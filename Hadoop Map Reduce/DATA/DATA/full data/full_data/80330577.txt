80330577	indiscretions of archie  by p g wodehouse   it wasnt archies fault really its true he went to america and fell in love with lucille the daughter of a millionaire hotel proprietor and if he did marry herwell what else was there to do  from his point of view the whole thing was a thoroughly good egg but mr brewster his fatherinlaw thought differently archie had neither money nor occupation which was distasteful in the eyes of the industrious mr brewster but the real bar was the fact that he had once adversely criticised one of his hotels  archie does his best to heal the breach but being something of an ass genus priceless he finds it almost beyond his powers to placate the maneating fish whom providence has given him as a fatherinlaw   p g wodehouse  author of the

say laddie said archie  sir replied the deskclerk alertly all the employes of the hotel cosmopolis were alert it was one of the things on which mr daniel brewster the proprietor insisted and as he was always wandering about the lobby of the hotel keeping a personal eye on affairs it was never safe to relax  i want to see the manager  is there anything i could do sir  archie looked at him doubtfully  well as a matter of fact my dear old deskclerk he said i want to kick up a fearful row and it hardly seems fair to lug you into it why you i mean to say the blighter whose head i want on a charger is the bally manager  at this point a massive greyhaired man who had been standing close by gazing on the lobby with an air of restrained severity as if daring it to start anything joined in the conversation  i am the manager he said  his eye was cold and hostile others it seemed to say might like archie moffam but not he daniel brewster was bristling for combat what he had overheard had shocked him to the core of his being the hotel cosmopolis was his own private personal property and the thing dearest to him in the world after his daughter lucille he prided himself on the fact that his hotel was not like other new york hotels which were run by impersonal companies and shareholders and boards of directors and consequently lacked the paternal touch which made the cosmopolis what it was at other hotels things went wrong and clients complained at the cosmopolis things never went wrong because he was on the spot to see that they didnt and as a result clients never complained yet here was this long thin stringbean of an englishman actually registering annoyance and dissatisfaction before his very eyes  what is your complaint he enquired frigidly  archie attached himself to the top button of mr brewsters coat and was immediately dislodged by an irritable jerk of the others substantial body  listen old thing i came over to this country to nose about in search of a job because there doesnt seem what you might call a general demand for my services in england directly i was demobbed the family started talking about the land of opportunity and shot me on to a liner the idea was that i might get hold of something in america  he got hold of mr brewsters coatbutton and was again shaken off  between ourselves ive never done anything much in england and i fancy the family were getting a bit fed at any rate they sent me over here  mr brewster disentangled himself for the third time  i would prefer to postpone the story of your life he said coldly and be informed what is your specific complaint against the hotel cosmopolis  of course yes the jolly old hotel im coming to that well it was like this a chappie on the boat told me that this was the best place to stop at in new york  he was quite right said mr brewster  was he by jove well all i can say then is that the other new york hotels must be pretty mouldy if this is the best of the lot i took a room here last night said archie quivering with selfpity and there was a beastly tap outside somewhere which went dripdripdrip all night and kept me awake  mr brewsters annoyance deepened he felt that a chink had been found in his armour not even the most paternal hotelproprietor can keep an eye on every tap in his establishment  dripdripdrip repeated archie firmly and i put my boots outside the door when i went to bed and this morning they hadnt been touched i give you my solemn word not touched  naturally said mr brewster my employes are honest  but i wanted them cleaned dash it  there is a shoeshining parlour in the basement at the cosmopolis shoes left outside bedroom doors are not cleaned  then i think the cosmopolis is a bally rotten hotel  mr brewsters compact frame quivered the unforgivable insult had been offered question the legitimacy of mr brewsters parentage knock mr brewster down and walk on his face with spiked shoes and you did not irremediably close all avenues to a peaceful settlement but make a remark like that about his hotel and war was definitely declared  in that case he said stiffening i must ask you to give up your room  im going to give it up i wouldnt stay in the bally place another minute  mr brewster walked away and archie charged round to the cashiers desk to get his bill it had been his intention in any case though for dramatic purposes he concealed it from his adversary to leave the hotel that morning one of the letters of introduction which he had brought over from england had resulted in an invitation from a mrs van tuyl to her houseparty at miami and he had decided to go there at once  well mused archie on his way to the station one things certain ill never set foot in that bally place again  but nothing in this world is certain     chapter ii a shock for mr brewster   mr daniel brewster sat in his luxurious suite at the cosmopolis smoking one of his admirable cigars and chatting with his old friend professor binstead a stranger who had only encountered mr brewster in the lobby of the hotel would have been surprised at the appearance of his sittingroom for it had none of the rugged simplicity which was the keynote of its owners personal appearance daniel brewster was a man with a hobby he was what parker his valet termed a connoozer his educated taste in art was one of the things which went to make the cosmopolis different from and superior to other new york hotels he had personally selected the tapestries in the diningroom and the various paintings throughout the building and in his private capacity he was an enthusiastic collector of things which professor binstead whose tastes lay in the same direction would have stolen without a twinge of conscience if he could have got the chance  the professor a small man of middle age who wore tortoiseshellrimmed spectacles flitted covetously about the room inspecting its treasures with a glistening eye in a corner parker a grave lean individual bent over the chafingdish in which he was preparing for his employer and his guest their simple lunch  brewster said professor binstead pausing at the mantelpiece  mr brewster looked up amiably he was in placid mood today two weeks and more had passed since the meeting with archie recorded in the previous chapter and he had been able to dismiss that disturbing affair from his mind since then everything had gone splendidly with daniel brewster for he had just accomplished his ambition of the moment by completing the negotiations for the purchase of a site further downtown on which he proposed to erect a new hotel he liked building hotels he had the cosmopolis his firstborn a summer hotel in the mountains purchased in the previous year and he was toying with the idea of running over to england and putting up another in london that however would have to wait meanwhile he would concentrate on this new one downtown it had kept him busy and worried arranging for securing the site but his troubles were over now  yes he said  professor binstead had picked up a small china figure of delicate workmanship it represented a warrior of prekhaki days advancing with a spear upon some adversary who judging from the contented expression on the warriors face was smaller than himself  where did you get this  that mawson my agent found it in a little shop on the east side  wheres the other there ought to be another these things go in pairs theyre valueless alone  mr brewsters brow clouded  i know that he said shortly mawsons looking for the other one everywhere if you happen across it i give you carte blanche to buy it for me  it must be somewhere  yes if you find it dont worry about the expense ill settle up no matter what it is  ill bear it in mind said professor binstead it may cost you a lot of money i suppose you know that  i told you i dont care what it costs  its nice to be a millionaire sighed professor binstead  luncheon is served sir said parker  he had stationed himself in a statutesque pose behind mr brewsters chair when there was a knock at the door he went to the door and returned with a telegram  telegram for you sir  mr brewster nodded carelessly the contents of the chafingdish had justified the advance advertising of their odour and he was too busy to be interrupted  put it down and you neednt wait parker  very good sir  the valet withdrew and mr brewster resumed his lunch  arent you going to open it asked professor binstead to whom a telegram was a telegram  it can wait i get them all day long i expect its from lucille saying what train shes making  she returns today  yes been at miami mr brewster having dwelt at adequate length on the contents of the chafingdish adjusted his glasses and took up the envelope i shall be gladgreat godfrey  he sat staring at the telegram his mouth open his friend eyed him solicitously  no bad news i hope  mr brewster gurgled in a strangled way  bad news bad here read it for yourself  professor binstead one of the three most inquisitive men in new york took the slip of paper with gratitude  returning new york today with darling archie he read lots of love from us both lucille he gaped at his host who is archie he enquired  who is archie echoed mr brewster helplessly who is thats just what i would like to know  darling archie murmured the professor musing over the telegram returning today with darling archie strange  mr brewster continued to stare before him when you send your only daughter on a visit to miami minus any entanglements and she mentions in a telegram that she has acquired a darling archie you are naturally startled he rose from the table with a bound it had occurred to him that by neglecting a careful study of his mail during the past week as was his bad habit when busy he had lost an opportunity of keeping abreast with current happenings he recollected now that a letter had arrived from lucille some time ago and that he had put it away unopened till he should have leisure to read it lucille was a dear girl he had felt but her letters when on a vacation seldom contained anything that couldnt wait a few days for a reading he sprang for his desk rummaged among his papers and found what he was seeking  it was a long letter and there was silence in the room for some moments while he mastered its contents then he turned to the professor breathing heavily  good heavens  yes said professor binstead eagerly yes  good lord  well  good gracious  what is it demanded the professor in an agony  mr brewster sat down again with a thud  shes married  married  married to an englishman  bless my soul  she says proceeded mr brewster referring to the letter again that they were both so much in love that they simply had to slip off and get married and she hopes i wont be cross cross gasped mr brewster gazing wildly at his friend  very disturbing  disturbing you bet its disturbing i dont know anything about the fellow never heard of him in my life she says he wanted a quiet wedding because he thought a fellow looked such a chump getting married and i must love him because hes all set to love me very much  extraordinary  mr brewster put the letter down  an englishman  i have met some very agreeable englishmen said professor binstead  i dont like englishmen growled mr brewster parkers an englishman  your valet  yes i believe he wears my shirts on the sly said mr brewster broodingly if i catch him what would you do about this binstead  do the professor considered the point judiciary well really brewster i do not see that there is anything you can do you must simply wait and meet the man perhaps he will turn out an admirable soninlaw  hm mr brewster declined to take an optimistic view but an englishman binstead he said with pathos why he went on memory suddenly stirring there was an englishman at this hotel only a week or two ago who went about knocking it in a way that would have amazed you said it was a rotten place my hotel  professor binstead clicked his tongue sympathetically he understood his friends warmth     chapter iii mr brewster delivers sentence   at about the same moment that professor binstead was clicking his tongue in mr brewsters sittingroom archie moffam sat contemplating his bride in a drawingroom on the express from miami he was thinking that this was too good to be true his brain had been in something of a whirl these last few days but this was one thought that never failed to emerge clearly from the welter  mrs archie moffam nee lucille brewster was small and slender she had a little animated face set in a cloud of dark hair she was so altogether perfect that archie had frequently found himself compelled to take the marriagecertificate out of his inside pocket and study it furtively to make himself realise that this miracle of good fortune had actually happened to him  honestly old beani mean dear old thingi mean darling said archie i cant believe it  what  what i mean is i cant understand why you should have married a blighter like me  lucilles eyes opened she squeezed his hand  why youre the most wonderful thing in the world precioussurely you know that  absolutely escaped my notice are you sure  of course im sure you wonderchild nobody could see you without loving you  archie heaved an ecstatic sigh then a thought crossed his mind it was a thought which frequently came to mar his bliss  i say i wonder if your father will think that  of course he will  we rather sprung this as it were on the old lad said archie dubiously what sort of a man is your father  fathers a darling too  rummy thing he should own that hotel said archie i had a frightful row with a blighter of a manager there just before i left for miami your father ought to sack that chap he was a blot on the landscape  it had been settled by lucille during the journey that archie should be broken gently to his fatherinlaw that is to say instead of bounding blithely into mr brewsters presence hand in hand the happy pair should separate for half an hour or so archie hanging around in the offing while lucille saw her father and told him the whole story or those chapters of it which she had omitted from her letter for want of space then having impressed mr brewster sufficiently with his luck in having acquired archie for a soninlaw she would lead him to where his bit of good fortune awaited him  the programme worked out admirably in its earlier stages when the two emerged from mr brewsters room to meet archie mr brewsters general idea was that fortune had smiled upon him in an almost unbelievable fashion and had presented him with a soninlaw who combined in almost equal parts the more admirable characteristics of apollo sir galahad and marcus aurelius true he had gathered in the course of the conversation that dear archie had no occupation and no private means but mr brewster felt that a greatsouled man like archie didnt need them you cant have everything and archie according to lucilles account was practically a hundred per cent man in soul looks manners amiability and breeding these are the things that count mr brewster proceeded to the lobby in a glow of optimism and geniality  consequently when he perceived archie he got a bit of a shock  hulloulloullo said archie advancing happily  archie darling this is father said lucille  good lord said archie  there was one of those silences mr brewster looked at archie archie gazed at mr brewster lucille perceiving without understanding why that the big introduction scene had stubbed its toe on some unlookedfor obstacle waited anxiously for enlightenment meanwhile archie continued to inspect mr brewster and mr brewster continued to drink in archie  after an awkward pause of about three and a quarter minutes mr brewster swallowed once or twice and finally spoke  lu  yes father  is this true  lucilles grey eyes clouded over with perplexity and apprehension  true  have you really inflicted thisthis on me for a soninlaw mr brewster swallowed a few more times archie the while watching with a frozen fascination the rapid shimmying of his new relatives adamsapple go away i want to have a few words alone with thisthiswassyourdamname he demanded in an overwrought manner addressing archie for the first time  i told you father its moom  moom  its spelt moffam but pronounced moom  to rhyme said archie helpfully with bluffinghame  lu said mr brewster run away i want to speak tototo  you called me this before said archie  you arent angry father dear said lucilla  oh no oh no im tickled to death  when his daughter had withdrawn mr brewster drew a long breath  now then he said  bit embarrassing all this what said archie chattily i mean to say having met before in less happy circs and what not rum coincidence and so forth how would it be to bury the jolly old hatchetstart a new lifeforgive and forgetlearn to love each otherand all that sort of rot im game if you are how do we go is it a bet  mr brewster remained entirely unsoftened by this manly appeal to his better feelings  what the devil do you mean by marrying my daughter  archie reflected  well it sort of happened dont you know you know how these things are young yourself once and all that i was most frightfully in love and lu seemed to think it wouldnt be a bad scheme and one thing led to another andwell there you are dont you know  and i suppose you think youve done pretty well for yourself  oh absolutely as far as im concerned everythings topping ive never felt so braced in my life  yes said mr brewster with bitterness i suppose from your viewpoint everything is topping you havent a cent to your name and youve managed to fool a rich mans daughter into marrying you i suppose you looked me up in bradstreet before committing yourself  this aspect of the matter had not struck archie until this moment  i say he observed with dismay i never looked at it like that before i can see that from your point of view this must look like a bit of a washout  how do you propose to support lucille anyway  archie ran a finger round the inside of his collar he felt embarrassed his fatherinlaw was opening up all kinds of new lines of thought  well there old bean he admitted frankly you rather have me he turned the matter over for a moment i had a sort of idea of as it were working if you know what i mean  working at what  now there again you stump me somewhat the general scheme was that i should kind of look round you know and nose about and buzz to and fro till something turned up that was broadly speaking the notion  and how did you suppose my daughter was to live while you were doing all this  well i think said archie i think we rather expected you to rally round a bit for the nonce  i see you expected to live on me  well you put it a bit crudely butas far as i had mapped anything outthat was what you might call the general scheme of procedure you dont think much of it what yes no  mr brewster exploded  no i do not think much of it good god you go out of my hotelmy hotelcalling it all the names you could think ofroasting it to beat the band  trifle hasty murmured archie apologetically spoke without thinking dashed tap had gone dripdripdrip all nightkept me awakehadnt had breakfastbygones be bygones  dont interrupt i say you go out of my hotel knocking it as no one has ever knocked it since it was built and you sneak straight off and marry my daughter without my knowledge  did think of wiring for blessing slipped the old bean somehow you know how one forgets things  and now you come back and calmly expect me to fling my arms round you and kiss you and support you for the rest of your life  only while im nosing about and buzzing to and fro  well i suppose ive got to support you there seems no way out of it ill tell you exactly what i propose to do you think my hotel is a pretty poor hotel eh well youll have plenty of opportunity of judging because youre coming to live here ill let you have a suite and ill let you have your meals but outside of thatnothing doing nothing doing do you understand what i mean  absolutely you mean napoo  you can sign bills for a reasonable amount in my restaurant and the hotel will look after your laundry but not a cent do you get out me and if you want your shoes shined you can pay for it yourself in the basement if you leave them outside your door ill instruct the floorwaiter to throw them down the airshaft do you understand good now is there anything more you want to ask  archie smiled a propitiatory smile  well as a matter of fact i was going to ask if you would stagger along and have a bite with us in the grillroom  i will not  ill sign the bill said archie ingratiatingly you dont think much of it oh righto     chapter iv work wanted   it seemed to archie as he surveyed his position at the end of the first month of his married life that all was for the best in the best of all possible worlds in their attitude towards america visiting englishmen almost invariably incline to extremes either detesting all that therein is or else becoming enthusiasts on the subject of the country its climate and its institutions archie belonged to the second class he liked america and got on splendidly with americans from the start he was a friendly soul a mixer and in new york that city of mixers he found himself at home the atmosphere of goodfellowship and the openhearted hospitality of everybody he met appealed to him there were moments when it seemed to him as though new york had simply been waiting for him to arrive before giving the word to let the revels commence  nothing of course in this world is perfect and rosy as were the glasses through which archie looked on his new surroundings he had to admit that there was one flaw one fly in the ointment one individual caterpillar in the salad mr daniel brewster his fatherinlaw remained consistently unfriendly indeed his manner towards his new relative became daily more and more a manner which would have caused gossip on the plantation if simon legree had exhibited it in his relations with uncle tom and this in spite of the fact that archie as early as the third morning of his stay had gone to him and in the most frank and manly way had withdrawn his criticism of the hotel cosmopolis giving it as his considered opinion that the hotel cosmopolis on closer inspection appeared to be a good egg one of the best and brightest and a bit of all right  a credit to you old thing said archie cordially  dont call me old thing growled mr brewster  eighto old companion said archie amiably  archie a true philosopher bore this hostility with fortitude but it worried lucille  i do wish father understood you better was her wistful comment when archie had related the conversation  well you know said archie im open for being understood any time he cares to take a stab at it  you must try and make him fond of you  but how i smile winsomely at him and what not but he doesnt respond  well we shall have to think of something i want him to realise what an angel you are you are an angel you know  no really  of course you are  its a rummy thing said archie pursuing a train of thought which was constantly with him the more i see of you the more i wonder how you can have a father likei mean to say what i mean to say is i wish i had known your mother she must have been frightfully attractive  what would really please him i know said lucille would be if you got some work to do he loves people who work  yes said archie doubtfully well you know i heard him interviewing that chappie behind the desk this morning who works like the dickens from early morn to dewy eve on the subject of a mistake in his figures and if he loved him he dissembled it all right of course i admit that so far i havent been one of the toilers but the dashed difficult thing is to know how to start im nosing round but the openings for a bright young man seem so scarce  well keep on trying i feel sure that if you could only find something to do it doesnt matter what father would be quite different  it was possibly the dazzling prospect of making mr brewster quite different that stimulated archie he was strongly of the opinion that any change in his fatherinlaw must inevitably be for the better a chance meeting with james b wheeler the artist at the penandink club seemed to open the way  to a visitor to new york who has the ability to make himself liked it almost appears as though the leading industry in that city was the issuing of twoweeks invitationcards to clubs archie since his arrival had been showered with these pleasant evidences of his popularity and he was now an honorary member of so many clubs of various kinds that he had not time to go to them all there were the fashionable clubs along fifth avenue to which his friend reggie van tuyl son of his florida hostess had introduced him there were the businessmens clubs of which he was made free by more solid citizens and best of all there were the lambs the players the friars the coffeehouse the penandinkand the other resorts of the artist the author the actor and the bohemian it was in these that archie spent most of his time and it was here that he made the acquaintance of j b wheeler the popular illustrator  to mr wheeler over a friendly lunch archie had been confiding some of his ambitions to qualify as the hero of one of the getonorgetoutyoungmansteplivelybooks  you want a job said mr wheeler  i want a job said archie  mr wheeler consumed eight fried potatoes in quick succession he was an able trencherman  i always looked on you as one of our leading lilies of the field he said why this anxiety to toil and spin  well my wife you know seems to think it might put me oneup with the jolly old dad if i did something  and youre not particular what you do so long as it has the outer aspect of work  anything in the world laddie anything in the world  then come and pose for a picture im doing said j b wheeler its for a magazine cover youre just the model i want and ill pay you at the usual rates is it a go  pose  youve only got to stand still and look like a chunk of wood you can do that surely  i can do that said archie  then come along down to my studio tomorrow  eighto said archie     chapter v strange experiences of an artists model   i say old thing  archie spoke plaintively already he was looking back ruefully to the time when he had supposed that an artists model had a soft job in the first five minutes muscles which he had not been aware that he possessed had started to ache like neglected teeth his respect for the toughness and durability of artists models was now solid how they acquired the stamina to go through this sort of thing all day and then bound off to bohemian revels at night was more than he could understand  dont wobble confound you snorted mr wheeler  yes but my dear old artist said archie what you dont seem to graspwhat you appear not to realiseis that im getting a crick in the back  you weakling you miserable invertebrate worm move an inch and ill murder you and come and dance on your grave every wednesday and saturday im just getting it  its in the spine that it seems to catch me principally  be a man you fainthearted stringbean urged j b wheeler you ought to be ashamed of yourself why a girl who was posing for me last week stood for a solid hour on one leg holding a tennis racket over her head and smiling brightly withal  the female of the species is more indiarubbery than the male argued archie  well ill be through in a few minutes dont weaken think how proud youll be when you see yourself on all the bookstalls  archie sighed and braced himself to the task once more he wished he had never taken on this binge in addition to his physical discomfort he was feeling a most awful chump the cover on which mr wheeler was engaged was for the august number of the magazine and it had been necessary for archie to drape his reluctant form in a twopiece bathing suit of a vivid lemon colour for he was supposed to be representing one of those jolly dogs belonging to the best families who dive off floats at exclusive seashore resorts j b wheeler a stickler for accuracy had wanted him to remove his socks and shoes but there archie had stood firm he was willing to make an ass of himself but not a silly ass  all right said j b wheeler laying down his brush that will do for today though speaking without prejudice and with no wish to be offensive if i had had a model who wasnt a weakkneed jellybackboned son of belial i could have got the darned thing finished without having to have another sitting  i wonder why you chappies call this sort of thing sitting said archie pensively as he conducted tentative experiments in osteopathy on his aching back i say old thing i could do with a restorative if you have one handy but of course you havent i suppose he added resignedly abstemious as a rule there were moments when archie found the eighteenth amendment somewhat trying  j b wheeler shook his head  youre a little previous he said but come round in another day or so and i may be able to do something for you he moved with a certain conspiratorlike caution to a corner of the room and lifting to one side a pile of canvases revealed a stout barrel which he regarded with a fatherly and benignant eye i dont mind telling you that in the fullness of time i believe this is going to spread a good deal of sweetness and light  oh ah said archie interested homebrew what  made with these hands i added a few more raisins yesterday to speed things up a bit there is much virtue in your raisin and talking of speeding things up for goodness sake try to be a bit more punctual tomorrow we lost an hour of good daylight today  i like that i was here on the absolute minute i had to hang about on the landing waiting for you  well well that doesnt matter said j b wheeler impatiently for the artist soul is always annoyed by petty details the point is that we were an hour late in getting to work mind youre here tomorrow at eleven sharp  it was therefore with a feeling of guilt and trepidation that archie mounted the stairs on the following morning for in spite of his good resolutions he was half an hour behind time he was relieved to find that his friend had also lagged by the wayside the door of the studio was ajar and he went in to discover the place occupied by a lady of mature years who was scrubbing the floor with a mop he went into the bedroom and donned his bathing suit when he emerged ten minutes later the charwoman had gone but j b wheeler was still absent rather glad of the respite he sat down to kill time by reading the morning paper whose sporting page alone he had managed to master at the breakfast table  there was not a great deal in the paper to interest him the usual bondrobbery had taken place on the previous day and the police were reported hot on the trail of the mastermind who was alleged to be at the back of these financial operations a messenger named henry babcock had been arrested and was expected to become confidential to one who like archie had never owned a bond the story made little appeal he turned with more interest to a cheery halfcolumn on the activities of a gentleman in minnesota who with what seemed to archie as he thought of mr daniel brewster a good deal of resource and public spirit had recently beaned his fatherinlaw with the family meataxe it was only after he had read this through twice in a spirit of gentle approval that it occurred to him that j b wheeler was uncommonly late at the tryst he looked at his watch and found that he had been in the studio threequarters of an hour  archie became restless longsuffering old bean though he was he considered this a bit thick he got up and went out on to the landing to see if there were any signs of the blighter there were none he began to understand now what had happened for some reason or other the bally artist was not coming to the studio at all that day probably he had called up the hotel and left a message to this effect and archie had just missed it another man might have waited to make certain that his message had reached its destination but not woollenheaded wheeler the most casual individual in new york  thoroughly aggrieved archie turned back to the studio to dress and go away  his progress was stayed by a solid forbidding slab of oak somehow or other since he had left the room the door had managed to get itself shut  oh dash it said archie  the mildness of the expletive was proof that the full horror of the situation had not immediately come home to him his mind in the first few moments was occupied with the problem of how the door had got that way he could not remember shutting it probably he had done it unconsciously as a child he had been taught by sedulous elders that the little gentleman always closed doors behind him and presumably his subconscious self was still under the influence and then suddenly he realised that this infernal officious ass of a subconscious self had deposited him right in the gumbo behind that closed door unattainable as youthful ambition lay his gents heathermixture with the green twill and here he was out in the world alone in a lemoncoloured bathing suit  in all crises of human affairs there are two broad courses open to a man he can stay where he is or he can go elsewhere archie leaning on the banisters examined these alternatives narrowly if he stayed where he was he would have to spend the night on this dashed landing if he legged it in this kit he would be gathered up by the constabulary before he had gone a hundred yards he was no pessimist but he was reluctantly forced to the conclusion that he was up against it  it was while he was musing with a certain tenseness on these things that the sound of footsteps came to him from below but almost in the first instant the hope that this might be j b wheeler the curse of the human race died away whoever was coming up the stairs was running and j b wheeler never ran upstairs he was not one of your lean haggard spirituallooking geniuses he made a large income with his brush and pencil and spent most of it in creature comforts this couldnt be j b wheeler  it was not it was a tall thin man whom he had never seen before he appeared to be in a considerable hurry he let himself into the studio on the floor below and vanished without even waiting to shut the door  he had come and disappeared in almost record time but brief though his passing had been it had been long enough to bring consolation to archie a sudden bright light had been vouchsafed to archie and he now saw an admirably ripe and fruity scheme for ending his troubles what could be simpler than to toddle down one flight of stairs and in an easy and debonair manner ask the chappies permission to use his telephone and what could be simpler once he was at the phone than to get in touch with somebody at the cosmopolis who would send down a few trousers and what not in a kit bag it was a priceless solution thought archie as he made his way downstairs not even embarrassing he meant to say this chappie living in a place like this wouldnt bat an eyelid at the spectacle of a fellow trickling about the place in a bathing suit they would have a good laugh about the whole thing  i say i hate to bother youdare say youre busy and all that sort of thingbut would you mind if i popped in for half a second and used your phone  that was the speech the extremely gentlemanly and wellphrased speech which archie had prepared to deliver the moment the man appeared the reason he did not deliver it was that the man did not appear he knocked but nothing stirred  i say  archie now perceived that the door was ajar and that on an envelope attached with a tack to one of the panels was the name elmer m moon he pushed the door a little farther open and tried again  oh mr moon mr moon he waited a moment oh mr moon mr moon are you there mr moon  he blushed hotly to his sensitive ear the words had sounded exactly like the opening line of the refrain of a vaudeville songhit he decided to waste no further speech on a man with such an unfortunate surname until he could see him face to face and get a chance of lowering his voice a bit absolutely absurd to stand outside a chappies door singing songhits in a lemoncoloured bathing suit he pushed the door open and walked in and his subconscious self always the gentleman closed it gently behind him  up said a low sinister harsh unfriendly and unpleasant voice  eh said archie revolving sharply on his axis  he found himself confronting the hurried gentleman who had run upstairs this sprinter had produced an automatic pistol and was pointing it in a truculent manner at his head archie stared at his host and his host stared at him  put your hands up he said  oh righto absolutely said archie but i mean to say  the other was drinking him in with considerable astonishment archies costume seemed to have made a powerful impression upon him  who the devil are you he enquired  me oh my names  never mind your name what are you doing here  well as a matter of fact i popped in to ask if i might use your phone you see  a certain relief seemed to temper the austerity of the others gaze as a visitor archie though surprising seemed to be better than he had expected  i dont know what to do with you he said meditatively  if youd just let me toddle to the phone  likely said the man he appeared to reach a decision here go into that room  he indicated with a jerk of his head the open door of what was apparently a bedroom at the farther end of the studio  i take it said archie chattily that all this may seem to you not a little rummy  get on  i was only saying  well i havent time to listen get a move on  the bedroom was in a state of untidiness which eclipsed anything which archie had ever witnessed the other appeared to be moving house bed furniture and floor were covered with articles of clothing a silk shirt wreathed itself about archies ankles as he stood gaping and as he moved farther into the room his path was paved with ties and collars  sit down said elmer m moon abruptly  righto thanks said archie i suppose you wouldnt like me to explain and what not what  no said mr moon i havent got your spare time put your hands behind that chair  archie did so and found them immediately secured by what felt like a silk tie his assiduous host then proceeded to fasten his ankles in a like manner this done he seemed to feel that he had done all that was required of him and he returned to the packing of a large suitcase which stood by the window  i say said archie  mr moon with the air of a man who has remembered something which he had overlooked shoved a sock in his guests mouth and resumed his packing he was what might be called an impressionist packer his aim appeared to be speed rather than neatness he bundled his belongings in closed the bag with some difficulty and stepping to the window opened it then he climbed out on to the fireescape dragged the suitcase after him and was gone  archie left alone addressed himself to the task of freeing his prisoned limbs the job proved much easier than he had expected mr moon that hustler had wrought for the moment not for all time a practical man he had been content to keep his visitor shackled merely for such a period as would permit him to make his escape unhindered in less than ten minutes archie after a good deal of snakelike writhing was pleased to discover that the thingummy attached to his wrists had loosened sufficiently to enable him to use his hands he untied himself and got up  he now began to tell himself that out of evil cometh good his encounter with the elusive mr moon had not been an agreeable one but it had had this solid advantage that it had left him right in the middle of a great many clothes and mr moon whatever his moral defects had the one excellent quality of taking about the same size as himself archie casting a covetous eye upon a tweed suit which lay on the bed was on the point of climbing into the trousers when on the outer door of the studio there sounded a forceful knocking  open up here     chapter vi the bomb   archie bounded silently out into the other room and stood listening tensely he was not a naturally querulous man but he did feel at this point that fate was picking on him with a somewhat undue severity  in th name av th law  there are times when the best of us lose our heads at this juncture archie should undoubtedly have gone to the door opened it explained his presence in a few wellchosen words and generally have passed the whole thing off with ready tact but the thought of confronting a posse of police in his present costume caused him to look earnestly about him for a hidingplace  up against the farther wall was a settee with a high arching back which might have been put there for that special purpose he inserted himself behind this just as a splintering crash announced that the law having gone through the formality of knocking with its knuckles was now getting busy with an axe a moment later the door had given way and the room was full of trampling feet archie wedged himself against the wall with the quiet concentration of a clam nestling in its shell and hoped for the best  it seemed to him that his immediate future depended for better or for worse entirely on the native intelligence of the force if they were the bright alert men he hoped they were they would see all that junk in the bedroom and deducing from it that their quarry had stood not upon the order of his going but had hopped it would not waste time in searching a presumably empty apartment if on the other hand they were the obtuse flatfooted persons who occasionally find their way into the ranks of even the most enlightened constabularies they would undoubtedly shift the settee and drag him into a publicity from which his modest soul shrank he was enchanted therefore a few moments later to hear a gruff voice state that th mutt had beaten it down th fireescape his opinion of the detective abilities of the new york police force rose with a bound  there followed a brief council of war which as it took place in the bedroom was inaudible to archie except as a distant growling noise he could distinguish no words but as it was succeeded by a general trampling of large boots in the direction of the door and then by silence he gathered that the pack having drawn the studio and found it empty had decided to return to other and more profitable duties he gave them a reasonable interval for removing themselves and then poked his head cautiously over the settee  all was peace the place was empty no sound disturbed the stillness  archie emerged for the first time in this morning of disturbing occurrences he began to feel that god was in his heaven and all right with the world at last things were beginning to brighten up a bit and life might be said to have taken on some of the aspects of a good egg he stretched himself for it is cramping work lying under settees and proceeding to the bedroom picked up the tweed trousers again  clothes had a fascination for archie another man in similar circumstances might have hurried over his toilet but archie faced by a difficult choice of ties rather strung the thing out he selected a specimen which did great credit to the taste of mr moon evidently one of our snappiest dressers found that it did not harmonise with the deeper meaning of the tweed suit removed it chose another and was adjusting the bow and admiring the effect when his attention was diverted by a slight sound which was half a cough and half a sniff and turning found himself gazing into the clear blue eyes of a large man in uniform who had stepped into the room from the fireescape he was swinging a substantial club in a negligent sort of way and he looked at archie with a total absence of bonhomie  ah he observed  oh there you are said archie subsiding weakly against the chest of drawers he gulped of course i can see youre thinking all this pretty tolerably weird and all that he proceeded in a propitiatory voice  the policeman attempted no analysis of his emotions he opened a mouth which a moment before had looked incapable of being opened except with the assistance of powerful machinery and shouted a single word  cassidy  a distant voice gave tongue in answer it was like alligators roaring to their mates across lonely swamps  there was a rumble of footsteps in the region of the stairs and presently there entered an even larger guardian of the law than the first exhibit he too swung a massive club and like his colleague he gazed frostily at archie  god save ireland he remarked  the words appeared to be more in the nature of an expletive than a practical comment on the situation having uttered them he draped himself in the doorway like a colossus and chewed gum  where ja get him he enquired after a pause  found him in here attimpting to disguise himself  i told cap he was hiding somewheres but he would have it that hed beat it down th escape said the gumchewer with the sombre triumph of the underling whose sound advice has been overruled by those above him he shifted his wholesome or as some say unwholesome morsel to the other side of his mouth and for the first time addressed archie directly yere pinched he observed  archie started violently the bleak directness of the speech roused him with a jerk from the dreamlike state into which he had fallen he had not anticipated this he had assumed that there would be a period of tedious explanations to be gone through before he was at liberty to depart to the cosy little lunch for which his interior had been sighing wistfully this long time past but that he should be arrested had been outside his calculations of course he could put everything right eventually he could call witnesses to his character and the purity of his intentions but in the meantime the whole dashed business would be in all the papers embellished with all those unpleasant flippancies to which your newspaper reporter is so prone to stoop when he sees half a chance he would feel a frightful chump chappies would rot him about it to the most fearful extent old brewsters name would come into it and he could not disguise it from himself that his fatherinlaw who liked his name in the papers as little as possible would be sorer than a sunburned neck  no i say you know i mean i mean to say  pinched repeated the rather larger policeman  and annything ye say added his slightly smaller colleague will be used agenst ya t the trial  and if ya try tescape said the first speaker twiddling his club yall getja block knocked off  and having sketched out this admirably clear and neatlyconstructed scenario the two relapsed into silence officer cassidy restored his gum to circulation officer donahue frowned sternly at his boots  but i say said archie its all a mistake you know absolutely a frightful error my dear old constables im not the lad youre after at all the chappie you want is a different sort of fellow altogether another blighter entirely  new york policemen never laugh when on duty there is probably something in the regulations against it but officer donahue permitted the left corner of his mouth to twitch slightly and a momentary muscular spasm disturbed the calm of officer cassidys granite features as a passing breeze ruffles the surface of some bottomless lake  thats what they all say observed officer donahue  its no use tryin that line of talk said officer cassidy babcocks squealed  sure squealed s morning said officer donahue  archies memory stirred vaguely  babcock he said do you know that name seems familiar to me somehow im almost sure ive read it in the paper or something  ah cut it out said officer cassidy disgustedly the two constables exchanged a glance of austere disapproval this hypocrisy pained them read it in th paper or something  by jove i remember now hes the chappie who was arrested in that bond business for goodness sake my dear merry old constables said archie astounded you surely arent labouring under the impression that im the mastermind they were talking about in the paper why what an absolutely priceless notion i mean to say i ask you what frankly laddies do i look like a mastermind  officer cassidy heaved a deep sigh which rumbled up from his interior like the first muttering of a cyclone  if id known he said regretfully that this guy was going to turn out a ruddy englishman id have taken a slap at him with m stick and chanced it  officer donahue considered the point well taken  ah he said understandingly he regarded archie with an unfriendly eye i know th sort well trampling on th face av th poor  ya cn trample on the poor mans face said officer cassidy severely but dont be surprised if one day he bites you in the leg  but my dear old sir protested archie ive never trampled  one of these days said officer donahue moodily the shannon will flow in blood to the sea  absolutely but  officer cassidy uttered a glad cry  why couldnt we hit him a lick he suggested brightly an tell th cap he resisted us in th exercise of our jooty  an instant gleam of approval and enthusiasm came into officer donahues eyes officer donahue was not a man who got these luminous inspirations himself but that did not prevent him appreciating them in others and bestowing commendation in the right quarter there was nothing petty or grudging about officer donahue  yere the lad with the head tim he exclaimed admiringly  it just sorta came to me said mr cassidy modestly  its a great idea timmy  just happened to think of it said mr cassidy with a coy gesture of selfeffacement  archie had listened to the dialogue with growing uneasiness not for the first time since he had made their acquaintance he became vividly aware of the exceptional physical gifts of these two men the new york police force demands from those who would join its ranks an extremely high standard of stature and sinew but it was obvious that jolly old donahue and cassidy must have passed in first shot without any difficulty whatever  i say you know he observed apprehensively  and then a sharp and commanding voice spoke from the outer room  donahue cassidy what the devil does this mean  archie had a momentary impression that an angel had fluttered down to his rescue if this was the case the angel had assumed an effective disguisethat of a police captain the new arrival was a far smaller man than his subordinatesso much smaller that it did archie good to look at him for a long time he had been wishing that it were possible to rest his eyes with the spectacle of something of a slightly less outsize nature than his two companions  why have you left your posts  the effect of the interruption on the messrs cassidy and donahue was pleasingly instantaneous they seemed to shrink to almost normal proportions and their manner took on an attractive deference  officer donahue saluted  if ye plaze sorr  officer cassidy also saluted simultaneously  twas like this sorr  the captain froze officer cassidy with a glance and leaving him congealed turned to officer donahue  oi wuz standing on th fireescape sorr said officer donahue in a tone of obsequious respect which not only delighted but astounded archie who hadnt known he could talk like that accordin to instructions when i heard a suspicious noise i crope in sorr and found this duckfound the accused sorrin front of the mirror examinin himself i then called to officer cassidy for assistance we pinchedarrested um sorr  the captain looked at archie it seemed to archie that he looked at him coldly and with contempt  who is he  the mastermind sorr  the what  the accused sorr the man thats wanted  you may want him i dont said the captain archie though relieved thought he might have put it more nicely this isnt moon its not a bit like him  absolutely not agreed archie cordially its all a mistake old companion as i was trying to  cut it out  ob righto  youve seen the photographs at the station do you mean to tell me you see any resemblance  if ye plaze sorr said officer cassidy coming to life  well  we thought hed bin disguising himself the way he wouldnt be recognised  youre a fool said the captain  yes sorr said officer cassidy meekly  so are you donahue  yes sorr  archies respect for this chappie was going up all the time he seemed to be able to take years off the lives of these massive blighters with a word it was like the stories you read about liontamers archie did not despair of seeing officer donahue and his old college chum cassidy eventually jumping through hoops  who are you demanded the captain turning to archie  well my name is  what are you doing here  well its rather a longish story you know dont want to bore you and all that  im here to listen you cant bore me  dashed nice of you to put it like that said archie gratefully i mean to say makes it easier and so forth what i mean is you know how rotten you feel telling the deuce of a long yarn and wondering if the party of the second part is wishing you would turn off the tap and go home i mean  if said the captain youre reciting something stop if youre trying to tell me what youre doing here make it shorter and easier  archie saw his point of course time was moneythe modern spirit of hustleall that sort of thing  well it was this bathing suit you know he said  what bathing suit  mine dont you know a lemoncoloured contrivance rather bright and so forth but in its proper place not altogether a bad egg well the whole thing started you know with my standing on a bally pedestal sort of arrangement in a diving attitudefor the cover you know i dont know if you have ever done anything of that kind yourself but it gives you a most fearful crick in the spine however thats rather beside the point i supposedont know why i mentioned it well this morning he was dashed late so i went out  what the devil are you talking about  archie looked at him surprised  arent i making it clear  no  well you understand about the bathing suit dont you the jolly old bathing suit youve grasped that what  no  oh i say said archie thats rather a nuisance i mean to say the bathing suits what you might call the good old pivot of the whole dashed affair you see well you understand about the cover what youre pretty clear on the subject of the cover  what cover  why for the magazine  what magazine  now there you rather have me one of these bright little periodicals you know that you see popping to and fro on the bookstalls  i dont know what youre talking about said the captain he looked at archie with an expression of distrust and hostility and ill tell you straight out i dont like the looks of you i believe youre a pal of his  no longer said archie firmly i mean to say a chappie who makes you stand on a bally pedestal sort of arrangement and get a crick in the spine and then doesnt turn up and leaves you biffing all over the countryside in a bathing suit  the reintroduction of the bathing suit motive seemed to have the worst effect on the captain he flushed darkly  are you trying to josh me ive a mind to soak you  if ye plaze sorr cried officer donahue and officer cassidy in chorus in the course of their professional career they did not often hear their superior make many suggestions with which they saw eye to eye but he had certainly in their opinion spoken a mouthful now  no honestly my dear old thing nothing was farther from my thoughts  he would have spoken further but at this moment the world came to an end at least that was how it sounded somewhere in the immediate neighbourhood something went off with a vast explosion shattering the glass in the window peeling the plaster from the ceiling and sending him staggering into the inhospitable arms of officer donahue  the three guardians of the law stared at one another  if ye plaze sorr said officer cassidy saluting  well  may i spake sorr  well  somethings exploded sorr  the information kindly meant though it was seemed to annoy the captain  what the devil did you think i thought had happened he demanded with not a little irritation it was a bomb  archie could have corrected this diagnosis for already a faint but appealing aroma of an alcoholic nature was creeping into the room through a hole in the ceiling and there had risen before his eyes the picture of j b wheeler affectionately regarding that barrel of his on the previous morning in the studio upstairs j b wheeler had wanted quick results and he had got them archie had long since ceased to regard j b wheeler as anything but a tumour on the social system but he was bound to admit that he had certainly done him a good turn now already these honest men diverted by the superior attraction of this latest happening appeared to have forgotten his existence  sorr said officer donahue  well  it came from upstairs sorr  of course it came from upstairs cassidy  sorr  get down into the street call up the reserves and stand at the front entrance to keep the crowd back well have the whole city here in five minutes  right sorr  dont let anyone in  no sorr  well see that you dont come along donahue now look slippy  on the spot sorr said officer donahue  a moment later archie had the studio to himself two minutes later he was picking his way cautiously down the fireescape after the manner of the recent mr moon archie had not seen much of mr moon but he had seen enough to know that in certain crises his methods were sound and should be followed elmer moon was not a good man his ethics were poor and his moral code shaky but in the matter of legging it away from a situation of peril and discomfort he had no superior     chapter vii mr roscoe sherriff has an idea   archie inserted a fresh cigarette in his long holder and began to smoke a little moodily it was about a week after his disturbing adventures in j b wheelers studio and life had ceased for the moment to be a thing of careless enjoyment mr wheeler mourning over his lost homebrew and refusing like niobe to be comforted has suspended the sittings for the magazine cover thus robbing archie of his lifework mr brewster had not been in genial mood of late and in addition to all this lucille was away on a visit to a schoolfriend and when lucille went away she took with her the sunshine archie was not surprised at her being popular and in demand among her friends but that did not help him to become reconciled to her absence  he gazed rather wistfully across the table at his friend roscoe sherriff the pressagent another of his penandink club acquaintances they had just finished lunch and during the meal sherriff who like most men of action was fond of hearing the sound of his own voice and liked exercising it on the subject of himself had been telling archie a few anecdotes about his professional past from these the latter had conceived a picture of roscoe sherriffs life as a prismatic thing of energy and adventure and wellpaid withaljust the sort of life in fact which he would have enjoyed leading himself he wished that he too like the pressagent could go about the place slipping things over and putting things across daniel brewster he felt would have beamed upon a soninlaw like roscoe sherriff  the more i see of america sighed archie the more it amazes me all you birds seem to have been doing things from the cradle upwards i wish i could do things  well why dont you  archie flicked the ash from his cigarette into the fingerbowl  oh i dont know you know he said somehow none of our family ever have i dont know why it is but whenever a moffam starts out to do things he infallibly makes a bloomer there was a moffam in the middle ages who had a sudden spasm of energy and set out to make a pilgrimage to jerusalem dressed as a wandering friar rum ideas they had in those days  did he get there  absolutely not just as he was leaving the front door his favourite hound mistook him for a trampor a varlet or a scurvy knave or whatever they used to call them at that timeand bit him in the fleshy part of the leg  well at least he started  enough to make a chappie start what  roscoe sherriff sipped his coffee thoughtfully he was an apostle of energy and it seemed to him that he could make a convert of archie and incidentally do himself a bit of good for several days he had been looking for someone like archie to help him in a small matter which he had in mind  if youre really keen on doing things he said theres something you can do for me right away  archie beamed action was what his soul demanded  anything dear boy anything state your case  would you have any objection to putting up a snake for me  putting up a snake  just for a day or two  but how do you mean old soul put him up where  wherever you live where do you live the cosmopolis isnt it of course you married old brewsters daughter i remember reading about it  but i say laddie i dont want to spoil your day and disappoint you and so forth but my jolly old fatherinlaw would never let me keep a snake why its as much as i can do to make him let me stop on in the place  he wouldnt know  theres not much that goes on in the hotel that he doesnt know said archie doubtfully  he mustnt know the whole point of the thing is that it must be a dead secret  archie flicked some more ash into the fingerbowl  i dont seem absolutely to have grasped the affair in all its aspects if you know what i mean he said i mean to sayin the first placewhy would it brighten your young existence if i entertained this snake of yours  its not mine it belongs to mme brudowska youve heard of her of course  oh yes shes some sort of performing snake female in vaudeville or something isnt she or something of that species or order  youre near it but not quite right she is the leading exponent of highbrow tragedy on any stage in the civilized world  absolutely i remember now my wife lugged me to see her perform one night it all comes back to me she had me wedged in an orchestrastall before i knew what i was up against and then it was too late i remember reading in some journal or other that she had a pet snake given her by some russian prince or other what  that said sherriff was the impression i intended to convey when i sent the story to the papers im her pressagent as a matter of fact i bought peterits names petermyself down on the east side i always believe in animals for pressagent stunts ive nearly always had good results but with her nibs im handicapped shackled so to speak you might almost say my genius is stifled or strangled if you prefer it  anything you say agreed archie courteously but how why is your whatdyoucallit whatsitsnamed  she keeps me on a leash she wont let me do anything with a kick in it if ive suggested one ripsnorting stunt ive suggested twenty and every time she turns them down on the ground that that sort of thing is beneath the dignity of an artist in her position it doesnt give a fellow a chance so now ive made up my mind to do her good by stealth im going to steal her snake  steal it pinch it as it were  yes big story for the papers you see shes grown very much attached to peter hes her mascot i believe shes practically kidded herself into believing that russian prince story if i can sneak it away and keep it away for a day or two shell do the rest shell make such a fuss that the papers will be full of it  i see  wow any ordinary woman would work in with me but not her nibs she would call it cheap and degrading and a lot of other things its got to be a genuine steal and if im caught at it i lose my job so thats where you come in  but where am i to keep the jolly old reptile  oh anywhere punch a few holes in a hatbox and make it up a shakedown inside itll be company for you  something in that my wifes away just now and its a bit lonely in the evenings  youll never be lonely with peter around hes a great scout always merry and bright  he doesnt bite i suppose or sting or whatnot  he may whatnot occasionally it depends on the weather but outside of that hes as harmless as a canary  dashed dangerous things canaries said archie thoughtfully they peck at you  dont weaken pleaded the pressagent  oh all right ill take him by the way touching the matter of browsing and sluicing what do i feed him on  oh anything breadandmilk or fruit or softboiled egg or dogbiscuit or antseggs you knowanything you have yourself well im much obliged for your hospitality ill do the same for you another time now i must be getting along to see to the practical end of the thing by the way her nibs lives at the cosmopolis too very convenient well so long see you later  archie left alone began for the first time to have serious doubts he had allowed himself to be swayed by mr sherriffs magnetic personality but now that the other had removed himself he began to wonder if he had been entirely wise to lend his sympathy and cooperation to the scheme he had never had intimate dealings with a snake before but he had kept silkworms as a child and there had been the deuce of a lot of fuss and unpleasantness over them getting into the salad and whatnot something seemed to tell him that he was asking for trouble with a loud voice but he had given his word and he supposed he would have to go through with it  he lit another cigarette and wandered out into fifth avenue his usually smooth brow was ruffled with care despite the eulogies which sherriff had uttered concerning peter he found his doubts increasing peter might as the pressagent had stated be a great scout but was his little garden of eden on the fifth floor of the cosmopolis hotel likely to be improved by the advent of even the most amiable and winsome of serpents however  moffam my dear fellow  the voice speaking suddenly in his ear from behind roused archie from his reflections indeed it roused him so effectually that he jumped a clear inch off the ground and bit his tongue revolving on his axis he found himself confronting a middleaged man with a face like a horse the man was dressed in something of an oldworld style his clothes had an english cut he had a drooping grey moustache he also wore a grey bowler hat flattened at the crownbut who are we to judge him  archie moffam i have been trying to find you all the morning  archie had placed him now he had not seen general mannister for several yearsnot indeed since the days when he used to meet him at the home of young lord seacliff his nephew archie had been at eton and oxford with seacliff and had often visited him in the long vacation  halloa general what ho what ho what on earth are you doing over here  lets get out of this crush my boy general mannister steered archie into a sidestreet thats better he cleared his throat once or twice as if embarrassed ive brought seacliff over he said finally  dear old squiffy here oh i say great work  general mannister did not seem to share his enthusiasm he looked like a horse with a secret sorrow he coughed three times like a horse who in addition to a secret sorrow had contracted asthma  you will find seacliff changed he said let me see how long is it since you and he met  archie reflected  i was demobbed just about a year ago i saw him in paris about a year before that the old egg got a bit of shrapnel in his foot or something didnt he anyhow i remember he was sent home  his foot is perfectly well again now but unfortunately the enforced inaction led to disastrous results you recollect no doubt that seacliff always had aa tendencyaa weaknessit was a family failing  mopping it up do you mean shifting it looking on the jolly old stuff when it was red and what not what  exactly  archie nodded  dear old squiffy was always rathera lad for the wassailbowl when i met him in paris i remember he was quite tolerably blotto  precisely and the failing has i regret to say grown on him since he returned from the war my poor sister was extremely worried in fact to cut a long story short i induced him to accompany me to america i am attached to the british legation in washington now you know  oh really  i wished seacliff to come with me to washington but he insists on remaining in new york he stated specifically that the thought of living in washington gave him thewhat was the expression he used  the pip  the pip precisely  but what was the idea of bringing him to america  this admirable prohibition enactment has rendered americato my mindthe ideal place for a young man of his views the general looked at his watch it is most fortunate that i happened to run into you my dear fellow my train for washington leaves in another hour and i have packing to do i want to leave poor seacliff in your charge while i am gone  oh i say what  you can look after him i am credibly informed that even now there are places in new york where a determined young man may obtain theerstuff and i should be infinitely obligedand my poor sister would be infinitely gratefulif you would keep an eye on him he hailed a taxicab i am sending seacliff round to the cosmopolis tonight i am sure you will do everything you can goodbye my boy goodbye  archie continued his walk this he felt was beginning to be a bit thick he smiled a bitter mirthless smile as he recalled the fact that less than half an hour had elapsed since he had expressed a regret that he did not belong to the ranks of those who do things fate since then had certainly supplied him with jobs with a lavish hand by bedtime he would be an active accomplice to a theft valet and companion to a snake he had never met andas far as could gather the scope of his dutiesa combination of nursemaid and private detective to dear old squiffy  it was past four oclock when he returned to the cosmopolis roscoe sherriff was pacing the lobby of the hotel nervously carrying a small handbag  here you are at last good heavens man ive been waiting two hours  sorry old bean i was musing a bit and lost track of the time  the pressagent looked cautiously round there was nobody within earshot  here he is he said  who  peter  where said archie staring blankly  in this bag did you expect to find him strolling arminarm with me round the lobby here you are take him  he was gone and archie holding the bag made his way to the lift the bag squirmed gently in his grip  the only other occupant of the lift was a strikinglooking woman of foreign appearance dressed in a way that made archie feel that she must be somebody or she couldnt look like that her face too seemed vaguely familiar she entered the lift at the second floor where the tearoom is and she had the contented expression of one who had tead to her satisfaction she got off at the same floor as archie and walked swiftly in a lithe pantherist way round the bend in the corridor archie followed more slowly when he reached the door of his room the passage was empty he inserted the key in his door turned it pushed the door open and pocketed the key he was about to enter when the bag again squirmed gently in his grip  from the days of pandora through the epoch of bluebeards wife down to the present time one of the chief failings of humanity has been the disposition to open things that were better closed it would have been simple for archie to have taken another step and put a door between himself and the world but there came to him the irresistible desire to peep into the bag nownot three seconds later but now all the way up in the lift he had been battling with the temptation and now he succumbed  the bag was one of those simple bags with a thingummy which you press archie pressed it and as it opened out popped the head of peter his eyes met archies over his head there seemed to be an invisible mark of interrogation his gaze was curious but kindly he appeared to be saying to himself have i found a friend  serpents or snakes says the encyclopaedia are reptiles of the saurian class ophidia characterised by an elongated cylindrical limbless scaly form and distinguished from lizards by the fact that the halves rami of the lower jaw are not solidly united at the chin but movably connected by an elastic ligament the vertebra are very numerous gastrocentrous and procoelous and of course when they put it like that you can see at once that a man might spend hours with combined entertainment and profit just looking at a snake  archie would no doubt have done this but long before he had time really to inspect the halves rami of his new friends lower jaw and to admire its elastic fittings and long before the gastrocentrous and procoelous character of the others vertebrae had made any real impression on him a piercing scream almost at his elbowstartled him out of his scientific reverie a door opposite had opened and the woman of the elevator was standing staring at him with an expression of horror and fury that went through him like a knife it was the expression which more than anything else had made mme brudowska what she was professionally combined with a deep voice and a sinuous walk it enabled her to draw down a matter of a thousand dollars per week  indeed though the fact gave him little pleasure archie as a matter of fact was at this moment getting aboutincluding wartaxtwo dollars and seventyfive cents worth of the great emotional star for nothing for having treated him gratis to the look of horror and fury she now moved towards him with the sinuous walk and spoke in the tone which she seldom permitted herself to use before the curtain of act two unless there was a whale of a situation that called for it in act one  thief  it was the way she said it  archie staggered backwards as though he had been hit between the eyes fell through the open door of his room kicked it to with a flying foot and collapsed on the bed peter the snake who had fallen on the floor with a squashy sound looked surprised and pained for a moment then being a philosopher at heart cheered up and began hunting for flies under the bureau     chapter viii a disturbed night for dear old squiffy   peril sharpens the intellect archies mind as a rule worked in rather a languid and restful sort of way but now it got going with a rush and a whir he glared round the room he had never seen a room so devoid of satisfactory cover and then there came to him a scheme a ruse it offered a chance of escape it was indeed a bit of all right  peter the snake loafing contentedly about the carpet found himself seized by what the encyclopaedia calls the distensible gullet and looked up reproachfully the next moment he was in his bag again and archie bounding silently into the bathroom was tearing the cord off his dressinggown  there came a banging at the door a voice spoke sternly a masculine voice this time  say open this door  archie rapidly attached the dressinggown cord to the handle of the bag leaped to the window opened it tied the cord to a projecting piece of iron on the sill lowered peter and the bag into the depths and closed the window again the whole affair took but a few seconds generals have received the thanks of their nations for displaying less resource on the field of battle  he opened thedoor outside stood the bereaved woman and beside her a bulletheaded gentleman with a bowler hat on the back of his head in whom archie recognised the hotel detective  the hotel detective also recognised archie and the stern cast of his features relaxed he even smiled a rusty but propitiatory smile he imaginederroneouslythat archie being the soninlaw of the owner of the hotel had a pull with that gentleman and he resolved to proceed warily lest he jeopardise his job  why mr moffam he said apologetically i didnt know it was you i was disturbing  always glad to have a chat said archie cordially what seems to be the trouble  my snake cried the queen of tragedy where is my snake  archie looked at the detective the detective looked at archie  this lady said the detective with a dry little cough thinks her snake is in your room mr moffam  snake  snakes what the lady said  my snake my peter mme brudowskas voice shook with emotion he is herehere in this room  archie shook his head  no snakes here absolutely not i remember noticing when i came in  the snake is herehere in this room this man had it in a bag i saw him he is a thief  easy maam protested the detective go easy this gentleman is the bosss soninlaw  i care not who he is he has my snake here here in this room  mr moffam wouldnt go round stealing snakes  rather not said archie never stole a snake in my life none of the moffams have ever gone about stealing snakes regular family tradition though i once had an uncle who kept goldfish  here he is here my peter  archie looked at the detective the detective looked at archie we must humour her their glances said  of course said archie if youd like to search the room what what i mean to say is this is liberty hall everybody welcome bring the kiddies  i will search the room said mme brudowska  the detective glanced apologetically at archie  dont blame me for this mr moffam he urged  rather not only too glad youve dropped in  he took up an easy attitude against the window and watched the empress of the emotional drama explore presently she desisted baffled for an instant she paused as though about to speak then swept from the room a moment later a door banged across the passage  how do they get that way queried the detective well gbye mr moffam sorry to have butted in  the door closed archie waited a few moments then went to the window and hauled in the slack presently the bag appeared over the edge of the windowsill  good god said archie  in the rush and swirl of recent events he must have omitted to see that the clasp that fastened the bag was properly closed for the bag as it jumped on to the windowsill gaped at him like a yawning face and inside it there was nothing  archie leaned as far out of the window as he could manage without committing suicide far below him the traffic took its usual course and the pedestrians moved to and fro upon the pavements there was no crowding no excitement yet only a few moments before a long green snake with three hundred ribs a distensible gullet and gastrocentrous vertebras must have descended on that street like the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath and nobody seemed even interested not for the first time since he had arrived in america archie marvelled at the cynical detachment of the new yorker who permits himself to be surprised at nothing  he shut the window and moved away with a heavy heart he had not had the pleasure of an extended acquaintanceship with peter but he had seen enough of him to realise his sterling qualities somewhere beneath peters three hundred ribs there had lain a heart of gold and archie mourned for his loss  archie had a dinner and theatre engagement that night and it was late when he returned to the hotel he found his fatherinlaw prowling restlessly about the lobby there seemed to be something on mr brewsters mind he came up to archie with a brooding frown on his square face  whos this man seacliff he demanded without preamble i hear hes a friend of yours  oh youve met him what said archie had a nice little chat together yes talked of this and that no  we have not said a word to each other  really oh well dear old squiffy is one of those strong silent fellers you know you mustnt mind if hes a bit dumb he never says much but its whispered round the clubs that he thinks a lot it was rumoured in the spring of nineteenthirteen that squiffy was on the point of making a bright remark but it never came to anything  mr brewster struggled with his feelings  who is he you seem to know him  oh yes great pal of mine squiffy we went through eton oxford and the bankruptcy court together and heres a rummy coincidence when they examined me i had no assets and when they examined squiffy he had no assets rather extraordinary what  mr brewster seemed to be in no mood for discussing coincidences  i might have known he was a friend of yours he said bitterly well if you want to see him youll have to do it outside my hotel  why i thought he was stopping here  he istonight tomorrow he can look for some other hotel to break up  great scot has dear old squiffy been breaking the place up  mr brewster snorted  i am informed that this precious friend of yours entered my grillroom at eight oclock he must have been completely intoxicated though the head waiter tells me he noticed nothing at the time  archie nodded approvingly  dear old squiffy was always like that its a gift however woozled he might be it was impossible to detect it with the naked eye ive seen the dear old chap many a time whiffled to the eyebrows and looking as sober as a bishop soberer when did it begin to dawn on the lads in the grillroom that the old egg had been pushing the boat out  the head waiter said mr brewster with cold fury tells me that he got a hint of the mans condition when he suddenly got up from his table and went the round of the room pulling off all the tablecloths and breaking everything that was on them he then threw a number of rolls at the diners and left he seems to have gone straight to bed  dashed sensible of him what sound practical chap squiffy but where on earth did he get theermaterials  from his room i made enquiries he has six large cases in his room  squiffy always was a chap of infinite resource well im dashed sorry this should have happened dont you know  if it hadnt been for you the man would never have come here mr brewster brooded coldly i dont know why it is but ever since you came to this hotel ive had nothing but trouble  dashed sorry said archie sympathetically  grrh said mr brewster  archie made his way meditatively to the lift the injustice of his fatherinlaws attitude pained him it was absolutely rotten and all that to be blamed for everything that went wrong in the hotel cosmopolis  while this conversation was in progress lord seacliff was enjoying a refreshing sleep in his room on the fourth floor two hours passed the noise of the traffic in the street below faded away only the rattle of an occasional belated cab broke the silence in the hotel all was still mr brewster had gone to bed archie in his room smoked meditatively peace may have been said to reign  at halfpast two lord seacliff awoke his hours of slumber were always irregular he sat up in bed and switched the light on he was a shockheaded young man with a red face and a hot brown eye he yawned and stretched himself his head was aching a little the room seemed to him a trifle close he got out of bed and threw open the window then returning to bed he picked up a book and began to read he was conscious of feeling a little jumpy and reading generally sent him to sleep  much has been written on the subject of bedbooks the general consensus of opinion is that a gentle slowmoving story makes the best opiate if this be so dear old squiffys choice of literature had been rather injudicious his book was the adventures of sherlock holmes and the particular story which he selected for perusal was the one entitled the speckled band he was not a great reader but when he read he liked something with a bit of zip to it  squiffy became absorbed he had read the story before but a long time back and its complications were fresh to him the tale it may be remembered deals with the activities of an ingenious gentleman who kept a snake and used to loose it into peoples bedrooms as a preliminary to collecting on their insurance it gave squiffy pleasant thrills for he had always had a particular horror of snakes as a child he had shrunk from visiting the serpent house at the zoo and later when he had come to mans estate and had put off childish things and settled down in real earnest to his selfappointed mission of drinking up all the alcoholic fluid in england the distaste for ophidia had lingered to a dislike for real snakes had been added a maturer shrinking from those which existed only in his imagination he could still recall his emotions on the occasion scarcely three months before when he had seen a long green serpent which a majority of his contemporaries had assured him wasnt there  squiffy read on  suddenly another sound became audiblea very gentle soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping continuously from a kettle  lord seacliff looked up from his book with a start imagination was beginning to play him tricks he could have sworn that he had actually heard that identical sound it had seemed to come from the window he listened again no all was still he returned to his book and went on reading  it was a singular sight that met our eyes beside the table on a wooden chair sat doctor grimesby rylott clad in a long dressinggown his chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with brownish speckles which seemed to be bound tightly round his head  i took a step forward in an instant his strange headgear began to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamondshaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent  ugh said squiffy  he closed the book and put it down his head was aching worse than ever he wished now that he had read something else no fellow could read himself to sleep with this sort of thing people ought not to write this sort of thing  his heart gave a bound there it was again that hissing sound and this time he was sure it came from the window  he looked at the window and remained staring frozen over the sill with a graceful leisurely movement a green snake was crawling as it crawled it raised its head and peered from side to side like a shortsighted man looking for his spectacles it hesitated a moment on the edge of the sill then wriggled to the floor and began to cross the room squiffy stared on  it would have pained peter deeply for he was a snake of great sensibility if he had known how much his entrance had disturbed the occupant of the room he himself had no feeling but gratitude for the man who had opened the window and so enabled him to get in out of the rather nippy night air ever since the bag had swung open and shot him out onto the sill of the window below archies he had been waiting patiently for something of the kind to happen he was a snake who took things as they came and was prepared to rough it a bit if necessary but for the last hour or two he had been hoping that somebody would do something practical in the way of getting him in out of the cold when at home he had an eiderdown quilt to sleep on and the stone of the windowsill was a little trying to a snake of regular habits he crawled thankfully across the floor under squiffys bed there was a pair of trousers there for his host had undressed when not in a frame of mind to fold his clothes neatly and place them upon a chair peter looked the trousers over they were not an eiderdown quilt but they would serve he curled up in them and went to sleep he had had an exciting day and was glad to turn in  after about ten minutes the tension of squiffys attitude relaxed his heart which had seemed to suspend its operations began beating again reason reasserted itself he peeped cautiously under the bed he could see nothing  squiffy was convinced he told himself that he had never really believed in peter as a living thing it stood to reason that there couldnt really be a snake in his room the window looked out on emptiness his room was several stories above the ground there was a stern set expression on squiffys face as he climbed out of bed it was the expression of a man who is turning over a new leaf starting a new life he looked about the room for some implement which would carry out the deed he had to do and finally pulled out one of the curtainrods using this as a lever he broke open the topmost of the six cases which stood in the corner the soft wood cracked and split squiffy drew out a strawcovered bottle for a moment he stood looking at it as a man might gaze at a friend on the point of death then with a sudden determination he went into the bathroom there was a crash of glass and a gurgling sound  half an hour later the telephone in archies room rang i say archie old top said the voice of squiffy  halloa old bean is that you  i say could you pop down here for a second im rather upset  absolutely which room  fourfortyone  ill be with you eftsoons or right speedily  thanks old man  what appears to be the difficulty  well as a matter of fact i thought i saw a snake  a snake  ill tell you all about it when you come down  archie found lord seacliff seated on his bed an arresting aroma of mixed drinks pervaded the atmosphere  i say what said archie inhaling  thats all right ive been pouring my stock away just finished the last bottle  but why  i told you i thought i saw a snake  green  squiffy shivered slightly  frightfully green  archie hesitated he perceived that there are moments when silence is the best policy he had been worrying himself over the unfortunate case of his friend and now that fate seemed to have provided a solution it would be rash to interfere merely to ease the old beans mind if squiffy was going to reform because he thought he had seen an imaginary snake better not to let him know that the snake was a real one  dashed serious he said  bally dashed serious agreed squiffy im going to cut it out  great scheme  you dont think asked squiffy with a touch of hopefulness that it could have been a real snake  never heard of the management supplying them  i thought it went under the bed  well take a look  squiffy shuddered  not me i say old top you know i simply cant sleep in this room now i was wondering if you could give me a doss somewhere in yours  rather im in fivefortyone just above trot along up heres the key ill tidy up a bit here and join you in a minute  squiffy put on a dressinggown and disappeared archie looked under the bed from the trousers the head of peter popped up with its usual expression of amiable enquiry archie nodded pleasantly and sat down on the bed the problem of his little friends immediate future wanted thinking over  he lit a cigarette and remained for a while in thought then he rose an admirable solution had presented itself he picked peter up and placed him in the pocket of his dressinggown then leaving the room he mounted the stairs till he reached the seventh floor outside a room halfway down the corridor he paused  from within through the open transom came the rhythmical snoring of a good man taking his rest after the labours of the day mr brewster was always a heavy sleeper  theres always a way thought archie philosophically if a chappie only thinks of it  his fatherinlaws snoring took on a deeper note archie extracted peter from his pocket and dropped him gently through the transom     chapter ix a letter from parker   as the days went by and he settled down at the hotel cosmopolis archie looking about him and revising earlier judgments was inclined to think that of all his immediate circle he most admired parker the lean grave valet of mr daniel brewster here was a man who living in the closest contact with one of the most difficult persons in new york contrived all the while to maintain an unbowed head and as far as one could gather from appearances a tolerably cheerful disposition a great man judge him by what standard you pleased anxious as he was to earn an honest living archie would not have changed places with parker for the salary of a moviestar  it was parker who first directed archies attention to the hidden merits of pongo archie had drifted into his fatherinlaws suite one morning as he sometimes did in the effort to establish more amicable relations and had found it occupied only by the valet who was dusting the furniture and bricabrac with a feather broom rather in the style of a manservant at the rise of the curtain of an oldfashioned farce after a courteous exchange of greetings archie sat down and lit a cigarette parker went on dusting  the guvnor said parker breaking the silence has some nice little objay dar sir  little what  objay dar sir  light dawned upon archie  of course yes french for junk i see what you mean now dare say youre right old friend dont know much about these things myself  parker gave an appreciative flick at a vase on the mantelpiece  very valuable some of the guvnors things he had picked up the small china figure of the warrior with the spear and was grooming it with the ostentatious care of one brushing flies off a sleeping venus he regarded this figure with a look of affectionate esteem which seemed to archie absolutely uncalledfor archies taste in art was not precious to his untutored eye the thing was only one degree less foul than his fatherinlaws japanese prints which he had always observed with silent loathing this one now continued parker worth a lot of money oh a lot of money  what pongo said archie incredulously  sir  i always call that rummylooking whatnot pongo dont know what else you could call him what  the valet seemed to disapprove of this levity he shook his head and replaced the figure on the mantelpiece  worth a lot of money he repeated not by itself no  oh not by itself  no sir things like this come in pairs somewhere or other theres the companionpiece to this here and if the guvnor could get hold of it hed have something worth having something that connoozers would give a lot of money for but ones no good without the other you have to have both if you understand my meaning sir  i see like filling a straight flush what  precisely sir  archie gazed at pongo again with the dim hope of discovering virtues not immediately apparent to the casual observer but without success pongo left him coldeven chilly he would not have taken pongo as a gift to oblige a dying friend  how much would the pair be worth he asked ten dollars  parker smiled a gravely superior smile a leetle more than that sir several thousand dollars more like it  do you mean to say said archie with honest amazement that there are chumps going about looseabsolutely loosewho would pay that for a weird little object like pongo  undoubtedly sir these antique china figures are in great demand among collectors  archie looked at pongo once more and shook his head  well well well it takes all sorts to make a world what  what might be called the revival of pongo the restoration of pongo to the ranks of the things that matter took place several weeks later when archie was making holiday at the house which his fatherinlaw had taken for the summer at brookport the curtain of the second act may be said to rise on archie strolling back from the golflinks in the cool of an august evening from time to time he sang slightly and wondered idly if lucille would put the finishing touch upon the allrightness of everything by coming to meet him and sharing his homeward walk  she came in view at this moment a trim little figure in a white skirt and a pale blue sweater she waved to archie and archie as always at the sight of her was conscious of that jumpy fluttering sensation about the heart which translated into words would have formed the question what on earth could have made a girl like that fall in love with a chump like me it was a question which he was continually asking himself and one which was perpetually in the mind also of mr brewster his fatherinlaw the matter of archies unworthiness to be the husband of lucille was practically the only one on which the two men saw eye to eye  halloalloallo said archie here we are what i was just hoping you would drift over the horizon  lucille kissed him  youre a darling she said and you look like a greek god in that suit  glad you like it archie squinted with some complacency down his chest i always say it doesnt matter what you pay for a suit so long as its right i hope your jolly old father will feel that way when he settles up for it  where is father why didnt he come back with you  well as a matter of fact he didnt seem any too keen on my company i left him in the lockerroom chewing a cigar gave me the impression of having something on his mind  oh archie you didnt beat him again  archie looked uncomfortable he gazed out to sea with something of embarrassment  well as a matter of fact old thing to be absolutely frank i as it were did  not badly  well yes i rather fancy i put it across him with some vim and not a little emphasis to be perfectly accurate i licked him by ten and eight  but you promised me you would let him beat you today you know how pleased it would have made him  i know but light of my soul have you any idea how dashed difficult it is to get beaten by your festive parent at golf  oh well lucille sighed it cant be helped i suppose she felt in the pocket of her sweater oh theres a letter for you ive just been to fetch the mail i dont know who it can be from the handwriting looks like a vampires kind of scrawly  archie inspected the envelope it provided no solution  thats rummy who could be writing to me  open it and see  dashed bright scheme i will herbert parker who the deuce is herbert parker  parker fathers valets name was parker the one he dismissed when he found he was wearing his shirts  do you mean to say any reasonable chappie would willingly wear the sort of shirts your father i mean to say there must have been some mistake  do read the letter i expect he wants to use your influence with father to have him taken back  my influence with your father well im dashed sanguine sort of johnny if he does well heres what he says of course i remember jolly old parker nowgreat pal of mine       dear sirit is some time since the undersigned had the      honour of conversing with you but i am respectfully trusting      that you may recall me to mind when i mention that until      recently i served mr brewster your fatherinlaw in the      capacity of valet owing to an unfortunate misunderstanding      i was dismissed from that position and am now temporarily out      of a job how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of      the morning isaiah xiv 12  you know said archie admiringly this bird is hot stuff i mean to say he writes dashed well       it is not however with my own affairs that i desire to      trouble you dear sir i have little doubt that all will be      well with me and that i shall not fall like a sparrow to the      ground i have been young and now am old yet have i not      seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread      psalms xxxvii 25 my object in writing to you is as      follows you may recall that i had the pleasure of meeting      you one morning in mr brewsters suite when we had an      interesting talk on the subject of mr bs objets dart      you may recall being particularly interested in a small      china figure to assist your memory the figure to which i      allude is the one which you whimsically referred to as pongo      i informed you if you remember that could the accompanying      figure be secured the pair would be extremely valuable       i am glad to say dear sir that this has now transpired and      is on view at beales art galleries on west fortyfifty street      where it will be sold tomorrow at auction the sale commencing      at twothirty sharp if mr brewster cares to attend he will      i fancy have little trouble in securing it at a reasonable price      i confess that i had thought of refraining from apprising my late      employer of this matter but more christian feelings have      prevailed if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give      him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his      head romans xii 20 nor i must confess am i altogether      uninfluenced by the thought that my action in this matter may      conceivably lead to mr b consenting to forget the past and to      reinstate me in my former position however i am confident that      i can leave this to his good feeling                               i remain respectfully yours                              herbert parker  lucille clapped her hands  how splendid father will be pleased  yes friend parker has certainly found a way to make the old dad fond of him wish i could  but you can silly hell be delighted when you show him that letter  yes with parker old herb parkers is the neck hell fall onnot mine  lucille reflected  i wish she began she stopped her eyes lit up oh archie darling ive got an idea  decant it  why dont you slip up to new york tomorrow and buy the thing and give it to father as a surprise  archie patted her hand kindly he hated to spoil her girlish daydreams  yes he said but reflect queen of my heart i have at the moment of going to press just two dollars fifty in specie which i took off your father this afternoon we were playing twentyfive cents a hole he coughed it up without enthusiasmin fact with a nasty hacking soundbut ive got it but thats all i have got  thats all right you can pawn that ring and that bracelet of mine  oh i say what pop the family jewels  only for a day or two of course once youve got the thing father will pay us back he would give you all the money we asked him for if he knew what it was for but i want to surprise him and if you were to go to him and ask him for a thousand dollars without telling him what it was for he might refuse  he might said archie he might  it all works out splendidly tomorrows the invitation handicap and fathers been looking forward to it for weeks hed hate to have to go up to town himself and not play in it but you can slip up and slip back without his knowing anything about it  archie pondered  it sounds a ripe scheme yes it has all the earmarks of a somewhat fruity wheeze by jove it is a fruity wheeze its an egg  an egg  good egg you know halloa heres a postscript i didnt see it       psi should be glad if you would convey my most      cordial respects to mrs moffam will you also inform      her that i chanced to meet mr william this morning on      broadway just off the boat he desired me to send his      regards and to say that he would be joining you at      brookport in the course of a day or so mr b will be      pleased to have him back a wise son maketh a glad      father proverbs x 1  whos mr william asked archie  my brother bill of course ive told you all about him  oh yes of course your brother bill rummy to think ive got a brotherinlaw ive never seen  you see we married so suddenly when we married bill was in yale  good god what for  not jail silly yale the university  oh ah yes  then he went over to europe for a trip to broaden his mind you must look him up tomorrow when you get back to new york hes sure to be at his club  ill make a point of it well vote of thanks to good old parker this really does begin to look like the point in my career where i start to have your forbidding old parent eating out of my hand  yes its an egg isnt it  queen of my soul said archie enthusiastically its an omelette  the business negotiations in connection with the bracelet and the ring occupied archie on his arrival in new york to an extent which made it impossible for him to call on brother bill before lunch he decided to postpone the affecting meeting of brothersinlaw to a more convenient season and made his way to his favourite table at the cosmopolis grillroom for a bite of lunch preliminary to the fatigues of the sale he found salvatore hovering about as usual and instructed him to come to the rescue with a minute steak  salvatore was the dark sinisterlooking waiter who attended among other tables to the one at the far end of the grillroom at which archie usually sat for several weeks archies conversations with the other had dealt exclusively with the bill of fare and its contents but gradually he had found himself becoming more personal even before the war and its democratising influences archie had always lacked that reserve which characterises many britons and since the war he had looked on nearly everyone he met as a brother long since through the medium of a series of friendly chats he had heard all about salvatores home in italy the little newspaper and tobacco shop which his mother owned down on seventh avenue and a hundred other personal details archie had an insatiable curiosity about his fellowman  well done said archie  sare  the steak not too rare you know  very good sare  archie looked at the waiter closely his tone had been subdued and sad of course you dont expect a waiter to beam all over his face and give three rousing cheers simply because you have asked him to bring you a minute steak but still there was something about salvatores manner that disturbed archie the man appeared to have the pip whether he was merely homesick and brooding on the lost delights of his sunny native land or whether his trouble was more definite could only be ascertained by enquiry so archie enquired  whats the matter laddie he said sympathetically something on your mind  sare  i say there seems to be something on your mind whats the trouble  the waiter shrugged his shoulders as if indicating an unwillingness to inflict his grievances on one of the tipping classes  come on persisted archie encouragingly all pals here barge alone old thing and lets have it  salvatore thus admonished proceeded in a hurried undertonewith one eye on the headwaiterto lay bare his soul what he said was not very coherent but archie could make out enough of it to gather that it was a sad story of excessive hours and insufficient pay he mused awhile the waiters hard case touched him  ill tell you what he said at last when jolly old brewster conies back to townhes away just nowill take you along to him and well beard the old boy in his den ill introduce you and you get that extract from italian operaoff your chest which youve just been singing to me and youll find itll be all right he isnt what you might call one of my greatest admirers but everybody says hes a square sort of cove and hell see you arent snootered and now laddie touching the matter of that steak  the waiter disappeared greatly cheered and archie turning perceived that his friend reggie van tuyl was entering the room he waved to him to join his table he liked reggie and it also occurred to him that a man of the world like the heir of the van tuyls who had been popping about new york for years might be able to give him some muchneeded information on the procedure at an auction sale a matter on which he himself was profoundly ignorant     chapter x doing father a bit of good   reggie van tuyl approached the table languidly and sank down into a chair he was a long youth with a rather subdued and deflated look as though the burden of the van tuyl millions was more than his frail strength could support most things tired him  i say reggie old top said archie youre just the lad i wanted to see i require the assistance of a blighter of ripe intellect tell me laddie do you know anything about sales  reggie eyed him sleepily  sales  auction sales  reggie considered  well theyre sales you know he checked a yawn auction sales you understand  yes said archie encouragingly somethingthe name or somethingseemed to tell me that  fellows put things up for sale you know and other fellowsother fellows go in andand buy em if you follow me  yes but whats the procedure i mean what do i do thats what im after ive got to buy something at beales this afternoon how do i set about it  well said reggie drowsily there are several ways of bidding you know you can shout or you can nod or you can twiddle your fingers the effort of concentration was too much for him he leaned back limply in his chair ill tell you what ive nothing to do this afternoon ill come with you and show you  when he entered the art galleries a few minutes later archie was glad of the moral support of even such a wobbly reed as reggie van tuyl there is something about an auction room which weighs heavily upon the novice the hushed interior was bathed in a dim religious light and the congregation seated on small wooden chairs gazed in reverent silence at the pulpit where a gentleman of commanding presence and sparkling pincenez was delivering a species of chant behind a gold curtain at the end of the room mysterious forms flitted to and fro archie who had been expecting something on the lines of the new york stock exchange which he had once been privileged to visit when it was in a more than usually feverish mood found the atmosphere oppressively ecclesiastical he sat down and looked about him the presiding priest went on with his chant  sixteensixteensixteensixteensixteenworth three hundredsixteensixteensixteensixteensixteenought to bring five hundredsixteensixteenseventeenseventeeneighteeneighteen nineteennineteennineteen  he stopped and eyed the worshippers with a glittering and reproachful eye they had it seemed disappointed him his lips curled and he waved a hand towards a grimly uncomfortablelooking chair with insecure legs and a good deal of gold paint about it gentlemen ladies and gentlemen you are not here to waste my time i am not here to waste yours am i seriously offered nineteen dollars for this eighteenthcentury chair acknowledged to be the finest piece sold in new york for months and months am itwenty i thank you twentytwentytwentytwenty your opportunity priceless very few extant twentyfivefivefivefivethirtythirty just what you are looking for the only one in the city of new york thirtyfivefivefivefive fortyfortyfortyfortyforty look at those legs back it into the light willie let the light fall on those legs  willie a sort of acolyte manoeuvred the chair as directed reggie van tuyl who had been yawning in a hopeless sort of way showed his first flicker of interest  willie he observed eyeing that youth more with pity than reproach has a face like jojo the dogfaced boy dont you think so  archie nodded briefly precisely the same criticism had occurred to him  fortyfivefivefivefivefive chanted the highpriest once fortyfive twice fortyfive third and last call fortyfive sold at fortyfive gentleman in the fifth row  archie looked up and down the row with a keen eye he was anxious to see who had been chump enough to give fortyfive dollars for such a frightful object he became aware of the dogfaced willie leaning towards him  name please said the canine one  eh what said archie oh my names moffam dont you know the eyes of the multitude made him feel a little nervous erglad to meet you and all that sort of rot  ten dollars deposit please said willie  i dont absolutely follow you old bean what is the big thought at the back of all this  ten dollars deposit on the chair  what chair  you bid fortyfive dollars for the chair  me  you nodded said willie accusingly if he went on reasoning closely you didnt want to bid why did you nod  archie was embarrassed he could of course have pointed out that he had merely nodded in adhesion to the statement that the other had a face like jojo the dogfaced boy but something seemed to tell him that a purist might consider the excuse deficient in tact he hesitated a moment then handed over a tendollar bill the price of willies feelings willie withdrew like a tiger slinking from the body of its victim  i say old thing said archie to reggie this is a bit thick you know no purse will stand this drain  reggie considered the matter his face seemed drawn under the mental strain  dont nod again he advised if you arent careful you get into the habit of it when you want to bid just twiddle your fingers yes thats the thing twiddle  he sighed drowsily the atmosphere of the auction room was close you werent allowed to smoke and altogether he was beginning to regret that he had come the service continued objects of varying unattractiveness came and went eulogised by the officiating priest but coldly received by the congregation relations between the former and the latter were growing more and more distant the congregation seemed to suspect the priest of having an ulterior motive in his eulogies and the priest seemed to suspect the congregation of a frivolous desire to waste his time he had begun to speculate openly as to why they were there at all once when a particularly repellent statuette of a nude female with an unwholesome green skin had been offered at two dollars and had found no biddersthe congregation appearing silently grateful for his statement that it was the only specimen of its kind on the continenthe had specifically accused them of having come into the auction room merely with the purpose of sitting down and taking the weight off their feet  if your thingyour whateveritis doesnt come up soon archie said reggie fighting off with an effort the mists of sleep i rather think i shall be toddling along what was it you came to get  its rather difficult to describe its a rummylooking sort of whatnot made of china or something i call it pongo at least this one isnt pongo dont you knowits his little brother but presumably equally foul in every respect its all rather complicated i know buthallo he pointed excitedly by jove were off there it is look willies unleasing it now  willie who had disappeared through the gold curtain had now returned and was placing on a pedestal a small china figure of delicate workmanship it was the figure of a warrior in a suit of armour advancing with raised spear upon an adversary a thrill permeated archies frame parker had not been mistaken this was undoubtedly the companionfigure to the redoubtable pongo the two were identical even from where he sat archie could detect on the features of the figure on the pedestal the same expression of insufferable complacency which had alienated his sympathies from the original pongo  the highpriest undaunted by previous rebuffs regarded the figure with a gloating enthusiasm wholly unshared by the congregation who were plainly looking upon pongos little brother as just another of those things  this he said with a shake in his voice is something very special china figure said to date back to the ming dynasty unique nothing like it on either side of the atlantic if i were selling this at christies in london where people he said nastily have an educated appreciation of the beautiful the rare and the exquisite i should start the bidding at a thousand dollars this afternoons experience has taught me that that might possibly be too high his pincenez sparkled militantly as he gazed upon the stolid throng will anyone offer me a dollar for this unique figure  leap at it old top said reggie van tuyl twiddle dear boy twiddle a dollars reasonable  archie twiddled  one dollar i am offered said the highpriest bitterly one gentleman here is not afraid to take a chance one gentleman here knows a good thing when he sees one he abandoned the gently sarcastic manner for one of crisp and direct reproach come come gentlemen we are not here to waste time will anyone offer me one hundred dollars for this superb piece of he broke off and seemed for a moment almost unnerved he stared at someone in one of the seats in front of archie thank you he said with a sort of gulp one hundred dollars i am offered one hundredone hundredone hundred  archie was startled this sudden tremendous jump this wholly unforeseen boom in pongos if one might so describe it was more than a little disturbing he could not see who his rival was but it was evident that at least one among those present did not intend to allow pongos brother to slip by without a fight he looked helplessly at reggie for counsel but reggie had now definitely given up the struggle exhausted nature had done its utmost and now he was leaning back with closed eyes breathing softly through his nose thrown on his own resources archie could think of no better course than to twiddle his fingers again he did so and the highpriests chant took on a note of positive exuberance  two hundred i am offered much better turn the pedestal round willie and let them look at it slowly slowly you arent spinning a roulettewheel two hundred twotwotwotwotwo he became suddenly lyrical twotwotwothere was a young lady named lou who was catching a train at twotwo said the porter dont worry or hurry or scurry its a minute or two to twotwo twotwotwotwotwo  archies concern increased he seemed to be twiddling at this voluble man across seas of misunderstanding nothing is harder to interpret to a nicety than a twiddle and archies idea of the language of twiddles and the highpriests idea did not coincide by a mile the highpriest appeared to consider that when archie twiddled it was his intention to bid in hundreds whereas in fact archie had meant to signify that he raised the previous bid by just one dollar archie felt that if given time he could make this clear to the highpriest but the latter gave him no time he had got his audience so to speak on the run and he proposed to hustle them before they could rally  two hundredtwo hundredtwothreethank you sirthreethreethreefourfourfivefivesixsixsevensevenseven  archie sat limply in his wooden chair he was conscious of a feeling which he had only experienced twice in his lifeonce when he had taken his first lesson in driving a motor and had trodden on the accelerator instead of the brake the second time more recently when he had made his first downtrip on an express lift he had now precisely the same sensation of being run away with by an uncontrollable machine and of having left most of his internal organs at some little distance from the rest of his body emerging from this welter of emotion stood out the one clear fact that be the opposition bidding what it might he must nevertheless secure the prize lucille had sent him to new york expressly to do so she had sacrificed her jewellery for the cause she relied on him the enterprise had become for archie something almost sacred he felt dimly like a knight of old hot on the track of the holy grail  he twiddled again the ring and the bracelet had fetched nearly twelve hundred dollars up to that figure his hat was in the ring  eight hundred i am offered eight hundred eighteighteighteight  a voice spoke from somewhere at the back of the room a quiet cold nasty determined voice  nine  archie rose from his seat and spun round this mean attack from the rear stung his fighting spirit as he rose a young man sitting immediately in front of him rose too and stared likewise he was a squarebuilt resolutelooking young man who reminded archie vaguely of somebody he had seen before but archie was too busy trying to locate the man at the back to pay much attention to him he detected him at last owing to the fact that the eyes of everybody in that part of the room were fixed upon him he was a small man of middle age with tortoiseshellrimmed spectacles he might have been a professor or something of the kind whatever he was he was obviously a man to be reckoned with he had a rich sort of look and his demeanour was the demeanour of a man who is prepared to fight it out on these lines if it takes all the summer  nine hundred i am offered ninenineninenine  archie glared defiantly at the spectacled man  a thousand he cried  the irruption of high finance into the placid course of the afternoons proceedings had stirred the congregation out of its lethargy there were excited murmurs necks were craned feet shuffled as for the highpriest his cheerfulness was now more than restored and his faith in his fellowman had soared from the depths to a very lofty altitude he beamed with approval despite the warmth of his praise he would have been quite satisfied to see pongos little brother go at twenty dollars and the reflection that the bidding had already reached one thousand and that his commission was twenty per cent had engendered a mood of sunny happiness  one thousand is bid he carolled now gentlemen i dont want to hurry you over this you are all connoisseurs here and you dont want to see a priceless china figure of the ming dynasty get away from you at a sacrifice price perhaps you cant all see the figure where it is willie take it round and show it to em well take a little intermission while you look carefully at this wonderful figure get a move on willie pick up your feet  archie sitting dazedly was aware that reggie van tuyl had finished his beauty sleep and was addressing the young man in the seat in front  why hallo said reggie i didnt know you were back you remember me dont you reggie van tuyl i know your sister very well archie old man i want you to meet my friend bill brewster why dash it he chuckled sleepily i was forgetting of course hes your  how are you said the young man talking of my sister he said to reggie i suppose you havent met her husband by any chance i suppose you know she married some awful chump  me said archie  hows that  i married your sister my names moffam  the young man seemed a trifle taken aback  sorry he said  not at all said archie  i was only going by what my father said in his letters he explained in extenuation  archie nodded  im afraid your jolly old father doesnt appreciate me but im hoping for the best if i can rope in that rummylooking little china thing that jojo the dogfaced boy is showing the customers he will be all over me i mean to say you know hes got another like it and if he can get a full house as it were im given to understand hell be bucked cheered and even braced  the young man stared  are you the fellow whos been bidding against me  eh what were you bidding against me  i wanted to buy the thing for my father ive a special reason for wanting to get in right with him just now are you buying it for him too  absolutely as a surprise it was lucilles idea his valet a chappie named parker tipped us off that the thing was to be sold  parker great scot it was parker who tipped me off i met him on broadway and he told me about it  rummy he never mentioned it in his letter to me why dash it we could have got the thing for about two dollars if we had pooled our bids  well wed better pool them now and extinguish that pill at the back there i cant go above eleven hundred thats all ive got  i cant go above eleven hundred myself  theres just one thing i wish youd let me be the one to hand the thing over to father ive a special reason for wanting to make a hit with him  absolutely said archie magnanimously its all the same to me i only wanted to get him generally braced as it were if you know what i mean  thats awfully good of you  not a bit laddie no no and far from it only too glad  willie had returned from his rambles among the connoisseurs and pongos brother was back on his pedestal the highpriest cleared his throat and resumed his discourse  now that you have all seen this superb figure we willi was offered one thousandone thousandoneoneoneoneeleven hundred thank you sir eleven hundred i am offered  the highpriest was now exuberant you could see him doing figures in his head  you do the bidding said brother bill  righto said archie  he waved a defiant hand  thirteen said the man at the back  fourteen dash it  fifteen  sixteen  seventeen  eighteen  nineteen  two thousand  the highpriest did everything but sing he radiated good will and bonhomie  two thousand i am offered is there any advance on two thousand come gentlemen i dont want to give this superb figure away twentyone hundred twentyoneoneoneone this is more the sort of thing i have been accustomed to when i was at sothebys rooms in london this kind of bidding was a commonplace twentytwotwotwotwotwo one hardly noticed it threethreethree twentythreethreethree twentythree hundred dollars i am offered  he gazed expectantly at archie as a man gazes at some favourite dog whom he calls upon to perform a trick but archie had reached the end of his tether the hand that had twiddled so often and so bravely lay inert beside his trouserleg twitching feebly archie was through  twentythree hundred said the highpriest ingratiatingly  archie made no movement there was a tense pause the highpriest gave a little sigh like one waking from a beautiful dream  twentythree hundred he said once twentythree twice twentythree third last and final call twentythree sold at twentythree hundred i congratulate you sir on a genuine bargain  reggie van tuyl had dozed off again archie tapped his brotherinlaw on the shoulder  may as well be popping what  they threaded their way sadly together through the crowd and made for the street they passed into fifth avenue without breaking the silence  bally nuisance said archie at last  rotten  wonder who that chappie was  some collector probably  well it cant be helped said archie  brother bill attached himself to archies arm and became communicative  i didnt want to mention it in front of van tuyl he said because hes such a talkingmachine and it would have been all over new york before dinnertime but youre one of the family and you can keep a secret  absolutely silent tomb and what not  the reason i wanted that darned thing was because ive just got engaged to a girl over in england and i thought that if i could hand my father that china figurething with one hand and break the news with the other it might help a bit shes the most wonderful girl  ill bet she is said archie cordially  the trouble is shes in the chorus of one of the revues over there and father is apt to kick so i thoughtoh well its no good worrying now come along where its quiet and ill tell you all about her  thatll be jolly said archie     chapter xi salvatore chooses the wrong moment   archie reclaimed the family jewellery from its temporary home next morning and having done so sauntered back to the cosmopolis he was surprised on entering the lobby to meet his fatherinlaw more surprising still mr brewster was manifestly in a mood of extraordinary geniality archie could hardly believe his eyes when the other waved cheerily to himnor his ears a moment later when mr brewster addressing him as my boy asked him how he was and mentioned that the day was a warm one  obviously this jovial frame of mind must be taken advantage of and archies first thought was of the downtrodden salvatore to the tale of whose wrongs he had listened so sympathetically on the previous day now was plainly the moment for the waiter to submit his grievance before some ebbtide caused the milk of human kindness to flow out of daniel brewster with a swift cheerio in his fatherinlaws direction archie bounded into the grillroom salvatore the hour for luncheon being imminent but not yet having arrived was standing against the far wall in an attitude of thought  laddie cried archie  sare  a most extraordinary thing has happened good old brewster has suddenly popped up through a trap and is out in the lobby now and whats still more weird hes apparently bucked  sare  braced you know in the pink pleased about something if you go to him now with that yarn of yours you cant fail hell kiss you on both cheeks and give you his bankroll and collarstud charge along and ask the headwaiter if you can have ten minutes off  salvatore vanished in search of the potentate named and archie returned to the lobby to bask in the unwonted sunshine  well well well what he said i thought you were at brookport  i came up this morning to meet a friend of mine replied mr brewster genially professor binstead  dont think i know him  very interesting man said mr brewster still with the same uncanny amiability hes a dabbler in a good many thingsscience phrenology antiques i asked him to bid for me at a sale yesterday there was a little china figure  archies jaw fell  china figure he stammered feebly  yes the companion to one you may have noticed on my mantelpiece upstairs i have been trying to get the pair of them for years i should never have heard of this one if it had not been for that valet of mine parker very good of him to let me know of it considering i had fired him ah here is binsteadhe moved to greet the small middleaged man with the tortoiseshellrimmed spectacles who was bustling across the lobby well binstead so you got it  yes  i suppose the price wasnt particularly stiff  twentythree hundred  twentythree hundred mr brewster seemed to reel in his tracks twentythree hundred  you gave me carte blanche  yes but twentythree hundred  i could have got it for a few dollars but unfortunately i was a little late and when i arrived some young fool had bid it up to a thousand and he stuck to me till i finally shook him off at twentythree hundred why this is the very man is he a friend of yours  archie coughed  more a relation than a friend what soninlaw dont you know  mr brewsters amiability had vanished  what damned foolery have you been up to now he demanded cant i move a step without stubbing my toe on you why the devil did you bid  we thought it would be rather a fruity scheme we talked it over and came to the conclusion that it was an egg wanted to get hold of the rummy little object dont you know and surprise you  whos we  lucille and i  but how did you hear of it at all  parker the valetchappie you know wrote me a letter about it  parker didnt he tell you that he had told me the figure was to be sold  absolutely not a sudden suspicion came to archie he was normally a guileless young man but even to him the extreme fishiness of the part played by herbert parker had become apparent i say you know it looks to me as if friend parker had been having us all on a bit what i mean to say it was jolly old herb who tipped your son offbill you knowto go and bid for the thing  bill was bill there  absolutely in person we were bidding against each other like the dickens till we managed to get together and get acquainted and then this birdthis gentlemansailed in and started to slip it across us  professor binstead chuckledthe carefree chuckle of a man who sees all those around him smitten in the pocket while he himself remains untouched  a very ingenious rogue this parker of yours brewster his method seems to have been simple but masterly i have no doubt that either he or a confederate obtained the figure and placed it with the auctioneer and then he ensured a good price for it by getting us all to bid against each other very ingenious  mr brewster struggled with his feelings then he seemed to overcome them and to force himself to look on the bright side  well anyway he said ive got the pair of figures and thats what i wanted is that it in that parcel  this is it i wouldnt trust an express company to deliver it suppose we go up to your room and see how the two look side by side  they crossed the lobby to the liftthe cloud was still on mr brewsters brow as they stepped out and made their way to his suite like most men who have risen from poverty to wealth by their own exertions mr brewster objected to parting with his money unnecessarily and it was plain that that twentythree hundred dollars still rankled  mr brewster unlocked the door and crossed the room then suddenly he halted stared and stared again he sprang to the bell and pressed it then stood gurgling wordlessly  anything wrong old bean queried archie solicitously  wrong wrong its gone  gone  the figure  the floorwaiter had manifested himself silently in answer to the bell and was standing in the doorway  simmons mr brewster turned to him wildly has anyone been in this suite since i went away  no sir  nobody  nobody except your valet sirparker he said he had come to fetch some things away i supposed he had come from you sir with instructions  get out  professor binstead had unwrapped his parcel and had placed the pongo on the table there was a weighty silence archie picked up the little china figure and balanced it on the palm of his hand it was a small thing he reflected philosophically but it had made quite a stir in the world  mr brewster fermented for a while without speaking  so he said at last in a voice trembling with selfpity i have been to all this trouble  and expense put in professor binstead gently  merely to buy back something which had been stolen from me and owing to your damned officiousness he cried turning on archie i have had to pay twentythree hundred dollars for it i dont know why they make such a fuss about job job never had anything like you around  of course argued archie he had one or two boils  boils what are boils  dashed sorry murmured archie acted for the best meant well and all that sort of rot  professor binsteads mind seemed occupied to the exclusion of all other aspects of the affair with the ingenuity of the absent parker  a cunning scheme he said a very cunning scheme this man parker must have a brain of no low order i should like to feel his bumps  i should like to give him some said the stricken mr brewster he breathed a deep breath oh well he said situated as i am with a crook valet and an imbecile soninlaw i suppose i ought to be thankful that ive still got my own property even if i have had to pay twentythree hundred dollars for the privilege of keeping it he rounded on archie who was in a reverie the thought of the unfortunate bill had just crossed archies mind it would be many moons many weary moons before mr brewster would be in a suitable mood to listen sympathetically to the story of loves young dream give me that figure  archie continued to toy absently with pongo he was wondering now how best to break this sad occurrence to lucille it would be a disappointment for the poor girl  give me that figure  archie started violently there was an instant in which pongo seemed to hang suspended like mohammeds coffin between heaven and earth then the force of gravity asserted itself pongo fell with a sharp crack and disintegrated and as it did so there was a knock at the door and in walked a dark furtive person who to the inflamed vision of mr daniel brewster looked like something connected with the executive staff of the black hand with all time at his disposal the unfortunate salvatore had selected this moment for stating his case  get out bellowed mr brewster i didnt ring for a waiter  archie his mind reeling beneath the catastrophe recovered himself sufficiently to do the honours it was at his instigation that salvatore was there and greatly as he wished that he could have seen fit to choose a more auspicious moment for his business chat he felt compelled to do his best to see him through  oh i say half a second he said you dont quite understand as a matter of fact this chappie is by way of being downtrodden and oppressed and what not and i suggested that he should get hold of you and speak a few wellchosen words of course if youd rathersome other time  but mr brewster was not permitted to postpone the interview before he could get his breath salvatore had begun to talk he was a strong ambidextrous talker whom it was hard to interrupt and it was not for some moments that mr brewster succeeded in getting a word in when he did he spoke to the point though not a linguist he had been able to follow the discourse closely enough to realise that the waiter was dissatisfied with conditions in his hotel and mr brewster as has been indicated had a short way with people who criticised the cosmopolis  youre fired said mr brewster  oh i say protested archie  salvatore muttered what sounded like a passage from dante  fired repeated mr brewster resolutely and i wish to heaven he added eyeing his soninlaw malignantly i could fire you  well said professor binstead cheerfully breaking the grim silence which followed this outburst if you will give me your cheque brewster i think i will be going two thousand three hundred dollars make it open if you will and then i can run round the corner and cash it before lunch that will be capital     chapter xii bright eyesand a fly   the hermitage unrivalled scenery superb cuisine daniel brewster proprietor was a picturesque summer hotel in the green heart of the mountains built by archies fatherinlaw shortly after he assumed control of the cosmopolis mr brewster himself seldom went there preferring to concentrate his attention on his new york establishment and archie and lucille breakfasting in the airy diningroom some ten days after the incidents recorded in the last chapter had consequently to be content with two out of the three advertised attractions of the place through the window at their side quite a slab of the unrivalled scenery was visible some of the superb cuisine was already on the table and the fact that the eye searched in vain for daniel brewster proprietor filled archie at any rate with no sense of aching loss he bore it with equanimity and even with positive enthusiasm in archies opinion practically all a place needed to make it an earthly paradise was for mr daniel brewster to be about fortyseven miles away from it  it was at lucilles suggestion that they had come to the hermitage never a human sunbeam mr brewster had shown such a bleak front to the world and particularly to his soninlaw in the days following the pongo incident that lucille had thought that he and archie would for a time at least be better aparta view with which her husband cordially agreed he had enjoyed his stay at the hermitage and now he regarded the eternal hills with the comfortable affection of a healthy man who is breakfasting well  its going to be another perfectly topping day he observed eyeing the shimmering landscape from which the morning mists were swiftly shredding away like faint puffs of smoke just the day you ought to have been here  yes its too bad ive got to go new york will be like an oven  put it off  i cant im afraid ive a fitting  archie argued no further he was a married man of old enough standing to know the importance of fittings  besides said lucille i want to see father archie repressed an exclamation of astonishment ill be back tomorrow evening you will be perfectly happy  queen of my soul you know i cant be happy with you away you know  yes murmured lucille appreciatively she never tired of hearing archie say this sort of thing  archies voice had trailed off he was looking across the room  by jove he exclaimed what an awfully pretty woman  where  over there just coming in i say what wonderful eyes i dont think i ever saw such eyes did you notice her eyes sort of flashing awfully pretty woman  warm though the morning was a suspicion of chill descended upon the breakfasttable a certain coldness seemed to come into lucilles face she could not always share archies fresh young enthusiasms  do you think so  wonderful figure too  yes  well what i mean to say fair to medium said archie recovering a certain amount of that intelligence which raises man above the level of the beasts of the field not the sort of type i admire myself of course  you know her dont you  absolutely not and far from it said archie hastily never met her in my life  youve seen her on the stage her names vera silverton we saw her in  of course yes so we did i say i wonder what shes doing here she ought to be in new york rehearsing i remember meeting whatshisnameyou knowchappie who writes plays and what notgeorge benhami remember meeting george benham and he told me she was rehearsing in a piece of his calledi forget the name but i know it was called something or other well why isnt she  she probably lost her temper and broke her contract and came away shes always doing that sort of thing shes known for it she must be a horrid woman  yes  i dont want to talk about her she used to be married to someone and she divorced him and then she was married to someone else and he divorced her and im certain her hair wasnt that colour two years ago and i dont think a woman ought to make up like that and her dress is all wrong for the country and those pearls cant be genuine and i hate the way she rolls her eyes about and pink doesnt suit her a bit i think shes an awful woman and i wish you wouldnt keep on talking about her  righto said archie dutifully  they finished breakfast and lucille went up to pack her bag archie strolled out on to the terrace outside the hotel where he smoked communed with nature and thought of lucille he always thought of lucille when he was alone especially when he chanced to find himself in poetic surroundings like those provided by the unrivalled scenery encircling the hotel hermitage the longer he was married to her the more did the sacred institution seem to him a good egg mr brewster might regard their marriage as one of the worlds most unfortunate incidents but to archie it was and always had been a bit of all right the more he thought of it the more did he marvel that a girl like lucille should have been content to link her lot with that of a class c specimen like himself his meditations were in fact precisely what a happilymarried mans meditations ought to be  he was roused from them by a species of exclamation or cry almost at his elbow and turned to find that the spectacular miss silverton was standing beside him her dubious hair gleamed in the sunlight and one of the criticised eyes was screwed up the other gazed at archie with an expression of appeal  theres something in my eye she said  no really  i wonder if you would mind it would be so kind of you  archie would have preferred to remove himself but no man worthy of the name can decline to come to the rescue of womanhood in distress to twist the ladys upper lid back and peer into it and jab at it with the corner of his handkerchief was the only course open to him his conduct may be classed as not merely blameless but definitely praiseworthy king arthurs knights used to do this sort of thing all the time and look what people think of them lucille therefore coming out of the hotel just as the operation was concluded ought not to have felt the annoyance she did but of course there is a certain superficial intimacy about the attitude of a man who is taking a fly out of a womans eye which may excusably jar upon the sensibilities of his wife it is an attitude which suggests a sort of rapprochement or camaraderie or as archie would have put it what not  thanks so much said miss silverton  oh no rather not said archie  such a nuisance getting things in your eye  absolutely  im always doing it  rotten luck  but i dont often find anyone as clever as you to help me  lucille felt called upon to break in on this feast of reason and flow of soul  archie she said if you go and get your clubs now i shall just have time to walk round with you before my train goes  oh ah said archie perceiving her for the first time oh ah yes righto yes yes yes  on the way to the first tee it seemed to archie that lucille was distrait and abstracted in her manner and it occurred to him not for the first time in his life what a poor support a clear conscience is in moments of crisis dash it all he didnt see what else he could have done couldnt leave the poor female staggering about the place with squads of flies wedged in her eyeball nevertheless  rotten thing getting a fly in your eye he hazarded at length dashed awkward i mean  or convenient  eh  well its a very good way of dispensing with an introduction  oh i say you dont mean you think  shes a horrid woman  absolutely cant think what people see in her  well you seemed to enjoy fussing over her  no no nothing of the kind she inspired me with absolute whatdyoucallitthe sort of thing chappies do get inspired with you know  you were beaming all over your face  i wasnt i was just screwing up my face because the sun was in my eye  all sorts of things seem to be in peoples eyes this morning   archie was saddened that this sort of misunderstanding should have occurred on such a topping day and at a moment when they were to be torn asunder for about thirtysix hours made him feelwell it gave him the pip he had an idea that there were words which would have straightened everything out but he was not an eloquent young man and could not find them he felt aggrieved lucille he considered ought to have known that he was immune as regarded females with flashing eyes and experimentallycoloured hair why dash it he could have extracted flies from the eyes of cleopatra with one hand and helen of troy with the other simultaneously without giving them a second thought it was in depressed mood that he played a listless nine holes nor had life brightened for him when he came back to the hotel two hours later after seeing lucille off in the train to new york never till now had they had anything remotely resembling a quarrel life archie felt was a bit of a washout he was disturbed and jumpy and the sight of miss silverton talking to somebody on a settee in the corner of the hotel lobby sent him shooting off at right angles and brought him up with a bump against the desk behind which the roomclerk sat  the roomclerk always of a chatty disposition was saying something to him but archie did not listen he nodded mechanically it was something about his room he caught the word satisfactory  oh rather quite said archie  a fussy devil the roomclerk he knew perfectly well that archie found his room satisfactory these chappies gassed on like this so as to try to make you feel that the management took a personal interest in you it was part of their job archie beamed absently and went in to lunch lucilles empty seat stared at him mournfully increasing his sense of desolation  he was halfway through his lunch when the chair opposite ceased to be vacant archie transferring his gaze from the scenery outside the window perceived that his friend george benham the playwright had materialised from nowhere and was now in his midst  hallo he said  george benham was a grave young man whose spectacles gave him the look of a mournful owl he seemed to have something on his mind besides the artistically straggling mop of black hair which swept down over his brow he sighed wearily and ordered fishpie  i thought i saw you come through the lobby just now he said  oh was that you on the settee talking to miss silverton  she was talking to me said the playwright moodily  what are you doing here asked archie he could have wished mr benham elsewhere for he intruded on his gloom but the chappie being amongst those present it was only civil to talk to him i thought you were in new york watching the rehearsals of your jolly old drama  the rehearsals are hung up and it looks as though there wasnt going to be any drama good lord cried george benham with honest warmth with opportunities opening out before one on every sidewith life extending prizes to one with both handswhen you see coalheavers making fifty dollars a week and the fellows who clean out the sewers going happy and singing about their workwhy does a man deliberately choose a job like writing plays job was the only man that ever lived who was really qualified to write a play and he would have found it pretty tough going if his leading woman had been anyone like vera silverton  archieand it was this fact no doubt which accounted for his possession of such a large and varied circle of friendswas always able to shelve his own troubles in order to listen to other peoples hardluck stories  tell me all laddie he said release the film has she walked out on you  left us flat how did you hear about it oh she told you of course  archie hastened to try to dispel the idea that he was on any such terms of intimacy with miss silverton  no no my wife said she thought it must be something of that nature or order when we saw her come in to breakfast i mean to say said archie reasoning closely woman cant come into breakfast here and be rehearsing in new york at the same time why did she administer the raspberry old friend  mr benham helped himself to fishpie and spoke dully through the steam  well what happened was this knowing her as intimately as you do  i dont know her  well anyway it was like this as you know she has a dog  i didnt know she had a dog protested archie it seemed to him that the world was in conspiracy to link him with this woman  well she has a dog a beastly great whacking brute of a bulldog and she brings it to rehearsal mr benhams eyes filled with tears as in his emotion he swallowed a mouthful of fishpie some eightythree degrees fahrenheit hotter than it looked in the intermission caused by this disaster his agile mind skipped a few chapters of the story and when he was able to speak again he said so then there was a lot of trouble everything broke loose  why archie was puzzled did the management object to her bringing the dog to rehearsal  a lot of good that would have done she does what she likes in the theatre  then why was there trouble  you werent listening said mr benham reproachfully i told you this dog came snuffling up to where i was sittingit was quite dark in the body of the theatre you knowand i got up to say something about something that was happening on the stage and somehow i must have given it a push with my foot  i see said archie beginning to get the run of the plot you kicked her dog  pushed it accidentally with my foot  i understand and when you brought off this kick  push said mr benham austerely  this kick or push when you administered this kick or push  it was more a sort of light shove  well when you did whatever you did the trouble started  mr benham gave a slight shiver  she talked for a while and then walked out taking the dog with her you see this wasnt the first time it had happened  good lord do you spend your whole time doing that sort of thing  it wasnt me the first time it was the stagemanager he didnt know whose dog it was and it came waddling on to the stage and he gave it a sort of pat a kind of flick  a slosh  not a slosh corrected mr benham firmly you might call it a tapwith the promptscript well we had a lot of difficulty smoothing her over that time still we managed to do it but she said that if anything of the sort occurred again she would chuck up her part  she must be fond of the dog said archie for the first time feeling a touch of goodwill and sympathy towards the lady  shes crazy about it thats what made it so awkward when i happenedquite inadvertentlyto give it this sort of accidental shove well we spent the rest of the day trying to get her on the phone at her apartment and finally we heard that she had come here so i took the next train and tried to persuade her to come back she wouldnt listen and thats how matters stand  pretty rotten said archie sympathetically  you can bet its pretty rottenfor me theres nobody else who can play the part like a chump i wrote the thing specially for her it means the play wont be produced at all if she doesnt do it so youre my last hope  archie who was lighting a cigarette nearly swallowed it  i am  i thought you might persuade her point out to her what a lot hangs on her coming back jolly her along you know the sort of thing  but my dear old friend i tell you i dont know her  mr benhams eyes opened behind their zareba of glass  well she knows you when you came through the lobby just now she said that you were the only real human being she had ever met  well as a matter of fact i did take a fly out of her eye but  you did well then the whole things simple all you have to do is to ask her how her eye is and tell her she has the most beautiful eyes you ever saw and coo a bit  but my dear old son the frightful programme which his friend had mapped out stunned archie i simply cant anything to oblige and all that sort of thing but when it comes to cooing distinctly napoo  nonsense it isnt hard to coo  you dont understand laddie youre not a married man i mean to say whatever you say for or against marriagepersonally im all for it and consider it a ripe eggthe fact remains that it practically makes a chappie a spent force as a cooer i dont want to dish you in any way old bean but i must firmly and resolutely decline to coo  mr benham rose and looked at his watch  ill have to be moving he said ive got to get back to new york and report ill tell them that i havent been able to do anything myself but that ive left the matter in good hands i know you will do your best  but laddie  think said mr benham solemnly of all that depends on it the other actors the smallpart people thrown out of a job myselfbut no perhaps you had better touch very lightly or not at all on my connection with the thing well you know how to handle it i feel i can leave it to you pitch it strong goodbye my dear old man and a thousand thanks ill do the same for you another time he moved towards the door leaving archie transfixed halfway there he turned and came back oh by the way he said my lunch have it put on your bill will you i havent time to stay and settle goodbye goodbye     chapter xiii rallying round percy   it amazed archie through the whole of a long afternoon to reflect how swiftly and unexpectedly the blue and brilliant sky of life can cloud over and with what abruptness a man who fancies that his feet are on solid ground can find himself immersed in fates gumbo he recalled with the bitterness with which one does recall such things that that morning he had risen from his bed without a care in the world his happiness unruffled even by the thought that lucille would be leaving him for a short space he had sung in his bath yes he had chirruped like a bally linnet and now  some men would have dismissed the unfortunate affairs of mr george benham from their mind as having nothing to do with themselves but archie had never been made of this stern stuff the fact that mr benham apart from being an agreeable companion with whom he had lunched occasionally in new york had no claims upon him affected him little he hated to see his fellowman in trouble on the other hand what could he do to seek miss silverton out and plead with hereven if he did it without cooingwould undoubtedly establish an intimacy between them which instinct told him might tinge her manner after lucilles return with just that suggestion of auld lang syne which makes things so awkward  his whole being shrank from extending to miss silverton that inch which the female artistic temperament is so apt to turn into an ell and when just as he was about to go in to dinner he met her in the lobby and she smiled brightly at him and informed him that her eye was now completely recovered he shied away like a startled mustang of the prairie and abandoning his intention of worrying the table dhote in the same room with the amiable creature tottered off to the smokingroom where he did the best he could with sandwiches and coffee  having got through the time as best he could till eleven oclock he went up to bed  the room to which he and lucille had been assigned by the management was on the second floor pleasantly sunny by day and at night filled with cool and heartening fragrance of the pines hitherto archie had always enjoyed taking a final smoke on the balcony overlooking the woods but tonight such was his mental stress that he prepared to go to bed directly he had closed the door he turned to the cupboard to get his pyjamas  his first thought when even after a second scrutiny no pyjamas were visible was that this was merely another of those things which happen on days when life goes wrong he raked the cupboard for a third time with an annoyed eye from every hook hung various garments of lucilles but no pyjamas he was breathing a soft malediction preparatory to embarking on a pointtopoint hunt for his missing property when something in the cupboard caught his eye and held him for a moment puzzled  he could have sworn that lucille did not possess a mauve neglige why she had told him a dozen times that mauve was a colour which she did not like he frowned perplexedly and as he did so from near the window came a soft cough  archie spun round and subjected the room to as close a scrutiny as that which he had bestowed upon the cupboard nothing was visible the window opening on to the balcony gaped wide the balcony was manifestly empty  urrf  this time there was no possibility of error the cough had come from the immediate neighbourhood of the window  archie was conscious of a pringly sensation about the roots of his closelycropped backhair as he moved cautiously across the room the affair was becoming uncanny and as he tiptoed towards the window old ghost stories read in lighter moments before cheerful fires with plenty of light in the room flitted through his mind he had the feelingprecisely as every chappie in those stories had hadthat he was not alone  nor was he in a basket behind an armchair curled up with his massive chin resting on the edge of the wickerwork lay a fine bulldog  urrf said the bulldog  good god said archie  there was a lengthy pause in which the bulldog looked earnestly at archie and archie looked earnestly at the bulldog  normally archie was a doglover his hurry was never so great as to prevent him stopping when in the street and introducing himself to any dog he met in a strange house his first act was to assemble the canine population roll it on its back or backs and punch it in the ribs as a boy his earliest ambition had been to become a veterinary surgeon and though the years had cheated him of his career he knew all about dogs their points their manners their customs and their treatment in sickness and in health in short he loved dogs and had they met under happier conditions he would undoubtedly have been on excellent terms with this one within the space of a minute but as things were he abstained from fraternising and continued to goggle dumbly  and then his eye wandering aside collided with the following objects a fluffy pink dressinggown hung over the back of a chair an entirely strange suitcase and on the bureau a photograph in a silver frame of a stout gentleman in eveningdress whom he had never seen before in his life  much has been written of the emotions of the wanderer who returning to his childhood home finds it altered out of all recognition but poets have neglected the themefar more poignantof the man who goes up to his room in an hotel and finds it full of somebody elses dressinggowns and bulldogs  bulldogs archies heart jumped sideways and upwards with a wiggling movement turning two somersaults and stopped beating the hideous truth working its way slowly through the concrete had at last penetrated to his brain he was not only in somebody elses room and a womans at that he was in the room belonging to miss vera silverton  he could not understand it he would have been prepared to stake the last cent he could borrow from his fatherinlaw on the fact that he had made no error in the number over the door yet nevertheless such was the case and below par though his faculties were at the moment he was sufficiently alert to perceive that it behoved him to withdraw  he leaped to the door and as he did so the handle began to turn  the cloud which had settled on archies mind lifted abruptly for an instant he was enabled to think about a hundred times more quickly than was his leisurely wont good fortune had brought him to within easy reach of the electriclight switch he snapped it back and was in darkness then diving silently and swiftly to the floor he wriggled under the bed the thud of his head against what appeared to be some sort of joist or support unless it had been placed there by the maker as a practical joke on the chance of this kind of thing happening some day coincided with the creak of the opening door then the light was switched on again and the bulldog in the corner gave a welcoming woofle  and how is mammas precious angel  rightly concluding that the remark had not been addressed to himself and that no social obligation demanded that he reply archie pressed his cheek against the boards and said nothing the question was not repeated but from the other side of the room came the sound of a patted dog  did he think his muzzer had fallen down dead and was never coming up  the beautiful picture which these words conjured up filled archie with that yearning for the mighthavebeen which is always so painful he was finding his position physically as well as mentally distressing it was cramped under the bed and the boards were harder than anything he had ever encountered also it appeared to be the practice of the housemaids at the hotel hermitage to use the space below the beds as a depository for all the dust which they swept off the carpet and much of this was insinuating itself into his nose and mouth the two things which archie would have liked most to do at that moment were first to kill miss silvertonif possible painfullyand then to spend the remainder of his life sneezing  after a prolonged period he heard a drawer open and noted the fact as promising as the old married man he presumed that it signified the putting away of hairpins about now the dashed woman would be looking at herself in the glass with her hair down then she would brush it then she would twiddle it up into thingummies say ten minutes for this and after that she would go to bed and turn out the light and he would be able after giving her a bit of time to go to sleep to creep out and leg it allowing at a conservative estimate threequarters of  come out  archie stiffened for an instant a feeble hope came to him that this remark like the others might be addressed to the dog  come out from under that bed said a stern voice and mind how you come ive got a pistol  well i mean to say you know said archie in a propitiatory voice emerging from his lair like a tortoise and smiling as winningly as a man can who has just bumped his head against the leg of a bed i suppose all this seems fairly rummy but  for the love of mike said miss silverton  the point seemed to archie well taken and the comment on the situation neatly expressed  what are you doing in my room  well if it comes to that you knowshouldnt have mentioned it if you hadnt brought the subject up in the course of general chitchatwhat are you doing in mine  yours  well apparently theres been a bloomer of some species somewhere but this was the room i had last night said archie  but the deskclerk said that he had asked you if it would be quite satisfactory to you giving it up to me and you said yes i come here every summer when im not working and i always have this room  by jove i remember now the chappie did say something to me about the room but i was thinking of something else and it rather went over the top so thats what he was talking about was it  miss silverton was frowning a movingpicture director scanning her face would have perceived that she was registering disappointment  nothing breaks right for me in this darned world she said regretfully when i caught sight of your leg sticking out from under the bed i did think that everything was all lined up for a real find and at last i could close my eyes and see the thing in the papers on the front page with photographs plucky actress captures burglar darn it  fearfully sorry you know  i just needed something like that ive got a pressagent and i will say for him that he eats well and sleeps well and has just enough intelligence to cash his monthly cheque without forgetting what he went into the bank for but outside of that you can take it from me hes not one of the worlds workers hes about as much solid use to a girl with aspirations as a pain in the lower ribs its three weeks since he got me into print at all and then the brightest thing he could think up was that my favourite breakfastfruit was an apple well i ask you  rotten said archie  i did think that for once my guardian angel had gone back to work and was doing something for me stage star and midnight marauder murmured miss silverton wistfully footlight favourite foils felon  bit thick agreed archie sympathetically well youll probably be wanting to get to bed and all that sort of rot so i may as well be popping what cheerio  a sudden gleam came into miss silvertons compelling eyes  wait  eh  wait ive got an idea the wistful sadness had gone from her manner she was bright and alert sit down  sit down  sure sit down and take the chill off the armchair ive thought of something  archie sat down as directed at his elbow the bulldog eyed him gravely from the basket  do they know you in this hotel  know me well ive been here about a week  i mean do they know who you are do they know youre a good citizen  well if it comes to that i suppose they dont but  fine said miss silverton appreciatively then its all right we can carry on  carry on  why sure all i want is to get the thing into the papers it doesnt matter to me if it turns out later that there was a mistake and that you werent a burglar trying for my jewels after all it makes just as good a story either way i cant think why that never struck me before here have i been kicking because you werent a real burglar when it doesnt amount to a hill of beans whether you are or not all ive got to do is to rush out and yell and rouse the hotel and they come in and pinch you and i give the story to the papers and everythings fine  archie leaped from his chair  i say what  whats on your mind enquired miss silverton considerately dont you think its a nifty scheme  nifty my dear old soul its frightful  cant see whats wrong with it grumbled miss silverton after ive had someone get new york on the longdistance phone and give the story to the papers you can explain and theyll let you out surely to goodness you dont object as a personal favour to me to spending an hour or two in a cell why probably they havent got a prison at all out in these parts and youll simply be locked in a room a child of ten could do it on his head said miss silverton a child of six she emended  but dash iti meanwhat i mean to sayim married  yes said miss silverton with the politeness of faint interest ive been married myself i wouldnt say its altogether a bad thing mind you for those that like it but a little of it goes a long way my first husband she proceeded reminiscently was a travelling man i gave him a twoweeks tryout and then i told him to go on travelling my second husbandnow he wasnt a gentleman in any sense of the word i remember once  you dont grasp the point the jolly old point you fail to grasp it if this bally thing comes out my wife will be most frightfully sick  miss silverton regarded him with pained surprise  do you mean to say you would let a little thing like that stand in the way of my getting on the front page of all the paperswith photographs wheres your chivalry  never mind my dashed chivalry  besides what does it matter if she does get a little sore shell soon get over it you can put that right buy her a box of candy not that im strong for candy myself what i always say is it may taste good but look what it does to your hips i give you my honest word that when i gave up eating candy i lost eleven ounces the first week my second husbandno im a liar it was my thirdmy third husband saidsay whats the big idea where are you going  out said archie firmly bally out  a dangerous light flickered in miss silvertons eyes  thatll be all of that she said raising the pistol you stay right where you are or ill fire  righto  i mean it  my dear old soul said archie in the recent unpleasantness in france i had chappies popping off things like that at me all day and every day for close on five years and here i am what i mean to say if ive got to choose between staying here and being pinched in your room by the local constabulary and having the dashed thing get into the papers and all sorts of trouble happening and my wife getting the wind up andi say if ive got to choose  suck a lozenge and start again said miss silverton  well what i mean to say is id much rather take a chance of getting a bullet in the old bean than that so loose it off and the best o luck  miss silverton lowered the pistol sank into a chair and burst into tears  i think youre the meanest man i ever met she sobbed you know perfectly well the bang would send me into a fit  in that case said archie relieved cheerio good luck pippip toodleoo and goodbyeee ill be shifting  yes you will cried miss silverton energetically recovering with amazing swiftness from her collapse yes you will i by no means suppose you think just because im no champion with a pistol im helpless you wait percy  my name is not percy  i never said it was percy percy come to muzzer  there was a creaking rustle from behind the armchair a heavy body flopped on the carpet out into the room heaving himself along as though sleep had stiffened his joints and breathing stertorously through his tilted nose moved the fine bulldog seen in the open he looked even more formidable than he had done in his basket  guard him percy good dog guard him oh heavens whats the matter with him  and with these words the emotional woman uttering a wail of anguish flung herself on the floor beside the animal  percy was indeed in manifestly bad shape he seemed quite unable to drag his limbs across the room there was a curious arch in his back and as his mistress touched him he cried out plaintively  percy oh what is the matter with him his nose is burning  now was the time with both sections of the enemys forces occupied for archie to have departed softly from the room but never since the day when at the age of eleven he had carried a large damp and muddy terrier with a sore foot three miles and deposited him on the best sofa in his mothers drawingroom had he been able to ignore the spectacle of a dog in trouble  he does look bad what  hes dying oh hes dying is it distemper hes never had distemper  archie regarded the sufferer with the grave eye of the expert he shook his head  its not that he said dogs with distemper make a sort of snifting noise  but he is making a snifting noise  no hes making a snuffling noise great difference between snuffling and snifting not the same thing at all i mean to say when they snift they snift and when they snuffle theyas it weresnuffle thats how you can tell if you ask mehe passed his hand over the dogs back percy uttered another cry i know whats the matter with him  a brute of a man kicked him at rehearsal do you think hes injured internally  its rheumatism said archie jolly old rheumatism thats all thats the trouble  are you sure  absolutely  but what can i do  give him a good hot bath and mind and dry him well hell have a good sleep then and wont have any pain then first thing tomorrow you want to give him salicylate of soda  ill never remember thatill write it down for you you ought to give him from ten to twenty grains three times a day in an ounce of water and rub him with any good embrocation  and he wont die  die hell live to be as old as you arei mean to say  i could kiss you said miss silverton emotionally  archie backed hastily  no no absolutely not nothing like that required really  youre a darling  yes i mean no no no really  i dont know what to say what can i say  good night said archie  i wish there was something i could do if you hadnt been here i should have gone off my head  a great idea flashed across archies brain  do you really want to do something  anything  then i do wish like a dear sweet soul you would pop straight back to new york tomorrow and go on with those rehearsals  miss silverton shook her head  i cant do that  oh righto but it isnt much to ask what  not much to ask ill never forgive that man for kicking percy  now listen dear old soul youve got the story all wrong as a matter of fact jolly old benham told me himself that he has the greatest esteem and respect for percy and wouldnt have kicked him for the world and you know it was more a sort of push than a kick you might almost call it a light shove the fact is it was beastly dark in the theatre and he was legging it sideways for some reason or other no doubt with the best motives and unfortunately he happened to stub his toe on the poor old bean  then why didnt he say so  as far as i could make out you didnt give him a chance  miss silverton wavered  i always hate going back after ive walked out on a show she said it seems so weak  not a bit of it theyll give three hearty cheers and think you a topper besides youve got to go to new york in any case to take percy to a vet you know what  of course how right you always are miss silverton hesitated again would you really be glad if i went back to the show  id go singing about the hotel great pal of mine benham a thoroughly cheery old bean and very cut up about the whole affair besides think of all the coves thrown out of workthe thingummabobs and the poor whatdyoucallems  very well  youll do it  yes  i say you really are one of the best absolutely like mother made thats fine well i think ill be saying good night  good night and thank you so much  oh no rather not  archie moved to the door  oh by the way  yes  if i were you i think i should catch the very first train you can get to new york you seeeryou ought to take percy to the vet as soon as ever you can  you really do think of everything said miss silverton  yes said archie meditatively     chapter xiv the sad case of looney biddle   archie was a simple soul and as is the case with most simple souls gratitude came easily to him he appreciated kind treatment and when on the following day lucille returned to the hermitage all smiles and affection and made no further reference to beautys eyes and the flies that got into them he was conscious of a keen desire to show some solid recognition of this magnanimity few wives he was aware could have had the nobility and what not to refrain from occasionally turning the conversation in the direction of the abovementioned topics it had not needed this behaviour on her part to convince him that lucille was a topper and a corker and one of the very best for he had been cognisant of these facts since the first moment he had met her but what he did feel was that she deserved to be rewarded in no uncertain manner and it seemed a happy coincidence to him that her birthday should be coming along in the next week or so surely felt archie he could whack up some sort of a not unjuicy gift for that occasionsomething pretty ripe that would make a substantial hit with the dear girl surely something would come along to relieve his chronic impecuniosity for just sufficient length of time to enable him to spread himself on this great occasion  and as if in direct answer to prayer an almost forgotten aunt in england suddenly out of an absolutely blue sky shot no less a sum than five hundred dollars across the ocean the present was so lavish and unexpected that archie had the awed feeling of one who participates in a miracle he felt like herbert parker that the righteous was not forsaken it was the sort of thing that restored a fellows faith in human nature for nearly a week he went about in a happy trance and when by thrift and enterprisethat is to say by betting reggie van tuyl that the new york giants would win the opening game of the series against the pittsburg baseball teamhe contrived to double his capital what it amounted to was simply that life had nothing more to offer he was actually in a position to go to a thousand dollars for lucilles birthday present he gathered in mr van tuyl of whose taste in these matters he had a high opinion and dragged him off to a jewellers on broadway  the jeweller a stout comfortable man leaned on the counter and fingered lovingly the bracelet which he had lifted out of its nest of blue plush archie leaning on the other side of the counter inspected the bracelet searchingly wishing that he knew more about these things for he had rather a sort of idea that the merchant was scheming to do him in the eyeball in a chair by his side reggie van tuyl half asleep as usual yawned despondently he had permitted archie to lug him into this shop and he wanted to buy something and go any form of sustained concentration fatigued reggie  now this said the jeweller i could do at eight hundred and fifty dollars  grab it murmured mr van tuyl  the jeweller eyed him approvingly a man after his own heart but archie looked doubtful it was all very well for reggie to tell him to grab it in that careless way reggie was a dashed millionaire and no doubt bought bracelets by the pound or the gross or what not but he himself was in an entirely different position  eight hundred and fifty dollars he said hesitating  worth it mumbled reggie van tuyl  more than worth it amended the jeweller i can assure you that it is better value than you could get anywhere on fifth avenue  yes said archie he took the bracelet and twiddled it thoughtfully well my dear old jeweller one cant say fairer than that can oneor two as the case may be he frowned oh well all right but its rummy that women are so fearfully keen on these little thingummies isnt it i mean to say cant see what they see in them stones and all that still there it is of course  there said the jeweller as you say it is sir  yes there it is  yes there it is said the jeweller fortunately for people in my line of business will you take it with you sir  archie reflected  no no not take it with me the fact is you know my wifes coming back from the country tonight and its her birthday tomorrow and the things for her and if it was popping about the place tonight she might see it and it would sort of spoil the surprise i mean to say she doesnt know im giving it her and all that  besides said reggie achieving a certain animation now that the tedious business interview was concluded going to the ballgame this afternoonmight get pocket pickedyes better have it sent  where shall i send it sir  eh oh shoot it along to mrs archibald moffam at the cosmopolis not today you know buzz it in first thing tomorrow  having completed the satisfactory deal the jeweller threw off the business manner and became chatty  so you are going to the ballgame it should be an interesting contest  reggie van tuyl nowby his own standardscompletely awake took exception to this remark  not a bit of it he said decidedly no contest cant call it a contest walkover for the pirates  archie was stung to the quick there is that about baseball which arouses enthusiasm and the partisan spirit in the unlikeliest bosoms it is almost impossible for a man to live in america and not become gripped by the game and archie had long been one of its warmest adherents he was a wholehearted supporter of the giants and his only grievance against reggie in other respects an estimable young man was that the latter whose money had been inherited from steelmills in that city had an absurd regard for the pirates of pittsburg  what absolute bally rot he exclaimed look what the giants did to them yesterday  yesterday isnt today said reggie  no itll be a jolly sight worse said archie looney biddlell be pitching for the giants today  thats just what i mean the pirates have got him rattled look what happened last time  archie understood and his generous nature chafed at the innuendo looney biddlesocalled by an affectionately admiring public as the result of certain marked eccentricitieswas beyond dispute the greatest lefthanded pitcher new york had possessed in the last decade but there was one blot on mr biddles otherwise stainless scutcheon five weeks before on the occasion of the giants invasion of pittsburg he had gone mysteriously to pieces few nativeborn partisans brought up to baseball from the cradle had been plunged into a profounder gloom on that occasion than archie but his soul revolted at the thought that that sort of thing could ever happen again  im not saying continued reggie that biddle isnt a very fair pitcher but its cruel to send him against the pirates and somebody ought to stop it his best friends should interfere once a team gets a pitcher rattled hes never any good against them again he loses his nerve  the jeweller nodded approval of this sentiment  they never come back he said sententiously  the fighting blood of the moffams was now thoroughly stirred archie eyed his friend sternly reggie was a good chapin many respects an extremely sound eggbut he must not be allowed to talk rot of this description about the greatest lefthanded pitcher of the age  it seems to me old companion he said that a small bet is indicated at this juncture how about it  dont want to take your money  you wont have to in the cool twilight of the merry old summer evening i friend of my youth and companion of my riper years shall be trousering yours  reggie yawned the day was very hot and this argument was making him feel sleepy again  well just as you like of course double or quits on yesterdays bet if that suits you  for a moment archie hesitated firm as his faith was in mr biddles stout left arm he had not intended to do the thing on quite this scale that thousand dollars of his was earmarked for lucilles birthday present and he doubted whether he ought to risk it then the thought that the honour of new york was in his hands decided him besides the risk was negligible betting on looney biddle was like betting on the probable rise of the sun in the east the thing began to seem to archie a rather unusually sound and conservative investment he remembered that the jeweller until he drew him firmly but kindly to earth and urged him to curb his exuberance and talk business on a reasonable plane had started brandishing bracelets that cost about two thousand there would be time to pop in at the shop this evening after the game and change the one he had selected for one of those nothing was too good for lucille on her birthday  righto he said make it so old friend  archie walked back to the cosmopolis no misgivings came to mar his perfect contentment he felt no qualms about separating reggie from another thousand dollars except for a little small change in the possession of the messrs rockefeller and vincent astor reggie had all the money in the world and could afford to lose he hummed a gay air as he entered the lobby and crossed to the cigarstand to buy a few cigarettes to see him through the afternoon  the girl behind the cigar counter welcomed him with a bright smile archie was popular with all the employes of the cosmopolis  s a great day mr moffam  one of the brightest and best agreed archie could you dig me out two or possibly three cigarettes of the usual description i shall want something to smoke at the ballgame  you going to the ballgame  rather wouldnt miss it for a fortune  no  absolutely no not with jolly old biddle pitching  the cigarstand girl laughed amusedly  is he pitching this afternoon say that fellers a nut dyou know him  know him well ive seen him pitch and so forth  ive got a girl friend whos engaged to him  archie looked at her with positive respect it would have been more dramatic of course if she had been engaged to the great man herself but still the mere fact that she had a girl friend in that astounding position gave her a sort of halo  no really he said i say by jove really fancy that  yes shes engaged to him all right been engaged close on a coupla months now  i say thats frightfully interesting fearfully interesting really  its funny about that guy said the cigarstand girl hes a nut the fellow who said theres plenty of room at the top must have been thinking of gus biddles head hes crazy about m girl friend y know and whenever they have a fuss it seems like he sort of flies right off the handle  goes in off the deep end eh  yes sir loses what little sense hes got why the last time him and m girl friend got to scrapping was when he was going on to pittsburg to play about a month ago hed been out with her the day he left for there and he had a grouch or something and he started making low sneaky cracks about her uncle sigsbee well m girl friends got a nice disposition but she cn get mad and she just left him flat and told him all was over and he went off to pittsburg and when he started in to pitch the opening game he just couldnt keep his mind on his job and look what them assassins done to him five runs in the first innings yessir hes a nut all right  archie was deeply concerned so this was the explanation of that mysterious disaster that weird tragedy which had puzzled the sporting press from coast to coast  good god is he often taken like that  oh hes all right when he hasnt had a fuss with m girl friend said the cigarstand girl indifferently her interest in baseball was tepid women are too often like thismere butterflies with no concern for the deeper side of life  yes but i say what i mean to say you know are they pretty pally now the good old dove of peace flapping its little wings fairly briskly and all that  oh i guess everythings nice and smooth just now i seen m girl friend yesterday and gus was taking her to the movies last night so i guess everythings nice and smooth  archie breathed a sigh of relief  took her to the movies did he stout fellow  i was at the funniest picture last week said the cigarstand girl honest it was a scream it was like this  archie listened politely then went in to get a bite of lunch his equanimity shaken by the discovery of the rift in the peerless ones armour was restored good old biddle had taken the girl to the movies last night probably he had squeezed her hand a goodish bit in the dark with what result why the fellow would be feeling like one of those chappies who used to joust for the smiles of females in the middle ages what he meant to say presumably the girl would be at the game this afternoon whooping him on and good old biddle would be so full of beans and buck that there would be no holding him  encouraged by these thoughts archie lunched with an untroubled mind luncheon concluded he proceeded to the lobby to buy back his hat and stick from the boy brigand with whom he had left them it was while he was conducting this financial operation that he observed that at the cigarstand which adjoined the coatandhat alcove his friend behind the counter had become engaged in conversation with another girl  this was a determined looking young woman in a blue dress and a large hat of a bold and flowery species archie happening to attract her attention she gave him a glance out of a pair of fine brown eyes then as if she did not think much of him turned to her companion and resumed their conversationwhich being of an essentially private and intimate nature she conducted after the manner of her kind in a ringing soprano which penetrated into every corner of the lobby archie waiting while the brigand reluctantly made change for a dollar bill was privileged to hear every word  right from the start i seen he was in a ugly mood you know how he gets dearie chewing his upper lip and looking at you as if you were so much dirt beneath his feet how was i to know hed lost fifteen dollars fiftyfive playing poker and anyway i dont see where he gets a licence to work off his grouches on me and i told him so i said to him gus i said if you cant be bright and smiling and cheerful when you take me out why do you come round at all was i wrong or right dearie  the girl behind the counter heartily endorsed her conduct once you let a man think he could use you as a doormat where were you  what happened then honey  well after that we went to the movies  archie started convulsively the change from his dollarbill leaped in his hand some of it sprang overboard and tinkled across the floor with the brigand in pursuit a monstrous suspicion had begun to take root in his mind  well we got good seats butwell you know how it is once things start going wrong you know that hat of mine the one with the daisies and cherries and the featherid taken it off and given it him to hold when we went in and what do you think that fellrd done put it on the floor and crammed it under the seat just to save himself the trouble of holding it on his lap and when i showed him i was upset all he said was that he was a pitcher and not a hatstand  archie was paralysed he paid no attention to the hatcheck boy who was trying to induce him to accept treasuretrove to the amount of fortyfive cents his whole being was concentrated on this frightful tragedy which had burst upon him like a tidal wave no possible room for doubt remained gus was the only gus in new york that mattered and this resolute and injured female before him was the girl friend in whose slim hands rested the happiness of new yorks baseball followers the destiny of the unconscious giants and the fate of his thousand dollars a strangled croak proceeded from his parched lips  well i didnt say anything at the moment it just shows how them movies can work on a girls feelings it was a bryant washburn film and somehow whenever i see him on the screen nothing else seems to matter i just get that gooey feeling and couldnt start a fight if you asked me to so we go off to have a soda and i said to him that sure was a lovely film gus and would you believe me he says straight out that he didnt think it was such a much and he thought bryant washburn was a pill a pill the girl friends penetrating voice shook with emotion  he never exclaimed the shocked cigarstand girl  he did if i die the next moment i wasnt more than halfway through my vanilla and maple but i got up without a word and left him and i aint seen a sight of him since so there you are dearie was i right or wrong  the cigarstand girl gave unqualified approval what men like gus biddle needed for the salvation of their souls was an occasional good jolt right where it would do most good  im glad you think i acted right dearie said the girl friend i guess ive been too weak with gus and hes took advantage of it i spose ill have to forgive him one of these old days but believe me it wont be for a week  the cigarstand girl was in favour of a fortnight  no said the girl friend regretfully i dont believe i could hold out that long but if i speak to him inside a week well well i gotta be going goodbye honey  the cigarstand girl turned to attend to an impatient customer and the girl friend walking with the firm and decisive steps which indicate character made for the swingdoor leading to the street and as she went the paralysis which had pipped archie released its hold still ignoring the fortyfive cents which the boy continued to proffer he leaped in her wake like a panther and came upon her just as she was stepping into a car the car was full but not too full for archie he dropped his five cents into the box and reached for a vacant strap he looked down upon the flowered hat there she was and there he was archie rested his left ear against the forearm of a long stronglybuilt young man in a grey suit who had followed him into the car and was sharing his strap and pondered     chapter xv summer storms   of course in a way the thing was simple the wheeze was in a sense straightforward and uncomplicated what he wanted to do was to point out to the injured girl all that hung on her he wished to touch her heart to plead with her to desire her to restate her waraims and to persuade herbefore three oclock when that stricken gentleman would be stepping into the pitchers box to loose off the first ball against the pittsburg piratesto let bygones be bygones and forgive augustus biddle but the blighted problem was how the deuce to find the opportunity to start he couldnt yell at the girl in a crowded streetcar and if he let go of his strap and bent over her somebody would step on his neck  the girl friend who for the first five minutes had remained entirely concealed beneath her hat now sought diversion by looking up and examining the faces of the upper strata of passengers her eye caught archies in a glance of recognition and he smiled feebly endeavouring to register bonhomie and goodwill he was surprised to see a startled expression come into her brown eyes her face turned pink at least it was pink already but it turned pinker the next moment the car having stopped to pick up more passengers she jumped off and started to hurry across the street  archie was momentarily taken aback when embarking on this business he had never intended it to become a blend of otterhunting and a movingpicture chase he followed her off the car with a sense that his grip on the affair was slipping preoccupied with these thoughts he did not perceive that the long young man who had shared his strap had alighted too his eyes were fixed on the vanishing figure of the girl friend who having buzzed at a smart pace into sixth avenue was now legging it in the direction of the staircase leading to one of the stations of the elevated railroad dashing up the stairs after her he shortly afterwards found himself suspended as before from a strap gazing upon the now familiar flowers on top of her hat from another strap farther down the carriage swayed the long young man in the grey suit  the train rattled on once or twice when it stopped the girl seemed undecided whether to leave or remain she half rose then sank back again finally she walked resolutely out of the car and archie following found himself in a part of new york strange to him the inhabitants of this district appeared to eke out a precarious existence not by taking in one anothers washing but by selling one another secondhand clothes  archie glanced at his watch he had lunched early but so crowded with emotions had been the period following lunch that he was surprised to find that the hour was only just two the discovery was a pleasant one with a full hour before the scheduled start of the game much might be achieved he hurried after the girl and came up with her just as she turned the corner into one of those forlorn new york sidestreets which are populated chiefly by children cats desultory loafers and empty meattins  the girl stopped and turned archie smiled a winning smile  i say my dear sweet creature he said i say my dear old thing one moment  is that so said the girl friend  i beg your pardon  is that so  archie began to feel certain tremors her eyes were gleaming and her determined mouth had become a perfectly straight line of scarlet it was going to be difficult to be chatty to this girl she was going to be a hard audience would mere words be able to touch her heart the thought suggested itself that properly speaking one would need to use a pickaxe  if you could spare me a couples of minutes of your valuable time  say the lady drew herself up menacingly you tie a can to yourself and disappear fade away or ill call a cop  archie was horrified at this misinterpretation of his motives one or two children playing close at hand and a loafer who was trying to keep the wall from falling down seemed pleased theirs was a colourless existence and to the rare purple moments which had enlivened it in the past the calling of a cop had been the unfailing preliminary the loafer nudged a fellowloafer sunning himself against the same wall the children abandoning the meattin round which their game had centred drew closer  my dear old soul said archie you dont understand  dont i i know your sort you trailing arbutus  no no my dear old thing believe me i wouldnt dream  are you going or arent you  eleven more children joined the ring of spectators the loafers stared silently like awakened crocodiles  but i say listen i only wanted  at this point another voice spoke  say  the word say more almost than any word in the american language is capable of a variety of shades of expression it can be genial it can be jovial it can be appealing it can also be truculent the say which at this juncture smote upon archies eardrum with a suddenness which made him leap in the air was truculent and the two loafers and twentyseven children who now formed the audience were well satisfied with the dramatic development of the performance to their experienced ears the word had the right ring  archie spun round at his elbow stood a long stronglybuilt young man in a grey suit  well said the young man nastily and he extended a large freckled face toward archies it seemed to the latter as he backed against the wall that the young mans neck must be composed of indiarubber it appeared to be growing longer every moment his face besides being freckled was a dull brickred in colour his lips curled back in an unpleasant snarl showing a gold tooth and beside him swaying in an ominous sort of way hung two clenched red hands about the size of two young legs of mutton archie eyed him with a growing apprehension there are moments in life when passing idly on our way we see a strange face look into strange eyes and with a sudden glow of human warmth say to ourselves we have found a friend this was not one of those moments the only person archie had ever seen in his life who looked less friendly was the sergeantmajor who had trained him in the early days of the war before he had got his commission  ive had my eye on you said the young man  he still had his eye on him it was a hot gimletlike eye and it pierced the recesses of archies soul he backed a little farther against the wall  archie was frankly disturbed he was no poltroon and had proved the fact on many occasions during the days when the entire german army seemed to be picking on him personally but he hated and shrank from anything in the nature of a bally public scene  what enquired the young man still bearing the burden of the conversation and shifting his left hand a little farther behind his back do you mean by following this young lady  archie was glad he had asked him this was precisely what he wanted to explain  my dear old lad he began  in spite of the fact that he had asked a question and presumably desired a reply the sound of archies voice seemed to be more than the young man could endure it deprived him of the last vestige of restraint with a rasping snarl he brought his left fist round in a sweeping semicircle in the direction of archies head  archie was no novice in the art of selfdefence since his early days at school he had learned much from leatherfaced professors of the science he had been watching this unpleasant young mans eyes with close attention and the latter could not have indicated his scheme of action more clearly if he had sent him a formal note archie saw the swing all the way he stepped nimbly aside and the fist crashed against the wall the young man fell back with a yelp of anguish  gus screamed the girl friend bounding forward  she flung her arms round the injured man who was ruefully examining a hand which always of an outsize was now swelling to still further dimensions  gus darling  a sudden chill gripped archie so engrossed had he been with his mission that it had never occurred to him that the lovelorn pitcher might have taken it into his head to follow the girl as well in the hope of putting in a word for himself yet such apparently had been the case well this had definitely torn it two loving hearts were united again in complete reconciliation but a fat lot of good that was it would be days before the misguided looney biddle would be able to pitch with a hand like that it looked like a ham already and was still swelling probably the wrist was sprained for at least a week the greatest lefthanded pitcher of his time would be about as much use to the giants in any professional capacity as a cold in the head and on that crippled hand depended the fate of all the money archie had in the world he wished now that he had not thwarted the fellows simple enthusiasm to have had his head knocked forcibly through a brick wall would not have been pleasant but the ultimate outcome would not have been as unpleasant as this with a heavy heart archie prepared to withdraw to be alone with his sorrow  at this moment however the girl friend releasing her wounded lover made a sudden dash for him with the plainest intention of blotting him from the earth  no i say really said archie bounding backwards i mean to say  in a series of events all of which had been a bit thick this in his opinion achieved the maximum of thickness it was the extreme ragged outside edge of the limit to brawl with a fellowman in a public street had been bad but to be brawled with by a girlthe shot was not on the board absolutely not on the board there was only one thing to be done it was dashed undignified no doubt for a fellow to pick up the old waukeesis and leg it in the face of the enemy but there was no other course archie started to run and as he did so one of the loafers made the mistake of gripping him by the collar of his coat  i got him observed the loaferthere is a time for all things this was essentially not the time for anyone of the male sex to grip the collar of archies coat if a syndicate of dempsey carpentier and one of the zoo gorillas had endeavoured to stay his progress at that moment they would have had reason to consider it a rash move archie wanted to be elsewhere and the blood of generations of moffams many of whom had swung a wicked axe in the freeforall mixups of the middle ages boiled within him at any attempt to revise his plans there was a good deal of the loafer but it was all soft releasing his hold when archies heel took him shrewdly on the shin he received a nasty punch in what would have been the middle of his waistcoat if he had worn one uttered a gurgling bleat like a wounded sheep and collapsed against the wall archie with a torn coat rounded the corner and sprinted down ninth avenue  the suddenness of the move gave him an initial advantage he was halfway down the first block before the vanguard of the pursuit poured out of the side street continuing to travel well he skimmed past a large dray which had pulled up across the road and moved on the noise of those who pursued was loud and clamorous in the rear but the dray hid him momentarily from their sight and it was this fact which led archie the old campaigner to take his next step  it was perfectly obvioushe was aware of this even in the novel excitement of the chasethat a chappie couldnt hoof it at twentyfive miles an hour indefinitely along a main thoroughfare of a great city without exciting remark he must take cover cover that was the wheeze he looked about him for cover  you want a nice suit  it takes a great deal to startle your commercial new yorker the small tailor standing in his doorway seemed in no way surprised at the spectacle of archie whom he had seen pass at a conventional walk some five minutes before returning like this at top speed he assumed that archie had suddenly remembered that he wanted to buy something  this was exactly what archie had done more than anything else in the world what he wanted to do now was to get into that shop and have a long talk about gents clothing pulling himself up abruptly he shot past the small tailor into the dim interior a confused aroma of cheap clothing greeted him except for a small oasis behind a grubby counter practically all the available space was occupied by suits stiff suits looking like the body when discovered by the police hung from hooks limp suits with the appearance of having swooned from exhaustion lay about on chairs and boxes the place was a cloth morgue a sargasso sea of serge  archie would not have had it otherwise in these quiet groves of clothing a regiment could have lain hid  something nifty in tweeds enquired the businesslike proprietor of this haven following him amiably into the shop or maybe yes a nice serge say mister i got a sweet thing in blue serge thatll fit you like the paper on the wall  archie wanted to talk about clothes but not yet  i say laddie he said hurriedly lend me your ear for half a jiffy outside the baying of the pack had become imminent stow me away for a moment in the undergrowth and ill buy anything you want  he withdrew into the jungle the noise outside grew in volume the pursuit had been delayed for a priceless few instants by the arrival of another dray moving northwards which had drawn level with the first dray and dexterously bottled up the fairway this obstacle had now been overcome and the original searchers their ranks swelled by a few dozen more of the leisured classes were hot on the trail again  you done a murder enquired the voice of the proprietor mildly interested filtering through a wall of cloth well boys will be boys he said philosophically see anything there that you like there some sweet things there  im inspecting them narrowly replied archie if you dont let those chappies find me i shouldnt be surprised if i bought one  one said the proprietor with a touch of austerity  two said archie quickly or possibly three or six  the proprietors cordiality returned  you cant have too many nice suits he said approvingly not a young feller like you that wants to look nice all the nice girls like a young feller that dresses nice when you go out of here in a suit i got hanging up there at the back the girls ll be all over you like flies round a honeypot  would you mind said archie would you mind as a personal favour to me old companion not mentioning that word girls  he broke off a heavy foot had crossed the threshold of the shop  say uncle said a deep voice one of those beastly voices that only the most poisonous blighters have you seen a young feller run past here  young feller the proprietor appeared to reflect do you mean a young feller in blue with a homburg hat  thats the duck we lost him where did he go  him why he come running past quick as he could go i wondered what he was running for a hot day like this he went round the corner at the bottom of the block  there was a silence  well i guess hes got away said the voice regretfully  the way he was travelling agreed the proprietor i wouldnt be surprised if he was in europe by this you want a nice suit  the other curtly expressing a wish that the proprietor would go to eternal perdition and take his entire stock with him stumped out  this said the proprietor tranquilly burrowing his way to where archie stood and exhibiting a saffroncoloured outrage which appeared to be a poor relation of the flannel family would put you back fifty dollars and cheap  fifty dollars  sixty i said i dont speak always distinct  archie regarded the distressing garment with a shuddering horror a young man with an educated taste in clothes it got right in among his nerve centres  but honestly old soul i dont want to hurt your feelings but that isnt a suit its just a regrettable incident  the proprietor turned to the door in a listening attitude  i believe i hear that feller coming back he said  archie gulped  how about trying it on he said im not sure after all it isnt fairly ripe  thats the way to talk said the proprietor cordially you try it on you cant judge a suit not a real nice suit like this by looking at it you want to put it on there he led the way to a dusty mirror at the back of the shop isnt that a bargain at seventy dollarswhy say your mother would be proud if she could see her boy now  a quarter of an hour later the proprietor lovingly kneading a little sheaf of currency bills eyed with a fond look the heap of clothes which lay on the counter  as nice a little lot as ive ever had in my shop archie did not deny this it was he thought probably only too true  i only wish i could see you walking up fifth avenue in them rhapsodised the proprietor youll give em a treat what you going to do with em carry em under your arm archie shuddered strongly well then i can send em for you anywhere you like its all the same to me wherell i send em  archie meditated the future was black enough as it was he shrank from the prospect of being confronted next day at the height of his misery with these appalling reachmedowns  an idea struck him  yes send em he said  whats the name and address  daniel brewster said archie hotel cosmopolis  it was a long time since he had given his fatherinlaw a present  archie went out into the street and began to walk pensively down a now peaceful ninth avenue out of the depths that covered him black as the pit from pole to pole no single ray of hope came to cheer him he could not like the poet thank whatever gods there be for his unconquerable soul for his soul was licked to a splinter he felt alone and friendless in a rotten world with the best intentions he had succeeded only in landing himself squarely amongst the ribstons why had he not been content with his wealth instead of risking it on that blighted bet with reggie why had he trailed the girl friend dash her he might have known that he would only make an ass of himself and because he had done so looney biddles left hand that priceless left hand before which opposing batters quailed and wilted was out of action resting in a sling careened like a damaged battleship and any chance the giants might have had of beating the pirates was gonegoneas surely as that thousand dollars which should have bought a birthday present for lucille  a birthday present for lucille he groaned in bitterness of spirit she would be coming back tonight dear girl all smiles and happiness wondering what he was going to give her tomorrow and when tomorrow dawned all he would be able to give her would be a kind smile a nice state of things a jolly situation a thoroughly good egg he did not think  it seemed to archie that nature contrary to her usual custom of indifference to human suffering was mourning with him the sky was overcast and the sun had ceased to shine there was a sort of sombreness in the afternoon which fitted in with his mood and then something splashed on his face  it says much for archies preoccupation that his first thought as after a few scattered drops as though the clouds were submitting samples for approval the whole sky suddenly began to stream like a showerbath was that this was simply an additional infliction which he was called upon to bear on top of all his other troubles he would get soaked to the skin or have to hang about in some doorway he cursed richly and sped for shelter  the rain was setting about its work in earnest the world was full of that rending swishing sound which accompanies the more violent summer storms thunder crashed and lightning flicked out of the grey heavens out in the street the raindrops bounded up off the stones like fairy fountains archie surveyed them morosely from his refuge in the entrance of a shop  and then suddenly like one of those flashes which were lighting up the gloomy sky a thought lit up his mind  by jove if this keeps up there wont be a ballgame today  with trembling fingers he pulled out his watch the hands pointed to five minutes to three a blessed vision came to him of a moist and disappointed crowd receiving rainchecks up at the polo grounds  switch it on you blighters he cried addressing the leaden clouds switch it on more and more  it was shortly before five oclock that a young man bounded into a jewellers shop near the hotel cosmopolisa young man who in spite of the fact that his coat was torn near the collar and that he oozed water from every inch of his drenched clothes appeared in the highest spirits it was only when he spoke that the jeweller recognised in the human sponge the immaculate youth who had looked in that morning to order a bracelet  i say old lad said this young man you remember that jolly little whatnot you showed me before lunch  the bracelet sir  as you observe with a manly candour which does you credit my dear old jeweller the bracelet well produce exhibit and bring it forth would you mind trot it out slip it across on a lordly dish  you wished me surely to put it aside and send it to the cosmopolis tomorrow  the young man tapped the jeweller earnestly on his substantial chest  what i wished and what i wish now are two bally separate and dashed distinct things friend of my college days never put off till tomorrow what you can do today and all that im not taking any more chances not for me for others yes but not for archibald here are the doubloons produce the jolly bracelet thanks  the jeweller counted the notes with the same unction which archie had observed earlier in the day in the proprietor of the secondhand clothesshop the process made him genial  a nasty wet day sir its been he observed chattily  archie shook his head  old friend he said youre all wrong far otherwise and not a bit like it my dear old trafficker in gems youve put your finger on the one aspect of this blighted pm that really deserves credit and respect rarely in the experience of a lifetime have i encountered a day so absolutely bally in nearly every shape and form but there was one thing that saved it and that was its merry old wetness toodleoo laddie  good evening sir said the jeweller     chapter xvi archie accepts a situation   lucille moved her wrist slowly round the better to examine the new bracelet  you really are an angel angel she murmured  like it said archie complacently  like it why its gorgeous it must have cost a fortune  oh nothing to speak of just a few hardearned pieces of eight just a few doubloons from the old oak chest  but i didnt know there were any doubloons in the old oak chest  well as a matter of fact admitted archie at one point in the proceedings there werent but an aunt of mine in englandpeace be on her headhappened to send me a chunk of the necessary at what you might call the psychological moment  and you spent it all on a birthday present for me archie lucille gazed at her husband adoringly archie do you know what i think  what  youre the perfect man  no really what ho  yes said lucille firmly ive long suspected it and now i know i dont think theres anybody like you in the world  archie patted her hand  its a rummy thing he observed but your father said almost exactly that to me only yesterday only i dont fancy he meant the same as you to be absolutely frank his exact expression was that he thanked god there was only one of me  a troubled look came into lucilles grey eyes  its a shame about father i do wish he appreciated you but you mustnt be too hard on him  me said archie hard on your father well dash it all i dont think i treat him with what you might call actual brutality what i mean to say my whole idea is rather to keep out of the old lads way and curl up in a ball if i cant dodge him id just as soon be hard on a stampeding elephant i wouldnt for the world say anything derogatory as it were to your jolly old pater but there is no getting away from the fact that hes by way of being one of our leading maneating fishes it would be idle to deny that he considers that you let down the proud old name of brewster a bit when you brought me in and laid me on the mat  anyone would be lucky to get you for a soninlaw precious  i fear me light of my life the dad doesnt see eye to eye with you on that point no every time i get hold of a daisy i give him another chance but it always works out at he loves me not  you must make allowances for him darling  righto but i hope devoutly that he doesnt catch me at it ive a sort of idea that if the old dad discovered that i was making allowances for him he would have from ten to fifteen fits  hes worried just now you know  i didnt know he doesnt confide in me much  hes worried about that waiter  what waiter queen of my soul  a man called salvatore father dismissed him some time ago  salvatore  probably you dont remember him he used to wait on this table  why  and father dismissed him apparently and now theres all sorts of trouble you see father wants to build this new hotel of his and he thought hed got the site and everything and could start building right away and now he finds that this man salvatores mother owns a little newspaper and tobacco shop right in the middle of the site and theres no way of getting him out without buying the shop and he wont sell at least hes made his mother promise that she wont sell  a boys best friend is his mother said archie approvingly i had a sort of idea all along  so fathers in despair  archie drew at his cigarette meditatively  i remember a chappiea policeman he was as a matter of fact and incidentally a fairly pronounced blighterremarking to me some time ago that you could trample on the poor mans face but you mustnt be surprised if he bit you in the leg while you were doing it apparently this is what has happened to the old dad i had a sort of idea all along that old friend salvatore would come out strong in the end if you only gave him time brainy sort of feller great pal of minelucilles small face lightened she gazed at archie with proud affection she felt that she ought to have known that he was the one to solve this difficulty  youre wonderful darling is he really a friend of yours  absolutely manys the time he and i have chatted in this very grillroom  then its all right if you went to him and argued with him he would agree to sell the shop and father would be happy think how grateful father would be to you it would make all the difference  archie turned this over in his mind  something in that he agreed  it would make him see what a pet lambkin you really are  well said archie im bound to say that any scheme which what you might call culminates in your father regarding me as a pet lambkin ought to receive ones best attention how much did he offer salvatore for his shop  i dont know there is fathercall him over and ask him  archie glanced over to where mr brewster had sunk moodily into a chair at a neighbouring table it was plain even at that distance that daniel brewster had his troubles and was bearing them with an ill grace he was scowling absently at the tablecloth  you call him said archie having inspected his formidable relative you know him better  lets go over to him  they crossed the room lucille sat down opposite her fatherarchie draped himself over a chair in the background  father dear said lucille archie has got an idea  archie said mr brewster incredulously  this is me said archie indicating himself with a spoon the tall distinguishedlooking bird  what new foolthing is he up to now  its a splendid idea father he wants to help you over your new hotel  wants to run it for me i suppose  by jove said archie reflectively thats not a bad scheme i never thought of running an hotel i shouldnt mind taking a stab at it  he has thought of a way of getting rid of salvatore and his shop  for the first time mr brewsters interest in the conversation seemed to stir he looked sharply at his soninlaw  he has has he he said  archie balanced a roll on a fork and inserted a plate underneath the roll bounded away into a corner  sorry said archie my fault absolutely i owe you a roll ill sign a bill for it oh about this sportsman salvatore well its like this you know he and i are great pals ive known him for years and years at least it seems like years and years lu was suggesting that i seek him out in his lair and ensnare him with my diplomatic manner and superior brain power and what not  it was your idea precious said lucille  mr brewster was silentmuch as it went against the grain to have to admit it there seemed to be something in this  what do you propose to do  become a jolly old ambassador how much did you offer the chappie  three thousand dollars twice as much as the place is worth hes holding out on me for revenge  ah but how did you offer it to him what i mean to say i bet you got your lawyer to write him a letter full of whereases peradventures and parties of the first part and so forth no good old companion  dont call me old companion  all wrong laddie nothing like it dear heart no good at all friend of my youth take it from your uncle archibald im a student of human nature and i know a thing or two  thats not much growled mr brewster who was finding his soninlaws superior manner a little trying  now dont interrupt father said lucille severely cant you see that archie is going to be tremendously clever in a minute  hes got to show me  what you ought to do said archie is to let me go and see him taking the stuff in crackling bills ill roll them about on the table in front of him thatll fetch him he prodded mr brewster encouragingly with a roll ill tell you what to do give me three thousand of the best and crispest and ill undertake to buy that shop it cant fail laddie  dont call me laddie mr brewster pondered very well he said at last i didnt know you had so much sense he added grudgingly  oh positively said archie beneath a rugged exterior i hide a brain like a buzzsaw sense i exude it laddie i drip with it  there were moments during the ensuing days when mr brewster permitted himself to hope but more frequent were the moments when he told himself that a pronounced chump like his soninlaw could not fail somehow to make a mess of the negotiations his relief therefore when archie curveted into his private room and announced that he had succeeded was great  you really managed to make that wop sell out  archie brushed some papers off the desk with a careless gesture and seated himself on the vacant spot  absolutely i spoke to him as one old friend to another sprayed the bills all over the place and he sang a few bars from rigoletto and signed on the dotted line  youre not such a fool as you look owned mr brewster  archie scratched a match on the desk and lit a cigarette  its a jolly little shop he said i took quite a fancy to it full of newspapers dont you know and cheap novels and some weirdlooking sort of chocolates and cigars with the most fearfully attractive labels i think ill make a success of it its bang in the middle of a dashed good neighbourhood one of these days somebody will be building a big hotel round about there and thatll help trade a lot i look forward to ending my days on the other side of the counter with a full set of white whiskers and a skullcap beloved by everybody everybodyll say oh you must patronise that quaint delightful old blighter hes quite a character  mr brewsters air of grim satisfaction had given way to a look of discomfort almost of alarm he presumed his soninlaw was merely indulging in badinage but even so his words were not soothing  well im much obliged he said that infernal shop was holding up everything now i can start building right away  archie raised his eyebrows  but my dear old top im sorry to spoil your daydreams and stop you chasing rainbows and all that but arent you forgetting that the shop belongs to me i dont at all know that i want to sell either  i gave you the money to buy that shop  and dashed generous of you it was too admitted archie unreservedly it was the first money you ever gave me and i shall always tell interviewers that it was you who founded my fortunes some day when im the newspaperandtobaccoshop king ill tell the world all about it in my autobiography  mr brewster rose dangerously from his seat  do you think you can hold me up youyou worm  well said archie the way i look at it is this ever since we met youve been after me to become one of the worlds workers and earn a living for myself and what not and now i see a way to repay you for your confidence and encouragement youll look me up sometimes at the good old shop wont you he slid off the table and moved towards the door there wont be any formalities where you are concerned you can sign bills for any reasonable amount any time you want a cigar or a stick of chocolate well toodleoo  stop  now what  how much do you want for that damned shop  i dont want moneyi want a jobif you are going to take my lifework away from me you ought to give me something else to do  what job  you suggested it yourself the other day i want to manage your new hotel  dont be a fool what do you know about managing an hotel  nothing it will be your pleasing task to teach me the business while the shanty is being run up  there was a pause while mr brewster chewed three inches off a penholder  very well he said at last  topping said archie i knew youd see it ill study your methods what adding some of my own of course you know ive thought of one improvement on the cosmopolis already  improvement on the cosmopolis cried mr brewster gashed in his finest feelings  yes theres one point where the old cosmop slips up badly and im going to see that its corrected at my little shack customers will be entreated to leave their boots outside their doors at night and theyll find them cleaned in the morning well pip pip i must be popping time is money you know with us business men     chapter xvii brother bills romance   her eyes said bill brewster are likelikewhats the word i want  he looked across at lucille and archie lucille was leaning forward with an eager and interested face archie was leaning back with his fingertips together and his eyes closed this was not the first time since their meeting in beales auction rooms that his brotherinlaw had touched on the subject of the girl he had become engaged to marry during his trip to england indeed brother bill had touched on very little else and archie though of a sympathetic nature and fond of his young relative was beginning to feel that he had heard all he wished to hear about mabel winchester lucille on the other hand was absorbed her brothers recital had thrilled her  like said bill like  stars suggested lucille  stars said bill gratefully exactly the word twin stars shining in a clear sky on a summer night her teeth are likewhat shall i say  pearls  pearls and her hair is a lovely brown like leaves in autumn in fact concluded bill slipping down from the heights with something of a jerk shes a corker isnt she archie  archie opened his eyes  quite right old top he said it was the only thing to do  what the devil are you talking about demanded bill coldly he had been suspicious all along of archies statement that he could listen better with his eyes shut  eh oh sorry thinking of something else  you were asleep  no no positively and distinctly not frightfully interested and rapt and all that only i didnt quite get what you said  i said that mabel was a corker  oh absolutely in every respect  there bill turned to lucille triumphantly you hear that and archie has only seen her photograph wait till he sees her in the flesh  my dear old chap said archie shocked ladies present i mean to say what  im afraid that father will be the one youll find it hard to convince  yes admitted her brother gloomily  your mabel sounds perfectly charming butwell you know what father is it is a pity she sings in the chorus  shehasnt much of a voiceargued billin extenuation  all the same  archie the conversation having reached a topic on which he considered himself one of the greatest living authoritiesto wit the unlovable disposition of his fatherinlawaddressed the meeting as one who has a right to be heard  lucilles absolutely right old thingabsolutely correcto your esteemed progenitor is a pretty tough nut and its no good trying to get away from itand im sorry to have to say it old bird but if you come bounding in with part of the personnel of the ensemble on your arm and try to dig a fathers blessing out of him hes extremely apt to stab you in the gizzard  i wish said bill annoyed you wouldnt talk as though mabel were the ordinary kind of chorusgirl shes only on the stage because her mothers hardup and she wants to educate her little brother  i say said archie concerned take my tip old top in chatting the matter over with the pater dont dwell too much on that aspect of the affairive been watching him closely and its about all he can stick having to support me if you ring in a mother and a little brother on him hell crack under the strain  well ive got to do something about it mabel will be over here in a week  great scot you never told us that  yes shes going to be in the new billington show and naturally she will expect to meet my family ive told her all about you  did you explain father to her asked lucille  well i just said she mustnt mind him as his bark was worse than his bite  well said archie thoughtfully he hasnt bitten me yet so you may be right but youve got to admit that hes a bit of a barker  lucille considered  really bill i think your best plan would be to go straight to father and tell him the whole thingyou dont want him to hear about it in a roundabout way  the trouble is that whenever im with father i cant think of anything to say  archie found himself envying his fatherinlaw this merciful dispensation of providence for where he himself was concerned there had been no lack of eloquence on bills part in the brief period in which he had known him bill had talked all the time and always on the one topic as unpromising a subject as the tariff laws was easily diverted by him into a discussion of the absent mabel  when im with father said bill i sort of lose my nerve and yammer  dashed awkward said archie politely he sat up suddenly i say by jove i know what you want old friend just thought of it  that busy brain is never still explained lucille  saw it in the paper this morning an advertisement of a book dont you know  ive no time for reading  youve time for reading this one laddie for you cant afford to miss it its a whatdyoucallit book what i mean to say is if you read it and take its tips to heart it guarantees to make you a convincing talker the advertisement says so the advertisements all about a chappie whose name i forget whom everybody loved because he talked so well and mark you before he got hold of this bookthe personality that wins was the name of it if i remember rightlyhe was known to all the lads in the office as silent samuel or something or it may have been tonguetied thomas well one day he happened by good luck to blow in the necessary for the good old p that ws and now whenever they want someone to go and talk rockefeller or someone into lending them a million or so they send for samuel only now they call him sammy the spellbinder and fawn upon him pretty copiously and all that how about it old son how do we go  what perfect nonsense said lucille  i dont know said bill plainly impressed there might be something in it  absolutely said archie i remember it said talk convincingly and no man will ever treat you with cold unresponsive indifference well cold unresponsive indifference is just what you dont want the pater to treat you with isnt it or is it or isnt it what i mean what  it sounds all right said bill  it is all right said archie its a scheme ill go farther its an egg  the idea i had said bill was to see if i couldnt get mabel a job in some straight comedy that would take the curse off the thing a bit then i wouldnt have to dwell on the chorus end of the business you see  much more sensible said lucille  but what adeuce of a sweatargued archie i mean to say having to pop round and nose about and all that  arent you willing to take a little trouble for your stricken brotherinlaw worm said lucille severely  oh absolutely my idea was to get this book and coach the dear old chap rehearse him dont you know he could bone up the early chapters a bit and then drift round and try his convincing talk on me  it might be a good idea said bill reflectively  well ill tell you what im going to do said lucille im going to get bill to introduce me to his mabel and if shes as nice as he says she is ill go to father and talk convincingly to him  youre an ace said bill  absolutely agreed archie cordially my partner what all the same we ought to keep the book as a second string you know i mean to say you are a young and delicately nurtured girlfull of sensibility and shrinking whatsitsname and all thatand you know what the jolly old pater is he might bark at you and put you out of action in the first round well then if anything like that happened dont you see we could unleash old bill the trained silvertongued expert and let him have a shot personally im all for the p that wsme too said bill  lucille looked at her watch  good gracious its nearly one oclock  no archie heaved himself up from his chair well its a shame to break up this feast of reason and flow of soul and all that but if we dont leg it with some speed we shall be late  were lunching at the nicholsons explained lucille to her brother i wish you were coming too  lunch bill shook his head with a kind of tolerant scorn lunch means nothing to me these days ive other things to think of besides food he looked as spiritual as his rugged features would permit i havent written to her yet today  but dash it old scream if shes going to be over here in a week whats the good of writing the letter would cross her  im not mailing my letters to england said bill im keeping them for her to read when she arrives  my sainted aunt said archie  devotion like this was something beyond his outlook     chapter xviii the sausage chappie   the personality that wins cost archie two dollars in cash and a lot of embarrassment when he asked for it at the store to buy a treatise of that name would automatically seem to argue that you havent a winning personality already and archie was at some pains to explain to the girl behind the counter that he wanted it for a friend the girl seemed more interested in his english accent than in his explanation and archie was uncomfortably aware as he receded that she was practising it in an undertone for the benefit of her colleagues and fellowworkers however what is a little discomfort if endured in friendships name  he was proceeding up broadway after leaving the store when he encountered reggie van tuyl who was drifting along in somnambulistic fashion near thirtyninth street  hullo reggie old thing said archie  hullo said reggie a man of few words  ive just been buying a book for bill brewster went on archie it appears that old billwhats the matter  he broke off his recital abruptly a sort of spasm had passed across his companions features the hand holding archies arm had tightened convulsively one would have said that reginald had received a shock  its nothing said reggie im all right now i caught sight of that fellows clothes rather suddenly they shook me a bit im all right now he said bravely  archie following his friends gaze understood reggie van tuyl was never at his strongest in the morning and he had a sensitive eye for clothes he had been known to resign from clubs because members exceeded the bounds in the matter of soft shirts with dinnerjackets and the short thickset man who was standing just in front of them in attitude of restful immobility was certainly no dandy his best friend could not have called him dapper take him for all in all and on the hoof he might have been posing as a model for a sketch of what the welldressed man should not wear  in costume as in most other things it is best to take a definite line and stick to it this man had obviously vacillated his neck was swathed in a green scarf he wore an eveningdress coat and his lower limbs were draped in a pair of tweed trousers built for a larger man to the north he was bounded by a straw hat to the south by brown shoes  archie surveyed the mans back carefully  bit thick he said sympathetically but of course broadway isnt fifth avenue what i mean to say is bohemian licence and what not broadways crammed with deuced brainy devils who dont care how they look probably this bird is a mastermind of some species  all the same mans no right to wear eveningdress coat with tweed trousers  absolutely not i see what you mean  at this point the sartorial offender turned seen from the front he was even more unnerving he appeared to possess no shirt though this defect was offset by the fact that the tweed trousers fitted snugly under the arms he was not a handsome man at his best he could never have been that and in the recent past he had managed to acquire a scar that ran from the corner of his mouth halfway across his cheek even when his face was in repose he had an odd expression and when as he chanced to do now he smiled odd became a mild adjective quite inadequate for purposes of description it was not an unpleasant face however unquestionably genial indeed there was something in it that had a quality of humorous appeal  archie started he stared at the man memory stirred  great scot he cried its the sausage chappie  reginald van tuyl gave a little moan he was not used to this sort of thing a sensitive young man as regarded scenes archies behaviour unmanned him for archie releasing his arm had bounded forward and was shaking the others hand warmly  well well well my dear old chap you must remember me what no yes  the man with the scar seemed puzzled he shuffled the brown shoes patted the straw hat and eyed archie questioningly  i dont seem to place you he said  archie slapped the back of the eveningdress coat he linked his arm affectionately with that of the dressreformer  we met outside st mihiel in the war you gave me a bit of sausage one of the most sporting events in history nobody but a real sportsman would have parted with a bit of sausage at that moment to a stranger never forgotten it by jove saved my life absolutely hadnt chewed a morse for eight hours well have you got anything on i mean to say you arent booked for lunch or any rot of that species are you fine then i move we all toddle off and get a bite somewhere he squeezed the others arm fondly fancy meeting you again like this ive often wondered what became of you but by jove i was forgetting dashed rude of me my friend mr van tuyl  reggie gulped the longer he looked at it the harder this mans costume was to bear his eye passed shudderingly from the brown shoes to the tweed trousers to the green scarf from the green scarf to the straw hat  sorry he mumbled just remembered important date late already ersee you some time  he melted away a broken man archie was not sorry to see him go reggie was a good chap but he would undoubtedly have been de trop at this reunion  i vote we go to the cosmopolis he said steering his newlyfound friend through the crowd the browsing and sluicing isnt bad there and i can sign the bill which is no small consideration nowadays  the sausage chappie chuckled amusedly  i cant go to a place like the cosmopolis looking like this  archie was a little embarrassed  oh i dont know you know dont you know he said still since you have brought the topic up you did get the good old wardrobe a bit mixed this morning what i mean to say you seem absentmindedly as it were to have got hold of samples from a good number of your various suitings  suitings how do you mean suitings i havent any suitings who do you think i am vincent astor all i have is what i stand up in  archie was shocked this tragedy touched him he himself had never had any money in his life but somehow he had always seemed to manage to have plenty of clothes how this was he could not say he had always had a vague sort of idea that tailors were kindly birds who never failed to have a pair of trousers or something up their sleeve to present to the deserving there was the drawback of course that once they had given you things they were apt to write you rather a lot of letters about it but you soon managed to recognise their handwriting and then it was a simple task to extract their communications from your morning mail and drop them in the wastepaper basket this was the first case he had encountered of a man who was really short of clothes  my dear old lad he said briskly this must be remedied oh positively this must be remedied at once i suppose my things wouldnt fit you no well i tell you what well wangle something from my fatherinlaw old brewster you know the fellow who runs the cosmopolis hisll fit you like the paper on the wall because hes a tubby little blighter too what i mean to say is hes also one of those sturdy square finelooking chappies of about the middle height by the way where are you stopping these days  nowhere just at present i thought of taking one of those selfcontained park benches  are you broke  am i  archie was concerned  you ought to get a job  i ought but somehow i dont seem able to  what did you do before the war  ive forgotten  forgotten  forgotten  how do you meanforgotten you cant meanforgotten  yes its quite gone  but i mean to say you cant have forgotten a thing like that  cant i ive forgotten all sorts of things where i was born how old i am whether im married or single what my name is  well im dashed said archie staggered but you remembered about giving me a bit of sausage outside st mihiel  no i didnt im taking your word for it for all i know you may be luring me into some den to rob me of my straw hat i dont know you from adam but i like your conversationespecially the part about eatingand im taking a chance  archie was concerned  listen old bean make an effort you must remember that sausage episode it was just outside st mihiel about five in the evening your little lot were lying next to my little lot and we happened to meet and i said what ho and you said halloa and i said what ho what ho and you said have a bit of sausage and i said what ho what ho what ho  the dialogue seems to have been darned sparkling but i dont remember it it must have been after that that i stopped one i dont seem quite to have caught up with myself since i got hit  oh thats how you got that scar  no i got that jumping through a plateglass window in london on armistice night  what on earth did you do that for  oh i dont know it seemed a good idea at the time  but if you can remember a thing like that why cant you remember your name  i remember everything that happened after i came out of hospital its the part before thats gone  archie patted him on the shoulder  i know just what you want you need a bit of quiet and repose to think things over and so forth you mustnt go sleeping on park benches wont do at all not a bit like it you must shift to the cosmopolis it isnt half a bad spot the old cosmop i didnt like it much the first night i was there because there was a dashed tap that went dripdripdrip all night and kept me awake but the place has its points  is the cosmopolis giving free board and lodging these days  rather thatll be all right well this is the spot well start by trickling up to the old boys suite and looking over his reachmedowns i know the waiter on his floor a very sound chappie hell let us in with his passkey  and so it came about that mr daniel brewster returning to his suite in the middle of lunch in order to find a paper dealing with the subject he was discussing with his guest the architect of his new hotel was aware of a murmur of voices behind the closed door of his bedroom recognising the accents of his soninlaw he breathed an oath and charged in he objected to archie wandering at large about his suite  the sight that met his eyes when he opened the door did nothing to soothe him the floor was a sea of clothes there were coats on the chairs trousers on the bed shirts on the bookshelf and in the middle of his welter stood archie with a man who to mr brewsters heated eye looked like a tramp comedian out of a burlesque show  great godfrey ejaculated mr brewster  archie looked up with a friendly smile  oh halloahalloa he said affably we were just glancing through your spare scenery to see if we couldnt find something for my pal here this is mr brewster my fatherinlaw old man  archie scanned his relatives twisted features something in his expression seemed not altogether encouraging he decided that the negotiations had better be conducted in private one moment old lad he said to his new friend i just want to have a little talk with my fatherinlaw in the other room just a little friendly business chat you stay here  in the other room mr brewster turned on archie like a wounded lion of the desert  what the  archie secured one of his coatbuttons and began to massage it affectionately  ought to have explained said archie only didnt want to interrupt your lunch the sportsman on the horizon is a dear old pal of mine  mr brewster wrenched himself free  what the devil do you mean you worm by bringing tramps into my bedroom and messing about with my clothes  thats just what im trying to explain if youll only listen this bird is a bird i met in france during the war he gave me a bit of sausage outside st mihiel  damn you and him and the sausage  absolutely but listen he cant remember who he is or where he was born or what his name is and hes broke so dash it i must look after him you see he gave me a bit of sausage  mr brewsters frenzy gave way to an ominous calm  ill give him two seconds to clear out of here if he isnt gone by then ill have him thrown out  archie was shocked  you dont mean that  i do mean that  but where is he to go  outside  but you dont understand this chappie has lost his memory because he was wounded in the war keep that fact firmly fixed in the old bean he fought for you fought and bled for you bled profusely by jove and he saved my life  if id got nothing else against him that would be enough  but you cant sling a chappie out into the cold hard world who bled in gallons to make the world safe for the hotel cosmopolis  mr brewster looked ostentatiously at his watch  two seconds he said  there was a silence archie appeared to be thinking righto he said at last no need to get the wind up i know where he can go its just occurred to me ill put him up at my little shop  the purple ebbed from mr brewsters face such was his emotion that he had forgotten that infernal shop he sat down there was more silence  oh gosh said mr brewster  i knew you would be reasonable about it said archie approvingly now honestly as man to man how do we go  what do you want me to do growled mr brewster  i thought you might put the chappie up for a while and give him a chance to look round and nose about a bit  i absolutely refuse to give any more loafers free board and lodging  any more  well he would be the second wouldnt he  archie looked pained  its true he said that when i first came here i was temporarily resting so to speak but didnt i go right out and grab the managership of your new hotel positively  i will not adopt this tramp  well find him a job then  what sort of a job  oh any old sort  he can be a waiter if he likes  all right ill put the matter before him  he returned to the bedroom the sausage chappie was gazing fondly into the mirror with a spotted tie draped round his neck  i say old top said archie apologetically the emperor of the blighters out yonder says you can have a job here as waiter and he wont do another dashed thing for you how about it  do waiters eat  i suppose so though by jove come to think of it ive never seen one at it  thats good enough for me said the sausage chappie when do i begin     chapter xix reggie comes to life   the advantage of having plenty of time on ones hands is that one has leisure to attend to the affairs of all ones circle of friends and archie assiduously as he watched over the destinies of the sausage chappie did not neglect the romantic needs of his brotherinlaw bill a few days later lucille returning one morning to their mutual suite found her husband seated in an upright chair at the table an unusually stern expression on his amiable face a large cigar was in the corner of his mouth the fingers of one hand rested in the armhole of his waistcoat with the other hand he tapped menacingly on the table  as she gazed upon him wondering what could be the matter with him lucille was suddenly aware of bills presence he had emerged sharply from the bedroom and was walking briskly across the floor he came to a halt in front of the table  father said bill  archie looked up sharply frowning heavily over his cigar  well my boy he said in a strange rasping voice what is it speak up my boy speak up why the devil cant you speak up this is my busy day  what on earth are you doing asked lucille  archie waved her away with the large gesture of a man of blood and iron interrupted while concentrating  leave us woman we would be alone retire into the jolly old background and amuse yourself for a bit read a book do acrostics charge ahead laddie  father said bill again  yes my boy yes what is it  father  archie picked up the redcovered volume that lay on the table  half a mo old son sorry to stop you but i knew there was something ive just remembered your walk all wrong  all wrong  all wrong wheres the chapter on the art of walking here we are listen dear old soul drink this in in walking one should strive to acquire that swinging easy movement from the hips the correctlypoised walker seems to float along as it were now old bean you didnt float a dam bit you just galloped in like a chappie charging into a railway restaurant for a bowl of soup when his train leaves in two minutes dashed important this walking business you know get started wrong and where are you try it again much better he turned to lucille notice him float along that time absolutely skimmed what  lucille had taken a seatand was waiting for enlightenment  are you and bill going into vaudeville she asked  archie scrutinisinghisbrotherinlaw closely had further criticism to make  the man of selfrespect and selfconfidence he read stands erect in an easy natural graceful attitude heels not too far apart head erect eyes to the front with a level gazeget your gaze level old thingshoulders thrown back arms hanging naturally at the sides when not otherwise employedthat means that if he tries to hit you its all right to guardchest expanded naturally and abdomenthis is no place for you lucille leg it out of earshotabwhat i said beforedrawn in somewhat and above all not protruded now have you got all that yes you look all right carry on laddie carry on lets have twopennorth of the dynamic voice and the tone of authoritysome of the full rich round stuff we hear so much about  bill fastened a gimlet eye upon his brotherinlaw and drew a deep breath  father he said father  youll have to brighten up bills dialogue a lot said lucille critically or you will never get bookings  father  i mean its all right as far as it goes but its sort of monotonous besides one of you ought to be asking questions and the other answering mill ought to be saying who was that lady i saw you coming down the street with so that you would be able to say that wasnt a lady that was my wife i know ive been to lots of vaudeville shows  bill relaxed his attitude he deflated his chest spread his heels and ceased to draw in his abdomen  wed better try this another time when were alone he said frigidly i cant do myself justice  why do you want to do yourself justice asked lucille  righto said archie affably casting off his forbidding expression like a garment rehearsal postponed i was just putting old bill through it he explained with a view to getting him into midseason form for the jolly old pater  oh lucilles voice was the voice of one who sees light in darkness when bill walked in like a cat on hot bricks and stood there looking stuffed that was just the personality that wins  that was it  well you couldnt blame me for not recognising it could you  archie patted her head paternally  a little less of the caustic critic stuff he said bill will be all right on the night if you hadnt come in then and put him off his stroke hed have shot out some amazing stuff full of authority and dynamic accents and what not i tell you light of my soul old bill is all right hes got the winning personality up a tree ready whenever he wants to go and get it speaking as his backer and trainer i think hell twist your father round his little finger absolutely it wouldnt surprise me if at the end of five minutes the good old dad started pumping through hoops and sitting up for lumps of sugar  it would surprise me  ah thats because you havent seen old bill in action you crabbed his act before he had begun to spread himself  it isnt that at all the reason why i think that bill however winning his personality may be wont persuade father to let him marry a girl in the chorus is something that happened last night  last night  well at three oclock this morning its on the front page of the early editions of the evening papers i brought one in for you to see only you were so busy look there it is  archie seized the paper  oh great scot  what is it asked bill irritably dont stand goggling there what the devil is it  listen to this old thing                          revelry by night                 spirited battle royal at hotel                          cosmopolis              the hotel detective had a good heart                  but pauline packed the punch   the

action as well as words proceeded to gather up an armful of assorted guests as a preliminary to a personallyconducted tour onto the cold night it was at this point that miss preston stepped into the limelight mr oneill contends that she hit him with a brick an iron casing and the singer building be that as it may her efforts were sufficiently able to induce him to retire for reinforcements which arriving arrested the supperparty regardless of age or sex  at the policecourt this morning miss preston maintained that she and her friends were merely having a quiet homeevening and that mr oneill was no gentleman the male guests gave their names respectively as woodrow wilson david lloydgeorge and william j bryan these however are believed to be incorrect but the moral is if you want excitement rather than sleep stay at the hotel cosmopolis  bill may have quaked inwardly as he listened to this epic but outwardly he was unmoved  well he said what about it  what about it said lucille  what about it said archie why my dear old friend it simply means that all the time weve been putting in making your personality winning has been chucked away absolutely a dead loss we might just as well have read a manual on how to knit sweaters  i dont see it maintained bill stoutly  lucille turned apologetically to her husband  you mustnt judge me by him archie darling this sort of thing doesnt run in the familywe are supposed to be rather bright on the whole but poor bill was dropped by his nurse when he was a baby and fell on his head  i suppose what youre driving at said the goaded bill is that what has happened will make father pretty sore against girls who happen to be in the chorus  thats absolutely it old thing im sorry to say the next person who mentions the word chorusgirl in the jolly old governors presence is going to take his life in his hands i tell you as one man to another that id much rather be back in france hopping over the top than do it myself  what darned nonsense mabel may be in the chorus but she isnt like those girls  poor old bill said lucille im awfully sorry but its no use not facing facts you know perfectly well that the reputation of the hotel is the thing father cares more about than anything else in the world and that this is going to make him furious with all the chorusgirls in creation its no good trying to explain to him that your mabel is in the chorus but not of the chorus so to speak  deuced well put said archie approvingly youre absolutely right a chorusgirl by the rivers brim so to speak a simple chorusgirl is to him as it were and she is nothing more if you know what i mean  so now said lucille having shown you that the imbecile scheme which you concocted with my poor wellmeaning husband is no good at all i will bring you words of cheer your own original planof getting your mabel a part in a comedywas always the best one and you can do it i wouldnt have broken the bad news so abruptly if i hadnt had some consolation to give you afterwards i met reggie van tuyl just now wandering about as if the cares of the world were on his shoulders and he told me that he was putting up most of the money for a new play thats going into rehearsal right away reggies an old friend of yours all you have to do is to go to him and ask him to use his influence to get your mabel a small part theres sure to be a maid or something with only a line or two that wont matter  a ripe scheme said archie very sound and fruity  the cloud did not lift from bills corrugated brow  thats all very well he said but you know what a talker reggie is hes an obliging sort of chump but his tongues fastened on at the middle and waggles at both ends i dont want the whole of new york to know about my engagement and have somebody spilling the news to father before im ready  thats all right said lucille archie can speak to him theres no need for him to mention your name at all he can just say theres a girl he wants to get a part for you would do it wouldnt you angelface  like a bird queen of my soul  then thats splendid youd better give archie that photograph of mabel to give to reggie bill  photograph said bill which photograph i have twentyfour  archie found reggie van tuyl brooding in a window of his club that looked over fifth avenue reggie was a rather melancholy young man who suffered from elephantiasis of the bankroll and the other evils that arise from that complaint gentle and sentimental by nature his sensibilities had been much wounded by contact with a sordid world and the thing that had first endeared archie to him was the fact that the latter though chronically hardup had never made any attempt to borrow money from him reggie would have parted with it on demand but it had delighted him to find that archie seemed to take a pleasure in his society without having any ulterior motives he was fond of archie and also of lucille and their happy marriage was a constant source of gratification to him  for reggie was a sentimentalist he would have liked to live in a world of ideally united couples himself ideally united to some charming and affectionate girl but as a matter of cold fact he was a bachelor and most of the couples he knew were veterans of several divorces in reggies circle therefore the homelife of archie and lucille shone like a good deed in a naughty world it inspired him in moments of depression it restored his waning faith in human nature  consequently when archie having greeted him and slipped into a chair at his side suddenly produced from his inside pocket the photograph of an extremely pretty girl and asked him to get her a small part in the play which he was financing he was shocked and disappointed he was in a more than usually sentimental mood that afternoon and had indeed at the moment of archies arrival been dreaming wistfully of soft arms clasped snugly about his collar and the patter of little feet and all that sort of thinghe gazed reproachfully at archie  archie his voice quivered with emotion is it worth it is it worth it old manthink of the poor little woman at home  archie was puzzled  eh old top which poor little woman  think of her trust in you her faith  i dont absolutely get you old bean  what would lucille say if she knew about this  oh she does she knows all about it  good heavens cried reggiehe was shocked to the core of his beingone of the articles of his faith was that the union of lucille and archie was different from those loose partnerships which were the custom in his worldhe had not been conscious of such a poignant feeling that the foundations of the universe were cracked and tottering and that there was no light and sweetness in life since the morning eighteen months back when a negligent valet had sent him out into fifth avenue with only one spat on  it was lucilles idea explained archie he was about to mention his brotherinlaws connection with the matter but checked himself in time remembering bills specific objection to having his secret revealed to reggie its like this old thing ive never met this female but shes a pal of lucilleshe comforted his conscience by the reflection that if she wasnt now she would be in a few daysand lucille wants to do her a bit of good shes been on the stage in england you know supporting a jolly old widowed mother and educating a little brother and all that kind and species of rot you understand and now shes coming over to america and lucille wants you to rally round and shove her into your show and generally keep the home fires burning and so forth how do we go  reggie beamed with relief he felt just as he had felt on that other occasion at the moment when a taxicab had rolled up and enabled him to hide his spatless leg from the public gaze  oh i see he said why delighted old man quite delighted  any small part would do isnt there a maid or something in your bobsworth of refined entertainment who drifts about saying yes madam and all that sort of thing well then thats just the thing topping i knew i could rely on you old bird ill get lucille to ship her round to your address when she arrives i fancy shes due to totter in somewhere in the next few days well i must be popping toodleoo  pippip said reggie   it was about a week later that lucille came into the suite at the hotel cosmopolis that was her home and found archie lying on the couch smoking a refreshing pipe after the labours of the day it seemed to archie that his wife was not in her usual cheerful frame of mind he kissed her and having relieved her of her parasol endeavoured without success to balance it on his chin having picked it up from the floor and placed it on the table he became aware that lucille was looking at him in a despondent sort of way her grey eyes were clouded  halloa old thing said archie whats up  lucille sighed wearily  archie darling do you know any really good swearwords  well said archie reflectively let me see i did pick up a few tolerably ripe and breezy expressions out in france all through my military career there was something about mesome subtle magnetism dont you know and that sort of thingthat seemed to make colonels and blighters of that order rather inventive i sort of inspired them dont you know i remember one brasshat addressing me for quite ten minutes saying something new all the time and even then he seemed to think he had only touched the fringe of the subject as a matter of fact he said straight out in the most frank and confiding way that mere words couldnt do justice to me but why  because i want to relieve my feelings  anything wrong  everythings wrong ive just been having tea with bill and his mabel  oh ah said archie interested and whats the verdict  guilty said lucille and the sentence if i had anything to do with it would be transportation for life she peeled off her gloves irritably what fools men are not you precious youre the only man in the world that isnt it seems to me you did marry a nice girl didnt you you didnt go running round after females with crimson hair goggling at them with your eyes popping out of your head like a bulldog waiting for a bone  oh i say does old bill look like that  worse  archie rose to a point of order  but one moment old lady you speak of crimson hair surely old billin the extremely jolly monologues he used to deliver whenever i didnt see him coming and he got me aloneused to allude to her hair as brown  it isnt brown now its bright scarlet good gracious i ought to know ive been looking at it all the afternoon it dazzled me if ive got to meet her again i mean to go to the oculists and get a pair of those smoked glasses you wear at palm beach lucille brooded silently for a while over the tragedy i dont want to say anything against her of course  no no of course not  but of all the awful secondrate girls i ever met shes the worst she has vermilion hair and an imitation oxford manner shes so horribly refined that its dreadful to listen to her shes a sly creepy slinky madeup insincere vampire shes common shes awful shes a cat  youre quite right not to say anything against her said archie approvingly it begins to look he went on as if the good old pater was about due for another shock he has a hard life  if bill dares to introduce that girl to father hes taking his life in his hands  but surely that was the ideathe schemethe wheeze wasnt it or do you think theres any chance of his weakening  weakening you should have seen him looking at her it was like a small boy flattening his nose against the window of a candystore  bit thick  lucille kicked the leg of the table  and to think she said that when i was a little girl i used to look up to bill as a monument of wisdom i used to hug his knees and gaze into his face and wonder how anyone could be so magnificent she gave the unoffending table another kick if i could have looked into the future she said with feeling id have bitten him in the ankle   in the days which followed archie found himself a little out of touch with bill and his romance lucille referred to the matter only when he brought the subject up and made it plain that the topic of her future sisterinlaw was not one which she enjoyed discussing mr brewster senior when archie by way of delicately preparing his mind for what was about to befall asked him if he liked red hair called him a fool and told him to go away and bother someone else when they were busy the only person who could have kept him thoroughly abreast of the trend of affairs was bill himself and experience had made archie wary in the matter of meeting bill the position of confidant to a young man in the early stages of love is no sinecure and it made archie sleepy even to think of having to talk to his brotherinlaw he sedulously avoided his lovelorn relative and it was with a sinking feeling one day that looking over his shoulder as he sat in the cosmopolis grillroom preparatory to ordering lunch he perceived bill bearing down upon him obviously resolved upon joining his meal  to his surprise however bill did not instantly embark upon his usual monologue indeed he hardly spoke at all he champed a chop and seemed to archie to avoid his eye it was not till lunch was over and they were smoking that he unburdened himself  archie he said  hallo old thing said archie still there i thought youd died or something talk about our old pals tonguetied thomas and silent sammy you could beat em both on the same evening  its enough to make me silent  what is  bill had relapsed into a sort of waking dream he sat frowning sombrely lost to the world archie having waited what seemed to him a sufficient length of time for an answer to his question bent forward and touched his brotherinlaws hand gently with the lighted end of his cigar bill came to himself with a howl  what is said archie  what is what said bill  now listen old thing protested archie life is short and time is flying suppose we cut out the crosstalk you hinted there was something on your mindsomething worrying the old beanand im waiting to hear what it is  bill fiddled a moment with his coffeespoon  im in an awful hole he said at last  whats the trouble  its about that darned girl  archie blinked  what  that darned girl  archie could scarcely credit his senses he had been preparedindeed he had steeled himselfto hear bill allude to his affinity in a number of ways but that darned girl was not one of them  companion of my riper years he said lets get this thing straight when you say that darned girl do you by any possibility allude to  of course i do  but william old bird  oh i know i know i know said bill irritably youre surprised to hear me talk like that about her  a trifle yes possibly a trifle when last heard from laddie you must recollect you were speaking of the lady as your soulmate and at least onceif i remember rightlyyou alluded to her as your little duskyhaired lamb  a sharp howl escaped bill  dont a strong shudder convulsed his frame dont remind me of it  theres been a species of slump then in duskyhaired lambs  how demanded bill savagely can a girl be a duskyhaired lamb when her hairs bright scarlet  dashed difficult admitted archie  i suppose lucille told you about that  she did touch on it lightly as it were with a sort of gossamer touch so to speak  bill threw off the last fragments of reserve  archie im in the devil of a fix i dont know why it was but directly i saw herthings seemed so different over in englandi mean he swallowed icewater in gulps i suppose it was seeing her with lucille old lu is such a thoroughbred seemed to kind of show her up like seeing imitation pearls by the side of real pearls and that crimson hair it sort of put the lid on it bill brooded morosely it ought to be a criminal offence for women to dye their hair especially red what the devil do women do that sort of thing for  dont blame me old thing its not my fault  bill looked furtive and harassed  it makes me feel such a cad here am i feeling that i would give all ive got in the world to get out of the darned thing and all the time the poor girl seems to be getting fonder of me than ever  how do you know archie surveyed his brotherinlaw critically perhaps her feelings have changed too very possibly she may not like the colour of your hair i dont myself now if you were to dye yourself crimson  oh shut up of course a man knows when a girls fond of him  by no means laddie when youre my age  i am your age  so you are i forgot that well now approaching the matter from another angle let us suppose old son that miss whatshernamethe party of the second part  stop it said bill suddenly here comes reggie  eh  here comes reggie van tuyl i dont want him to hear us talking about the darned thing  archie looked over his shoulder and perceived that it was indeed so reggie was threading his way among the tables  well he looks pleased with things anyway said bill enviously glad somebodys happy  he was right reggie van tuyls usual mode of progress through a restaurant was a somnolent slouch now he was positively bounding along furthermore the usual expression on reggies face was a sleepy sadness now he smiled brightly and with animation he curveted towards their table beaming and erect his head up his gaze level and his chest expanded for all the world as if he had been reading the hints in the personality that wins  archie was puzzled something had plainly happened to reggie but what it was idle to suppose that somebody had left him money for he had been left practically all the money there was a matter of ten years before  hallo old bean he said as the newcomer radiating good will and bonhomie arrived at the table and hung over it like a noonday sun weve finished but rally round and well watch you eat dashed interesting watching old reggie eat why go to the zoo  reggie shook his head  sorry old man cant just on my way to the ritz stepped in because i thought you might be here i wanted you to be the first to hear the news  news  im the happiest man alive  you look it darn you growled bill on whose mood of grey gloom this human sunbeam was jarring heavily  im engaged to be married  congratulations old egg archie shook his hand cordially dash it dont you know as an old married man i like to see you young fellows settling down  i dont know how to thank you enough archie old man said reggie fervently  thank me  it was through you that i met her dont you remember the girl you sent to me you wanted me to get her a small part  he stopped puzzled archie had uttered a sound that was half gasp and half gurgle but it was swallowed up in the extraordinary noise from the other side of the table bill brewster was leaning forward with bulging eyes and soaring eyebrows  are you engaged to mabel winchester  why by george said reggie do you know her  archie recovered himself  slightly he said slightly old bill knows her slightly as it were not very well dont you know buthow shall i put it  slightly suggested bill  just the word slightly  splendid said reggie van tuyl why dont you come along to the ritz and meet her now  bill stammered archie came to the rescue again  bill cant come now hes got a date  a date said bill  a date said archie an appointment dont you know aain fact a date  buterwish her happiness from me said bill cordially  thanks very much old man said reggie  and say im delighted will you  certainly  you wont forget the word will you delighted  delighted  thats right delighted  reggie looked at his watch  halloa i must rush  bill and archie watched him as he bounded out of the restaurant  poor old reggie said bill with a fleeting compunction  not necessarily said archie what i mean to say is tastes differ dont you know one mans peach is another mans poison and vice versa  theres something in that  absolutely well said archie judicially this would appear to be as it were the maddest merriest day in all the glad new year yes no  bill drew a deep breath  you bet your sorrowful existence it is he said id like to do something to celebrate it  the right spirit said archie absolutely the right spirit begin by paying for my lunch     chapter xx thesausagechappieclicks   rendered restless by relief bill brewster did not linger long at the luncheontable shortly after reggie van tuyl had retired he got up and announced his intention of going for a bit of a walk to calm his excited mind archie dismissed him with a courteous wave of the hand and beckoning to the sausage chappie who in his role of waiter was hovering near requested him to bring the best cigar the hotel could supply the padded seat in which he sat was comfortable he had no engagements and it seemed to him that a pleasant halfhour could be passed in smoking dreamily and watching his fellowmen eat  the grillroom had filled up the sausage chappie having brought archie his cigar was attending to a table close by at which a woman with a small boy in a sailor suit had seated themselves the woman was engrossed with the bill of fare but the childs attention seemed riveted upon the sausage chappie he was drinking him in with wide eyes he seemed to be brooding on him  archie too was brooding on the sausage chappie the latter made an excellent waiter he was brisk and attentive and did the work as if he liked it but archie was not satisfied something seemed to tell him that the man was fitted for higher things archie was a grateful soul that sausage coming at the end of a fivehour hike had made a deep impression on his plastic nature reason told him that only an exceptional man could have parted with half a sausage at such a moment and he could not feel that a job as waiter at a new york hotel was an adequate job for an exceptional man of course the root of the trouble lay in the fact that the fellow could not remember what his real lifework had been before the war it was exasperating to reflect as the other moved away to take his order to the kitchen that there for all one knew went the dickens of a lawyer or doctor or architect or what not  his meditations were broken by the voice of the child  mummie asked the child interestedly following the sausage chappie with his eyes as the latter disappeared towards the kitchen why has that man got such a funny face  hush darling  yes but why has he  i dont know darling  the childs faith in the maternal omniscience seemed to have received a shock he had the air of a seeker after truth who has been baffled his eyes roamed the room discontentedly  hes got a funnier face than that man there he said pointing to archie  hush darling  but he has much funnier  in a way it was a sort of compliment but archie felt embarrassed he withdrew coyly into the cushioned recess presently the sausage chappie returned attended to the needs of the woman and the child and came over to archie his homely face was beaming  say i had a big night last night he said leaning on the table  yes said archie party or something  no i mean i suddenly began to remember things something seems to have happened to the works  archie sat up excitedly this was great news  no really my dear old lad this is absolutely topping this is priceless  yessir first thing i remembered was that i was born at springfield ohio it was like a mist starting to life springfield ohio that was it it suddenly came back to me  splendid anything else  yessir just before i went to sleep i remembered my name as well  archie was stirred to his depths  why the things a walkover he exclaimed now youve once got started nothing can stop you what is your name  why itsthats funny its gone again i have an idea it began with an s what was it skeffington skillington  sanderson  no ill get it in a moment cunningham carrington wilberforce debenham  dennison suggested archie helpfullyno no no its on the tip of my tongue barrington montgomery hepplethwaite ive got it smith  by jove really  certain of it  whats the first name  an anxious expression came into the mans eyes he hesitated he lowered his voice  i have a horrible feeling that its lancelot  good god said archie  it couldnt really be that could it  archie looked grave he hated to give pain but he felt he must be honest  it might he said people give their children all sorts of rummy names my second names tracy and i have a pal in england who was christened cuthbert de la hay horace fortunately everyone calls him stinker  the headwaiter began to drift up like a bank of fog and the sausage chappie returned to his professional duties when he came back he was beaming again  something else i remembered he said removing the cover im married  good lord  at least i was before the war she had blue eyes and brown hair and a pekingese dog  what was her name  i dont know  well youre coming on said archie ill admit that youve still got a bit of a way to go before you become like one of those blighters who take the memory training courses in the magazine advertisementsi mean to say you know the lads who meet a fellow once for five minutes and then come across him again ten years later and grasp him by the hand and say surely this is mr watkins of seattle still youre doing fine you only need patience everything comes to him who waits archie sat up electrified i say by jove thats rather good what everything comes to him who waits and youre a waiter what what i mean to say what  mummie said the child at the other table still speculative do you think something trod on his face  hush darling  perhaps it was bitten by something  eat your nice fish darling said the mother who seemed to be one of those dullwitted persons whom it is impossible to interest in a discussion on first causes  archie felt stimulated not even the advent of his fatherinlaw who came in a few moments later and sat down at the other end of the room could depress his spirits  the sausage chappie came to his table again  its a funny thing he said like waking up after youve been asleep everything seems to be getting clearer the dogs name was marie my wifes dog you know and she had a mole on her chin  the dog  no my wife little beast she bit me in the leg once  your wife  no the dog good lord said the sausage chappie  archie looked up and followed his gaze  a couple of tables away next to a sideboard on which the management exposed for view the cold meats and puddings and pies mentioned in volume two of the bill of fare buffet froid a man and a girl had just seated themselves the man was stout and middleaged he bulged in practically every place in which a man can bulge and his head was almost entirely free from hair the girl was young and pretty her eyes were blue her hair was brown she had a rather attractive little mole on the left side of her chin  good lord said the sausage chappie  now what said archie  whos that over at the table there  archie through long attendance at the cosmopolis grill knew most of the habitues by sight  thats a man named gossett james j gossett hes a motionpicture man you must have seen his name around  i dont mean him whos the girl  ive never seen her before  its my wife said the sausage chappie  your wife  yes  are you sure  of course im sure  well well well said archie many happy returns of the day  at the other table the girl unconscious of the drama which was about to enter her life was engrossed in conversation with the stout man and at this moment the stout man leaned forward and patted her on the cheek  it was a paternal pat the pat which a genial uncle might bestow on a favourite niece but it did not strike the sausage chappie in that light he had been advancing on the table at a fairly rapid pace and now stirred to his depths he bounded forward with a hoarse cry  archie was at some pains to explain to his fatherinlaw later that if the management left cold pies and things about all over the place this sort of thing was bound to happen sooner or later he urged that it was putting temptation in peoples way and that mr brewster had only himself to blame whatever the rights of the case the buffet froid undoubtedly came in remarkably handy at this crisis in the sausage chappies life he had almost reached the sideboard when the stout man patted the girls cheek and to seize a huckleberry pie was with him the work of a moment the next instant the pie had whizzed past the others head and burst like a shell against the wall  there are no doubt restaurants where this sort of thing would have excited little comment but the cosmopolis was not one of them everybody had something to say but the only one among those present who had anything sensible to say was the child in the sailor suit  do it again said the child cordially  the sausage chappie did it again he took up a fruit salad poised it for a moment then decanted it over mr gossetts bald head the childs happy laughter rang over the restaurant whatever anybody else might think of the affair this child liked it and was prepared to go on record to that effect  epic events have a stunning quality they paralyse the faculties for a moment there was a pause the world stood still mr brewster bubbled inarticulately mr gossett dried himself sketchily with a napkin the sausage chappie snorted  the girl had risen to her feet and was staring wildly  john she cried  even at this moment of crisis the sausage chappie was able to look relieved  so it is he said and i thought it was lancelot  i thought you were dead  im not said the sausage chappie  mr gossett speaking thickly through the fruitsalad was understood to say that he regretted this and then confusion broke loose again everybody began to talk at once  i say said archie i say one moment  of the first stages of this interesting episode archie had been a paralysed spectator the thing had numbed him and then       sudden a thought came like a fullblown rose      flushing his brow  when he reached the gesticulating group he was calm and businesslike he had a constructive policy to suggest  i say he said ive got an idea  go away said mr brewster this is bad enough without you butting in  archie quelled him with a gesture  leave us he said we would be alone i want to have a little businesstalk with mr gossett he turned to the moviemagnate who was gradually emerging from the fruitsalad rather after the manner of a stout venus rising from the sea can you spare me a moment of your valuable time  ill have him arrested  dont you do it laddie listen  the mans mad throwing pies  archie attached himself to his coatbutton  be calm laddie calm and reasonable  for the first time mr gossett seemed to become aware that what he had been looking on as a vague annoyance was really an individual  who the devil are you  archie drew himself up with dignity  i am this gentlemans representative he replied indicating the sausage chappie with a motion of the hand his jolly old personal representative i act for him and on his behalf i have a pretty ripe proposition to lay before you reflect dear old bean he proceeded earnestly are you going to let this chance slip the opportunity of a lifetime which will not occur again by jove you ought to rise up and embrace this bird you ought to clasp the chappie to your bosom he has thrown pies at you hasnt he very well you are a moviemagnate your whole fortune is founded on chappies who throw pies you probably scour the world for chappies who throw pies yet when one comes right to you without any fuss or trouble and demonstrates before your very eyes the fact that he is without a peer as a piepropeller you get the wind up and talk about having him arrested consider theres a bit of cherry just behind your left ear be sensible why let your personal feeling stand in the way of doing yourself a bit of good give this chappie a job and give it him quick or we go elsewhere did you ever see fatty arbuckle handle pastry with a surer touch has charlie chaplin got this fellows speed and control absolutely not i tell you old friend youre in danger of throwing away a good thing  he paused the sausage chappie beamed  ive aways wanted to go into the movies he said i was an actor before the war just remembered  mr brewster attempted to speak archie waved him down  how many times have i got to tell you not to butt in he said severely  mr gossetts militant demeanour had become a trifle modified during archies harangue first and foremost a man of business mr gossett was not insensible to the arguments which had been put forward he brushed a slice of orange from the back of his neck and mused awhile  how do i know this fellow would screen well he said at length  screen well cried archie of course hell screen well look at his face i ask you the map i call your attention to it he turned apologetically to the sausage chappie awfully sorry old lad for dwelling on this but its business you know he turned to mr gossett did you ever see a face like that of course not why should i as this gentlemans personal representative let a face like that go to waste theres a fortune in it by jove ill give you two minutes to think the thing over and if you dont talk business then ill jolly well take my man straight round to mack sennett or someone we dont have to ask for jobs we consider offers  there was a silence and then the clear voice of the child in the sailor suit made itself heard again  mummie  yes darling  is the man with the funny face going to throw any more pies  no darling  the child uttered a scream of disappointed fury  i want the funny man to throw some more pies i want the funny man to throw some more pies  a look almost of awe came into mr gossetts face he had heard the voice of the public he had felt the beating of the publics pulse  out of the mouths of babes and sucklings he said picking a piece of banana off his right eyebrow out of the mouths of babes and sucklings come round to my office     chapter xxi the growing boy   the lobby of the cosmopolis hotel was a favourite stampingground of mr daniel brewster its proprietor he liked to wander about there keeping a paternal eye on things rather in the manner of the jolly innkeeper hereinafter to be referred to as mine host of the oldfashioned novel customers who hurrying in to dinner tripped over mr brewster were apt to mistake him for the hotel detectivefor his eye was keen and his aspect a trifle austerebut nevertheless he was being as jolly an innkeeper as he knew how his presence in the lobby supplied a personal touch to the cosmopolis which other new york hotels lacked and it undeniably made the girl at the bookstall extraordinarily civil to her clients which was all to the good  most of the time mr brewster stood in one spot and just looked thoughtful but now and again he would wander to the marble slab behind which he kept the deskclerk and run his eye over the register to see who had booked roomslike a child examining the stocking on christmas morning to ascertain what santa claus had brought him  as a rule mr brewster concluded this performance by shoving the book back across the marble slab and resuming his meditations but one night a week or two after the sausage chappies sudden restoration to the normal he varied this procedure by starting rather violently turning purple and uttering an exclamation which was manifestly an exclamation of chagrin he turned abruptly and cannoned into archie who in company with lucille happened to be crossing the lobby at the moment on his way to dine in their suite  mr brewster apologised gruffly then recognising his victim seemed to regret having done so  oh its you why cant you look where youre going he demanded he had suffered much from his soninlaw  frightfully sorry said archie amiably never thought you were going to foxtrot backwards all over the fairway  you mustnt bully archie said lucille severely attaching herself to her fathers back hair and giving it a punitive tug because hes an angel and i love him and you must learn to love him too  give you lessons at a reasonable rate murmured archie  mr brewster regarded his young relative with a lowering eye  whats the matter father darling asked lucille you seem upset  i am upset mr brewster snorted some people have got a nerve he glowered forbiddingly at an inoffensive young man in a light overcoat who had just entered and the young man though his conscience was quite clear and mr brewster an entire stranger to him stopped dead blushed and went out againto dine elsewhere some people have got the nerve of an army mule  why whats happened  those darned mccalls have registered here  no  bit beyond me this said archie insinuating himself into the conversation deep waters and what not who are the mccalls  some people father dislikes said lucille and theyve chosen his hotel to stop at but father dear you mustnt mind its really a compliment theyve come because they know its the best hotel in new york  absolutely said archie good accommodation for man and beast all the comforts of home look on the bright side old bean no good getting the wind up cherrio old companion  dont call me old companion  eh what oh righto  lucille steered her husband out of the danger zone and they entered the lift  poor father she said as they went to their suite its a shame they must have done it to annoy him this man mccall has a place next to some property father bought in westchester and hes bringing a lawsuit against father about a bit of land which he claims belongs to him he might have had the tact to go to another hotel but after all i dont suppose it was the poor little fellows fault he does whatever his wife tells him to  we all do that said archie the married man  lucille eyed him fondly  isnt it a shame precious that all husbands havent nice wives like me  when i think of you by jove said archie fervently i want to babble absolutely babble  oh i was telling you about the mccalls mr mccall is one of those little meek men and his wifes one of those big bullying women it was she who started all the trouble with father father and mr mccall were very fond of each other till she made him begin the suit i feel sure she made him come to this hotel just to annoy father still theyve probably taken the most expensive suite in the place which is something  archie was at the telephone his mood was now one of quiet peace of all the happenings which went to make up existence in new york he liked best the cosy teteatete dinners with lucille in their suite which owing to their engagementsfor lucille was a popular girl with many friendsoccurred all too seldom  touching now the question of browsing and sluicing he said ill be getting them to send along a waiter  oh good gracious  whats the matter  ive just remembered i promised faithfully i would go and see jane murchison today and i clean forgot i must rush  but light of my soul we are about to eat pop around and see her after dinner  i cant shes going to a theatre tonight  give her the jolly old missinbaulk then for the nonce and spring round tomorrow  shes sailing for england tomorrow morning early no i must go and see her now what a shame shes sure to make me stop to dinner i tell you what order something for me and if im not back in half an hour start  jane murchison said archie is a bally nuisance  yes but ive known her since she was eight  if her parents had had any proper feeling said archie they would have drowned her long before that  he unhooked the receiver and asked despondently to be connected with room service he thought bitterly of the exigent jane whom he recollected dimly as a tall female with teeth he half thought of going down to the grillroom on the chance of finding a friend there but the waiter was on his way to the room he decided that he might as well stay where he was  the waiter arrived booked the order and departed archie had just completed his toilet after a showerbath when a musical clinking without announced the advent of the meal he opened the door the waiter was there with a table congested with things under covers from which escaped a savoury and appetising odour in spite of his depression archies soul perked up a trifle  suddenly he became aware that he was not the only person present who was deriving enjoyment from the scent of the meal standing beside the waiter and gazing wistfully at the foodstuffs was a long thin boy of about sixteen he was one of those boys who seem all legs and knuckles he had pale red hair sandy eyelashes and a long neck and his eyes as he removed them from thetable and raised them to archies had a hungry look he reminded archie of a halfgrown halfstarved hound  that smells good said the long boy he inhaled deeply yes sir he continued as one whose mind is definitely made up that smells good  before archie could reply the telephone bell rang it was lucille confirming her prophecy that the pest jane would insist on her staying to dine  jane said archie into the telephone is a pot of poison the waiter is here now setting out a rich banquet and i shall have to eat two of everything by myself  he hung up the receiver and turning met the pale eye of the long boy who had propped himself up in the doorway  were you expecting somebody to dinner asked the boy  why yes old friend i was  i wish  yes  oh nothing  the waiter left the long boy hitched his back more firmly against the doorpost and returned to his original theme  that surely does smell good he basked a moment in the aroma yes sir ill tell the world it does  archie was not an abnormally rapid thinker but he began at this point to get a clearly defined impression that this lad if invited would waive the formalities and consent to join his meal indeed the idea archie got was that if he were not invited pretty soon he would invite himself  yes he agreed it doesnt smell bad what  it smells good said the boy oh doesnt it wake me up in the night and ask me if it doesnt  poulet en casserole said archie  golly said the boy reverently  there was a pause the situation began to seem to archie a trifle difficult he wanted to start his meal but it began to appear that he must either do so under the penetrating gaze of his new friend or else eject the latter forcibly the boy showed no signs of ever wanting to leave the doorway  youve dined i suppose what said archie  i never dine  what  not really dine i mean i only get vegetables and nuts and things  dieting  mother is  i dont absolutely catch the drift old bean said archie the boy sniffed with halfclosed eyes as a wave of perfume from the poulet en casserole floated past him he seemed to be anxious to intercept as much of it as possible before it got through the door  mothers a foodreformer he vouchsafed she lectures on it she makes pop and me live on vegetables and nuts and things  archie was shocked it was like listening to a tale from the abyss  my dear old chap you must suffer agoniesabsolute shooting pains he had no hesitation now common humanity pointed out his course would you care to join me in a bite now  would i the boy smiled a wan smile would i just stop me on the street and ask me  come on in then said archie rightly taking this peculiar phrase for a formal acceptance and close the door the fatted calf is getting cold  archie was not a man with a wide visitinglist among people with families and it was so long since he had seen a growing boy in action at the table that he had forgotten what sixteen is capable of doing with a knife and fork when it really squares its elbows takes a deep breath and gets going the spectacle which he witnessed was consequently at first a little unnerving the long boys idea of trifling with a meal appeared to be to swallow it whole and reach out for more he ate like a starving eskimo archie in the time he had spent in the trenches making the world safe for the workingman to strike in had occasionally been quite peckish but he sat dazed before this majestic hunger this was real eating  there was little conversation the growing boy evidently did not believe in tabletalk when he could use his mouth for more practical purposes it was not until the final roll had been devoured to its last crumb that the guest found leisure to address his host then he leaned back with a contented sigh  mother said the human python says you ought to chew every mouthful thirtythree times  yes sir thirtythree times he sighed again i havent ever had meal like that  all right was it what  was it was it call me up on the phone and ask meyes sirmothers tipped off these darned waiters not to serveme anything but vegetables and nuts and things darn it  the mater seems to have drastic ideas about the good old feedbag what  ill say she has pop hates it as much as me but hes scared to kick mother says vegetables contain all the proteins you want mother says if you eat meat your bloodpressure goes all blooey do you think it does  mine seems pretty well in the pink  shes great on talking conceded the boy shes out tonight somewhere giving a lecture on rational eating to some ginks ill have to be slipping up to our suite before she gets back he rose sluggishly that isnt a bit of roll under that napkin is it he asked anxiously  archie raised the napkin  no nothing of that species  oh well said the boy resignedly then i believe ill be going thanks very much for the dinner  not a bit old top come again if youre ever trickling round in this direction  the long boy removed himself slowly loath to leave at the door he cast an affectionate glance back at the table  some meal he said devoutly considerable meal  archie lit a cigarette he felt like a boy scout who has done his days act of kindness  on the following morning it chanced that archie needed a fresh supply of tobacco it was his custom when this happened to repair to a small shop on sixth avenue which he had discovered accidentally in the course of his rambles about the great city his relations with jno blake the proprietor were friendly and intimate the discovery that mr blake was english and had indeed until a few years back maintained an establishment only a dozen doors or so from archies london club had served as a bond  today he found mr blake in a depressed mood the tobacconist was a hearty redfaced man who looked like an english sporting publicanthe kind of man who wears a fawncoloured topcoat and drives to the derby in a dogcart and usually there seemed to be nothing on his mind except the vagaries of the weather concerning which he was a great conversationalist but now moodiness had claimed him for its own after a short and melancholy good morning he turned to the task of measuring out the tobacco in silence  archies sympathetic nature was perturbedwhats the matter laddie he enquired you would seem to be feeling a bit of an onion this bright morning what yes no i can see it with the naked eye  mr blake grunted sorrowfully  ive had a knock mr moffam  tell me all friend of my youth  mr blake with a jerk of his thumb indicated a poster which hung on the wall behind the counter archie had noticed it as he came in for it was designed to attract the eye it was printed in black letters on a yellow ground and ran as follows                 cloverleaf social and outing club                           grand contest              pieeating championship of the west side                           spike odowd                           champion                                v                         blakes unknown                    for a purse of 50 and sidebet  archie examined this document gravely it conveyed nothing to him exceptwhat he had long suspectedthat his sportinglooking friend had sporting blood as well as that kind of exterior he expressed a kindly hope that the others unknown would bring home the bacon  mr blake laughed one of those hollow mirthless laughs  there aint any blooming unknown he said bitterly this man had plainly suffered yesterday yes but not now  archie sighed  in the midst of lifedead he enquired delicately  as good as replied the stricken tobacconist he cast aside his artificial restraint and became voluble archie was one of those sympathetic souls in whom even strangers readily confided their most intimate troubles he was to those in travail of spirit very much what catnip is to a cat its ard sir its blooming ard id got the event all sewed up in a parcel and now this young fellermelad as to give me the knock this lad of minesort of cousin e is comes from london like you and meas always ad ever since he landed in this country a most amazing knack of stowing away grub ed been a bit underfed these last two or three years over in the old country what with food restrictions and all and e took to the food over ere amazing id ave backed im against a ruddy orstridge orstridge id ave backed im against arff a dozen orstridgestake em on one after the other in the same ring on the same eveningand given em a handicap too e was a jewel that boy ive seen him polish off four pounds of steak and mealy potatoes and then look round kind of wolfish as much as to ask when dinner was going to begin thats the kind of a lad e was till this very morning e would have outswallowed this ere odowd without turning a hair as a relish before is tea id got a couple of undred dollars on im and thought myself lucky to get the odds and now  mr blake relapsed into a tortured silence  but whats the matter with the blighter why cant he go over the top has he got indigestion  indigestion mr blaife laughed another of his hollow laughs you couldnt give that boy indigestion if you fed im in on safetyrazor blades religions more like what es got  religion  well you can call it that seems last night instead of goin and resting is mind at a picturepalace like i told him to e sneaked off to some sort of a lecture down on eighth avenue e said ed seen a piece about it in the papers and it was about rational eating and that kind of attracted im e sort of thought e might pick up a few hints like e didnt know what rational eating was but it sounded to im as if it must be something to do with food and e didnt want to miss it e came in here just now said mr blake dully and e was a changed lad scared to death e was said the way ed been goin on in the past it was a wonder ed got any stummick left it was a lady that give the lecture and this boy said it was amazing what she told em about bloodpressure and things e didnt even know e ad she showed em pictures coloured pictures of what appens inside the injudicious eaters stummick who doesnt chew his food and it was like a battlefield e said e would no more think of eatin a lot of pie than e would of shootin imself and anyhow eating pie would be a quicker death i reasoned with im mr moffam with tears in my eyes i asked im was he goin to chuck away fame and wealth just because a woman who didnt know what she was talking about had shown him a lot of faked pictures but there wasnt any doin anything with him e give me the knock and opped it down the street to buy nuts mr blake moaned two undred dollars and more gone pop not to talk of the fifty dollars e would have won and me to get twentyfive of  archie took his tobacco and walked pensively back to the hotel he was fond of jno blake and grieved for the trouble that had come upon him it was odd he felt how things seemed to link themselves up together the woman who had delivered the fateful lecture to injudicious eaters could not be other than the mother of his young guest of last night an uncomfortable woman not content with starving her own familyarchie stopped in his tracks a pedestrian walking behind him charged into his back but archie paid no attention he had had one of those sudden luminous ideas which help a man who does not do much thinking as a rule to restore his average he stood there for a moment almost dizzy at the brilliance of his thoughts then hurried on napoleon he mused as he walked must have felt rather like this after thinking up a hot one to spring on the enemy  as if destiny were suiting her plans to his one of the first persons he saw as he entered the lobby of the cosmopolis was the long boy he was standing at the bookstall reading as much of a morning paper as could be read free under the vigilant eyes of the presiding girl both he and she were observing the unwritten rules which govern these affairsto wit that you may read without interference as much as can be read without touching the paper if you touch the paper you lose and have to buy  well well well said archie here we are again what he prodded the boy amiably in the lower ribs youre just the chap i was looking for got anything on for the time being  the boy said he had no engagements  then i want you to stagger round with me to a chappie i know on sixth avenue its only a couple of blocks away i think i can do you a bit of good put you on to something tolerably ripe if you know what i mean trickle along laddie you dont need a hat  they found mr blake brooding over his troubles in an empty shop  cheer up old thing said archie the relief expedition has arrived he directed his companions gaze to the poster cast your eye over that how does that strike you  the long boy scanned the poster a gleam appeared in his rather dull eye  well  some people have all the luck said the long boy feelingly  would you like to compete what  the boy smiled a sad smile  would i would i say  i know interrupted archie wake you up in the night and ask you i knew i could rely on you old thing he turned to mr blake heres the fellow youve been wanting to meet the finest leftandrighthand eater east of the rockies hell fight the good fight for you  mr blakes english training had not been wholly overcome by residence in new york he still retained a nice eye for the distinctions of class  but this is young gentlemans a young gentleman he urged doubtfully yet with hope shining in his eye he wouldnt do it  of course he would dont be ridic old thing  wouldnt do what asked the boy  why save the old homestead by taking on the champion dashed sad case between ourselves this poor eggs nominee has given him the raspberry at the eleventh hour and only you can save him and you owe it to him to do something you know because it was your jolly old maters lecture last night that made the nominee quit you must charge in and take his place sort of poetic justice dont you know and what not he turned to mr blake when is the conflict supposed to start twothirty you havent any important engagement for twothirty have you  no mothers lunching at some ladies club and giving a lecture afterwards i can slip away  archie patted his head  then leg it where glory waits you old bean  the long boy was gazing earnestly at the poster it seemed to fascinate him  pie he said in a hushed voice  the word was like a battlecry     chapter xxii washy steps into the hall of fame   at about nine oclock next morning in a suite at the hotel cosmopolis mrs cora bates mccall the eminent lecturer on rational eating was seated at breakfast with her family before her sat mr mccall a little huntedlooking man the natural peculiarities of whose face were accentuated by a pair of glasses of semicircular shape like halfmoons with the horns turned up behind these mr mccalls eyes played a perpetual game of peekaboo now peering over them anon ducking down and hiding behind them he was sipping a cup of anticaffeine on his right toying listlessly with a plateful of cereal sat his son washington mrs mccall herself was eating a slice of health bread and nut butter for she practised as well as preached the doctrines which she had striven for so many years to inculcate in an unthinking populace her day always began with a light but nutritious breakfast at which a peculiarly uninviting cereal which looked and tasted like an old straw hat that had been run through a meat chopper competed for first place in the dislike of her husband and son with a more than usually offensive brand of imitation coffee mr mccall was inclined to think that he loathed the imitation coffee rather more than the cereal but washington held strong views on the latters superior ghastliness both washington and his father however would have been fairminded enough to admit that it was a close thing  mrs mccall regarded her offspring with grave approval  i am glad to see lindsay she said to her husband whose eyes sprang dutifully over the glass fence as he heard his name that washy has recovered his appetite when he refused his dinner last night i was afraid that he might be sickening for something especially as he had quite a flushed look you noticed his flushed look  he did look flushed  very flushed and his breathing was almost stertorous and when he said that he had no appetite i am bound to say that i was anxious but he is evidently perfectly well this morning you do feel perfectly well this morning washy  the heir of the mccalls looked up from his cereal he was a long thin boy of about sixteen with pale red hair sandy eyelashes and a long neck  uhhuh he said  mrs mccall nodded  surely now you will agree lindsay that a careful and rational diet is what a boy needs washys constitution is superb he has a remarkable stamina and i attribute it entirely to my careful supervision of his food i shudder when i think of the growing boys who are permitted by irresponsible people to devour meat candy pie she broke off what is the matter washy  it seemed that the habit of shuddering at the thought of pie ran in the mccall family for at the mention of the word a kind of internal shimmy had convulsed washingtons lean frame and over his face there had come an expression that was almost one of pain he had been reaching out his hand for a slice of health bread but now he withdrew it rather hurriedly and sat back breathing hard  im all right he said huskily  pie proceeded mrs mccall in her platform voice she stopped again abruptly whatever is the matter washington you are making me feel nervous  im all right  mrs mccall had lost the thread of her remarks moreover having now finished her breakfast she was inclined for a little light reading one of the subjects allied to the matter of dietary on which she felt deeply was the question of reading at meals she was of the opinion that the strain on the eye coinciding with the strain on the digestion could not fail to give the latter the short end of the contest and it was a rule at her table that the morning paper should not even be glanced at till the conclusion of the meal she said that it was upsetting to begin the day by reading the paper and events were to prove that she was occasionally right  all through breakfast the new york chronicle had been lying neatly folded beside her plate she now opened it and with a remark about looking for the report of her yesterdays lecture at the butterfly club directed her gaze at the front page on which she hoped that an editor with the best interests of the public at heart had decided to place her  mr mccall jumping up and down behind his glasses scrutinised her face closely as she began to read he always did this on these occasions for none knew better than he that his comfort for the day depended largely on some unknown reporter whom he had never met if this unseen individual had done his work properly and as befitted the importance of his subject mrs mccalls mood for the next twelve hours would be as uniformly sunny as it was possible for it to be but sometimes the fellows scamped their job disgracefully and once on a day which lived in mr mccalls memory they had failed to make a report at all  today he noted with relief all seemed to be well the report actually was on the front page an honour rarely accorded to his wifes utterances moreover judging from the time it took her to read the thing she had evidently been reported at length  good my dear he ventured satisfactory  eh mrs mccall smiled meditatively oh yes excellent they have used my photograph too not at all badly reproduced  splendid said mr mccall  mrs mccall gave a sharp shriek and the paper fluttered from her hand  my dear said mr mccall with concern  his wife had recovered the paper and was reading with burning eyes a bright wave of colour had flowed over her masterful features she was breathing as stertorously as ever her son washington had done on the previous night  washington  a basilisk glare shot across the table and turned the long boy to stoneall except his mouth which opened feebly  washington is this true  washy closed his mouth then let it slowly open again  my dear mr mccalls voice was alarmed what is it his eyes had climbed up over his glasses and remained there what is the matter is anything wrong  wrong read for yourself  mr mccall was completely mystified he could not even formulate a guess at the cause of the trouble that it appeared to concern his son washington seemed to be the one solid fact at his disposal and that only made the matter still more puzzling where mr mccall asked himself did washington come in  he looked at the paper and received immediate enlightenment headlines met his eyes                    good stuff in this boy                     about a ton of it                  son of cora bates mccall                famous foodreform lecturer              wins pieeating championship of                        west side  there followed a lyrical outburst so uplifted had the reporter evidently felt by the importance of his news that he had been unable to confine himself to prose         my children if you fail to shine or triumph in your      special line if let us say your hopes are bent on      some day being president and folks ignore your proper      worth and say youve not a chance on earthcheer up      for in these stirring days fame may be won in many ways      consider when your spirits fall the case of washington      mccall       yes cast your eye on washy please he looks just like      a piece of cheese hes not a brilliant sort of chap he      has a dull and vacant map his eyes are blank his face      is red his ears stick out beside his head in fact to      end these compliments he would be dear at thirty cents      yet fame has welcomed to her hall this selfsame      washington mccall       his mother nee miss cora bates is one who frequently      orates upon the proper kind of food which every menu      should include with eloquence the world she weans from      chops and steaks and pork and beans such horrid things      shed like to crush and make us live on milk and mush      but oh the thing that makes her sigh is when she sees      us eating pie we heard her lecture last july upon the      nations menacepie alas the hit it made was small      with master washington mccall       for yesterday we took a trip to see the great pie      championship where men with bulging cheeks and eyes      consume vast quantities of pies a fashionable west side      crowd beheld the champion spike odowd endeavour to      defend his throne against an upstart blakes unknown      he wasnt an unknown at all he was young washington      mccall       we freely own wed give a leg if we could borrow steal      or beg the skill old homer used to show he wrote the      iliad you know old homer swung a wicked pen but we      are ordinary men and cannot even start to dream of      doing justice to our theme the subject of that great      repast is too magnificent and vast we cant describe      or even try the way those rivals wolfed their pie      enough to say that when for hours each had extended all      his powrs toward the quiet evenfall odowd succumbed      to young mccall       the champion was a willing lad he gave the public all      he had his was a genuine fighting soul hed lots of      speed and much control no yellow streak did he evince      he tackled applepie and mince this was the motto on      his shieldodowds may burst they never yield his      eyes began to start and roll he eased his belt another      hole poor fellow with a single glance one saw that he      had not a chance a python would have had to crawl and      own defeat from young mccall       at last long last the finish came his features      overcast with shame odowd whod faltered once or      twice declined to eat another slice he tottered off      and kindly men rallied around with oxygen but washy      cora batess son seemed disappointed it was done he      somehow made those present feel hed barely started on      his meal we ask him arent you feeling bad me      said the lionhearted lad lead mehe started for the      streetwhere i can get a bite to eat oh what a      lesson does it teach to all of us that splendid speech      how better can the curtain fall on master washington      mccall   mr mccall read this epic through then he looked at his son he first looked at him over his glasses then through his glasses then over his glasses again then through his glasses once more a curious expression was in his eyes if such a thing had not been so impossible one would have said that his gaze had in it something of respect of admiration even of reverence  but how did they find out your name he asked at length  mrs mccall exclaimed impatiently  is that all you have to say  no no my dear of course not quite so but the point struck me as curious  wretched boy cried mrs mccall were you insane enough to reveal your name  washington wriggled uneasily unable to endure the piercing stare of his mother he had withdrawn to the window and was looking out with his back turned but even there he could feel her eyes on the back of his neck  i didnt think it ud matter he mumbled a fellow with tortoiseshellrimmed specs asked me so i told him how was i to know  his stumbling defence was cut short by the opening of the door  halloalloallo what ho what ho  archie was standing in the doorway beaming ingratiatingly on the family  the apparition of an entire stranger served to divert the lightning of mrs mccalls gaze from the unfortunate washy archie catching it between the eyes blinked and held on to the wall he had begun to regret that he had yielded so weakly to lucilles entreaty that he should look in on the mccalls and use the magnetism of his personality upon them in the hope of inducing them to settle the lawsuit he wished too if the visit had to be paid that he had postponed it till after lunch for he was never at his strongest in the morning but lucille had urged him to go now and get it over and here he was  i think said mrs mccall icily that you must have mistaken your room  archie rallied his shaken forces  oh no rather not better introduce myself what my names moffam you know im old brewsters soninlaw and all that sort of rot if you know what i mean he gulped and continued ive come about this jolly old lawsuit dont you know  mr mccall seemed about to speak but his wife anticipated him  mr brewsters attorneys are in communication with ours we do not wish to discuss the matter  archie took an uninvited seat eyed the health bread on the breakfast table for a moment with frank curiosity and resumed his discourse  no but i say you know ill tell you what happened i hate to totter in where im not wanted and all that but my wife made such a point of it rightly or wrongly she regards me as a bit of a hound in the diplomacy line and she begged me to look you up and see whether we couldnt do something about settling the jolly old thing i mean to say you know the old birdold brewster you knowis considerably perturbed about the affairhates the thought of being in a posish where he has either got to bite his old pal mccall in the neck or be bitten by himandwell and so forth dont you know how about it he broke off great scot i say what  so engrossed had he been in his appeal that he had not observed the presence of the pieeating champion between whom and himself a large potted plant intervened but now washington hearing the familiar voice had moved from the window and was confronting him with an accusing stare  he made me do it said washy with the stern joy a sixteenyearold boy feels when he sees somebody on to whose shoulders he can shift trouble from his own thats the fellow who took me to the place  what are you talking about washington  im telling you he got me into the thing  do you mean thisthis mrs mccall shuddered are you referring to this pieeating contest  you bet i am  is this true mrs mccall glared stonily at archie was it you who lured my poor boy into thatthat  oh absolutely the fact is dont you know a dear old pal of mine who runs a tobacco shop on sixth avenue was rather in the soup he had backed a chappie against the champion and the chappie was converted by one of your lectures and swore off pie at the eleventh hour dashed hard luck on the poor chap dont you know and then i got the idea that our little friend here was the one to step in and save the situash so i broached the matter to him and ill tell you one thing said archie handsomely i dont know what sort of a capacity the original chappie had but ill bet he wasnt in your sons class your son has to be seen to be believed absolutely you ought to be proud of him he turned in friendly fashion to washy rummy we should meet again like this never dreamed i should find you here and by jove its absolutely marvellous how fit you look after yesterday i had a sort of idea you would be groaning on a bed of sickness and all that  there was a strange gurgling sound in the background it resembled something getting up steam and this curiously enough is precisely what it was the thing that was getting up steam was mr lindsay mccall  the first effect of the washy revelations on mr mccall had been merely to stun him it was not until the arrival of archie that he had had leisure to think but since archies entrance he had been thinking rapidly and deeply  for many years mr mccall had been in a state of suppressed revolution he had smouldered but had not dared to blaze but this startling upheaval of his fellowsufferer washy had acted upon him like a high explosive there was a strange gleam in his eye a gleam of determination he was breathing hard  washy  his voice had lost its deprecating mildness it rang strong and clear  yes pop  how many pies did you eat yesterday  washy considered  a good few  how many twenty  more than that i lost count a good few  and you feel as well as ever  i feel fine  mr mccall dropped his glasses he glowered for a moment at the breakfast table his eye took in the health bread the imitation coffeepot the cereal the nutbutter then with a swift movement he seized the cloth jerked it forcibly and brought the entire contents rattling and crashing to the floor  lindsay  mr mccall met his wifes eye with quiet determination it was plain that something had happened in the hinterland of mr mccalls soul  cora he said resolutely i have come to a decision ive been letting you run things your own way a little too long in this family im going to assert myself for one thing ive had all i want of this foodreform foolery look at washy yesterday that boy seems to have consumed anything from a couple of hundredweight to a ton of pie and he has thriven on it thriven i dont want to hurt your feelings cora but washington and i have drunk our last cup of anticaffeine if you care to go on with the stuff thats your lookout but washy and i are through  he silenced his wife with a masterful gesture and turned to archie and theres another thing i never liked the idea of that lawsuit but i let you talk me into it now im going to do things my way mr moffam im glad you looked in this morning ill do just what you want take me to dan brewster now and lets call the thing off and shake hands on it  are you mad lindsay  it was cora bates mccalls last shot mr mccall paid no attention to it he was shaking hands with archie  i consider you mr moffam he said the most sensible young man i have ever met  archie blushed modestly  awfully good of you old bean he said i wonder if youd mind telling my jolly old fatherinlaw that itll be a bit of news for him     chapter xxiii mothers knee   archie moffams connection with that devastatingly popular ballad mothers knee was one to which he always looked back later with a certain pride mothers knee it will be remembered went through the world like a pestilence scots elders hummed it on their way to kirk cannibals crooned it to their offspring in the jungles of borneo it was a bestseller among the bolshevists in the united states alone three million copies were disposed of for a man who has not accomplished anything outstandingly great in his life it is something to have been in a sense responsible for a song like that and though there were moments when archie experienced some of the emotions of a man who has punched a hole in the dam of one of the larger reservoirs he never really regretted his share in the launching of the thing  it seems almost bizarre now to think that there was a time when even one person in the world had not heard mothers knee but it came fresh to archie one afternoon some weeks after the episode of washy in his suite at the hotel cosmopolis where he was cementing with cigarettes and pleasant conversation his renewed friendship with wilson hymack whom he had first met in the neighbourhood of armentieres during the war  what are you doing these days enquired wilson hymack  me said archie well as a matter of fact there is what you might call a sort of species of lull in my activities at the moment but my jolly old fatherinlaw is bustling about running up a new hotel a bit farther downtown and the scheme is for me to be manager when its finished from what i have seen in this place its a simple sort of job and i fancy i shall be somewhat hot stuff how are you filling in the long hours  im in my uncles office darn it  starting at the bottom and learning the business and all that a noble pursuit no doubt but im bound to say it would give me the pip in no uncertain manner  it gives me said wilson hymack a pain in the thorax i want to be a composer  a composer eh  archie felt that he should have guessed this the chappie had a distinctly artistic look he wore a bowtie and all that sort of thing his trousers bagged at the knees and his hair which during the martial epoch of his career had been pruned to the roots fell about his ears in luxuriant disarray  say do you want to hear the best thing ive ever done  indubitably said archie politely carry on old bird  i wrote the lyric as well as the melody said wilson hymack who had already seated himself at the piano its got the greatest title you ever heard its a lallapaloosa its called its a long way back to mothers knee hows that poor eh  archie expelled a smokering doubtfully  isnt it a little stale  stale what do you mean stale theres always room for another song boosting mother  oh is it boosting mother archies face cleared i thought it was a hit at the short skirts why of course that makes all the difference in that case i see no reason why it should not be ripe fruity and pretty well all to the mustard lets have it  wilson hymack pushed as much of his hair out of his eyes as he could reach with one hand cleared his throat looked dreamily over the top of the piano at a photograph of archies fatherinlaw mr daniel brewster played a prelude and began to sing in a weak high composers voice all composers sing exactly alike and they have to be heard to be believed  one night a young man wandered through the glitter of broadway his money he had squandered for a meal he couldnt pay  tough luck murmured archie sympathetically      he thought about the village where his boyhood he had      spent and yearned for all the simple joys with which      hed been content  the right spirit said archie with approval im beginning to like this chappie  dont interrupt  oh righto carried away and all that      he looked upon the city so frivolous and gay and      as he heaved a weary sigh these words he then did say           its a long way back to mothers knee                                   mothers knee                                   mothers knee           its a long way back to mothers knee                where i used to stand and prattle                with my teddybear and rattle           oh those childhood days in tennessee           they sure look good to me      its a long long way but im gonna start today           im going back           believe me oh      im going back           i want to go      im going backbackon the seventhree      to the dear old shack where i used to be      im going back to mothers knee  wilson hymacks voice cracked on the final high note which was of an altitude beyond his powers he turned with a modest cough  thatll give you an idea of it  it has old thing it has  is it or is it not a ball of fire  it has many of the earmarks of a sound egg admitted archie of course  of course it wants singing  just what i was going to suggest  it wants a woman to sing it a woman who could reach out for that last high note and teach it to take a joke the whole refrain is working up to that you need tetrazzini or someone who would just pick that note off the roof and hold it till the janitor came round to lock up the building for the night  i must buy a copy for my wife where can i get it  you cant get it it isnt published writing musics the darndest job wilson hymack snorted fiercely it was plain that the man was pouring out the pentup emotion of many days you write the biggest thing in years and you go round trying to get someone to sing it and they say youre a genius and then shove the song away in a drawer and forget about it  archie lit another cigarette  im a jolly old child in these matters old lad he said but why dont you take it direct to a publisher as a matter of fact if it would be any use to you i was foregathering with a musicpublisher only the other day a bird of the name of blumenthal he was lunching in here with a pal of mine and we got tolerably matey why not let me tool you round to the office tomorrow and play it to him  no thanks much obliged but im not going to play that melody in any publishers office with his hired gang of tinpan alley composers listening at the keyhole and taking notes ill have to wait till i can find somebody to sing it well i must be going along glad to have seen you again sooner or later ill take you to hear that high note sung by someone in a way thatll make your spine tie itself in knots round the back of your neck  ill count the days said archie courteously pippip  hardly had the door closed behind the composer when it opened again to admit lucille  hallo light of my soul said archie rising and embracing his wife where have you been all the afternoon i was expecting you this many an hour past i wanted you to meet  ive been having tea with a girl down in greenwich village i couldnt get away before who was that who went out just as i came along the passage  chappie of the name of hymack i met him in france a composer and what not  we seem to have been moving in artistic circles this afternoon the girl i went to see is a singer at least she wants to sing but gets no encouragement  precisely the same with my bird he wants to get his music sung but nobodyll sing it but i didnt know you knew any greenwich village warblers sunshine of my home how did you meet this female  lucille sat down and gazed forlornly at him with her big grey eyes she was registering something but archie could not gather what it was  archie darling when you married me you undertook to share my sorrows didnt you  absolutely its all in the book of words for better or for worse in sickness and in health alldownsetemupintheotheralley regular ironclad contract  then share em said lucille bills in love again  archie blinked  bill when you say bill do you mean bill your brother bill my brotherinlaw bill jolly old william the son and heir of the brewsters  i do  you say hes in love cupids dart  even so  but i say isnt this ratherwhat i mean to say is the lads an absolute scourge the great lover what also ran brigham young and all that sort of thing why its only a few weeks ago that he was moaning brokenly about that vermilionhaired female who subsequently hooked on to old reggie van tuyl  shes a little better than that girl thank goodness all the same i dont think father will approve  of what calibre is the latest exhibit  well she comes from the middle west and seems to be trying to be twice as bohemian as the rest of the girls down in greenwich village she wears her hair bobbed and goes about in a kimono shes probably read magazine stories about greenwich village and has modelled herself on them its so silly when you can see hicks corners sticking out of her all the time  that one got past me before i could grab it what did you say she had sticking out of her  i meant that anybody could see that she came from somewhere out in the wilds as a matter of fact bill tells me that she was brought up in snake bite michigan  snake bite what rummy names you have in america still ill admit theres a village in england called nether wallop so who am i to cast the first stone how is old bill pretty feverish  he says this time it is the real thing  thats what they all say i wish i had a dollar for every timeforgotten what i was going to say broke off archie prudently so you think he went on after a pause that williams latest is going to be one more shock for the old dad  i cant imagine father approving of her  ive studied your merry old progenitor pretty closely said archie and between you and me i cant imagine him approving of anybody  i cant understand why it is that bill goes out of his way to pick these horrors i know at least twenty delightful girls all pretty and with lots of money who would be just the thing for him but he sneaks away and goes falling in love with someone impossible and the worst of it is that one always feels ones got to do ones best to see him through  absolutely one doesnt want to throw a spanner into the works of loves young dream it behoves us to rally round have you heard this girl sing  yes she sang this afternoon  what sort of a voice has she got  well itsloud  could she pick a high note off the roof and hold it till the janitor came round to lock up the building for the night  what on earth do you mean  answer me this woman frankly how is her high note pretty lofty  why yes  then say no more said archie leave this to me my dear old better fourfifths hand the whole thing over to archibald the man who never lets you down i have a scheme   as archie approached his suite on the following afternoon he heard through the closed door the drone of a gruff male voice and going in discovered lucille in the company of his brotherinlaw lucille archie thought was looking a trifle fatigued bill on the other hand was in great shape his eyes were shining and his face looked so like that of a stuffed frog that archie had no difficulty in gathering that he had been lecturing on the subject of his latest enslaver  hallo bill old crumpet he said  hallo archie  im so glad youve come said lucille bill is telling me all about spectatia  who  spectatia the girl you know her name is spectatia huskisson  it cant be said archie incredulously  why not growled bill  well how could it said archie appealing to him as a reasonable man i mean to say spectatia huskisson i gravely doubt whether there is such a name  whats wrong with it demanded the incensed bill its a darned sight better name than archibald moffam  dont fight you two children intervened lucille firmly its a good old middle west name everybody knows the huskissons of snake bite michigan besides bill calls her tootles  pootles corrected bill austerely  oh yes pootles he calls her pootles  young blood young blood sighed archie  i wish you wouldnt talk as if you were my grandfather  i look on you as a son laddie a favourite son  if i had a father like youah but you havent youngfellermelad and thats the trouble if you had everything would be simple but as your actual father if youll allow me to say so is one of the finest specimens of the human vampirebat in captivity something has got to be done about it and youre dashed lucky to have me in your corner a guide philosopher and friend full of the fruitiest ideas now if youll kindly listen to me for a moment  ive been listening to you ever since you came in  you wouldnt speak in that harsh tone of voice if you knew all william i have a scheme  well  the scheme to which i allude is what maeterlinck would call a lallapaloosa  what a little marvel he is said lucille regarding her husband affectionately he eats a lot of fish bill thats what makes him so clever  shrimps diagnosed bill churlishly  do you know the leader of the orchestra in the restaurant downstairs asked archie ignoring the slur  i know there is a leader of the orchestra what about him  a sound fellow great pal of mine ive forgotten his name  call him pootles suggested lucille  desist said archie as a wordless growl proceeded from his stricken brotherinlaw temper your hilarity with a modicum of reserve this girlish frivolity is unseemly well im going to have a chat with this chappie and fix it all up  fix what up  the whole jolly business im going to kill two birds with one stone ive a composer chappie popping about in the background whose one ambish is to have his pet song sung before a discriminating audience you have a singer straining at the leash im going to arrange with this egg who leads the orchestra that your female shall sing my chappies song downstairs one night during dinner how about it is it or is it not a ball of fire  its not a bad idea admitted bill brightening visibly i wouldnt have thought you had it in you  why not  well  its a capital idea said lucille quite out of the question of course  how do you mean  dont you know that the one thing father hates more than anything else in the world is anything like a cabaret people are always coming to him suggesting that it would brighten up the dinner hour if he had singers and things and he crushes them into little bits he thinks theres nothing that lowers the tone of a place more hell bite you in three places when you suggest it to him  ah but has it escaped your notice lighting system of my soul that the dear old dad is not at present in residence he went off to fish at lake whatsitsname this morning  you arent dreaming of doing this without asking him  that was the general idea  but hell be furious when he finds out  but will he find out i ask you will he  of course he will  i dont see why he should said bill on whose plastic mind the plan had made a deep impression  he wont said archie confidently this wheeze is for one night only by the time the jolly old guvnor returns bitten to the bone by mosquitoes with one small stuffed trout in his suitcase everything will be over and all quiet once more along the potomac the scheme is this my chappie wants his song heard by a publisher your girl wants her voice heard by one of the blighters who get up concerts and all that sort of thing no doubt you know such a bird whom you could invite to the hotel for a bit of dinner  i know carl steinburg as a matter of fact i was thinking of writing to him about spectatia  youre absolutely sure that is her name said archie his voice still tinged with incredulity oh well i suppose she told you so herself and no doubt she knows best that will be topping rope in your pal and hold him down at the table till the finish lucille the beautiful vision on the skyline yonder and i will be at another table entertaining maxie blumenthal  who on earth is maxie blumenthal asked lucille  one of my boyhood chums a musicpublisher ill get him to come along and then well all be set at the conclusion of the performance miss archie wincedmiss spectatia huskisson will be signed up for a forty weeks tour and jovial old blumenthal will be making all arrangements for publishing the song two birds as i indicated before with one stone how about it  its a winner said bill  of course said archie im not urging you i merely make the suggestion if you know a better ole go to it  its terrific said bill  its absurd said lucille  my dear old partner of joys and sorrows said archie wounded we court criticism but this is mere abuse what seems to be the difficulty  the leader of the orchestra would be afraid to do it  ten dollarssupplied by william herepush it over bill old manwill remove his tremors  and fathers certain to find out  am i afraid of father cried archie manfully well yes i am he added after a moments reflection but i dont see how he can possibly get to know  of course he cant said bill decidedly fix it up as soon as you can archie this is what the doctor ordered     chapter xxiv the melting of mr connolly   the main diningroom of the hotel cosmopolis is a decorous place the lighting is artistically dim and the genuine old tapestries on the walls seem with their mediaeval calm to discourage any essay in the riotous softfooted waiters shimmer to and fro over thick expensive carpets to the music of an orchestra which abstains wholly from the noisy modernity of jazz to archie who during the past few days had been privileged to hear miss huskisson rehearsing the place had a sort of brooding quiet like the ocean just before the arrival of a cyclone as lucille had said miss huskissons voice was loud it was a powerful organ and there was no doubt that it would take the cloistered stillness of the cosmopolis diningroom and stand it on one ear almost unconsciously archie found himself bracing his muscles and holding his breath as he had done in france at the approach of the zero hour when awaiting the first roar of a barrage he listened mechanically to the conversation of mr blumenthal  the musicpublisher was talking with some vehemence on the subject of labour a recent printers strike had bitten deeply into mr blumenthals soul the working man he considered was rapidly landing gods country in the soup and he had twice upset his glass with the vehemence of his gesticulation he was an energetic rightandlefthand talker  the more you give em the more they want he complained theres no pleasing em it isnt only in my business theres your father mrs moffam  good god where said archie starting  i say take your fathers case hes doing all he knows to get this new hotel of his finished and what happens a man gets fired for loafing on his job and connolly calls a strike and the building operations are held up till the things settled it isnt right  its a great shame agreed lucille i was reading about it in the paper this morning  that man connollys a tough guy youd think being a personal friend of your father he would  i didnt know they were friends  been friends for years but a lot of difference that makes out come the men just the same it isnt right i was saying it wasnt right repeated mr blumenthal to archie for he was a man who liked the attention of every member of his audience  archie did not reply he was staring glassily across the room at two men who had just come in one was a large stout squarefaced man of commanding personality the other was mr daniel brewster  mr blumenthal followed his gaze  why there is connolly coming in now  father gasped lucille  her eyes met archies archie took a hasty drink of icewater  this he murmured has torn it  archie you must do something  i know but what  whats the trouble enquired mr blumenthal mystified  go over to their table and talk to them said lucille  me archie quivered no i say old thing really  get them away  how do you mean  i know cried lucille inspired father promised that you should be manager of the new hotel when it was built well then this strike affects you just as much as anybody else you have a perfect right to talk it over with them go and ask them to have dinner up in our suite where you can discuss it quietly say that up there they wont be disturbed by thethe music  at this moment while archie wavered hesitating like a diver on the edge of a springboard who is trying to summon up the necessary nerve to project himself into the deep a bellboy approached the table where the messrs brewster and connolly had seated themselves he murmured something in mr brewsters ear and the proprietor of the cosmopolis rose and followed him out of the room  quick nows your chance said lucille eagerly fathers been called to the telephone hurry  archie took another drink of icewater to steady his shaking nervecenters pulled down his waistcoat straightened his tie and then with something of the air of a roman gladiator entering the arena tottered across the room lucille turned to entertain the perplexed musicpublisher  the nearer archie got to mr aloysius connolly the less did he like the looks of him even at a distance the labour leader had had a formidable aspect seen close to he looked even more uninviting his face had the appearance of having been carved out of granite and the eye which collided with archies as the latter with an attempt at an ingratiating smile pulled up a chair and sat down at the table was hard and frosty mr connolly gave the impression that he would be a good man to have on your side during a roughandtumble fight down on the waterfront or in some lumbercamp but he did not look chummy  halloalloallo said archie  who the devil inquired mr connolly are you  my names archibald moffam  thats not my fault  im jolly old brewsters soninlaw  glad to meet you  glad to meet you said archie handsomely  well goodbye said mr connolly  eh  run along and sell your papers your fatherinlaw and i have business to discuss  yes i know  private added mr connolly  oh but im in on this binge you know im going to be the manager of the new hotel  you  absolutely  well well said mr connolly noncommittally  archie pleased with the smoothness with which matters had opened bent forward winsomely  i say you know it wont do you know absolutely no not a bit like it no no far from it well how about it how do we go what yes no  what on earth are you talking about  call it off old thing  call what off  this festive old strike  not on yourhallo dan back again  mr brewster looming over the table like a thundercloud regarded archie with more than his customary hostility life was no pleasant thing for the proprietor of the cosmopolis just now once a man starts building hotels the thing becomes like dramdrinking any hitch any sudden cuttingoff of the daily dose has the worst effects and the strike which was holding up the construction of his latest effort had plunged mr brewster into a restless gloom in addition to having this strike on his hands he had had to abandon his annual fishingtrip just when he had begun to enjoy it and as if all this were not enough here was his soninlaw sitting at his table mr brewster had a feeling that this was more than man was meant to bear  what do you want he demanded  hallo old thing said archie come and join the party  dont call me old thing  righto old companion just as you say i say i was just going to suggest to mr connolly that we should all go up to my suite and talk this business over quietly  he says hes the manager of your new hotel said mr connolly is that right  i suppose so said mr brewster gloomily  then im doing you a kindness said mr connolly in not letting it be built  archie dabbed at his forehead with his handkerchief the moments were flying and it began to seem impossible to shift these two men mr connolly was as firmly settled in his chair as some primeval rock as for mr brewster he too had seated himself and was gazing at archie with a weary repulsion mr brewsters glance always made archie feel as though there were soup on his shirtfront  and suddenly from the orchestra at the other end of the room there came a familiar sound the prelude of mothers knee  so youve started a cabaret dan said mr connolly in a satisfied voice i always told you you were behind the times here  mr brewster jumped  cabaret  he stared unbelievingly at the whiterobed figure which had just mounted the orchestra dais and then concentrated his gaze on archie  archie would not have looked at his fatherinlaw at this juncture if he had had a free and untrammelled choice but mr brewsters eye drew his with something of the fascination which a snakes has for a rabbit mr brewsters eye was fiery and intimidating a basilisk might have gone to him with advantage for a course of lessons his gaze went right through archie till the latter seemed to feel his backhair curling crisply in the flames  is this one of your fooltricks  even in this tense moment archie found time almost unconsciously to admire his fatherinlaws penetration and intuition he seemed to have a sort of sixth sense no doubt this was how great fortunes were made  well as a matter of factto be absolutely accurateit was like this  say cut it out said mr connolly can the chatter i want to listen  archie was only too ready to oblige him conversation at the moment was the last thing he himself desired he managed with a strong effort to disengage himself from mr brewsters eye and turned to the orchestra dais where miss spectatia huskisson was now beginning the first verse of wilson hymacks masterpiece  miss huskisson like so many of the female denizens of the middle west was tall and blonde and constructed on substantial lines she was a girl whose appearance suggested the old homestead and fried pancakes and pop coming home to dinner after the mornings ploughing even her bobbed hair did not altogether destroy this impression she looked big and strong and healthy and her lungs were obviously good she attacked the verse of the song with something of the vigour and breadth of treatment with which in other days she had reasoned with refractory mules her diction was the diction of one trained to call the cattle home in the teeth of western hurricanes whether you wanted to or not you heard every word  the subdued clatter of knives and forks had ceased the diners unused to this sort of thing at the cosmopolis were trying to adjust their faculties to cope with the outburst waiters stood transfixed frozen in attitudes of service in the momentary lull between verse and refrain archie could hear the deep breathing of mr brewster involuntarily he turned to gaze at him once more as refugees from pompeii may have turned to gaze upon vesuvius and as he did so he caught sight of mr connolly and paused in astonishment  mr connolly was an altered man his whole personality had undergone a subtle change his face still looked as though hewn from the living rock but into his eyes had crept an expression which in another man might almost have been called sentimental incredible as it seemed to archie mr connollys eyes were dreamy there was even in them a suggestion of unshed tears and when with a vast culmination of sound miss huskisson reached the high note at the end of the refrain and after holding it as some stormingparty spent but victorious holds the summit of a hardwon redoubt broke off suddenly in the stillness which followed there proceeded from mr connolly a deep sigh  miss huskisson began the second verse and mr brewster seeming to recover from some kind of a trance leaped to his feet  great godfrey  sit down said mr connolly in a broken voice sit down dan      he went back to his mother on the train that very day      he knew there was no other who could make him bright and         gay      he kissed her on the forehead and he whispered ive come         home      he told her he was never going any more to roam      and onward through the happy years till he grew old and         grey      he never once regretted those brave words he once did say      its a long way back to mothers knee  the last high note screeched across the room like a shell and the applause that followed was like a shells bursting one could hardly have recognised the refined interior of the cosmopolis diningroom fair women were waving napkins brave men were hammering on the tables with the buttend of knives for all the world as if they imagined themselves to be in one of those distressing midnightrevue places miss huskisson bowed retired returned bowed and retired again the tears streaming down her ample face over in a corner archie could see his brotherinlaw clapping strenuously a waiter with a display of manly emotion that did him credit dropped an order of new peas  thirty years ago last october said mr connolly in a shaking voice i  mr brewster interrupted him violently  ill fire that orchestraleader he goes tomorrow ill fire he turned on archie what the devil do you mean by it youyou  thirty years ago said mr connolly wiping away a tear with his napkin i left me dear old home in the old country  my hotel a beargarden  frightfully sorry and all that old companion  thirty years ago last october twas a fine autumn evening the finest yed ever wish to see me old mother she came to the station to see me off  mr brewster who was not deeply interested in mr connollys old mother continued to splutter inarticulately like a firework trying to go off  yell always be a good boy aloysius she said to me said mr connolly proceeding with his autobiography and i said yes mother i will mr connolly sighed and applied the napkin again twas a liar i was he observed remorsefully manys the dirty ive played since then its a long way back to mothers knee tis a true word he turned impulsively to mr brewster dan theres a deal of trouble in this world without me going out of me way to make more the strike is over ill send the men back tomorrow theres me hand on it  mr brewster who had just managed to coordinate his views on the situation and was about to express them with the generous strength which was ever his custom when dealing with his soninlaw checked himself abruptly he stared at his old friend and business enemy wondering if he could have heard aright hope began to creep back into mr brewsters heart like a shamefaced dog that has been away from home hunting for a day or two  youll what  ill send the men back tomorrow that song was sent to guide me dan it was meant thirty years ago last october me dear old mother  mr brewster bent forward attentively his views on mr connollys dear old mother had changed he wanted to hear all about her  twas that last note that girl sang brought it all back to me as if twas yesterday as we waited on the platform me old mother and i out comes the train from the tunnel and the engine lets off a screech the way yed hear it ten miles away twas thirty years ago  archie stole softly from the table he felt that his presence if it had ever been required was required no longer looking back he could see his fatherinlaw patting mr connolly affectionately on the shoulder  archie and lucille lingered over their coffee mr blumenthal was out in the telephonebox settling the business end with wilson hymack the musicpublisher had been unstinted in his praise of mothers knee it was surefire he said the words stated mr blumenthal were gooey enough to hurt and the tune reminded him of every other songhit he had ever heard there was in mr blumenthals opinion nothing to stop this thing selling a million copies  archie smoked contentedly  not a bad evenings work old thing he said talk about birds with one stone he looked at lucille reproachfully you dont seem bubbling over with joy  oh i am precious lucille sighed i was only thinking about bill  what about bill  well its rather awful to think of him tied for life to thatthat steamsiren  oh we mustnt look on the jolly old dark side perhapshallo bill old top we were just talking about you  were you said bill brewster in a dispirited voice  i take it that you want congratulations what  i want sympathy  sympathy  sympathy and lots of it shes gone  gone who  spectatia  how do you mean gone  bill glowered at the tablecloth  gone home ive just seen her off in a cab shes gone back to washington square to pack shes catching the ten oclock train back to snake bite it was that damned song muttered bill in a stricken voice she says she never realised before she sang it tonight how hollow new york was she said it suddenly came over her she says shes going to give up her career and go back to her mother what the deuce are you twiddling your fingers for he broke off irritably  sorry old man i was just counting  counting counting what  birds old thing only birds said archie     chapter xxv the wigmore venus   the morning was so brilliantly fine the populace popped to and fro in so active and cheery a manner and everybody appeared to be so absolutely in the pink that a casual observer of the city of new york would have said that it was one of those happy days yet archie moffam as he turned out of the sunbathed street into the ramshackle building on the third floor of which was the studio belonging to his artist friend james b wheeler was faintly oppressed with a sort of a kind of feeling that something was wrong he would not have gone so far as to say that he had the pipit was more a vague sense of discomfort and searching for first causes as he made his way upstairs he came to the conclusion that the person responsible for this nebulous depression was his wife lucille it seemed to archie that at breakfast that morning lucilles manner had been subtly rummy nothing you could put your finger on stillrummy  musing thus he reached the studio and found the door open and the room empty it had the air of a room whose owner has dashed in to fetch his golfclubs and biffed off after the casual fashion of the artist temperament without bothering to close up behind him and such indeed was the case the studio had seen the last of j b wheeler for that day but archie not realising this and feeling that a chat with mr wheeler who was a lighthearted bird was what he needed this morning sat down to wait after a few moments his gaze straying over the room encountered a handsomely framed picture and he went across to take a look at it  j b wheeler was an artist who made a large annual income as an illustrator for the magazines and it was a surprise to archie to find that he also went in for this kind of thing for the picture dashingly painted in oils represented a comfortably plump young woman who from her rather weakminded simper and the fact that she wore absolutely nothing except a small dove on her left shoulder was plainly intended to be the goddess venus archie was not much of a lad around the picturegalleries but he knew enough about art to recognise venus when he saw her though once or twice it is true artists had doublecrossed him by ringing in some such title as day dreams or when the heart is young  he inspected this picture for awhile then returning to his seat lit a cigarette and began to meditate on lucille once more yes the dear girl had been rummy at breakfast she had not exactly said anything or done anything out of the ordinary butwell you know how it is we husbands we lads of the forbetterorforworse brigade we learn to pierce the mask there had been in lucilles manner that curious strained sweetness which comes to women whose husbands have failed to match the piece of silk or forgotten to post an important letter if his conscience had not been as clear as crystal archie would have said that that was what must have been the matter but when lucille wrote letters she just stepped out of the suite and dropped them in the mailchute attached to the elevator it couldnt be that and he couldnt have forgotten anything else because  oh my sainted aunt  archies cigarette smouldered neglected between his fingers his jaw had fallen and his eyes were staring glassily before him he was appalled his memory was weak he knew but never before had it let him down so scurvily as this this was a record it stood in a class by itself printed in red ink and marked with a star as the bloomer of a lifetime for a man may forget many things he may forget his name his umbrella his nationality his spats and the friends of his youth but there is one thing which your married man your insicknessandinhealth lizard must not forget and that is the anniversary of his weddingday  remorse swept over archie like a wave his heart bled for lucille no wonder the poor girl had been rummy at breakfast what girl wouldnt be rummy at breakfast tied for life to a ghastly outsider like himself he groaned hollowly and sagged forlornly in his chair and as he did so the venus caught his eye for it was an eyecatching picture you might like it or dislike it but you could not ignore it  as a strong swimmer shoots to the surface after a high dive archies soul rose suddenly from the depths to which it had descended he did not often get inspirations but he got one now hope dawned with a jerk the one way out had presented itself to him a rich present that was the wheeze if he returned to her bearing a rich present he might with the help of heaven and a face of brass succeed in making her believe that he had merely pretended to forget the vital date in order to enhance the surprise  it was a scheme like some great general forming his plan of campaign on the eve of battle archie had the whole binge neatly worked out inside a minute he scribbled a note to mr wheeler explaining the situation and promising reasonable payment on the instalment system then placing the note in a conspicuous position on the easel he leaped to the telephone and presently found himself connected with lucilles room at the cosmopolis  hullo darling he cooed  there was a slight pause at the other end of the wire  oh hullo archie  lucilles voice was dull and listless and archies experienced ear could detect that she had been crying he raised his right foot and kicked himself indignantly on the left ankle  many happy returns of the day old thing  a muffled sob floated over the wire  have you only just remembered said lucille in a small voice  archie bracing himself up cackled gleefully into the receiver  did i take you in light of my home do you mean to say you really thought i had forgotten for heavens sake  you didnt say a word at breakfast  ah but that was all part of the devilish cunning i hadnt got a present for you then at least i didnt know whether it was ready  oh archie you darling lucilles voice had lost its crushed melancholy she trilled like a thrush or a linnet or any bird that goes in largely for trilling have you really got me a present  its here now the dickens of a fruity picture one of j b wheelers things youll like it  oh i know i shall i love his work you are an angel well hang it over the piano  ill be round with it in something under three ticks star of my soul ill take a taxi  yes do hurry i want to hug you  righto said archie ill take two taxis  it is not far from washington square to the hotel cosmopolis and archie made the journey without mishap there was a little unpleasantness with the cabman before startinghe on the prudish plea that he was a married man with a local reputation to keep up declining at first to be seen in company with the masterpiece but on archie giving a promise to keep the front of the picture away from the public gaze he consented to take the job on and some ten minutes later having made his way blushfully through the hotel lobby and endured the frank curiosity of the boy who worked the elevator archie entered his suite the picture under his arm  he placed it carefully against the wall in order to leave himself more scope for embracing lucille and when the joyful reunionor the sacred scene if you prefer so to call it was concluded he stepped forward to turn it round and exhibit it  why its enormous said lucille i didnt know mr wheeler ever painted pictures that size when you said it was one of his i thought it must be the original of a magazine drawing or something likeoh  archie had moved back and given her an uninterrupted view of the work of art and she had started as if some unkindly disposed person had driven a bradawl into her  pretty ripe what said archie enthusiastically  lucille did not speak for a moment it may have been sudden joy that kept her silent or on the other hand it may not she stood looking at the picture with wide eyes and parted lips  a bird eh said archie  yyes said lucille  i knew youd like it proceeded archie with animation you see youre by way of being a picturehoundknow all about the things and what notinherit it from the dear old dad i shouldnt wonder personally i cant tell one picture from another as a rule but im bound to say the moment i set eyes on this i said to myself what ho or words to that effect i rather think this will add a touch of distinction to the home yes no ill hang it up shall i phone down to the office light of my soul and tell them to send up a nail a bit of string and the hotel hammer  one moment darling im not quite sure  eh  where it ought to hang i mean you see  over the piano you said the jolly old piano  yes but i hadnt seen it then  a monstrous suspicion flitted for an instant into archies mind  i say you do like it dont you he said anxiously  oh archie darling of course i doand it was so sweet of you to give it to me but what i was trying to say was that this picture is soso striking that i feel that we ought to wait a little while and decide where it would have the best effect the light over the piano is rather strong  you think it ought to hang in a dimmish light what  yes yes the dimmer thei mean yes in a dim light suppose we leave it in the corner for the momentover therebehind the sofa andand ill think it over it wants a lot of thought you know  righto here  yes that will do splendidly oh and archie  hullo  i think perhaps just turn its face to the wall will you lucille gave a little gulp it will prevent it getting dusty  it perplexed archie a little during the next few days to notice in lucille whom he had always looked on as preeminently a girl who knew her own mind a curious streak of vacillation quite half a dozen times he suggested various spots on the wall as suitable for the venus but lucille seemed unable to decide archie wished that she would settle on something definite for he wanted to invite j b wheeler to the suite to see the thing he had heard nothing from the artist since the day he had removed the picture and one morning encountering him on broadway he expressed his appreciation of the very decent manner in which the other had taken the whole affair  oh that said j b wheeler my dear fellow youre welcome he paused for a moment more than welcome he added you arent much of an expert on pictures are you  well said archie i dont know that youd call me an absolute nib dont you know but of course i know enough to see that this particular exhibit is not a little fruity absolutely one of the best things youve ever done laddie  a slight purple tinge manifested itself in mr wheelers round and rosy face his eyes bulged  what are you talking about you tishbite you misguided son of belial are you under the impression that i painted that thing  didnt you  mr wheeler swallowed a little convulsively  my fiancee painted it he said shortly  your fiancee my dear old lad i didnt know you were engaged who is she do i know her  her name is alice wigmore you dont know her  and she painted that picture archie was perturbed but i say wont she be apt to wonder where the thing has got to  i told her it had been stolen she thought it a great compliment and was tickled to death so thats all right  and of course shell paint you another  not while i have my strength she wont said j b wheeler firmly shes given up painting since i taught her golf thank goodness and my best efforts shall be employed in seeing that she doesnt have a relapse  but laddie said archie puzzled you talk as though there were something wrong with the picture i thought it dashed hot stuff  god bless you said j b wheeler  archie proceeded on his way still mystified then he reflected that artists as a class were all pretty weird and rummy and talked more or less consistently through their hats you couldnt ever take an artists opinion on a picture nine out of ten of them had views on art which would have admitted them to any looneybin and no questions asked he had met several of the species who absolutely raved over things which any reasonable chappie would decline to be found dead in a ditch with his admiration for the wigmore venus which had faltered for a moment during his conversation with j b wheeler returned in all its pristine vigour absolute rot he meant to say to try to make out that it wasnt one of the ones and just like mother used to make look how lucille had liked it  at breakfast next morning archie once more brought up the question of the hanging of the picture it was absurd to let a thing like that go on wasting its sweetness behind a sofa with its face to the wall  touching the jolly old masterpiece he said how about it i think its time we hoisted it up somewhere  lucille fiddled pensively with her coffeespoon  archie dear she said ive been thinking  and a very good thing to do said archie ive often meant to do it myself when i got a bit of time  about that picture i mean did you know it was fathers birthday tomorrow  why no old thing i didnt to be absolutely honest your revered parent doesnt confide in me much these days as a matter of fact  well it is and i think we ought to give him a present  absolutely but how im all for spreading sweetness and light and cheering up the jolly old paters sorrowful existence but i havent a bean and what is more things have come to such a pass that i scan the horizon without seeing a single soul i can touch i suppose i could get into reggie van tuyls ribs for a bit buti dont knowtouching poor old reggie always seems to me rather like potting a pitting bird  of course i dont want you to do anything like that i was thinkingarchie darling would you be very hurt if i gave father the picture  oh i say  well i cant think of anything else  but wouldnt you miss it most frightfully  oh of course i should but you seefathers birthday  archie had always thought lucille the dearest and most unselfish angel in the world but never had the fact come home to him so forcibly as now he kissed her fondly  by jove he exclaimed you really are you know this is the biggest thing since jolly old sir philip whatshisname gave the drink of water to the poor blighter whose need was greater than his if you recall the incident i had to sweat it up at school i remember sir philip poor old bean had a most ghastly thirst on and he was just going to have one on the house so to speak when but its all in the historybooks this is the sort of thing boy scouts do well of course its up to you queen of my soul if you feel like making the sacrifice righto shall i bring the pater up here and show him the picture  no i shouldnt do that do you think you could get into his suite tomorrow morning and hang it up somewhere you see if he had the chance ofwhat i mean is ifyes i think it would be best to hang it up and let him discover it there  it would give him a surprise you mean what  yes  lucille sighed inaudibly she was a girl with a conscience and that conscience was troubling her a little she agreed with archie that the discovery of the wigmore venus in his artistically furnished suite would give mr brewster a surprise surprise indeed was perhaps an inadequate word she was sorry for her father but the instinct of selfpreservation is stronger than any other emotion  archie whistled merrily on the following morning as having driven a nail into his fatherinlaws wallpaper he adjusted the cord from which the wigmore venus was suspended he was a kindhearted young man and though mr daniel brewster had on many occasions treated him with a good deal of austerity his simple soul was pleased at the thought of doing him a good turn he had just completed his work and was stepping cautiously down when a voice behind him nearly caused him to overbalance  what the devil  archie turned beamingly  hullo old thing many happy returns of the day  mr brewster was standing in a frozen attitude his strong face was slightly flushed  whatwhat he gurgled  mr brewster was not in one of his sunniest moods that morning the proprietor of a large hotel has many things to disturb him and today things had been going wrong he had come up to his suite with the idea of restoring his shaken nerve system with a quiet cigar and the sight of his soninlaw had as so frequently happened made him feel worse than ever but when archie had descended from the chair and moved aside to allow him an uninterrupted view of the picture mr brewster realised that a worse thing had befallen him than a mere visit from one who always made him feel that the world was a bleak place  he stared at the venus dumbly unlike most hotelproprietors daniel brewster was a connoisseur of art connoisseuring was in fact his hobby even the public rooms of the cosmopolis were decorated with taste and his own private suite was a shrine of all that was best and most artistic his tastes were quiet and restrained and it is not too much to say that the wigmore venus hit him behind the ear like a stuffed eelskin  so great was the shock that for some moments it kept him silent and before he could recover speech archie had explained  its a birthday present from lucille dont you know  mr brewster crushed down the breezy speech he had intended to utter  lucille gave methat he muttered  he swallowed pathetically he was suffering but the iron courage of the brewsters stood him in good stead this man was no weakling presently the rigidity of his face relaxed he was himself again of all things in the world he loved his daughter most and if in whoever mood of temporary insanity she had brought herself to suppose that this beastly daub was the sort of thing he would like for a birthday present he must accept the situation like a man he would on the whole have preferred death to a life lived in the society of the wigmore venus but even that torment must be endured if the alternative was the hurting of lucilles feelings  i think ive chosen a pretty likely spot to hang the thing what said archie cheerfully it looks well alongside those japanese prints dont you think sort of stands out  mr brewster licked his dry lips and grinned a ghastly grin  it does stand out he agreed     chapter xxvi a tale of a grandfather   archie was not a man who readily allowed himself to become worried especially about people who were not in his own immediate circle of friends but in the course of the next week he was bound to admit that he was not altogether easy in his mind about his fatherinlaws mental condition he had read all sorts of things in the sunday papers and elsewhere about the constant strain to which captains of industry are subjected a strain which sooner or later is only too apt to make the victim go all blooey and it seemed to him that mr brewster was beginning to find the going a trifle too tough for his stamina undeniably he was behaving in an odd manner and archie though no physician was aware that when the american businessman that restless everactive human machine starts behaving in an odd manner the next thing you know is that two strong men one attached to each arm are hurrying him into the cab bound for bloomingdale  he did not confide his misgivings to lucille not wishing to cause her anxiety he hunted up reggie van tuyl at the club and sought advice from him  i say reggie old thingpresent company exceptedhave there been any loonies in your family  reggie stirred in the slumber which always gripped him in the early afternoon  loonies he mumbled sleepily rather my uncle edgar thought he was twins  twins eh  yes silly idea i mean youd have thought one of my uncle edgar would have been enough for any man  how did the thing start asked archie  start well the first thing we noticed was when he began wanting two of everything had to set two places for him at dinner and so on always wanted two seats at the theatre ran into money i can tell you  he didnt behave rummily up till then i mean to say wasnt sort of jumpy and all that  not that i remember why  archies tone became grave  well ill tell you old man though i dont want it to go any farther that im a bit worried about my jolly old fatherinlaw i believe hes about to go in off the deepend i think hes cracking under the strain dashed weird his behaviour has been the last few days  such as murmured mr van tuyl  well the other morning i happened to be in his suiteincidentally he wouldnt go above ten dollars and i wanted twentyfiveand he suddenly picked up a whacking big paperweight and bunged it for all he was worth  at you  not at me that was the rummy part of it at a mosquito on the wall he said well i mean to say do chappies bung paperweights at mosquitoes i mean is it done  smash anything  curiously enough no but he only just missed a rather decent picture which lucille had given him for his birthday another foot to the left and it would have been a goner  sounds queer  and talking of that picture i looked in on him about a couple of afternoons later and hed taken it down from the wall and laid it on the floor and was staring at it in a dashed marked sort of manner that was peculiar what  on the floor  on the jolly old carpet when i came in he was goggling at it in a sort of glassy way absolutely rapt dont you know my coming in gave him a startseemed to rouse him from a kind of trance you knowand he jumped like an antelope and if i hadnt happened to grab him he would have trampled bang on the thing it was deuced unpleasant you know his manner was rummy he seemed to be brooding on something what ought i to do about it do you think its not my affair of course but it seams to me that if he goes on like this one of these days hell be stabbing someone with a picklefork  to archies relief his fatherinlaws symptoms showed no signs of development in fact his manner reverted to the normal once more and a few days later meeting archie in the lobby of the hotel he seemed quite cheerful it was not often that he wasted his time talking to his soninlaw but on this occasion he chatted with him for several minutes about the big picturerobbery which had formed the chief item of news on the front pages of the morning papers that day it was mr brewsters opinion that the outrage had been the work of a gang and that nobody was safe  daniel brewster had spoken of this matter with strange earnestness but his words had slipped from archies mind when he made his way that night to his fatherinlaws suite archie was in an exalted mood in the course of dinner he had had a bit of good news which was occupying his thoughts to the exclusion of all other matters it had left him in a comfortable if rather dizzy condition of benevolence to all created things he had smiled at the roomclerk as he crossed the lobby and if he had had a dollar he would have given it to the boy who took him up in the elevator  he found the door of the brewster suite unlocked which at any other time would have struck him as unusual but tonight he was in no frame of mind to notice these trivialities he went in and finding the room dark and no one at home sat down too absorbed in his thoughts to switch on the lights and gave himself up to dreamy meditation  there are certain moods in which one loses count of time and archie could not have said how long he had been sitting in the deep armchair near the window when he first became aware that he was not alone in the room he had closed his eyes the better to meditate so had not seen anyone enter nor had he heard the door open the first intimation he had that somebody had come in was when some hard substance knocked against some other hard object producing a sharp sound which brought him back to earth with a jerk  he sat up silently the fact that the room was still in darkness made it obvious that something nefarious was afoot plainly there was dirty work in preparation at the crossroads he stared into the blackness and as his eyes grew accustomed to it was presently able to see an indistinct form bending over something on the floor the sound of rather stertorous breathing came to him  archie had many defects which prevented him being the perfect man but lack of courage was not one of them his somewhat rudimentary intelligence had occasionally led his superior officers during the war to thank god that great britain had a navy but even these stern critics had found nothing to complain of in the manner in which he bounded over the top some of us are thinkers others men of action archie was a man of action and he was out of his chair and sailing in the direction of the back of the intruders neck before a wiser man would have completed his plan of campaign the miscreant collapsed under him with a squashy sound like the wind going out of a pair of bellows and archie taking a firm seat on his spine rubbed the others face in the carpet and awaited the progress of events  at the end of half a minute it became apparent that there was going to be no counterattack the dashing swiftness of the assault had apparently had the effect of depriving the marauder of his entire stock of breath he was gurgling to himself in a pained sort of way and making no effort to rise archie feeling that it would be safe to get up and switch on the light did so and turning after completing this manoeuvre was greeted by the spectacle of his fatherinlaw seated on the floor in a breathless and dishevelled condition blinking at the sudden illumination on the carpet beside mr brewster lay a long knife and beside the knife lay the handsomely framed masterpiece of j b wheelers fiancee miss alice wigmore archie stared at this collection dumbly  oh whatho he observed at length feebly  a distinct chill manifested itself in the region of archies spine this could mean only one thing his fears had been realised the strain of modern life with all its hustle and excitement had at last proved too much for mr brewster crushed by the thousand and one anxieties and worries of a millionaires existence daniel brewster had gone off his onion  archie was nonplussed this was his first experience of this kind of thing what he asked himself was the proper procedure in a situation of this sort what was the local rule where in a word did he go from here he was still musing in an embarrassed and baffled way having taken the precaution of kicking the knife under the sofa when mr brewster spoke and there was in both the words and the method of their delivery so much of his old familiar self that archie felt quite relieved  so its you is it you wretched blight you miserable weed said mr brewster having recovered enough breath to be going on with he glowered at his soninlaw despondently i might have expected it if i was at the north pole i could count on you butting in  shall i get you a drink of water said archie  what the devil demanded mr brewster do you imagine i want with a drink of water  well archie hesitated delicately i had a sort of idea that you had been feeling the strain a bit i mean to say rush of modern life and all that sort of thing  what are you doing in my room said mr brewster changing the subject  well i came to tell you something and i came in here and was waiting for you and i saw some chappie biffing about in the dark and i thought it was a burglar or something after some of your things so thinking it over i got the idea that it would be a fairly juicy scheme to land on him with both feet no idea it was you old thing frightfully sorry and all that meant well  mr brewster sighed deeply he was a just man and he could not but realise that in the circumstances archie had behaved not unnaturally  oh well he said i might have known something would go wrong  awfully sorry  it cant be helped what was it you wanted to tell me he eyed his soninlaw piercingly not a cent over twenty dollars he said coldly  archie hastened to dispel the pardonable error  oh it wasnt anything like that he said as a matter of fact i think its a good egg it has bucked me up to no inconsiderable degree i was dining with lucille just now and as we dallied with the foodstuffs she told me something whichwell im bound to say it made me feel considerably braced she told me to trot along and ask you if you would mind  i gave lucille a hundred dollars only last tuesday  archie was pained  adjust this sordid outlook old thing he urged you simply arent anywhere near it right off the target absolutely what lucille told me to ask you was if you would mindat some tolerably near datebeing a grandfather rotten thing to be of course proceeded archie commiseratingly for a chappie of your age but there it is  mr brewster gulped  do you mean to say  i mean apt to make a fellow feel a bit of a patriarch snowy hair and what not and of course for a chappie in the prime of life like you  do you mean to tell me is this true  absolutely of course speaking for myself im all for it i dont know when ive felt more bucked i sang as i came up hereabsolutely warbled in the elevator but you  a curious change had come over mr brewster he was one of those men who have the appearance of having been hewn out of the solid rock but now in some indescribable way he seemed to have melted for a moment he gazed at archie then moving quickly forward he grasped his hand in an iron grip  this is the best news ive ever had he mumbled  awfully good of you to take it like this said archie cordially i mean being a grandfather  mr brewster smiled of a man of his appearance one could hardly say that he smiled playfully but there was something in his expression that remotely suggested playfulness  my dear old bean he said  archie started  my dear old bean repeated mr brewster firmly im the happiest man in america his eye fell on the picture which lay on the floor he gave a slight shudder but recovered himself immediately after this he said i can reconcile myself to living with that thing for the rest of my life i feel it doesnt matter  i say said archie how about that wouldnt have brought the thing up if you hadnt introduced the topic but speaking as man to man what the dickens were you up to when i landed on your spine just now  i suppose you thought i had gone off my head  well im bound to say  mr brewster cast an unfriendly glance at the picture  well i had every excuse after living with that infernal thing for a week  archie looked at him astonished  i say old thing i dont know if i have got your meaning exactly but you somehow give me the impression that you dont like that jolly old work of art  like it cried mr brewster its nearly driven me mad every time it caught my eye it gave me a pain in the neck tonight i felt as if i couldnt stand it any longer i didnt want to hurt lucilles feelings by telling her so i made up my mind i would cut the damned thing out of its frame and tell her it had been stolen  what an extraordinary thing why thats exactly what old wheeler did  who is old wheeler  artist chappie pal of mine his fiancee painted the thing and when i lifted it off him he told her it had been stolen he didnt seem frightfully keen on it either  your friend wheeler has evidently good taste  archie was thinking  well all this rather gets past me he said personally ive always admired the thing dashed ripe bit of work ive always considered still of course if you feel that way  you may take it from me that i do  well then in that caseyou know what a clumsy devil i amyou can tell lucille it was all my fault  the wigmore venus smiled up at archieit seemed to archie with a pathetic pleading smile for a moment he was conscious of a feeling of guilt then closing his eyes and hardening his heart he sprang lightly in the air and descended with both feet on the picture there was a sound of rending canvas and the venus ceased to smile  golly said archie regarding the wreckage remorsefully  mr brewster did not share his remorse for the second time that night he gripped him by the hand  my boy he quavered he stared at archie as if he were seeing him with new eyes my dear boy you were through the war were you not  eh oh yes right through the jolly old war  what was your rank  oh second lieutenant  you ought to have been a general mr brewster clasped his hand once more in a vigorous embrace i only hope he added that your son will be like you  there are certain compliments or compliments coming from certain sources before which modesty reels stunned archies did  he swallowed convulsively he had never thought to hear these words from daniel brewster  how would it be old thing he said almost brokenly if you and i trickled down to the bar and had a spot of sherbet  the end
