8133659	the kingdom of the blind  by e phillips oppenheim     chapter i  lady anselman stood in the centre of the lounge at the ritz hotel and with a delicatelypoised forefinger counted her guests there was the great french actress who had every charm but youth chatting vivaciously with a tall palefaced man whose french seemed to be as perfect as his attitude was correct the popular wife of a great actor was discussing her husbands latest play with a cabinet minister who had the air of a schoolboy present at an illicit feast a very beautiful young woman tall and fair with greyblue eyes and a wealth of golden almost yellow hair was talking to a famous musician a little further in the background a young man in the uniform of a naval lieutenant was exchanging what seemed to be rather impressive chaff with a petite but exceedingly goodlooking girl lady anselman counted them twice glanced at the clock and frowned  i cant remember whom we are waiting for she exclaimed a little helplessly to the remaining guest a somewhat tiredlooking publisher who stood by her side i am one short i dare say it will come to me in a minute you know every one i suppose mr daniell  the publisher shook his head  i have met lord romsey and also madame selarne he observed for the rest i was just thinking what a stranger i felt  the man who talks french so well lady anselman told him dropping her voice a little is surgeonmajor thomson he is inspector of hospitals at the front or something of the sort the tall fair girlisnt she prettyis geraldine conyers daughter of admiral sir seymour conyers thats her brother the sailor over there talking to olive moreton their engagement was announced last week lady patrick of course you know and signor scobel and adelaide cunninghamyou do know her dont you mr daniell she is my dearest friend how many do you make that  the publisher counted them carefully  eleven including ourselves he announced  and we should be twelve lady anselman sighed of course she added her face suddenly brightening what an idiot i am its ronnie we are waiting for one cant be cross with him poor fellow he can only just get about  the fair girl who had overheard leaned across the shade of newly awakened interest in her face and the curve of her lips as she spoke added to her charm a gleam of sunlight flashed upon the yellowgold of her plainly coiled hair  is it your nephew captain ronald granet who is coming she asked a little eagerly  lady anselman nodded  he only came home last tuesday with dispatches from the front she said this is his first day out  ah but he is wounded perhaps madame selarne inquired solicitously  in the left arm and the right leg lady anselman assented i believe that he has seen some terrible fighting and we are very proud of his d s o the only trouble is that he is like all the othershe will tell us nothing  he shows excellent judgment lord romsey observed  lady anselman glanced at her august guest a little querulously  that is the principle you go on nowadays isnt it she remarked i am not sure that you are wise when one is told nothing one fears the worst and when time after time the news of these small disasters reaches us piecemeal about three weeks late we never get rid of our forebodings even when you tell us about victories ah here he comes at last she added holding out both her hands to the young man who was making his somewhat difficult way towards them ronnie you are a few minutes late but were not in the least cross with you do you know that you are looking better already come and tell me whom you dont know of my guests and ill introduce you  the young man leaning upon his stick greeted his aunt and murmured a word of apology he was very fair and with a slight reddish moustache and the remains of freckles upon his face his grey eyes were a little sunken and there were lines about his mouth which one might have guessed had been brought out recently by pain or suffering of some sort his left arm reclined uselessly in a black silk sling he glanced around the little assembly  first of all he said bowing to the french actress and raising her fingers to his lips there is no one who does not know madame selarne lady patrick we have met before havent we i am going to see your husband in his new play the first night i am allowed out mr daniell i have met and lord romsey may perhaps do me the honour of remembering me he added shaking hands with the cabinet minister  he turned to face geraldine conyers who had been watching him with interest lady anselman at once introduced them  i know that you havent met miss conyers because she has been asking about you this is my nephew ronnie geraldine i hope that you will be friends  the girl murmured something inaudible as she shook hands the young soldier looked at her for a moment his manner became almost serious  i hope so too he said quietly  olive come and make friends with my nephew if you can spare a moment from your young man lady anselman continued captain granetmiss olive moreton and this is geraldines brotherlieutenant conyers  the two men shook hands pleasantly lady anselman glanced at the clock and turned briskly towards the corridor  and now i think she announced luncheon  as she moved forward she was suddenly conscious of the man who had been talking to madame selarne he had drawn a little on one side and he was watching the young soldier with a curious intentness she turned back to her nephew and touched him on the arm  ronnie she said i dont know whether you have met surgeonmajor thomson in france major thomson this is my nephew captain granet  granet turned at once and offered his hand to the other man only geraldine conyers who was a young woman given to noticing things and who had also reasons of her own for being interested observed the rather peculiar scrutiny with which each regarded the other something which might almost have been a challenge seemed to pass from one to the other  i may not have met you personally granet admitted but if you are the surgeonmajor thomson who has been doing such great things with the field hospitals at the front then like nearly every poor crock out there i owe you a peculiar debt of gratitude you are the man i mean arent you the young soldier concluded cordially  major thomson bowed and a moment later they all made their way along the corridor across the restaurant searched for their names on the cards and took their places at the table which had been reserved for them lady anselman glanced around with the scrutinising air of the professional hostess to see that her guests were properly seated before she devoted herself to the cabinet minister she had a word or two to say to nearly every one of them  i have put you next miss conyers ronnie she remarked because we give all the good things to our men when they come home from the war and i have put you next olive ralph she went on turning to the sailor because i hear you are expecting to get your ship today or tomorrow so you too have to be spoiled a little as a general rule i dont approve of putting engaged people together it concentrates conversation so and lord romsey she added turning to her neighbour please dont imagine for a moment that i am going to break my promise we are going to talk about everything in the world except the war i know quite well that if ronnie has had any particularly thrilling experiences he wont tell us about them and i also know that your brain is packed full of secrets which nothing in the world would induce you to divulge we are going to try and persuade madame to tell us about her new play she concluded smiling at the french actress and there are so many of my friends on the french stage whom i must hear about  lord romsey commenced his luncheon with an air of relief he was a man of little more than middleage powerfully built inclined to be sombre with features of a legal type heavily jawed always tactful dear hostess he murmured as a matter of fact nothing but the circumstance that it was your invitation and that madame selarne was to be present brought me here today it is so hard to avoid speaking of the great things and for a man in my position he added dropping his voice a little so difficult to say anything worth listening to about them without at any rate the semblance of indiscretion  we all appreciate that lady anselman assured him sympathetically madame selarne has promised to give us an outline of the new play which she is producing in manchester  if that would interest you all madame selarne assented it commencesso  for a time they nearly all listened in absorbed silence her gestures the tricks of her voice the uplifting of her eyebrows and shouldersall helped to give life and colour to the little sketch she expounded only those at the remote end of the table ventured upon an independent conversation mrs cunningham the woman whom her hostess had referred to as being her particular friend and one who shared her passion for entertaining chatted fitfully to her neighbour major thomson it was not until luncheon was more than halfway through that she realised the onesidedness of their conversation she studied him for a moment curiously there was something very still and expressionless in his face even though the sunshine from the broad high windows which overlooked the park was shining full upon him  tell me about yourself she insisted suddenly i have been talking rubbish quite long enough you have been out havent you  he assented gravely  i went with the first division at that time i was in charge of a field hospital  and now  i am chief inspector of field hospitals he replied  you are home on leave  not exactly he told her a shade of stiffness in his manner i have to come over very often on details connected with the administration of my work  i should have known quite well that you were a surgeon she observed  you are a physiognomist then  more or less she admitted you see i love people i love having people around me my friends find me a perfect nuisance for i am always wanting to give parties you have the still cold face of a surgeonand the hands too she added glancing at them  you are very observant he remarked laconically  i am also curious she laughed as you are about to discover tell me why you are so interested in ronnie granet you hadnt met him before had you  almost for the first time he turned and looked directly at his neighbour she was a woman whose fair hair was turning grey welldressed sprightly agreeable she had a humorous mouth and an understanding face  captain granet was a stranger to me he assented one is naturally interested in soldiers however  you must have met thousands like him she remarkedgoodlooking very british keen sportsman lots of pluck just a little careless hating to talk about himself and serious things i have known him since he was a boy  major thomson continued to be gravely interested  granet he said to himself thoughtfully do i know any of his people i wonder  you know some of his connections of course mrs cunningham replied briskly sir alfred anselman for instance his uncle  his father and mother  they are both dead there is a large family place in warwickshire and a chateau just now i am afraid in the hands of the germans it was somewhere quite close to the frontier lady granet was an alsatian he was to have gone out with the polo team you know to america but broke a rib just as they were making the selection he played cricket for middlesex once or twice too and he was captain of oxford the year that they did so well  an admirable crichton major thomson murmured  in sport at any rate his neighbour assented he has always been one of the most popular young men about town but of course the women will spoil him now  is it my fancy he asked or was he not reported a prisoner  he was missing twice once for over a week mrs cunningham replied there are all sorts of stories as to how he got back to the lines a perfect young daredevil i should think i must talk to mr daniell for a few minutes or he will never publish my reminiscences  she leaned towards her neighbour on the other side and major thomson was able to resume the role of attentive observer a role which seemed somehow his by destiny he listened without apparent interest to the conversation between geraldine conyers and the young man whom they had been discussing  i think geraldine complained that you are rather overdoing your diplomatic reticence captain granet you havent told me a single thing why some of the tommies i have been to see in the hospitals have been far more interesting than you  he smiled  i can assure you he protested it isnt my fault you cant imagine how fed up one gets with things out there and the newspapers can tell you ever so much more than we can one soldier only sees a little bit of his own corner of the fight you know  but cant you tell me some of your own personal experiences she persisted they are so much more interesting than what one reads in print  i never had any he assured her fearfully slow time we had for months  of course i dont believe a word you say she declared laughing  youre not taking me for a war correspondent by any chance are you he asked  she shook her head  your language isnt sufficiently picturesque tell me when are you going back  as soon as i can pass the doctorsin a few days i hope  you hope she repeated do you really mean that or do you say it because it is the proper thing to say  he appeared for the moment to somewhat resent her question  the fact that i hope to get back he remarked coldly has nothing whatever to do with my liking my job when i get there as a matter of fact i hate it at the same time you can surely understand that there isnt any other place for a man of my age and profession  of course not she agreed softly i really am sorry that i bothered you there is one thing i should like to know though and that is how you managed to escape  he shook his head but his amiability seemed to have wholly returned his eyes twinkled as he looked at her  there were up against a solid wall of impossibility he replied you see some of our other chaps may try the dodge i gave them the tip and i dont want to spoil their chances bythebye do you know the man two places down on your left he added dropping his voice a little looks almost like a waxwork figure doesnt he  you mean major thomson yes i know him she assented after a moments hesitation he is very quiet today but he is really most interesting  their hostess rose and beamed on them all from her end of the table  we have decided she announced to take our coffee out in the lounge    chapter ii  the little party trooped out of the restaurant and made their way to a corner of the lounge where tables had already been prepared with coffee and liqueurs geraldine conyers and captain granet who had lingered behind found a table to themselves lady anselman laid her fingers upon major thomsons arm  please talk for a few more minutes to selarne she begged your french is such a relief to her  he obeyed immediately although his eyes strayed more than once towards the table at which captain granet and his companion were seated madame selarne was in a gossipy mood and they found many mutual acquaintances  to speak a foreign language as you do she told him is wonderful is it in french alone monsieur that you excel or are you perhaps a great linguist  i can scarcely call myself that he replied but i do speak several other languages in my younger days i travelled a good deal  german perhaps too she inquired with a little grimace  i was at a hospital in berlin he confessed  lady anselmans party was suddenly increased by the advent of some acquaintances from an adjoining table all of whom desired to be presented to madame selarne major thomson set at liberty made his way at once towards the small table at which captain granet and geraldine conyers were seated she welcomed him with a smile  are you coming to have coffee with us she asked  if i may he answered i shall have to be off in a few minutes  a waiter paused before their table and offered a salver on which were several cups of coffee and liqueur glasses captain granet leaned forward in his place and stretched out his hand to serve his companion before he could take the cup however the whole tray had slipped from the waiters fingers caught the corner of the table and fallen with its contents on to the carpet the waiter himselfa small undersized person with black startled eyes set at that moment in a fixed and unnatural staremade one desperate effort to save himself and then fell backwards every one turned around attracted by the noise of the falling cups and the sharp halfstifled groan which broke from the mans lips captain granet sprang to his feet  good heavens the fellows in a fit he exclaimed  the maitre dhotel and several waiters came hurrying up towards the prostrate figure by the side of which major thomson was already kneeling the manager who appeared upon the scene as though by magic and upon whose face was an expression of horror that his clients should have been so disturbed quickly gave his orders the man was picked up and carried away major thomson followed behind two or three waiters in a few seconds succeeded in removing the debris of the accident the orchestra commenced a favourite waltz the maitre dhotel apologised to the little groups of people for the commotionthey were perhaps to blame for having employed a young man so delicatehe was scarcely fit for service  he seemed to be a foreigner lady anselman remarked as the man addressed his explanations to her  he was a belgian madam he was seriously wounded at the commencement of the war we took him direct from the hospital  i hope the poor fellow will soon recover lady anselman declared please do not think anything more of the affair so far as we are concerned you must let me know later on how he is  the maitre dhotel retreated with a little bow geraldine turned to captain granet  i think she said that you must be very kindhearted for a soldier  he turned and looked at her  why  you must have been so many horrible sightsso many dead people and yet  well he persisted  there was something in your face when the man staggered back a kind of horror almost i am sure you felt it quite as much as any of us  he was silent for a moment  in a battlefield he observed slowly one naturally becomes a little callous but here it is different the fellow did look ghastly ill didnt he i wonder what was really the matter with him  we shall know when major thomson returns she said  granet seemed scarcely to hear her words a curious fit of abstraction had seized him his head was turned towards the corridor he seemed to be waiting  queer sort of stick thomson he remarked presently is he a great friend of yours miss conyers  she hesitated for a moment  i have known him for some time  something in her tone seemed to disturb him he leaned towards her quickly his face had lost its goodhumoured indifference he was evidently very much in earnest  please dont think me impertinent he begged butis he a very great friend  she did not answer she was looking over his shoulder towards where major thomson who had just returned was answering a little stream of questions  the man is in a shockingly weak state he announced he is a belgian has been wounded and evidently subjected to great privations his heart is very much weakened he had a bad fainting fit but with a long rest he may recover  the little party broke up once more into groups granet who had drawn for a moment apart and seemed to be adjusting the knots of his sling turned to thomson  has he recovered consciousness yet he asked  barely was the terse reply  there was no special cause for his going off like that i suppose  surgeonmajor thomsons silence was scarcely a hesitation he was standing perfectly still his eyes fixed upon the young soldier  at present he said i am not quite clear about that if you are ready geraldine  she nodded and they made their farewells to lady anselman granet looked after them with a slight frown he drew his aunt on one side for a moment  why is miss conyers here without a chaperon he asked and why did she go away with thomson  lady anselman laughed  didnt she tell you  tell me what he insisted eagerly  lady anselman looked at her nephew curiously  evidently she remarked your progress with the young lady was not so rapid as it seemed or she would have told you her secretwhich bythebye isnt a secret at all she and major thomson are engaged to be married    chapter iii  a few rays of fugitive sunshine were brightening piccadilly when geraldine and her escort left the ritz the momentary depression occasioned by the dramatic little episode of a few minutes ago seemed already to have passed from the girls manner she walked on humming to herself as they paused to cross the road she glanced as though involuntarily at her companion his dark morning clothes and rather abstracted air created an atmosphere of sombreness about him of which she was suddenly conscious  hugh why dont you wear uniform in town she asked  why should i he replied after all i am not really a fighting man you see  its so becoming she sighed  he seemed to catch the reminiscent flash in her eyes as she looked down the street and a shadow of foreboding clouded his mind  you found captain granet interesting  very she assented heartily i think he is delightful dont you  he certainly seems to be a most attractive type of young man thomson admitted  and how wonderful to have had such adventures she continued life has become so strange though during the last few months to think that the only time i ever saw him before was at a polo match and today we sit side by side in a restaurant and although he wont speak of them one knows that he has had all manner of marvellous adventures he was one of those who went straight from the playing fields to look for glory wasnt he hugh he made a hundred and thirtytwo for middlesex the day before the war was declared  thats the type of young soldier whos going to carry us through if any one can major thomson agreed cheerfully  she suddenly clutched at his arm  hugh she exclaimed pointing to a placard which a newsboy was carrying that is the one thing i cannot bear the one thing which i think if i were a man would turn me into a savage  they both paused and read the headlines  passenger steamer torpedoed without warning in the irish sea twentytwo lives lost  that is the sort of thing she groaned which makes one long to be not a man but a god to be able to wield thunderbolts and to deal out hell  good for you gerry a strong fresh voice behind them declared thats my job now didnt you hear us shouting after you olive and i look  her brother waved a telegram  youve got your ship thomson inquired  ive got what i wanted the young man answered enthusiastically ive got a destroyer one of the new typeforty knots an hour a dear little row of fourinch guns and my god something else i hope thatll teach those murderers a lesson he added shaking his fist towards the placard  geraldine laid her hand upon her brothers arm  when do you join ralph  tomorrow night at portsmouth he replied im afraid we shall be several days before we are at work its the scorpion theyre giving me geraldor the mystery ship as they call it in the navy  why she asked  his rather boyish face curiously like his sisters was suddenly transformed  because weve got a rod in pickle for those cursed pirates  conyers thomson interrupted  the young man paused in his sentence thomson was looking towards him with a slight frown upon his forehead  dont think im a fearful old woman he said i know we are all rather fed up with these tales of spies and that sort of thing but do you think its wise to even open your lips about a certain matter  what the dickens do you know about it conyers demanded  nothing thomson assured him hastily nothing at all i am only going by what you said yourself if there is any device on the scorpion for dealing with these infernal craft id never breathe a word about it if i were you id put out to sea with a seal upon my lips even before geraldine here and miss moreton  the young mans cheeks were a little flushed  perhaps youre right he admitted i was a little overexcited to get the scorpion was more even than i had dared to hope for still before the girls it didnt seem to matter very much there are no spies anyhow hiding in the trees of berkeley street he added glancing about them  thomson held up his finger and stopped a taxicab  you wont be annoyed with me will you he said to conyers if youd heard half the stories i had of the things we have given away quite innocently  thats all right the young man interrupted only you mustnt think im a gasbag just because i said a word or two here before gerry and olive and you old fellow  must you go hugh geraldine asked  i am so sorry he replied but i must i really have rather an important appointment this afternoon  an appointment she grumbled you are in london for so short a time and you seem to be keeping appointments all the while i shant let you go unless you tell me what its about  i have to inspect a new pattern of camp bedstead he explained calmly if i may i will telephone directly i am free and see if you are at liberty  she shrugged her shoulders but gave him a pleasant little nod as he stepped into the taxi  sober old stick thomson her brother observed as they started off i didnt like his pulling me up like that but i expect he was right  i dont see what business it was of his and i think it was rather horrid of him olive declared as though gerry or i mattered  a chap like thomson hasnt very much discretion you see ralph conyers remarked youll have to wake him up a bit gerry if you mean to get any fun out of life  there was just the faintest look of trouble in geraldines face she remained perfectly loyal however  some of us take life more seriously than others she sighed hugh is one of them when one remembers all the terrible things he must have seen though it is very hard to find fault with him  they turned into the square and paused before olives turning  youre coming down with me ralph and you too geraldine she invited  conyers shook his head regretfully  im due at the admiralty at four to receive my final instructions he said i must move along at once  the smile suddenly faded from his lips he seemed to be listening to the calling of the newsboys down the street i dont know what my instructions are going to be he continued dropping his voice a little but im sick of making war the way our chaps are doing it if ever im lucky enough to get one of those murderous submarines i can promise you one thingtherell be no survivors  for a moment or two they neither of them spoke from out of the windows of the house before which they were standing came the music of a popular waltz olive turned a way with a little shiver  you think im brutal dear conyers went on as he patted her hand remember ive seen men killedthats what makes the difference olive yes i am different we are all different we whove tackled the job thomsons different your young man at luncheon geraldinewhats his namegranethes different theres something big and serious grown up inside us and the brute is looking out it has to be ill come in later olive tell the mater i shall be home to dinner geraldine the governors waiting down at the admiralty for me goodbye girls  he waved his hand and strode down towards the corner of the square both girls watched him for a few moments his shoulders were as square as ever but something had gone from the springiness of his gait there was nothing left of the sailors jaunty swagger  they are all like that geraldine whispered when theyve been face to face with the real thing and we are only women olive    chapter iv  surgeonmajor thomson had apparently forgotten his appointment to view camp bedsteads for a few minutes after he had left geraldine and her brother his taxicab set him down before a sombrelooking house in adelphi terrace he passed through the open doorway up two flights of stairs drew a key of somewhat peculiar shape from his pocket and opened a door in front of him he found himself in a very small hall from which there was no egress save through yet another door through which he passed and stepped into a large but singularly barelooking apartment three great safes were ranged along one side of the wall piles of newspapers and maps were strewn all over a long table and a huge ordnance map of the french and belgian frontiers stood upon an easel the only occupant of the apartment was a man who was sitting before a typewriter in front of the window he turned his head and rose at thomsons entrance a rather short keenlooking young man his face slightly pitted with smallpox his mouth hard and firm his eyes deepset and bright  anything happened ambrose  a dispatch sir was the brief reply  from the war office  no sir it came direct  thomson drew the thin sheet of paper from its envelope and swept a space for himself at the corner of the table then he unlocked one of the safes and drew out from an inner drawer a parchment book bound in brown vellum he spread out the dispatch and read it carefully it had been handed in at a town near the belgian frontier about eight hours before  fifty thousand camp bedsteads are urgently required for neighbourhood of la guir please do your best for us the matter is urgent double mattress if possible london  for a matter of ten minutes thomson was busy with his pencil and the codebook when he had finished he studied thoughtfully the message which he had transcribed  plans for attack on la guir communicated attack foiled believe smith in london  anything important sir the young man at the typewriter asked  thomson nodded but made no immediate reply he first of all carefully destroyed the message which he had received and the transcription and watched the fragments of paper burn into ashes then he replaced the codebook in the safe which he carefully locked and strolled towards the window he stood for several minutes looking out towards the thames  the same thing has happened again at la guir he said at last  any clue  none they say that he is in london now  the two men looked at one another for a moment in grave silence ambrose leaned back in his chair and frowned heavily  through our lines through boulogne across the channel through dover station out of charingcross through our own men and the best that scotland yard could do for us in london eh  thomsons face twitched convulsively his teeth had come together with a little snap  you neednt play at being headquarters ambrose he said hoarsely i know it seems like a miracle but theres a reason for that  what is it ambrose asked  only a few weeks after the war began thomson continued thoughtfully two french generals four or five colonels and over twenty junior and noncommissioned officers were courtmartialled for espionage the french have been on the lookout for that sort of thing we havent there isnt one of these men who are sitting in judgment upon us today ambrose who would listen to me for a single moment if i were to take the bull by the horns and say that the traitor we seek is one of ourselves  youre right ambrose murmured but do you believe it  i do thomson asserted it isnt only the fact of the attacks themselves miscarrying but its the knowledge on the other side of exactly how best to meet that attack its the exact knowledge they have as to our dispositions our most secret and sudden change of tactics weve suffered enough ambrose in this country from civil spiesthe government are to blame for that but there are plenty of people who go blustering about declaring that two of our cabinet ministers ought to be hung whod turn round and give you the life if you hinted for a moment that the same sort of thing in a far worse degree was going on amongst men who are wearing the kings uniform  its ugly ambrose muttered damned ugly  look at me major thomson continued thoughtfully every secret connected with our present and future plans practically passes through my hands yet no one watches me whisper a word at the war office that perhaps it would be as welljust for a week sayto test a few of my reports and theyd laugh at you with the air of superior beings listening to the chatter of a fool yet what is there impossible about it i may have some secret viceavarice perhaps germany would give me the price of a kingdom for all that i could tell them yet because i am an english officer i am above all suspicion its magnificent ambrose but its damnably foolish  the young man watched his chief for several moments thomson was standing before the window the cold spring light falling full upon his face with its nervous lines and stronglycut immobile features he felt a curious indisposition to speak a queer sort of desire to wait on the chance of hearing more  a single kink in my brain thomson continued a secret weakness perhaps even a dash of lunacy and i might be quite reasonably the masterspy of the world i was in berlin six weeks ago ambrose there wasnt a soul who ever knew it i made no report on purpose  perhaps they knew and said nothing ambrose suggested softly  there was a moments silence thomson seemed to be considering the idea with strange intensity then he shook his head  i think not he decided when the history of this war is written ambrose with flamboyant phrases and copious rhetoric there will be unwritten chapters more dramatic having really more direct effect upon the final issue than even the great battles which have seemed the dominant factors sit tight here ambrose and wait i may be going over to boulogne at any hour  thomson pushed on one side the curtains which concealed an inner room and passed through in a quarter of an hour he reappeared dressed in uniform his tone his bearing his whole manner were changed he walked with a springier step he carried a little cane and he was whistling softly to himself  i am going to one or two places in the tottenham court road by appointment he announced to inspect some new patterns of camp bedsteads you can tell them if they ring up from whitehall that ill report myself later in the evening  curiously enough the other man too had changed as though in sympathetic deference to his superior officer he had become simply the obedient and assiduous secretary  very good sir he said smoothly ill do my best to finish the specifications before you return    chapter v  lord romsey after his luncheonparty spent an hour at his official residence in whitehall and made two other calls on his way home his secretary met him in the spacious hall of his house in portland square a few moments after he had resigned his coat and hat to the footman  there is a gentleman here to see you who says that he made an appointment by telephone sir he announced his name is sidneythe reverend horatio sidney he calls himself  lord romsey stood for a moment without reply his lips had come together in a hard unpleasant line it was obvious that this was by no means a welcome visitor  i gave no appointment ainsley he remarked i simply said that i would see the gentleman when he arrived in england you had better bring him to my study he continued and be careful that no one interrupts us  the young man withdrew and the cabinet minister made his way to his study a little of the elasticity however had gone from his footsteps and he seated himself before his desk with the air of a man who faces a disagreeable quarter of an hour he played for a moment with a penholder  the skeleton in the cupboard he muttered to himself gloomily even the greatest of us he added with a momentary return of his more inflated self have them  there was a knock at the door and the secretary reappeared ushering in this undesired visitor  this is mr sidney sir he announced quietly  the cabinet minister rose in his place and held out his hand in his best official style a discrete mixture of reserve and condescension his manner changed however the moment the door was closed he withdrew his hand which the other had made no attempt to grasp  i am according you the interview you desire he said pointing to a chair but i shall be glad if you will explain the purport of your visit in as few words as possible you will i hope appreciate the fact that your presence here is a matter of grave embarrassment to me  mr sidney bowed he was a tall and apparently an elderly man dressed with the utmost sobriety he accepted the chair without undue haste adjusted a pair of hornrimmed spectacles and took some papers from his pocket  sir he began speaking deliberately but without any foreign accent i am here to make certain proposals to you on behalf of a person who at your own request shall be nameless  lord romsey frowned ponderously and tapped the desk by his side with his thick forefinger  i cannot prevent your speaking of course he said but i wish you to understand from the first that i am not in a position to deal with any messages or communications from your master whoever he may be or any one else in your country  nevertheless the other remarked drily my message must be delivered  an impulse of curiosity struggled through the gloom and apprehension of lord romseys manner he gazed at his visitor with knitted brows  who are you he demanded an englishman  it is of no consequence was the colourless reply  but it is of consequence lord romsey insisted you have dared to proclaim yourself an ambassador to me from a country with whom england is at war even a discussion between us amounts almost to treason on second thoughts i decline to receive you  he held out his hand towards the electric bell which stood on his study table his visitor shook his head  i wouldnt adopt that attitude if i were you he said calmly you know why if you are really curious about my nationality there is no harm in telling you that i am an american citizen that i have held for three years the post of american chaplain at brussels better let me say what i have come to say  lord romsey hesitated his natural propensity for temporising asserted itself and his finger left the bell the other continued  you are in the unfortunate position lord romsey of having failed absolutely in your duty towards your own country and having grossly and traitorously deceived a personage who has always treated you with the greatest kindness i am here to see if it is possible for you to make some amends  i deny every word you say the minister declared passionately and i refuse to hear your proposition  mr sidneys manner suddenly changed he leaned forward in his chair  do not be foolish he advised your last letter to a certain personage was dated june second i have a copy of it with me shall i read it to you word by word  thank you i remember enough of it lord romsey groaned  you will listen then to what i have to say the envoy proceeded or that letter will be published in the times tomorrow morning you know what that will meanyour political ruin your everlasting disgrace what use will this country blinded at the present moment by prejudice have for a statesman who without authority pledged his government to an alliance with germany who over his own signature  stop lord romsey interrupted there is no purpose in this what is it you want  your influence in the cabinet you are responsible for this war it is for you to end it  rubbish the other exclaimed hoarsely you are attempting to saddle me with a responsibility like this simply because my personal sympathies have always been on the side of the country you are representing  it is not a question of your personal sympathies mr sidney returned swiftly in black and white you pledged your government to abstain from war against germany  how could i tell the statesman protested that germany was thinking of tearing up treaties of entering into a campaign of sheer and scandalous aggression  you made no stipulations or conditions in what you wrote was the calm reply you pledged your word that your government would never declare war against germany you alluded to the french entente as an unnatural one you spoke eloquently of the kinship of spirit between england and germany  lord romsey moved uneasily in his chair he had expected to find this an unpleasant interview and he was certainly not being disappointed  well i was mistaken he admitted what i said was true enough i never did believe that the government with which i was associated would declare war against germany even now let me tell you that there isnt a soul breathing who knows how close the real issue was if your people had only chosen any other line of advance  i have not come here to recriminate mr sidney declared that is not my mission i am here to state our terms for refraining from sending your lettersyour personal letters to the kaiserto the english press  lord romsey sprang to his feet  good god man do you know what you are saying he exclaimed  perfectly the other replied i told you that my errand was a serious one shall i proceed  the minister slowly resumed his seat from behind the electric lamp his face was ghastly white in that brief pause which followed he seemed to be looking through the walls of the room into an ugly chapter of his future he saw the headlines in the newspapers the leading articles the culmination of all the gossip and mutterings of the last few months the end of his political careera disgraceful and ignoble end surely no man had ever been placed in so painful a predicament it was treason to parley it was disgraceful to send this man away  germany wants peace his visitor continued calmly she may not have accomplished all she wished to have accomplished by this war and she is still as strong as ever from a military point of view but she wants peace i need say no more than that  lord romsey shook his head  even if i had the influence which i havent he began it isnt a matter of the government at all the country would never stand it  then you had better convert the country was the prompt reply look upon it as your duty remember thisyou are the man in all this world and not the kaiser who is responsible for this war but for your solemn words pledging your country to neutrality germany would never have forced the issue as she has done now it is for you to repair the evil i tell you that we want peace the first overtures may come ostensibly through washington if you will but they must come in reality from you  the minister leaned back in his chair his was the calmness of despair  you might as well ask me he said simply to order our fleet out of the north sea  mr sidney rose to his feet  i think he advised that you had better try what you can do lord romsey we shall give you little time we may even extend it if we find traces of your influence you have two colleagues at least who are pacifists at heart take them on one side talk in a whisper at first plant just a little seed but be careful that it grows we do not expect impossibilities onlyremember what failure will mean to you  lord romsey looked steadfastly at his visitor mr sidney was tall and spare and there was certainly nothing of the teuton or the american in his appearance or accent his voice was characterless his restraint almost unnatural relieved of his more immediate fears the minister was conscious of a renewed instinct of strong curiosity  how can i communicate with you mrsidney he asked  in no way the other replied when i think it advisable i shall come to see you again  are you an american or a german or an englishman  i am whichever i choose for the moment was the cool response if you doubt my credentials i can perhaps establish myself in your confidence by repeating the conversation which took place between you and the kaiser on the terrace of the imperial palace at potsdam between three and four oclock on the afternoon of april the seventh you gave the kaiser a little character sketch of your colleagues in the cabinet and you treated with ridicule the bare idea that one or two of them at any rate would ever consent  that will do the minister interrupted hoarsely  just as you will the other observed i wish you goodday sir the issue is before you now quite plainly let us soon be able to appreciate the effect of your changed attitude  lord romsey touched his bell in silence and his visitor took a grave and decorous leave he walked with the secretary down the hall  these are sad days for all of us he said benignly i have been telling lord romsey of some of my experiences in brussels i was american chaplain at the new church there when the war broke out i have seen sights which i shall never forget horrors the memory of which will never leave me  the secretary nodded sympathetically he was trying to get off early however and he had heard a good deal already about belgium  will you let one of the servants fetch you a taxicab he suggested  i prefer to walk a little distance mr sidney replied i am quite at home in london i was once in fact invited to take up a pastorate here i wish you goodday sir i have had a most interesting conversation with your chief a conversation which will dwell for a long time in my memory  the secretary bowed and mr sidney walked slowly to the corner of the square arrived there he hailed a passing taxicab which drew up at once by the side of the kerb in stepping in he brushed the shoulder of a man who had paused to light a cigarette he lingered for a moment to apologise  i beg your pardon he commenced  for a single moment his selfpossession seemed to desert him he looked into the cold incurious face of the man in an officers uniform who was already moving away as though he had seen a ghost his hesitation was a matter of seconds only however  it was very clumsy of me he concluded  major thomson touched his cap as he moved off  quite all right he said serenely    chapter vi  the room was a study in masculine luxury the brown walls were hung with a choice selection of sporting prints varied here and there with silverpoint etchings of beautiful women in various poses there were a good many photographs mostly signed above the mantelpiece a cigar cabinet a case of sportingrifles and shot guns some fishing tackle a case of books distributed appropriately about the apartment there were some warlike trophies displayed without ostentation a handsome writingtable on which stood a telephone on a thick green rug stretched in front of the fireplace a fox terrier lay blinking at the wood fire the room was empty and silent except for the slow ticking of an ancient clock which stood underneath an emblazoned coat of arms in the far corner the end of a log broke off and fell hissing into the hearth the fox terrier rose reluctantly to his feet shook himself and stood looking at the smoking fragment in an aggrieved manner satisfied that no personal harm was intended to him however he presently curled himself up once more again the apartment seemed to become the embodiment of repose the clock after a hoarse wheezing warning struck seven the dog opened one eye and looked up at it a few minutes later the peace of the place was broken in a different fashion there was the sound of a key being hastily fitted into the lock of the outside door the dog rose to his feet expectantly the door which led into the apartment was thrown open and hastily slammed to a man breathing heavily stood for a moment upon the threshold his head stooped a little as though listening then without a glance even at the dog who jumped to greet him he crossed the room with swift stealthy footsteps before he could reach the other side however the door which faced him was opened a manservant looked inquiringly out  my bath and clothes jarvis like hell  the man gilded away his master following close behind from somewhere further inside the flat the sound of water running into a bath was heard the door was closed again there was silence the fox terrier after a few moments scratching at the door resumed his place upon the rug and curled himself up to renewed slumber  the next interruption was of a different nature the sharp insistent summons of an electric bell from outside rang through the room in a moment or two the manservant appeared from the inner apartment crossed the floor and presently reappeared ushering in a visitor  captain granet is changing for dinner at present sir he explained if you will take a seat however he will be out presently what name shall i say  surgeonmajor thomson  the servant wheeled an easychair up towards the fire and placed by its side a small table on which were some illustrated papers then with a little bow he disappeared through the inner door major thomson who had been fingering the sketch laid it down the moment the door was closed he leaned forward his face a little strained he had the air of listening intently after a brief absence the man returned  captain granet will be with you in a few moments sir he announced  please ask him not to hurry major thomson begged  certainly sir  the man withdrew and once more thomson and the dog were alone the latter having made a few overtures of friendship which passed unnoticed resumed his slumbers major thomson sat upright in his easychair an illustrated paper in his hand all the time however his eyes seemed to be searching the room his sense of listening was obviously quickened he had the air even of thinking rapidly fiveten minutes passed then voices were heard from within and the door was suddenly opened captain granet emerged and crossed the room hobbling slightly towards his visitor  awfully sorry to keep you like this he remarked pleasantly the fact is id just got into my bath  i ought to apologise his visitor replied for calling at such a time  glad to see you anyway the other declared pausing at his smokingcabinet and bringing out some cigarettes try one of these wont you  not just now thanks  there was a moments pause major thomson seemed in no hurry to explain himself  jolly luncheon party wasnt it granet remarked lighting a cigarette for himself with some difficulty what an idiot it makes a fellow feel to be strapped up like this  from what one reads of the fighting around ypres the other replied you were lucky to get out of it so well let me explain if i may why i have paid you this rather untimely call  captain granet nodded amiably he had made himself comfortable in an easychair and was playing with the dog who had jumped on to his knee  i had some conversation on thursday last major thomson began with the provostmarshal of boulogne as you of course know we have suffered a great deal especially around ypres from the marvellous success of the german intelligence department the provostmarshal who is a friend of mine told me that there was a special warning out against a person purporting to be an american chaplain who had escaped from belgium you dont happen to have heard of him i suppose do you  captain granet looked doubtful  cant remember that i have he replied theyve been awfully clever those fellows though the last few nights before our little scrap they knew exactly what time our relief parties came along several times we changed the hour no use they were on to us just the same  major thompson nodded  well he continued i happened to catch sight of a man who exactly resembled the photograph which my friend the provostmarshal showed me only a few minutes ago and although i could not be sure of it i fancied that he entered this building it occurred to me that he might be paying a call upon you  upon me he repeated  he is an exceedingly plausible fellow thomson explained and as you are just back from the front and brought dispatches he might very possibly regard you as a likely victim  cant make bricks without straw granet laughed and i know no more about the campaign than my two eyes have seen i was saying only yesterday that unless you have a staff billet its wonderful how little the ordinary soldier picks up as to what is going on as a matter of fact though he went on twisting the fox terriers ear a little no one has called here at all except yourself during the last hour or two there arent many of my pals know im back yet  are there many other people living in the building major thomson asked  the groundfloor here the other replied belongs to a prosperous cigarette manufacturer who lives himself upon the first floor this is the second and above us are nothing but the servants quarters i should think he concluded thoughtfully that you must have been mistaken about the fellow turning in here at all  thomson nodded  very likely he admitted it was just a chance any way  bythebye granet inquired curiously looking up from the dog how did you know that i roomed here  i happened to see you come in or was it go out the other dayi cant remember which major thomson replied  the telephone upon the table tinkled out a summons granet crossed the room and held the receiver to his ear  this is captain granet speaking he said who are you please  the reply seemed to surprise him he glanced across at his visitor  i shall be delighted he answered into the instrument it is really very kind of you about a quarter past eight certainly youll excuse my not being able to get into mufti wont you ever so many thanks goodbye  he laid down the receiver and turned to thomson  rather a coincidence he observed seems i am going to see you tonight at dinner that was miss geraldine conyers who just rang upasked me if id like to meet her brother again before he goes off he is spending the afternoon at the admiralty and she thought i might be interested  major thomsons face was expressionless and his murmured word noncommittal granet had approached the dark mahogany sideboard and was fingering some bottles  let me mix you a cocktail he suggested by jove that fellow conyers would be the fellow for your american chaplain to get hold of if he is spending the afternoon down at the admiralty hell have all the latest tips about how they mean to deal with the submarines i hear there are at least three or four new inventions which they are keeping dark you like yours dry i suppose  thomson had risen to his feet and leaned forward towards the mirror for a moment to straighten his tie when he turned around he glanced at the collection of bottles granet had been handling  i am really very sorry he said i did not mean to put you to this trouble i never drink cocktails  granet paused in shaking the silver receptacle and laid it down  have a whisky and soda instead  thomson shook his head  if you will excuse me he said i will drink your health at dinnertime i have no doubt that your cocktails are excellent but i never seem to have acquired the habit what do you put in them  oh just both sorts of vermouth and gin and a dash of something to give it a flavour granet explained carelessly  thomson touched a small black bottle smelt it and put it down  whats that he asked  a mixture of absinth and some west indian bitters granet replied a chap who often goes to the states brought it back for me gives a cocktail the real yankee twang he says  thomson nodded slowly  rather a curious odour he remarked we shall meet again then captain granet  they walked towards the door granet held it open leaning upon his stick  many times i trust he observed politely  there was a seconds pause his right hand was half extended but his departing guest seemed not to notice the fact he merely nodded and put on his hat  it is a small world he said especially although it sounds paradoxical in the big places  he passed out granet listened to the sound of his retreating footsteps with a frown upon his forehead then he came back and stood for a moment upon the rug in front of the fire deep in thought the fox terrier played unnoticed about his feet his face seemed suddenly to have become older and more thoughtful he glanced at the card which thomson had left upon the sideboard  surgeonmajor thomson he repeated quietly to himself i wonder  thomson walked slowly to the end of sackville street crossed the road and made his way to the ritz hotel he addressed himself to the head clerk of the reception counter  i am surgeonmajor thomson he announced  i was lunching here today and attended one of the waiters who was taken ill afterwards i should be very glad to know if i can see him for a few moments  the man bowed politely  i remember you quite well sir he said a belgian waiter was it not he has been taken away by a lady this afternoon  taken away thomson repeated puzzled  the lady who was giving the luncheonlady anselmancalled and saw the manager about an hour ago the man explained she has interested herself very much in the matter of belgian refugees and is entertaining a great many of them at a house of hers near the seaside the man is really not fit to work so we were very glad indeed to pass him on to her  he recovered consciousness before he was removed i suppose thomson inquired  i believe so sir he seemed very weak and ill though in fact he had to be carried to the automobile  i suppose he didnt give any reason for his sudden attack  none that i am aware of sir  thomson stood for a moment deep in thought then he turned away from the desk  thank you very much indeed he said to the clerk the mans case rather interested me i think i shall ask lady anselman to allow me to visit him where did you say the house was  her ladyship did not mention the exact locality the man replied i believe however that it is near the isle of wight  a most suitable neighbourhood major thomson murmured as he turned away from the hotel    chapter vii  i wonder why you dont like captain granet geraldine asked her fiance as they stood in the drawingroom waiting for dinner  not like him thomson repeated have i really given you that impression geraldine  the girl nodded  perhaps i ought not to say that though she confessed you are never particularly enthusiastic about people are you  one of his rare smiles transfigured his face he leaned a little towards her  not about many people geraldine he whispered  she made a charming little grimace but a moment afterwards she was serious again  but really she continued to me captain granet seems just the type of young englishman who is going to save the country he is a keen soldier clever modest and a wonderful sportsman i cant think what there is about him for any one to dislike  major thomson glanced across the room in a way he and the man whom he felt instinctively was in some sense of the word his rival even though an undeclared one were of exactly opposite types granet was the centre of a little group of people who all seemed to be hanging upon his conversation he was full of high spirits and humour debonair with all the obvious claims to popularity thomson on the other hand although goodlooking even distinguished in his way was almost too slim and pale his face was more the face of a scholar than of one interested in or anxious to shine in the social side of life his manners and his speech were alike reserved his air of breeding was apparent but he had not the natural ease or charm which was making granet even in those few minutes persona grata with geraldines mother and a little circle of newlyarrived guests  at least i appreciate your point of view major thomson admitted with a faint sigh  dont be such a dear old stick geraldine laughed i want you to like him because i find him so interesting you see as he gets to know one a little better he doesnt seem to mind talking about the war you others will scarcely say a word of what you have seen or of what is being done out there i like to be told things by people who have actually seen them he happened to be ten minutes early this evening and he gave me a most fascinating description of some skirmishing near la bassee  you must remember thomson told her that personally i do not in an ordinary way see a great deal of fighting until the whole show is over it may be a fine enough panorama when an attack is actually taking place but there is nothing very inspiring in the modern battlefield when the living have passed away from it  geraldine shivered for a moment  really i almost wish that you were a soldier too she declared your work seems to me so horribly gruesome come along you know you are going to take me to dinner think of something nice to say i really want to be amused  i will make a suggestion then he remarked as they took their places i dont know whether you will find it amusing though why shouldnt we do like so many of our friends and get married  she stared at him for a moment then she laughed heartily  hugh she exclaimed i can see through you youve suddenly realised that this is your chance to escape a ceremony and a reception and all that sort of thing i call it a most cowardly suggestion  it rather appeals to me he persisted it may be he added dropping his voice a little because you are looking particularly charming this evening or it may be  she looked at him curiously  go on please she murmured  or it may be he repeated a mans desire to be absolutely sure of the thing he wants more than anything else in the world  there was a moments silence as though by some curious instinct which they both shared they glanced across the table to where granet had become the centre of a little babble of animated conversation geraldine averted her eyes almost at once and looked down at her plate there was a shade of uneasiness in her manner  you sounds very serious hugh she observed  that is rather a failing of mine isnt it he replied at any rate i am very much in earnest  there was another brief silence during which geraldine was addressed by her neighbour on the other side thomson who was watching her closely fancied that she accepted almost eagerly the opportunity of diversion it was not until dinner was almost over that she abandoned a conversion into which she had thrown herself with spirit  my little suggestion thomson reminded her remains unanswered  she looked down at her plate  i dont think you are really in earnest she said  am i usually a farceur he replied i think that my tendencies are rather the other way i really mean it geraldine shall we talk about it later on this evening  if you like she agreed simply but somehow i believe that i would rather wait look at mothers eye roving around the table give me my gloves please hugh dont be long  thomson moved his chair next to his hosts geraldines father admiral sir seymour conyers was a very garrulous old gentleman with fixed ideas about everything a little deaf and exceedingly fond of conversation he proceeded to give his prospective soninlaw a detailed lecture concerning the mismanagement of the field hospitals at the front and having disposed of that subject he opened a broadside attack upon the admiralty the rest of the men showed indications of breaking into little groups ralph conyers and granet were sitting side by side engrossed in conversation more than once thomson glanced towards them  wish i understood more about naval affairs granet sighed im a perfect ass at any ones job but my own i cant see how you can deal with submarines at all the beggars can stay under the water as long as they like they just pop up and show their heads and if they dont like the look of anything near down they go again i dont see how you can get at them any way  the young sailor smiled in a somewhat superior manner  weve a few ideas left still which the germans havent mopped up he declared  personally the admiral observed joining in the conversation i consider the submarine danger the greatest to which this country has yet been exposed no one but a nation of pirates of ferocious and conscienceless huns could have inaugurated such a campaign  good for you dad his son exclaimed theyre a rotten lot of beggars of course although some of them have behaved rather decently theres one thing he added sipping his port there isnt a job in the world id sooner take on than submarine hunting  every one to his taste granet remarked goodhumouredly give me my own company at my back my artillery well posted my reserves in position the enemy not too strongly entrenched and our dear old colonels voice shouting at them boys thats my idea of a scrap  there was a little murmur of sympathy ralph conyers however his cigar in the corner of his mouth smiled imperturbably  sounds all right he admitted but for sheer excitement give me a misty morning the bows of a fortyknot destroyer cutting the sea into diamonds decks cleared for action and old dick in oilskins on the saluteenemys submarine sir on the port bow sir  and what would you do then granet asked  see page seven admiralty instructions this afternoon the other replied smiling were not taking it sitting down i can tell you  the admiral rose and pushed back his chair  i think he said if you are quite sure all of you that you will take no more port we should join the ladies  they trooped out of the room together thomson kept close behind ralph conyers and captain granet who were talking no more of submarines however but of the last ballet at the empire geraldine came towards them as they entered the drawingroom  hugh she begged passing her arm through his would you mind playing bridge the mulliners are going on and mother does miss her rubber so and we can talk afterwards if you like she added  thomson glanced across the room to where granet was chatting with some other guests young conyers for the moment was nowhere to be seen  ill play with pleasure geraldine he assented but i want to have a word with ralph first  hes at the telephone she said the admiralty rang up about something and he is talking to them ill tell him if you like when he comes up  if youll do that thomson promised i wont keep him a minute  the little party settled down to their gamelady conyers sir charles hankinsa celebrated lawyeranother man and thomson geraldine with olive moreton and captain granet found a sofa in a remote corner of the room and the trio were apparently talking nonsense with great success presently ralph reappeared and joined them  hugh wants to speak to you geraldine told him  ralph glanced at the little bridgetable and made a grimace  hugh can wait he declared as he passed his arm through olives this is my last night on shore for heaven knows how long and i am going to take olive off to see my photographs of the scorpion old wilcock handed them to me out of his drawer this afternoon  the two young people disappeared captain granet and geraldine remained upon the couch talking in low voices once thomson when he was dummy crossed the room and approached them their conversation was suddenly suspended  i told ralph geraldine said looking up that you wanted to speak to him but he and olive have gone off somewhere bythebye hugh she went on curiously you didnt tell me that youd called on captain granet this evening  well it wasnt a matter of vital importance was it he answered smiling my call in any case arose from an accident  major thomson came a voice from the other side of the room it is your deal  thomson returned obediently to the bridgetable the rubber was over a few minutes later and the little party broke up thomson glanced around but the room was empty  i think if i may he said ill go into the morning room and have a whisky and soda i dare say ill find the admiral there  he took his leave of the others and made his way to the bachelor rooms at the back of the house he looked first into the little apartment which geraldine claimed for her own but found it empty he passed on into the smokingroom and found all four of the young people gathered around the table they were so absorbed that they did not even notice his entrance ralph with a sheet of paper stretched out before him and a pencil in his hand was apparently sketching something by his side was granet the two girls with arms interlocked were watching intently  you see ralph conyers explained drawing back for a moment to look at the result of his labours this scheme properly worked out can keep a channel route such as the folkestone to boulogne one for instance perfectly safe those black marks are floats and the nets  one moment ralph thomson interrupted from the background  they all started and turned their heads thomson drew a step nearer and his hand fell upon the paper there was a queer look in his face which geraldine was beginning to recognise  ralph old fellow he said dont think me too much of an interfering beggar will you i dont think even to your dearest friend not to the girl you are going to marry to me or to your own mother would i finish that little drawing and description if i were you  they all stared at him granets face was expressionless the girls were bewildered ralph was frowning  dash it all hugh he expostulated do have a little common sense heres a fellow like granet a keen soldier and one of the best doing all he can for us on land but a bit worried about our submarine danger why shouldnt i try and reassure him ehlet him see that weve a few little things up our sleeves  that sounds all right ralph thomson agreed but youre departing from a principle and i wouldnt do it it isnt a personal risk youre running or a personal secret youre sharing with others it may sound absurd under the present circumstances i know but  granet laughed lightly his arm fell upon the young sailors shoulder  perhaps thomsons right conyers he intervened you keep your old scheme at the back of your head well know all about it when the history of the wars written theres always the thousand to one chance you know i might get brain fever in a german hospital and begin to babble tear it up old fellow  there was a moments silence geraldine turned to thomson  hugh she protested dont you think youre carrying principle almost too far its so fearfully interesting for us when ralphs at sea and we wait day by day for news from him to understand a little what hes doing  i think youre a horrid nuisance major thomson olive grumbled wed just reached the exciting part  i am sorry thomson said but i think ralph you had better do what captain granet suggested  the young man shrugged his shoulders his face was a little sulky he took the plan up and tore it into pieces  if you werent my prospective brotherinlaw you know thomson he exclaimed i should call your interference damned cheek after all you know youre only a civilian and you cant be expected to understand these things  thomson was silent for a moment he read in the others faces their sympathy with the young sailors complaint he moved towards the door  i am sorry he said simply good night everybody  they all wished him goodnightnobody stirred he walked slowing into the front hall waited for a moment and then accepted his coat and hat from a servant lady conyers waved to him from the staircase  wheres geraldine she asked  thomson turned away  they are all in the smokingroom lady conyers he said good night    chapter viii  in a way their meeting the next morning was fortuitous enough yet it had also its significance for both of them geraldines greeting was almost studiously formal  you are not going to scold me for my memory are you captain granet asked looking down at her with a faintly humorous uplifting of the eyebrows i must have exercise you know  i dont even remember telling you that i came into the park in the mornings geraldine replied  you didntthat is to say you didnt mention the park particularly he admitted you told me you always took these five dogs out for a walk directly after breakfast and for the rest i used my intelligence  i might have gone into regents park or st james park she reminded him  in which case he observed i should have walked up and down until i had had enough of it and then gone away in a bad temper  dont be foolish she laughed i decline absolutely to believe that you had a single thought of me when you turned in here do you mind if i say that i prefer not to believe it  he accepted the reproof gracefully  well since we do happen to have met he suggested might i walk with you a little way you see he went on its rather dull hobbling along here all alone  of course you may if you like she assented glancing sympathetically at his stick how is your leg getting on  its bettergetting on finely so far as my leg is concerned i believe i shall be fit to go out again within ten days its my arm that bothers me a little one of the nerves the doctor said must be wrong i can only just lift it youve no idea he went on how a game leg and a trussedup arm interfere with the little round of ones daily life i cant ride cant play golf or billiards and for an unintelligent chap like me he wound up with a sigh there arent a great many other ways of passing the time  why do you call yourself unintelligent she protested you couldnt have got through your soldiering so well if you had been  oh i know all the soldier stuff he admitted know my job that is to say all right and of course i am moderately good at languages but that finishes me i havent any brains like your friend thomson for instance  major thomson is very clever i believe she said a little coldly  and a little censorious i am afraid granet added with a slight grimace i suppose he thinks i am a garrulous sort of ass but i really cant see why he needed to go for your brother last night just because he was gratifying a very reasonable curiosity on my part it isnt as though i wasnt in the service the army and the navy are the same thing any way and we are always glad to give a navy man a hint as to how we are getting on  i really couldnt quite understand major thomson myself she agreed  may i askdo you mind he beganhave you been engaged to him long  she looked away for a moment her tone when she replied was meant to convey some slight annoyance at the question  about three months  captain granet kicked a pebble away from the path in front of him with his sound foot  i should think he must be a very good surgeon he remarked in a measured tone looks as though he had lots of nerve and that sort of thing to tell you the truth though he rather frightens me i dont think that he has much sympathy with my type  she became a little more indulgent and smiled faintly as she looked at him  i wonder what your type is she asked reflectively  fairly obvious i am afraid he confessed with a sigh i love my soldiering of course and i am ashamed to think how keen i have been on games and should be still if i had the chance outside that i dont read much i am not musical and i am very much predisposed to let the future look after itself there are thousands just like me he continued thoughtfully we dont do any particular harm in the world but i dont suppose we do much good  dont be silly she protested for one thing it is splendid to be a capable soldier you are just what the country wants today but apart from that i am quite sure that you have brains  have i he murmured perhaps its the incentive i lack  they were silent for a few moments then they began to talk more lightly they discussed dogs and horses their mutual friends and their engagements for the next few days they did not once refer to thomson presently geraldine paused to speak to some friends granet leaned upon his stick in the background and watched her she was wearing a plain tailor made suit and a becoming little hat from underneath which little wisps of golden hair had somehow detached themselves in a fascinating disorder there was a delicate pink colour in her cheeks the movements and lines of her body were all splendidly free and graceful as she talked to her friends her eyes for the moment seemed to have lost their seriousness her youth had reasserted itselfher youth and splendid physical health he watched her eagerly and some shadow seemed to pass from his own facethe shadow of his suffering or his pain he too seemed to grow younger the simplest and yet the most wonderful joy in life was thrilling him at last she bade farewell to her friends and came smiling towards him  i am so sorry to have kept you all this time she exclaimed lady anne has just told me the time and i am horrified i meant to walk here for an hour and we have been here for two stop that taxi for me please i cannot spare the time even to walk home  he handed her into the cab and whistled for the dogs who all scrambled in after her  thanks to much for looking after a helpless cripple he said pleasantly as they shook hands you mustnt grudge the time doing your duty to the country you know  he tactfully avoided any mention of a future meeting and was rewarded with a little wave of her hand from the window of the cab he himself left the park at the same time strolled along piccadilly as far as sackville street and let himself into his rooms his servant came forward to meet him from the inner room and took his cap and stick  any telephone messages jarvis  nothing sir  granet moved towards the easychair on the way he stopped the door of one of the cupboards in the sideboard was half open he frowned  havent i told you jarvis that i wish those cupboards kept locked he asked a little curtly  the man was staring towards the sideboard in some surprise  i am very sorry sir he said i certainly believed that i locked it last night  granet opened it wide and looked inside his first glance was careless enough then his expression changed he stared incredulously at the small array of bottles and turned swiftly around  have you moved anything from here  certainly not sir was the prompt reply  granet closed the cupboard slowly then he walked to the window for a moment his hands behind his back  any one been here this morning at all jarvis he inquired  a man for the laundry sir and a person to test the electric light  left alone in the room at all  the electric light man was here for a few minutes sir  the master and servant exchanged quick glances the latter was looking pale and nervous  is anything missing sir he asked  yes granet replied did you notice the gentleman who called last eveningsurgeonmajor thomson  yes sir  you havent seen him since he hasnt been here  no sir  granet stood for a moment thinking the servant remained motionless the silence in the room was ominous so also was the strange look of disquietude in the two mens faces  jarvis his master said at last remember this i am not finding fault i know you are always careful but from tonight be more vigilant than ever there is a new hand in the game he may not suspect us yet but he will you understand jarvis  perfectly sir  the man withdrew noiselessly once more granet walked to the window he looked down for a few minutes at the passersby but he saw nothing grave thoughts were gathering together in his mind he was travelling along the road of horrors and at the further end of it a man stood waiting he saw himself draw nearer and nearer to the meeting his name almost frame itself upon his lips the name of the man whom he had grown to hate    chapter ix  considering the crowded state of the waitingroom and the number of highly important people who were there for the same purpose surgeonmajor thomson seemed to have remarkably little difficulty in procuring the interview he desired he was conducted by a boy scout into a room on the second floor of the war office within a few minutes of his arrival a tall greyhaired man in the uniform of a general looked up and nodded with an air of intimacy as soon as the door had been closed  sit down thomson weve been expecting you any news  i have come to you for that sir the other replied  the general sighed  i am afraid you will be disappointed he said i received your report and i went to a certain official myselfsaw him in his own house before breakfast this morning i had reports of three other men occupying responsible positions in the city thomson against whom there was really tangible and serious evidence our friend had the effrontery almost to laugh at me  there was a little glitter in thomsons eyes  these damned civilians he murmured softly theyve done their best to ruin great britain by crabbing every sort of national service during the last ten years they feed and pamper the vermin who are eating away the foundations of the country and damn it all when we put a clear case to them when we show them men whom we know to be dangerous they laugh at us and tell us that it isnt our department they look upon us as amateurs and speak of scotland yard with bated breath my god if i had a free hand for ten minutes thered be two cabinet ministers eating bread and water instead of their dinners tonight  the general raised his eyebrows he knew thomson well enough to be aware how unusual such an ebullition of feeling on his part was  got you a bit worked up major he remarked  isnt it enough to make any mans blood boil the other replied the country today looks to its army and its navy to save it from the humiliation these blackcoated parasites have encouraged and yet even now we havent a free hand you and i who control the secret service of the army denounce certain men upon no slight evidence either as spies and we are laughed at one of those very blatant idiots whose blundering is costing the country millions of money and thousands of brave men has still enough authority to treat our reports as so much waste paper  i am bound to say i agree with you thomson the general declared a little hopelessly its the weakest spot of our whole organisation this depending on the civil powers two of my cases were absolutely flagrant as regards yours thomson i am not at all sure that we shouldnt be welladvised to get just a little more evidence before we press the matter  and meanwhile thomson retorted bitterly leave him a free hand to do what mischief he can but for the merest accident in the world the night before last he would have learnt our new scheme for keeping the channel communication free from submarines  the general frowned  whos been talking he demanded  no one who is to be blamed thomson replied cant you realise the position heres a fellow service man a soldier a d s o who has been specially mentioned for bravery and who very nearly got the victoria cross comes here with the halo of a brilliant escape from the germans wounded a young man of good family and connections and apparently as keen as mustard to get back again in the fighting line good heavens the most careful sailor in the world might just drop a hint to that sort of man what nearly happened last night may happen a dozen times within the next week even our great secret general thomson continued dropping his voice a little even that might come to his ears  the general was undoubtedly disturbed he searched amongst the papers on his desk and brought out at last a flimsy halfsheet of notepaper which he studied carefully  just read this thomson  thomson rose and looked over his shoulder the letter was an autograph one of a few lines only and dated from a village in the north of france  my dear brice  this is a special request to you arrange it any way you please but dont send me captain granet out again in any capacity keep him at home mind i am not saying word against him as a soldier he has done some splendid work on more than one occasion but notwithstanding this i do not wish to see him again with any of the forces under my command                                    ever yours                                              f  did you show this to our friend thomson inquired  i gave him a digest of its contents the general replied he smiled in a supercilious manner and said i had better do as i was asked  thomson said nothing for a moment his face was very set and he had the air of a man desperately but quietly angry  as a matter of fact general brice continued glancing at the clock on his desk granet is in my anteroom at the present moment i expect he asked for an interview this afternoon  have him in if you dont mind the other suggested i can sit at the empty desk over there i can be making some calculations with reference to the number of hospital beds for each transport i want to hear him talk to you  the general nodded and touched a bell  you can show captain granet in he told the boy scout who answered it  thomson took his place in the far corner of the room and bent over a sheaf of papers presently granet was ushered in he was leaning a little less heavily upon his stick and he had taken his arm from the sling for a moment he saluted the general respectfully and glanced across the room towards where thomson was at work if he recognised him however he made no sign  well granet the general inquired how are you getting on  wonderfully sir was the brisk reply i have seen my own doctor this morning and he thinks i might come up before the board on saturday  and what does that mean  i want to get back again sir granet replied eagerly  the general stroked his grey moustache and looked searchingly at the young officer he was standing full in the light of a ray of sunshine which came streaming through the high uncurtained windows although he was still a little haggard his eyes were bright his lips were parted in an anticipatory smile his whole expression was engaging general brice studying him closely felt compelled to admit the improbability of his vague suspicions  thats all very well you know he reminded him quietly but you wont be fit enough for active service for some time to come  the young mans face fell  i am sure they must be wanting me back sir he said naively  the general shook his head  i dont want to disappoint you young fellow he continued but i heard from your brigadier only yesterday he has been obliged to fill up your place and i dont think he has room for any one on his staff  granet looked a little hurt  i thought he might have made a temporary appointment he said gloomily  this is no time to consider individuals the general pointed out what about finding you a billet at home for a time eh youve seen a bit of the rough side of the war you know  id sooner go out and dig trenches  thomson had risen slowly from his place and with a sheet of foolscap in his hand closely covered with writing crossed the room  you might get taken prisoner again captain granet he remarked drily  there was a moments rather tense silence the young mans lips had come together his eyes flashed  i did not recognise you major thomson he said calmly have you found a new billet  my old one is sufficiently absorbing just at present the other replied laying his calculations on the generals desk forgive my interrupting you sir but you told me to let you have this as soon as i had finished that is my estimate of the number of beds we could stow away in the cubic feet you offer us  the general glanced at the paper and nodded  dont go thomson he said ill talk to you about this later on well captain granet he added youd better leave things in my hands ill do the best i can for you  i shall be very disappointed if i dont get out to the front again soon sir the young man declared simply  ill do the best i can the general repeated touching his bell  granet was shown out and the door was closed general brice turned towards his companion  thomson he said frankly i cant believe it however well find him a billet where he cant possibly do any mischief  if you found him a billet where i should like to see him surgeonmajor thomson observed bitterly he would never do any more mischief in this world any dispatches from the front sir  general brice raised his eyebrows  are you off again he asked  i am going to see that young mans general thomson replied i shall cross over today and be back tomorrow night or saturday morning  general brice nodded thoughtfully  perhaps you are right he assented yes i shall have a few reports youd better let them know at the admiralty and what time you want to go over  surgeonmajor thomson shook hands with the general and turned towards the door  when i come back he said i hope ill be able to convince even you sir    chapter x  surgeonmajor thomson awoke about twelve hours later with a start he had been sleeping so heavily that he was at first unable to remember his whereabouts his mind moved sluggishly across the brief panorama of his hurried journeythe special train from victoria to folkestone the destroyer which had brought him and a few other soldiers across the channel black with darkness at a pace which made even the promenade deck impossible the landing at boulogne a hive of industry notwithstanding the darkness the clanking of waggons the shrieking of locomotives the jostling of crowds the occasional flashing of an electric torch and then the ride in the great automobile through the misty night he rubbed his eyes and looked around him a grey morning was breaking the car had come to a standstill before a white gate in front of which was stationed a british soldier with drawn bayonet surgeonmajor thomson pulled himself together and answered the challenge  a friend he answeredsurgeonmajor thomson on his majestys service  he leaned from the car for a moment and held out something in the hollow of his hand the man saluted and drew back the car went along a rough road which led across a great stretch of pastureland on the ridge of the hills on his right little groups of men were at work unlimbering guns once or twice with a queer screeching sound a shell like a little puff of white smoke passed high over the car and fell somewhere in the grey valley below in the distance he could see the movements of a body of troops through the trees soldiers on the way to relieve their comrades in the trenches as the morning broke the trenches themselves came into viewlong zigzag lines silent and with no sign of the men who crawled about inside like ants he passed a great brewery transformed into a canteen from which a line of waggons going and returning were passing all the time backwards and forwards into the valley every now and then through the stillness came the sharp crack of a rifle from the snipers lying hidden in the little stretches of woodland and marshland away on the right a motoromnibus with its advertisement signs still displayed but a great red cross floating above it came rocking down the road on its way to the field hospital in the distance as yet however the business of fighting seemed scarcely to have commenced  they passed several small houses and farms in front of each of which was stationed a sentry once from the hills behind a great whitewinged aeroplane glided over his head on its way to make a reconnaissance queerest sight of all here and there were peasants at work in the fields one old man leaned upon his spade and watched as the car passed not a dozen yards from him was a great hole in the ground where a shell had burst and a little further away a barn in ruins the car was forced to stop here to let a cavalcade of ammunition waggons pass by surgeonmajor thomson leaned from his seat and spoke to the old man  you are not afraid of the german shells then he asked  monsieur the old man answered one must live or dieit does not matter which for the rest if one is to live one must eat therefore i work four sons i have and a nephew away yonder he added waving his hand southwards that is why i dig alone why do you not send us more soldiers monsieur langlais  wait but a little time longer thomson answered cheerfully  the old man looked sadly at his ruined barn  it is always wait he muttered and one grows old and tired bonjour monsieur  the car passed on again and suddenly dropped into a little protected valley they came to a standstill before a tiny chateau in front of which stretched what might once have been an ornamental garden but which was now torn to pieces by gun carriages convoy waggons and every description of vehicle from the top of the house stretched many wires a sentry stood at the iron gates and passed major thomson after a perfunctory challenge an office with mudstained boots and windtossed hair who looked as though he had been out all night stood on the steps of the house and welcomed thomson  hullo major he called out just across eh  this moment thomson assented anything fresh  nothing to speak of the other replied weve just had a message in that the french have been giving them a knock weve had a quiet time the last two days theyre bringing up some more bavarians we think  do you think i could have a few words with the general major thomson asked  come in and have some coffee yes hell see you of course he is in his own room with two of the flying men just for the moment ill let you know when you can go in  they passed into an apartment which had once been the diningroom of the chateau and in which a long table was laid one or two staff officers greeted thomson and the man who had brought him in attended to his wants  the general had his breakfast an hour ago the latter observed were pretty well forward here and we have to keep on the qui vive we got some shells yesterday dropped within a quarter of a mile of us i think were going to try and give them a push back on the left flank ill go in and see about you thomson  good fellow you might tell them to give my chauffeur something the destroyer that brought me over is waiting at boulogne and i want to be in london tonight  one of the officers from the other side of the table smiled queerly  london my god he muttered there is still a london i suppose savoy and carlton going still pall mall where it was  and very much as it was thomson assured him londons wonderfully unchanged you been out long  september the second was the cheerful reply i keep on getting promised a week but i cant bring it off  hes such a nut with the telephones the man by his side explained helping himself to marmalade the general positively cant spare him  oh chuck it the other exclaimed in disgust what about youthe only man with an eye to a heavenordained gun position as old wattles declared one day were all living wonders major he went on turning to thomson but if i dont get a sole colbert and a grill at the savoy and a front seat at the alhambra before many weeks have passed i shall get stalethats whatll happen to me  hope youll have your hair cut before you go back a man from the other end of the table remarked your own mother wouldnt know you like thatmuch less your sweetheart  the young man fingered his locks reflectively  chap who was going to cut it for me got shot yesterday he grumbled anything doing as you came over the ridge major  thomson shook his head  one aeroplane and a few shells  that would be johnny oates going out in his bleriot some one remarked hell be back here before long with a report  the officer who had met thomson in the garden reentered the room  general says hell see you at once he announced  thomson followed his guide into a small back room an officer was seated before a desk writing another was shouting down a telephone and a third was making some measurements upon a large ordnance map nailed upon one of the walls the general was standing with his back to the fire and a pipe in his mouth he nodded cheerily to thomson  when did you leave london he asked  nine oclock last evening sir thomson replied rather a record trip we had a special down and a destroyer over  and im going to tell you what you want to know the general continued glancing at a document in his hand well close the door harewood out with it  its about captain granet of harrisons staff thomson began  the general frowned and knocked the ashes from his pipe  well he asked what is it  weve reasons of our own for wishing to know exactly what you meant by asking the war office not to send him back again thomson continued  the general hesitated  well what are they  they are a little intangible sir thomson confessed but exceedingly important without any direct evidence i have come to the conclusion that captain granet is a mysterious person and needs watching as usual we are in trouble with the civil authorities and to be frank with you i am trying to strengthen my case  the general shrugged his shoulders  very well he decided under the circumstances you have the right to know what my message meant we sent granet back because of a suspicion which may be altogether unjustifiable the suspicion was there however and it was sufficiently strong for me to make up my mind that i should prefer not to have him back again now you shall know the facts very briefly granet was taken prisoner twice no one saw him takenas a matter of fact both of the affairs were night attacks he seemed suddenly to disappeargot too far ahead of his men was his explanation all i can say is that he was luckier than most of them anything wandering about loose in a british uniformbut there i wont go on with that he came back each time with information as to what he had seen each time we planned an attack on the strength of that information each time that information proved to be misleading and our attack failed costing us heavy losses of course dispositions might have been changed since his observations were made but there the fact remains further the general continued filling his pipe slowly and pressing in the tobacco on the second occasion we had four hundred men thrown forward into the village of ossray they were moved in the pitch darkness and silently it was impossible for any word of their presence in ossray to have been known to the germans yet the night of granets capture the village was shelled and those who escaped were cut off and made prisoners follow me major  yes sir thomson acquiesced  those are just the facts the general concluded now on the other hand granet has handled his men well shown great personal bravery and has all the appearance of a keen soldier i hate to do him a wrong even in my thoughts but there were others besides myself to whom these coincidences seemed amazing we simply decided that theyd better give granet a billet at home thats the reason of my message  i am very much obliged to you sir thomson said slowly you have given me exactly the information which we desire  the general was called away for a moment to give some instructions to the young officer who was sitting in a distant corner of the room with a telephone band around his head he signed to thomson however to remain  now that i have gratified your curiosity he said when he returned perhaps you will gratify mine will you tell me just how you over in england have come to have suspicions of this man  that thomson explained is almost a personal matter with me three months ago i spent the night with the third army corps up by niemen i was there on other business as you may imagine but there was some hot fighting and i went out to help i was attending to some of our fellows and got very near to the german lines i became separated from the others a little and was groping about when i heard voices talking german within a few feet of me i couldnt hear what they said but i could just distinguish two figures one of them made off towards the german lines the other after standing still for a moment came in my direction i took out my revolver and to tell you the truth i very nearly fired on sight for it would have been an exceedingly awkward matter for me to have been taken prisoner just then just as my finger was on the trigger i became conscious that the man who was approaching was humming tipperary i flashed my light on his face and saw at once that he was a british officer he addressed me quickly in german i answered him in english i fancied for a moment that he seemed annoyed wed better get out of this he whispered were within a hundred yards of the german trenches and they are bringing searchlights up who were you talking to just now i asked as we stole along no one at all he answered i didnt take the thing seriously for the moment although it seemed to me queer afterwards i regretted however that i hadnt set myself to discover the meaning of what was apparently a deliberate lie the next time i met granet was at a luncheon party at the ritz a few days ago i recognised his face at once although i had only seen it by the flash of my electric lamp from that moment i have had my suspicions  the general nodded he was looking a little grave  its a hateful thing to believe he said that any one wearing his majestys uniform could ever play such a dastardly part however on the whole i am rather glad that i passed in that request to the war office anything more we can do for you major  thomson took the hint and departed a few minutes later he was in his car and on his way back to boulogne    chapter xi  olive moreton gave a little start as the long grey racing car came noiselessly to a standstill by the side of the kerbstone captain granet raised his hat and leaned from the driving seat towards her  hope i didnt frighten you miss moreton  not at all she replied what a perfectly lovely car  he assented eagerly  isnt she my uncles present to me to pass away the time until i can do some more soldiering they only brought it round to me early this morning can i take you anywhere  i was just going to see geraldine conyers she began  do you know i guessed that he remarked leaning on one side and opening the door do let me take you i havent had a passenger yet  she stepped in at once  as a matter of fact she told him i was looking for a taxicab i have had a telegram from ralph he wants us to go down to portsmouth by the first train we can catch this morning he says that if we can get down there in time to have lunch at two oclock he can show us over the scorpion after today she will be closed to visitors even his own relations i was just going to see if geraldine could come  granet was thoughtful for a moment he glanced at the little clock on the dashboard opposite to him  i tell you what he suggested why not let me motor you and miss conyers down i dont believe theres another fast train before one oclock and wed get down in a couple of hours easily its just what im longing for a good stretch into the country  i should love it the girl exclaimed and i should think geraldine would will you wait while i run in and see her  of course granet replied here we are and theres miss conyers at the window you go in and talk her over and ill just see that weve got lots of petrol ill have you down there within two hours all right if we can get away before the roads are crowded  she hurried into the house geraldine met her on the threshold and they talked together for a few moments then olive reappeared her face beaming  geraldine would simply love it she announced she will be here in five minutes could we just stop at my house for a motorcoat  certainly granet agreed glancing at his watch this is absolutely ripping we shall be down there by one oclock why is this to be conyers last day for entertaining  i dont know she answered indifferently some admiralty regulation i suppose  he sighed  after all he declared i am not sure whether i chose the right profession there is so much that is mysterious about the navy they are always inventing something or trying something new  geraldine came down the steps waving her hand  this is the most delightful idea she exclaimed as granet held the door open do you really mean that you are going to take us down to portsmouth and come and see ralph  i am not going to worry your brother he answered smiling but i am going to take you down to portsmouth if i may we shall be there long before you could get there by train andwell what do you think of my new toy  simply wonderful geraldine declared olive told me that your uncle had just given it you what a lucky person you are captain granet  he laughed a little shortly as they glided off  do you think so he answered well i am lucky in my uncle at any rate he is one of those few people who have a great deal of money and dont mind spending it i was getting bored to death with my game leg and arm and certainly this makes one forget both of them six cylinders you see miss conyers and i wouldnt like to tell you what we can touch if we were pressed  you wont frighten us geraldine assured him  granet glanced once more at the clock in front of him  for a time he remarked i am your chauffeur i just want to see what shell doto experiment a little  from that point conversation became scanty the girls leaned back in their seats granet sat bolt upright with his eyes fixed upon the road shortly before one oclock they entered portsmouth  the most wonderful ride i ever had in my life geraldine exclaimed  marvelous olive echoed captain granet ralph promised that there should be a pinnace at number seven dock from one until three  granet pointed with his finger  number seven dock is there he said and theres the pinnace i shall go back to the hotel for lunch and wait for you there  you will do nothing of the sort geraldine insisted ralph would be furious if you didnt come with us  of course olive interposed how could you think of anything so ridiculous its entirely owing to you that we were able to get here  captain granet looked for a moment doubtful  you see just now he explained i know the regulations for visiting ships in commission are very strict perhaps an extra visitor might embarrass your brother  how can you be so absurd geraldine protested youa soldier why of course hed be delighted to have you  granet swung the car around into the archway of a hotel exactly opposite the dock  all right he agreed well leave the car here of course id like to come all right  they crossed the cobbled street and made their way to the dock the pinnace was waiting for them and in a very few minutes they were on their way across the harbour the scorpion was lying well away from other craft her four squat funnels emitting faint wreaths of smoke she rode very low in the water and her appearance was certainly menacing  personally geraldine observed leaning a little forward to look at her i think a destroyer is one of the most vicious the most hideous things i ever saw i do hope that ralph will be quick and get a cruiser  is that the scorpion just ahead of us granet asked  geraldine nodded  did you ever see anything so ugly she looks as though she would spit out death from every little crevice  shes a fine boat granet muttered what did your brother say she could do  thirtynine knots geraldine replied it seems wonderful doesnt it  the officer in charge of the pinnace smiled  our speeds are only nominal any way he remarked if our chief engineer there had the proper message theres none of us would like to say what he could get out of those new engines  he turned and shouted an order in a moment or two they swung around and drew up by the side of the vessel ralph waved his hand to them from the top of the gangway  well done you people he exclaimed hullo granet have you brought the girls down  in the most wonderful racing car you ever saw geraldine told him as they climbed up the gangway we shouldnt have been here for hours if we had waited for the train  i met captain granet this morning by accident olive explained as she stepped on deck and he insisted on bringing us down  i hope im not in the way at all granet asked anxiously if i am you have only to say the word and put me on shore and ill wait with pleasure until the young ladies come off i have a lot of pals down here too i could look up  dont be silly conyers replied our dear old lady friend thomson isnt here to worry so i think we can make you free of the ship come along down and try a cocktail mind your heads were not on a battleship you know you will find my quarters a little cramped im afraid  they drank cocktails cheerfully and afterwards geraldine exclaimed taking a long breath if olive werent so fearfully in love shed be suffocated  granet paused and looked before him with a puzzled frown  what in heavens name is this  exactly opposite to them was an erection of light framework obviously built around some hidden object for purposes of concealment a marine was standing on guard before it with drawn cutlass granet was in the act of addressing him when an officer ran lightly down the fore part of the ship and saluted  very sorry sir he said but would you mind keeping to the other side this deck is closed for the present  what on earth have you got there granet asked goodhumouredlythat is if its anything a landsman may know about  the young officer piloted them across to the other side  its just a little something we are not permitted to talk about just now he replied i didnt know the commander expected any visitors today or we should have had it roped off anything i can show you on this deck he inquired politely  nothing at all thanks geraldine assured him well just stroll about for a little time  they leaned over the rail together the young officer saluted and withdrew a freshening breeze blew in their faces and the sunshine danced upon the foamflecked sea the harbour was lively with small craft an aeroplane was circling overhead and out in the roads several warships were lying anchored  i was in luck this morning granet asserted  so were we geraldine replied i never enjoyed motoring more your new car is wonderful  she is a beauty isnt she granet assented enthusiastically what she could touch upon fourth speed i wouldnt dare to say we were going over sixty plenty of times this morning and yet one scarcely noticed it you see shes so beautifully hung  you are fortunate she remarked to have an appreciative uncle  he is rather a brick granet acknowledged hes done me awfully well all my life  she nodded  you really are rather to be envied arent you captain granet you have most of the things a man wants youve had your opportunity too of doing just the finest things a man can and youve done them  he looked gloomily out seawards  i am lucky in one way he admitted in others i am not so sure  she kept her head turned from him somehow or other she divined quite well what was in his mind she tried to think of something to say something to dispel the seriousness which she felt to be in the atmosphere but words failed her it was he who broke the silence  may i ask you a question miss conyers  a question why not  are you really engaged to major thomson  she did not answer him at once she still kept her eyes resolutely turned away from his when at last she spoke her voice was scarcely raised above a whisper  certainly i am she assented  he leaned a little closer towards her his voice sounded to her very deep and firm it was the voice of a man immensely in earnest  i am going to be an awful rotter he said i suppose i ought to take your answer to my question as final i wont thats all he came along first but that isnt everything its a fair fight between him and me he hates me and takes no pains to hide it he hates me because i care for youyou know that i couldnt keep it to myself even if i would  she drew a little away but he forced her to look at him there was something else besides appeal in her eyes  youve been the victim of a mistake he insisted his hand resting upon hers i dont believe that you really care for him at all he doesnt seem the right sort for you hes so much older and graver you mustnt be angry you must forgive me please if i have said more than i oughtif i say more nowbecause i am going to tell you now that we are alone together for a moment that i love you  she turned upon him a little indignantly though the distress in her face was still apparent  captain granet she exclaimed you should not say that you have no rightno right at all  on the contrary i have every right he answered doggedly it isnt as though thomson were my friend he hates me and i dislike him every man has a right to do his best to win the girl he cares for its the first time ive felt anything of this sort ive never wanted the big things before from any woman and now  she turned impetuously away from him over their head an electric message was sparkling and crackling she stood looking up her hand outstretched as though to keep him away  i cannot listen any more she declared if you say another word i shall go below  he remained for a moment gloomily silent a young officer stepped out of the wireless room and saluted geraldine  very sorry for you people miss conyers he announced but i am afraid well have to put you on shore weve an urgent message here from the flagship to clear off all guests  but we havent had lunch yet geraldine protested  conyers suddenly made his appearance in the gangway followed by olive  whats the message howard he inquired  the officer saluted and handed over a folded piece of paper conyers read it with a frown and stepped at once out on to the deck he gave a few orders then he turned back to his guests  gels he explained and you granet im frightfully sorry but i cant keep you here another second i have ordered the pinnace round you must get on shore and have lunch at the ship ill come along as soon as i can frightfully sorry granet but i neednt apologise to you need i wars war you know and this is a matter of urgency  youre not going out this tide geraldine demanded breathlessly  conyers shook his head  it isnt that he replied weve got some engineers coming over to do some work on deck and ive had a private tip from my chief to clear out any guests i may have on board  is it anything to do with this wonderful screenedup thing olive asked strolling towards the frameworkcovered edifice  conyers shrugged his shoulders  cant disclose government secrets between just us fourour friend thomson isnt here is he he added smilingwe are planning a little hell for the submarines  they glanced curiously at the mysterious erection granet sighed  secretive chaps you sailors he observed never mind i have a pal in the admiralty who gives me a few hints now and then i shall go and pump him  dont you breathe a word about having been board the scorpion conyers begged quickly they wink at it down here so long as its done discreetly but its positively against the rules you know  righto granet agreed there isnt a soul im likely to mention it to  ill come over to the ship as soon as i can get away conyers promised  they raced across the mile of broken water to the landingstage they were all a little silent olive was frankly disappointed geraldine was busy with her thoughts granets gaze seemed rivetted upon the scorpion another pinnace had drawn up alongside and a little company of men were boarding her  i only hope that they really have hit upon a device to rid the sea of these cursed submarines he remarked as they made their way across the dock i see the brutes have taken to sinking fishing boats now  ralph believes that they have got something olive declared eagerly he is simply aching to get to work  sailors are all so jolly sanguine granet reminded her they are doing something pretty useful with nets of course in the way your brother was beginning to explain to me when major thomson chipped in but they could only keep a fixed channel clear in that way what they really need is some way of tackling them when they are under water here we are at last i hope you girls are as hungry as i am  they lunched in leisurely fashion olive in particular glancing often towards the door and afterwards they sat about in the lounge drinking their coffee granet had seemed to be in high spirits throughout the meal and told the girls many little anecdotes of his adventures at the front afterwards however he became silent and finally with a word of excuse strolled off alone olive looked once more at the clock  ralph doesnt seem to be coming back does he she sighed lets walk a little way down to the landingstage  the two girls strolled out and made their way towards the harbour they could see the scorpion but there was no sign of any pinnace leaving her reluctantly they turned back towards the hotel  i wonder what has become of captain granet olive asked  geraldine stopped short there was a little frown gathering upon her forehead she pointed up to the roof of the hotel where a man was crouching with a telescope glued to his eyes he lowered it almost as they paused and waved his hand to them  cant see any sign of conyers he shouted im waiting for the pinnace come up here theres such a ripping view  they entered the hotel in silence  i dont believe geraldine remarked uneasily that ralph would like that  they made their way to the top of the house and were escorted by a buxom chambermaid to what was practically a stepladder opening out on to a skylight from here they crawled on to the roof where they found granet comfortably ensconced with his back to a chimney smoking a cigarette  this is rather one on your brother he chuckled  where did you find the telescope geraldine asked  i borrowed it from downstairs he answered do come and have a look you can see the scorpion quite distinctly all the officers seem to be gathered around that mysterious structure on the upper deck i thought at first it was a stand for a gun but it isnt  olive held out her hand for the telescope but geraldine shook her head there was a troubled expression in her eyes  i suppose its awfully silly captain granet she said but honestly i dont think ralph would take it as a joke at all if he knew that we were up here trying to find out what was going on  olive set down the telescope promptly  i didnt think of that she murmured  granet laughed easily  perhaps you are right he admitted all the same we are a little exceptionally placed arent wehis sister his fiancee and  he broke off suddenly a hand had been laid upon his shoulder a small dark man who had come round the corner of the chimney unperceived was standing immediately behind him  i must trouble you all for your names and addresses if you please he announced quietly  the two girls stared at him dumbfounded granet however remained perfectly at his ease he laid down the telescope and scrutinised the newcomer  i really dont altogether see he remarked good humouredly why i should give my name and address to a perfect stranger just because he asks for it  the man opened his coat and displayed a badge  i am on government service sir  well i am captain granet back from the front with dispatches a few days ago granet told him this is miss conyers sister of commander conyers of the scorpion and miss olive moreton his fiancee we are waiting for commander conyers at the present moment and we were just looking to see if the pinnace had started is it against the law to use a telescope in portsmouth  the man made a few notes in his pocketbook then he opened the trapdoor and stood on one side  no one is allowed out here sir he said the hotel people are to blame for not having the door locked i shall have to make a report but i have no doubt that your explanation will be accepted will you be so good as to descend please  granet struggled to his feet and turned towards his companions  the fellows quite right he decided i am only glad that the government are looking after things so the admiralty are much more goahead in this way than we are i vote we have out the car and go down the front to southseaunless we are under arrest he added pleasantly turning towards the man who had accosted them  you are at liberty to do whatever you please sir was the polite reply in any case i think it would be quite useless of you to wait for commander conyers  why olive asked quickly  the scorpion has just received orders to leave on this evenings tide madam the man announced you can see that she is moving even now  they looked out across the harbour the smoke was pouring from the funnels of the destroyer already she had swung around and was steaming slowly towards the channel  shes off right enough granet exclaimed nothing left for us then but london    chapter xii  geraldine a few hours later set down the telephone receiver with a little sigh of resignation lady conyers glanced up inquiringly from her book  was that some one wanting to come and see you at this time of night geraldine she asked  geraldine yawned  its hugh she explained he has rung up from the war office or somewheresays he has just got back from france and wants to see me at once i think he might have waited till tomorrow morning i can scarcely keep my eyes open i am so sleepy  lady conyers glanced at the clock  it isnt really so late she remarked and i dare say if the poor mans been travelling all day hed like to say goodnight to you  geraldine made a little grimace  i shall go into the morning room and wait for him she announced hell very likely find me asleep  the admiral looked up from behind the times  wheres that nice young fellow granet he asked why didnt you bring him in to dinner  well we didnt get back until nearly eight geraldine reminded her father i didnt think hed have time to change and get back here comfortably  fine young chap that sir seymour remarked the very best type of young english soldier we could do with lots like him  geraldine left the room without remark she could hear her father rustling his paper as she disappeared  cant think why geraldine didnt pick up with a smart young fellow like granet instead of an old stick like thomson he grumbled i hate these army medicals anyway  major thomson has a charming disposition lady conyers declared warmly besides he will be very well off some dayhe may even get the baronetcy  who cares about that her husband grunted geraldine has all the family she needs and all the money how she came to choose thomson from all her sweethearts i cant imagine  geraldine notwithstanding her fatigue welcomed her lover very charmingly when he arrived a few minutes later major thomson was still in travelling clothes and had the air of a man who had been working at high pressure for some time he held her fingers tightly for a moment without speaking then he led her to the sofa and seated himself beside her  geraldine he began gravely has what i say any weight with you at all  a good deal she assured him  you know that i do not like captain granet yet you took him with you down to portsmouth today and even allowed him to accompany you on board the scorpion  geraldine started a little  how do you know that already she asked curiously  he shook his head impatiently  it doesnt matter i heard why did you do it geraldine  in the first place because he offered to motor us down after we had missed the train there are heaps of other reasons  as for instance  well olive and i preferred having an escort and captain granet was a most agreeable one he took us down in a car his uncle has just given hima sixty horsepower panhard i never enjoyed motoring more in my life  you are all very foolish thomson said slowly i am going to tell you something now dear which you may not believe but it is for your good and it is necessary for me to have some excuse for the request i am going to make granet is under suspicion at the war office  under suspicion geraldine repeated blankly  nothing has been proved against him thomson continued and i tell you frankly that in certain quarters the idea is scouted as absurd on the other hand he is under observation as being a possible german spy  geraldine for a moment sat quite still then she broke into a peal of laughter she sat up a moment later wiping her eyes  are you really serious hugh she demanded  absolutely he assured her a little coldly  she wiped her eyes once more  hugh dear she sighed patting his hand you do so much better looking after your hospitals and your wounded than unearthing maresnests like this i dont think that youd be a brilliant success in the intelligence department as to the war office well you know what i think of them captain granet a german spy indeed  neither the war office nor i myself thomson continued have arrived at these suspicions without some reason perhaps you will look at the matter a little more seriously when i tell you that captain granet will not be allowed to return to the front  not be allowed she repeated hugh you are not serious  i have never been more serious in my life he insisted i am not in a position to tell you more than the bare facts or i might disclose some evidence which even you would have to admit throws a rather peculiar light upon some of this young mans actions as it is however i can do no more than warn you and beg you he went on to yield to my wishes in the matter of your further acquaintance with him  there was a moments rather curious silence geraldine seemed to be gazing through the walls of the room her hands were clenched in one another her fingers nervously interlocked  i shall send for him to come and see me the first thing tomorrow morning she decided  you will do nothing of the sort thomson objected firmly  she turned her head and looked at him he was conscious of the antagonism which had sprung up like a wall between them his face however showed no sign  how do you propose to prevent me she asked with ominous calm  by reminding you of your duty to your country he answered geraldine dear i did not expect to have to talk to you like this when i tell you that responsible people in the war office officials whose profession it is to scent out treachery have declared this young man suspect i am certainly disappointed to find you embracing his cause so fervently it is no personal matter believe me he added after a moments pause whatever my personal bias may be what i am saying to you now is not actuated in the slightest by any feelings of jealousy i have told you what i know and it is for you to make your choice as to how much or how little in the future you will see of this young man but i do forbid you not in my own name but for our countrys sake to breathe a single word to him of what i have said to you  it comes to this then she said that you make accusations against a man and deny him the right of being heard  if you choose to put it like that yes he assented only i fancied that consideringconsidering the things between us you might have taken my word  he leaned a little towards her if she had been looking she could scarcely have failed to have been touched by the sudden softness of his dark eyes the little note of appeal in his usually immobile face her eyes however were fixed upon the diamond ring which sparkled upon her third finger slowly she drew it off and handed it to him  hugh she said the things you speak of do not exist any more between us i am sorry but i think you are narrow and suspicious you have your own work to do it seems to me mean to spend your time suspecting soldiers who have fought for their king and their country of such a despicable crime  cant you trust me a little more than that geraldine he asked wistfully  in what way she demanded i judge only by the facts the things you have said to me your accusations against captain granet why should you go out of your way to investigate cases of suspected espionage  you cannot believe that i would do so unless i was convinced that it was my duty  i cannot see that it is your business at all she told him shortly  he rose from his place  i am very sorry geraldine he said i will keep this ring you are quite free butlook at me  against her will she was forced to do as he bade her her own attitude which had appeared to her so dignified and right seemed suddenly weakened she had the feeling of a peevish child  geraldine he begged take at least the advice of a man who loves you wait  even when he had opened the door she felt a sudden inclination to call him back she heard him go down the hall heard the front door open and close she sat and looked in a dazed sort of way at the empty space upon her finger then she rose and went into the drawingroom where her father and mother were still reading she held out her hand  mother she announced i am not engaged to major thomson any more  the admiral laid down his newspaper  damned good job too he declared that young fellow granets worth a dozen of him never could stick an army medical well well how did he take it  lady conyers watched her daughter searchingly then she shook her head  i hope you have done wisely dear she said    chapter xiii  at a little after noon on the following day captain granet descended from a taxicab in the courtyard of the milan hotel and passing through the swing doors made his way to the inquiry office a suave blackcoated young clerk hastened to the desk  can you tell me granet inquired whether a gentlemen named guillot is staying here  the young man bowed  monsieur guillot arrived last night sir he announced he has just rung down to say that if a gentlemen called to see him he could be shown up here page he went on turning to a diminutive youth in the background show this gentleman to number 322  granet followed the boy to the lift and was conducted to a room on the third floor the door was opened by a tall whitehaired frenchman  monsieur guillot captain granet inquired pleasantly my name is granet  the frenchman ushered him in the door was closed and carefully locked then monsieur guillot swung around and looked at his visitor with some curiosity granet was still wearing his uniform  france must live granet murmured  the frenchman at once extended his hand  my friend he confessed for a moment i was surprised it did not occur to me to see you in this guise  granet smiled  i have been out at the front he explained and am home wounded  but an english officer monsieur guillot remarked dubiously i do not quite understand then the nature of the communication which i have come to receive is known to you  granet nodded and accepted the chair which his host had offered  i do not think that you should be so much surprised he said simply if the war is grievous for your country it is ruin to mine we do not perhaps advertise our apprehensions in the papers we prefer to keep them locked up in our own brain there is one great fact always before us germany is unconquerable one must find peace or perish  monsieur guillot listened with a curious look upon his face his forefinger tapped the copy of the times which was lying upon the table the other nodded gravely  yes he continued i know that our press is carrying on a magnificent campaign of bluff i know that many of the ignorant people of the country believe that this war is still being prosecuted with every hope of success we who have been to the front especially those who have any source of information in germany know differently the longer the war the more ruinous the burden which your country and mine will have to bear  it is my opinion also monsieur guillot declared and furthermore listen it is not our war at all that is the cruel part of it it is russias war and yours yet it is we who suffer most we the richest part of whose country is in the hands of the foe we whose industries are paralysed my country from whom the lifeblood is being slowly drained you english what do you know of the war no enemy has set foot upon your soil no englishman has seen his womankind dishonoured or his home crumble into ashes the war to you is a thing of paper an abstractionthat same war which has turned the better half of my beloved country into a lurid corner of hell  our time has not yet come granet admitted but before long unless diplomacy can avert it fate will be knocking at our doors too listen you have friends still in power monsieur guillotfriends in the cabinet is it not so  it is indeed true monsieur guillot assented  you have too granet continued a great following throughout france you are the man for the task i bring to you you if you choose shall save your country and earn the reward she will surely bestow upon you  monsieur guillots cheeks were flushed a little with long nervous fingers he rolled a cigarette and lit it  monsieur he said i listen to you eagerly and yet i am puzzled you wear the uniform of an english officer but you come to me is it not so as an emissary of germany  in bald words that may be true granet confessed yet i would remind you of two things first that the more dominant part of the personality which i have inherited comes to me from alsatian ancestors and secondly that this peace for which i am striving may in the end mean salvation for england too  i hear you with relief monsieur guillot admitted in this transaction it is my great desire to deal with a man of honour as such i know perceive that i can recognise you monsieur  granet bowed gravely and without any shadow of embarrassment  that assuredly monsieur guillot he said shall i proceed  by all means  granet drew a thin packet from the breast pocket of his coat he laid it on the table between them  i received this he announced less than three weeks ago from the hands of the kaiser himself  monsieur guillot gazed at his companion incredulously  it was very simple granet continued i was taken prisoner near the village of ossray i was conducted at once to headquarters and taken by motorcar to a certain fortified place which i will not specify but which was at that time the headquarters of the german staff i received this document there in the way i have told you i was then assisted after some very remarkable adventures to rejoin my regiment you can open that document monsieur guillot it is addressed to you guard it carefully though for it is signed by the kaiser himself i have carried it with me now for more than a fortnight in the inner sole of my shoe as you can imagine its discovery upon my person would have meant instant death  monsieur guillot was engrossed in reading the few lines of the missive when he had finished he covered the paper with the palm of his hand and leaned forward there was a queer light in his eyes  germany will give up alsace and lorraine he said hoarsely and will retire within her own frontiers she will ask for no indemnity what is the meaning of it  simple enough granet pointed out a great politician like you should easily realise the actual conditions which prompt such an offer what good is territory to germany territory over which she must rule by force struggling always against the accumulated hatred of years alsace and lorraine have taught her her lesson it is not french territory she wants russia has far more to give russia and england between them can pay an indemnity which will make germany rich beyond the dreams of avarice form your party monsieur guillot spread your tidings in any way that seems fit to you only until the hour comes guard that document as you would your soul its possession would mean death to you as it would to me  monsieur guillot took the document and buttoned it up in his inside pocket  supposing i succeed he said quietly what of your country then  my country will make peace granet replied  it will be a peace that will cost us much but nothing more than we deserve for generations the war has been the perfectly obvious and apparent sequence of european events it threw its warning shadow across our path for years and our statesmen deliberately turned their heads the other way or walked blindfolded not only our statesmen mind but our people our english people our young men shirked their duty our philosophers and essayists shirked theirs we prated of peace and conventions and we knew very well that we were living in times when human nature and red blood were still the controlling elements we watched germany arm and prepare we turned for comfort towards our fellow sinners america and we prattled about conventions and arbitration and hundred other silly abstractions a father can watch the punishment of his child monsieur guillot believe me there are many other englishmen besides me who will feel a melancholy satisfaction in the chastisement of their country many who are more english even than i  monsieur guillot passed away from the personal side of the matter already his mind was travelling swiftly along the avenues of his own future greatness  this is the chance which comes to few men he muttered there is dejane gardine debonnot senn besides my own followers my own journal too it is a great campaign this which i shall start  granet rose to his feet  after today i breathe more freely he confessed there have been enemies pressing closely around me i have walked in fear today i am a free man take care monsieur take care especially whilst you are in england  monsieur guillot extended his hand  my young friend he said in the years to come you and i shall perhaps meet in our wonderful paris and if i may not tell the world so i shall yet feel as we look upon her greatness that you and i together have saved france adieu  granet made his way along the empty corridor rang for the lift and descended into the hall a smile was upon his lips the torch at last was kindled in the hall of the hotel he came across a group of assembling guests just starting for the luncheon room a tall familiar figure stepped for a moment on one side his heart gave a little jump geraldine held out her pearlgloved hand  captain granet she said i wanted to tell you something  yes he answered breathlessly  she glanced towards where the little group of people were already on their way to the stairs  i must not stay for a second she continued dropping her voice but i wanted to tell youi am no longer engaged to major thomson goodbye  a rush of words trembled upon his lips but she was gone he watched her slim graceful figure as she passed swiftly along the vestibule and joined her friends he even heard her little laugh as she greeted one of the men who had waited for her  decidedly granet said to himself triumphantly as he turned towards the door this is my day    chapter xiv  monsieur guillot was a man of emotional temperament for more than an hour after granet had left him he paced up and down his little room stood before the high windows which overlooked the thames raised his hands above his head and gazed with flashing eyes into the futuresuch a future all his life he had been a schemer his eyes turned towards the big things yet with himself always occupying the one glorified place in the centre of the arena he was in one sense of the word a patriot but it was the meanest and smallest sense there was no great france for him in which his was not the commanding figure in every dream of that wonderful future of a more splendid and triumphant france he saw himself on the pinnacle of fame himself acclaimed by millions the strong great man the liberator france outside himself lived only as a phantasy and now at last his chance had come the minutes passed unnoticed as he built his way up into the future he was shrewd and calculating he took note of the pitfalls he must avoid one by one he decided upon the men whom gradually and cautiously he would draw into his confidence finally he saw the whole scheme complete the bombshell thrown france hysterically casting laurels upon the man who had brought her unexpected peace  the doorbell rang he answered it a little impatiently a slim fashionably dressed young frenchman stood there whose face was vaguely familiar to him  monsieur guillot the newcomer inquired politely  guillot bowed the young man handed him a card  i am the baron devignon he announced second secretary at the embassy here  monsieur guillot held the card and looked at his visitor he was very puzzled some dim sense of foreboding was beginning to steal in upon him  be so kind as to come in monsieur le baron he invited will you not be seated and explain to me to what i am indebted for this honour you do not by any chance mistake me for another i am monsieur guillot lately alas of lille  the baron smiled ever so slightly as he waved away the chair  there is no mistake monsieur guillot he said i come to you with a message from my chief he would be greatly honoured if you would accompany me to the embassy he wishes a few minutes conversation with you  with me monsieur guillot echoed incredulously but there is some mistake  no mistake i assure you the young man insisted  monsieur guillot drew back a little into the room  but what have i to do with the ambassador or with diplomatic matters of any sort he protested i am here on business to see what can be saved from the wreck of my affairs monsieur the ambassador is mistaking me for another  the baron shook his head  there is no mistake my dear sir he insisted we all recognise he added with a bow the necessities which force the most famous of us to live sometimes in the shadow of anonymity if the chief could find little to say to monsieur guillot of lille he will i am sure be very interested in a short conversation with monsieur henri pailleton  there was a brief tense silence the man who had called himself guillot was transformed the dreams which had uplifted him a few minutes ago had passed he was living very much in the presentan ugly and foreboding present the veins stood out upon his forehead and upon the back of his hands his teeth gleamed underneath his coarse white moustache then he recovered himself  there is some mistake he said but i will come  in silence they left the hotel and drove to the embassy in silence the young man ushered his charge into the large pleasant apartment on the ground floor of the embassy where the ambassador was giving instructions to two of his secretaries he dismissed them with a little wave of his hand and bowed politely to his visitor there was no longer any pretext on the part of monsieur guillot he recognised its complete futility  monsieur pailleton the ambassador began will you take a seat it is very kind of you to obey so quickly my summons  i had no idea the latter remarked that my presence in england was known i am here on private business  the ambassador bowed suavely  precisely my friend you see i use the epithet my friend because at a time like this all frenchmen must forget their differences and work together for the good and honour of their country is it not so monsieur  that is indeed true monsieur pailleton admitted slowly we may work in different ways but we work towards the same end  no one has ever doubted your patriotism monsieur pailleton the ambassador continued it is my privilege now to put it to the test there is a little misunderstanding in brazil every particular concerning which and the views of our government is contained in the little parcel of documents which you see upon this table put them in your pocket monsieur pailleton i am going to ask you to serve your country by leaving for liverpool this afternoon and for brazil tomorrow on the steamship hermes  monsieur pailleton had been a little taken aback by the visit of the baron he sat now like a man temporarily stupefied he was too amazed to find any sinister significance in this mission he could only gasp the ambassadors voice as he continued talking smoothly seemed to reach him from a long way off  it may be a little contrary to your wishes my friend the latter proceeded to find yourself so far from the throb of our great struggle yet in these days we serve best who obey it is the wish of those who stand for france that you should take that packet and board that steamer  monsieur pailleton began in some measure to recover himself he was still however bewildered  monsieur he protested i do not understand this mission to brazil of which you speakit can have no great importance cannot it be entrusted to some other messenger  alas no my dear sir was the uncompromising reply it is youmonsieur pailletonwhom the president desires to travel to brazil  the light was breaking in upon pailleton he clenched his fists  i am to be got out of the way he exclaimed the president fears me politically he fears my following  the ambassador drew himself a little more upright a stiff unbending figure his words seemed suddenly to become charged with more weight  monsieur pailleton he said the only thing that france fears is treachery  pailleton gripped at the back of his chair the room for a moment swam before his eyes  is this an insult monsieur lambassadeur he demanded  take it as an insult if in your heart there is no shadow of treachery towards the france that is today towards the cause of the allies as it is today was the stern answer  i refuse to accept this extraordinary mission pailleton declared rising to his feet you can send whom you will to brazil i have greater affairs before me  the ambassador shrugged his shoulders  i shall not press you he said i shall only put before you the alternative you are at this present moment upon french soil if you refuse this mission which has been offered to you i shall detain you here until i have the means of sending you under escort to france  detain me on what charge pailleton exclaimed angrily  on the charge of treason was the quiet reply i shall have you stripped and searched in this room i shall have your luggage and your room searched at the milan hotel and now monsieur pailleton  once more the man was bewildered this time however it was bewilderment of a different sort he thought for a moment steadfastly who was there who could have betrayed him  what is the nature of this document monsieur which you expect to find amongst my belongings he demanded  an authorised offer of peace from germany to the french people the ambassador answered slowly it is the second attempt which has been made the first was torn into fragments before the face of the person who had the effrontery to present it the second monsieur pailleton is in your possession you may keep it if you will in brazil you will find it of little use  monsieur pailleton folded his arms  i am a frenchman he proclaimed what i may do i do for france  you refuse my mission then  i refuse it  the ambassador struck a bell upon his table one of his secretaries promptly appeared  send colonel defarge to me at once his chief ordered  there was a brief pause the ambassador was busy writing at his table pailleton who was breathing heavily said nothing presently an officer in french uniform entered  monsieur le colonel the ambassador said stretching out his hand towards pailleton you will accept the charge of this man whom you will consider under arrest i take the full responsibility for this proceeding you will conduct him to your rooms here and you will search him any document found in his possession you will bring to me when you have finished let me know and i will give you an authority to proceed to his apartments in the milan hotel you understand  certainly my chief  the officer saluted and moved to pailleton  you will come quietly monsieur is it not so he asked  pailleton waved him away he turned to the ambassador  monsieur he decided i will go to brazil    chapter xv  two more german submarines sunk with all hands  the admiralty report that they received last night a message from commander conyers of the destroyer scorpion announcing that he has destroyed german submarines u 22 and 27 with all hands  well im damned the admiral exclaimed as he laid down the newspaper a few mornings later ralphs done it this time and no mistake  geraldine looked over his shoulder her cheeks aglow  i knew at seven oclock she declared harris brought me the paper up they are all so excited about it in the kitchen youd just gone out in the park  i want to know how it was done the admiral speculated cant have been ramming if he bagged two of them and they surely never came to the surface voluntarily with a destroyer about  geraldine glanced around the room to be sure that they were alone  dont you remember when olive and i were at portsmouth she said ralph has been absolutely dumb about it but he did just give us a hint that he had a little surprise in store for the submarines there was something on deck covered all up and watched by a sentry and just before we sat down to lunch you know we were turned off and had to go to the ship ralph wouldnt tell us a word about it but im sure hes got some new contrivance on the scorpion for fighting the submarines  there may be something in it the admiral admitted cheerfully i noticed the morning post naval man the other day made a very guarded reference to some secret means of dealing with these vermin  lady conyers sailed into the room a telegram in her hand  a wireless from ralph she announced listen    have sunk two of the brutes more to come love                                  ralph  they pored over the telegram and the newspaper until the breakfast was cold the admiral was like a boy again  if we can get rid of these curses of the sea he said settling down at last to his bacon and eggs and get those germans to come out the war will be over months before any one expected i shall go down to the admiralty after breakfast and see if theyve got anything to tell ralph gave me a hint about the net scheme but he never even mentioned anything else  the telephone rang in the next room and a servant summoned geraldine  captain granet wishes to speak to miss conyers he announced  geraldine left her place at once and hastened into the library she took up the receiver  is that you captain granet she asked  i felt that i must ring you up he declared to congratulate you miss conyers upon your brothers exploit i have had half a dozen soldier fellows in already this morning to talk about it and were simply mad with curiosity do you think we shall be told soon how it was done  fathers going down to the admiralty to try and find out geraldine replied ralph doesnt say a word except that he sunk them weve had a wireless from him this morning  it really doesnt matter much does it granet went on so long as we get rid of the brutes i was perfectly certain when we were down at portsmouth that your brother had something up his sleeve does give one a thrill doesnt it when ones ashore and doing nothing to read of things like this  youll soon be at work again she told him encouragingly  i dont know he sighed they talk about giving me a home job and i dont think i could stick it are you walking in the park this morning miss conyers  she hesitated for a moment  no i am playing golf at ranelagh  might i call this afternoon  if you like she assented after four oclock though because i am staying out to lunch  thank you so much he replied gratefully  she set down the receiver again and went back to the breakfastroom  captain granet just wanted to congratulate us all she announced and to know if he could come in to tea this afternoon  better ask him to dinner my dear the admiral suggested hospitably hes a fine young fellow granet very thoughtful of him to ring us up  lady conyers made no comment geraldine was bending over her plate the admiral rose to his feet he was much too excited to pursue the conversation  i shall walk down to the admiralty and see if i can get hold of old wilcock he continued if he wont tell me anything ill wring the old beggars neck  the admiral left the house a few minutes later and lady conyers walked arm in arm with her daughter into the pleasant little morningroom which looked out upon the square the former paused for a moment to look at thomsons photograph which stood upon one of the side tables then she closed the door  geraldine she said i am not very happy about you and hugh  why not mother the girl asked looking out of the window  perhaps because i like hugh lady conyers went on quietly perhaps too because i am not sure that you have done wisely you havent given me any reason yet have you for breaking your engagement  geraldine was silent for a moment then she came back and sat on the rug at her mothers feet she kept her face however a little turned away  its so hard to put it into words mother she said thoughtfully only hugh never seemed to give me any of his confidence of course his is very dull work looking after hospitals and that sort of thing but still id have liked to try and take an interest in it he must have seen exciting things in france but it is only by the merest chance that one ever realises that he has been even near the front he is so silent so secretive  lady conyers took up her knitting  some men are like that dear she remarked it is just temperamental perhaps you havent encouraged him to talk  but i have geraldine insisted i have asked him no end of questions but before he has answered any of them properly i find him trying to change the conversation  men dont like talking about the war you know lady conyers went on there was that nice major tyndale who was back from the front the other day with a v c and goodness knows what not a word would he say about any one of the fights and he is cheery enough in a general way isnt he and fond of talking  even then geraldine protested hughs work is different i can understand why he doesnt like to talk a lot about the wounded and that sort of thing but he must have had some interesting adventures  i dont think lady conyers said the very nicest men talk about their adventures  geraldine made a little grimace  hugh doesnt talk about anything she complained he goes about looking as though he had the cares of the world upon his shoulders and then he has thewell the cheek i call it to lecture me about captain granet he does talk about captain granet in the most absurd manner you know mother  he may have his reasons lady conyers observed  geraldine turned her head and looked at her mother  now what reasons could he have for not liking captain granet and suspecting him of all manner of ridiculous things she asked did you ever know a more harmless ingenuous delightful young man in your life  perhaps it is because you find him all these things lady conyers suggested that hugh doesnt like him  of course if he is going to be jealous about nothing at all  is it nothing at all  lady conyers raised her head from her knitting and looked across at her daughter a little flush of colour had suddenly streamed into geraldines face she drew back as though she had been sitting too near the fire  of course it is she declared i have only known captain granet for a very short time i like him of courseevery one must like him who knows himbut thats all  do you know lady conyers said a moment later i almost hope that it is all  and why mother  because i consider hugh is a great judge of character because we have known hugh since he was a boy and we have known captain granet for about a week  geraldine rose to her feet  you dont like captain granet mother  i do not dislike him lady conyers replied thoughtfully i do not see how any one could  hugh does he hinted things about himthat he wasnt honestand then forbade me to tell him i think hugh was mean  lady conyers glanced at the clock  you had better go and get ready dear if you have promised to be at ranelagh at halfpast ten she said will you just remember this  ill remember anything you say mother geraldine promised  youre just a little impulsive dear at times although you seem so thoughtful lady conyers continued dont rush at any conclusion about these two men sometimes i have fancied that there is a great well of feeling behind hughs silence and more than thatthat there is something in his life of which just now he cannot speak which is keeping him living in great places his abstractions are not ordinary ones you know its just an idea of mine but the other daywell something happened which i thought rather queer i saw a closed car turn into st jamess park and evidently according to orders the chauffeur drove very slowly there were two men inside talking very earnestly one of them was hugh the other waswell the most important man at the war office who seldom as you know speaks to any one  you mean to say that he was alone talking confidentially with hugh geraldine exclaimed incredulously  he was dear her mother assented and it made me think thats all i have a fancy that some day when the time comes that hugh is free to talk he will be able to interest youwell quite as much as captain granet now then dear hurry theres the car at the door for you and you havent your hat on  geraldine went upstairs a little thoughtfully as she drew on her gloves she looked down at the empty space upon her third finger for a moment there was almost a lump in her throat    chapter xvi  the two men who had walked up together arm in arm from downing street stood for several moments in pall mall before separating the pressman who was passing yearned for the sunlight in his camera one of the greatest financiers of the city in close confabulation with mr gordon jones the chancellor of the exchequer was an interesting almost an historical sight  it is a source of the greatest satisfaction to me sir alfred the minister was saying earnestly to find such royal and wholehearted support in the city i am afraid he went on with a little twinkle in his eyes that there are times when i have scarcely been popular in financial circles  we have hated you like poison the other assured him with emphasis  the capitalists must always hate the man who tries to make wealth pay its just share in the support of the empire mr gordon jones remarked the more one has the less one likes to part with it however those days have passed you bankers have made my task easier at every turn you have met me in every possible way to you personally sir alfred i feel that some day i shall have to express my thanksmy thanks and the thanks of the nationin a more tangible form  you are very kind the banker acknowledged times like this change everything we remember only that we are englishmen  the minister hailed a passing taxi and disappeared the banker strolled slowly along pall mall and passed through the portals of an augustlooking club the hallporter relieved him of his coat and hat with great deference as he was crossing the hall after having exchanged greetings with several friends he came face to face with surgeonmajor thomson the latter paused  i am afraid you dont remember me sir alfred he said but i have been hoping for an opportunity of thanking you personally for the six ambulance cars you have endowed i am surgeonmajor thomson chief inspector of field hospitals  sir alfred held out his hand affably  i remember you perfectly major he declared i am very glad that my gift is acceptable anything one can do to lessen the suffering of those who are fighting our battle is almost a charge upon our means  it is very fortunate for us that you feel like that the other replied thank you once more sir  the two men separated sir alfred turned to the hallporter  i am expecting my nephew in to dine he saidcaptain granet bring him into the smokingroom will you directly he arrives  certainly sir  sir alfred passed on across the marble hall thomson whose hand had been upon his hat replaced it upon the peg he looked after the great banker and stood for a moment deep in thought then he addressed the hallporter  bythebye charles he inquired if you ask a nonmember to dinner you have to dine in the strangers room i suppose  certainly sir the man replied it is just at the back of the general diningroom  i suppose an ordinary member couldnt dine in there alone  it is not customary sir  surgeonmajor thomson made his way to the telephone booth when he emerged he interviewed the headwaiter  keep a small table for me in the strangers room he ordered i shall require dinner for two  at what time sir  major thomson seemed for a moment deaf he was looking through the open door of the smokingroom to where sir alfred was deep in the pages of a review  are there many people dining there tonight he asked  sir alfred has a guest at eight oclock sir the man replied there are several others i think but they have not ordered tables specially  at a quarter past eight if you please i shall be in the billiardroom charles he added turning to the hallporter  sir alfred wearied soon of the pages of his review and leaned back in his chair his hands folded in front of him gazing through the window at the opposite side of the way a good many people passing backwards and forwards glanced at him curiously for thirty years his had been something like a household name in the city he had been responsible he and the great firm of which he was the head for international finance conducted on the soundest principles finance which scorned speculation finance which rolled before it the great snowball of automatically accumulated wealth his father had been given the baronetcy which he now enjoyed and which as he knew very well might at any moment be transferred into a peerage he was a short rather thickset man with firm jaws and keen blue eyes carefully dressed in somewhat oldfashioned style with hornrimmed eyeglass hung about his neck with a black ribbon his hair was a little closecropped and stubbly no one could have called him handsome no one could have found him undistinguished even without the knowledge of his millions people who glanced at him recognised the atmosphere of power  wonder what old anselmans thinking about one man asked another in an opposite corner  money bags was the prompt reply the man thinks money he dreams money he lives money he lives like a prince but he has no pleasures from ten in the morning till two he sites in his office in lombard street and the pulse of the city beats differently in his absence  i wonder the other murmured  other people had wondered too still the keen blue eyes looked across through the misty atmosphere at the grey building opposite men and women passed before him in a constant unseen procession no one came and spoke to him no one interfered with his meditations the two men who had been discussing him passed out of the room presently one of them glanced backwards in his direction  after all i suppose he observed as he passed down the hall there is something great about wealth or else one wouldnt believe that old anselman there was thinking of his moneybags why heres granet good fellow id no idea youd joined this august company of old fogies  granet smiled as he shook hands  i havent he explained you have to be a millionaire dont you and a great political bug before theyd let you in no place for poor soldiers i have to be content with the rag  poor devil his friend remarked sympatheticallybest cooking best wines in london these service men look after themselves all right what are you doing here anyhow granet  im dining with my uncle granet replied quickly  sir alfreds in there waiting for you his friend told him indicating the doorhe has been sitting at the window watching for you in fact so long  the two men passed out and granet was ushered into the smokingroom sir alfred came back from his reverie and was greeted by his nephew cordially the two men sat by the window for a few moments in silence  an aperitif sir alfred suggested capital  they drank mixed vermouth sir alfred picked up an evening paper from his side  any news he asked  nothing fresh granet replied the whole worlds excited about this submarine affair looks as though wed got the measure of those johnnies doesnt it  it does indeed sir alfred agreed two submarines one after the other two of the latest class too destroyed within a few miles and without a word of explanation no wonder every ones excited about it  theyre fearfully bucked at the admiralty i believe granet remarked of course theyll pretend that they had this new dodge or whatever it may be up their sleeves all the time  sir alfred nodded  well he said come in to dinner young fellow you shall entertain me with tales of your adventures whilst you compare our cuisine here with your own commissariat  they passed on into the strangers diningroom a small but cheerful apartment opening out of the general diningroom the headwaiter ushered them unctuously to a small table set in the far corner of the room  i have obeyed your wishes sir alfred he announced as they seated themselves no one else will be dining anywhere near you  sir alfred nodded  knowing how modest you soldiers are in talking of your exploits he remarked to granet i have pleaded for seclusion here in the intervals of our being served with dinner you can spin me yarns of the front the whole thing fascinates me i want to hear the story of your escape  they seated themselves and sir alfred studied the menu for a moment through his eyeglass after the service of the soup they were alone he leaned a little across the table  ronnie he said i thought it was better to ask you here than to have you down at the city  granet nodded  this seems all right he admitted glancing around well one part of the great work is finished i have lived for eleven days not quite sure when i wasnt going to be stood up with my back to the light at the tower now its over  youve seen pailleton  seen him impressed him given him the document he has his plans all made  good very good  sir alfred ate soup for several moments as though it were the best soup on earth and nothing else was worth consideration then he laid down his spoon  magnificent he said now listenthese submarines there was a taube close at hand and i can tell you something which the admiralty here are keeping dark with their tongues in their cheeks both those submarines were sunk under water  i guessed it granet replied coolly i not only guessed it but i came very near the key of the whole thing  a waiter appeared with the next course followed by the wine steward carrying champagne sir alfred nodded approvingly  just four minutes in the ice he instructed not longer what you tell me about the champagne country is i must confess a relief he added turning to granet it may not affect us quite so much but personally i believe that the whole world is happier and better when champagne is cheap it is the bottled gaiety of the nation a nation of ginger ale drinkers would be doomed before they reached the second generation 1900 pommery this ronnie and i drink your health if i may be allowed one moments sentiment he added raising his glass let me say that i drink your health from the bottom of my hear with all the admiration which a man of my age feels for you younger fellows who are fighting for us and our country  they drank the toast in silence in a moment or two they were alone again  go on ronnie his uncle said i am interested  i met conyers the other day granet proceeded the man who commands the scorpion i managed to get an invitation down to portsmouth to have lunch with him on his ship i went down with his sister and the young lady he is engaged to marry on deck there was a structure of some sort covered up i tried to make inquires about it but they headed me off pretty quick there was even a sentry standing on guard before itwouldnt let me even feel the shape of it however i hadnt given up hope when there came a wirelessno guests to be allowed on board conyers had to pack us all off back to the hotel without stopping even for lunch from the hotel i got a telescope and i saw a pinnace with halfadozen workmen and a pilot who was evidently an engineer land on board they seemed to be completing the adjustments of some new piece of mechanism then they steamed away out of sight of the land  a busy life yours ronnie sir alfred remarked after a moments pause what about it now ive had two urgent messages from berlin this morning  its pretty difficult granet acknowledged the scorpions out in the channel or the north sea no getting at her and i dont believe theres another destroyer yet fitted with this apparatus whatever it may be  they must be making them somewhere though sir alfred remarked  his nephew nodded  to think he muttered that weve two hundred men spread out at tyneside woolwich and portsmouth and not one of them got on to this a nation of spies indeed theyre mugs uncle  not altogether that the banker replied we have some reports although they dont go far enough i can put you on to the track of the thing the apparatus you saw is something in the nature of an inverted telescope with various extraordinary lenses treated by a new process you can see forty feet down under the surface of the water for a distance of a mile and we believe that attached to the same apparatus is an instrument which brings any moving object within the range of what they call a deepwater gun  did that come from reports granet asked eagerly  it did sir alfred said further than that the main part of the instrument is being made under the supervision of sir meyville worth in a large workshop erected on his estate in a village near brancaster in norfolk  i take it back granet remarked  the plans of the instrument should be worth a hundred thousand pounds sir alfred continued calmly if that is impossible the destruction of the little plant would be the next consideration  do i come in here granet inquired  you do ronnie his uncle replied the name of the village where sir meyville worth lives is market burnham which as i think i told you is within a few miles of brancaster geoffrey at my instigation has arranged a harmless little golf party to go to brancaster the day after tomorrow you will accompany them in the meantime miss worth sir meyville worths only daughter is staying in london until wednesday she is lunching with your aunt at the ritz tomorrow i have made some other arrangements in connection with your visit to norfolk which will keep for the present i see that some strangers have entered the room tell me exactly how you came by the wound in your foot  granet turned a little around there was a queer change in his face as he looked back at his uncle  do you know the man at that corner table he asked  sir alfred glanced across the room  very slightly i spoke to him an hour ago he thanked me for some ambulances he is the chief inspector of hospitals i thinkmajor thomson his name is  did you happen to say that i was dining with you  sir alfred reflected for a moment  i believe that i did mention it he admitted why  granet struggled for a moment with an idea and rejected it he drained his glass and leaned across the table  hes a dull enough person really he remarked a little under his breath but i seem to be always running up against him once or twice hes given me rather a start  sir alfred smiled he called the wine steward and pointed to his nephews glass  the best thing in the world he observed drily as he watched the wine being poured out for presentiments    chapter xvii  lady anselman stood once more in the foyer of the ritz hotel and counted her guests it was a smaller party this time and in its way a less distinguished one there were a couple of officers friends of granets back from the front on leave lady conyers with geraldine and olive granet himself and a tall dark girl with pallid complexion and brilliant eyes who had come with lady anselman and who was standing now by her side  i suppose you know everybody my dear lady anselman asked her genially  the girl shook her head a little disconsolately  we are so little in london lady anselman she murmured you know how difficult father is and just now he is worse than ever in fact if he werent so hard at work i dont believe hed have let me come even now  these scientific men lady anselman declared are great boons to the country but as parent i am afraid they are just a little thoughtless major harrison and colonel grey let me present you to my young chargefor the day only unfortunatelymiss worth now ronnie if you can be persuaded to let miss conyers have a moments peace perhaps you will show us the way in to lunch  granet promptly abandoned his whispered conversation with geraldine the little company moved in and took their places at the round table which was usually reserved for lady anselman on tuesdays  some people the latter remarked as she seated herself find fault with me for going on with my luncheons this season even alfred wont come except now and then personally i have very strong views about it i think we all ought to keep on doing just the same as usualto a certain extent of course there is no reason why we should bring the hotel proprietors and shopkeepers to the brink of ruin because we are all feeling more or less miserable  quite right her neighbour colonel grey assented i am sure it wouldnt do us any good out there to feel that you were all sitting in sackcloth and ashes besides think how pleasant this is to come home to he added looking around the little table jove what a goodlooking girl miss conyers is  lady anselman nodded and lowered her voice a little  she has just broken her engagement to surgeonmajor thomson i wonder whether you know him  inspector of field hospitals or something isnt he the other remarked carelessly i came across him once at boulogne rather a dull sort of fellow he seemed  lady anselman sighed  i am afraid geraldine found him so she agreed her mother is very disappointed i cant help thinking myself though that a girl with her appearance ought to do better  the colonel reflected for a moment  seems to me ive heard something about thomson somewhere he said half to himself bythebye who is the pale girl with the wonderful eyes to whom your nephew is making himself so agreeable  that is isabel worth lady anselman replied she is the daughter of sir meyville worth the great scientist i am afraid she has rather a dull time poor girl her father lives in an outoftheway village of norfolk spends all his time trying to discover things and forgets that he has a daughter at all she has been in london for a few days with an aunt but i dont believe that the old lady is able to do much for her  ronnie seems to be making the running all right her neighbour observed  i asked him specially to look after her lady anselman confided and ronnie is always such a dear at doing what he is told  major harrison leaned across the table towards them  didnt i hear you mention thomsons name just now he inquired i saw him the other day in boulogne awful swell he was about something too a destroyer brought him across and a government motorcar was waiting at the quay to rush him up to the front we all thought at boulogne that royalty was coming at least  there was a slight frown on granets forehead he glanced half unconsciously towards geraldine  mysterious sort of fellow thomson major harrison continued in blissful ignorance of the peculiar significance of his words you see him in paris one day you hear of him at the furthermost point of the french lines immediately afterwards he reports at headquarters within a few hours and you meet him slipping out of a back door of the war office a day or two later  inspector of field hospitals is a post which i think must have been created for him colonel grey remarked hes an impenetrable sort of chap  was major thomson going or returning from france when you saw him last geraldine asked looking across the table  coming back when we left boulogne the destroyer which brought him over was waiting in the harbour it passed us in midchannel doing about thirty knots to our eighteen prince cyril was rather sick he was bringing dispatches but no one seemed to have thought of providing a destroyer for him  after all lady anselman murmured there is nothing very much more important than our hospitals  the conversation drifted away from thomson granet was making himself very agreeable indeed to isabel worth there was a little more colour in her cheeks than at the commencement of luncheon and her manner had become more animated  tell me about the village where you live he inquiredmarket burnham isnt it  when we first went there she replied i thought that it was simply paradise that was four years ago though and i scarcely counted upon spending the winters there  you find it lovely then  she shivered a little half closing her eyes as though to shut out some unpleasant memory  the house she explained is on a sort of tongue of land with a tidal river on either side and the sea not fifty yards away from our drawingroom window when there are high tides we are simply cut off from the mainland altogether unless we go across on a farm cart  you mustnt draw too gloomy a picture of your home lady anselman said i have seen it when it was simply heavenly  and i have seen it the girl retorted with a note of grimness in her tone when it was a great deal more like the other placestillness that seems almost to stifle you grey mists that choke your breath and blot out everything nothing but the gurgling of a little water and the sighingthe most melancholy sighing you ever heardof the wind in our ragged elms i am talking about the autumn and winter now you must remember  it doesnt sound attractive granet admitted bythebye which side of norfolk are you you are nowhere near brancaster i suppose  we are within four miles of it the girl replied quickly you dont ever come there do you  granet looked at her with uplifted eyebrows  this is really rather a coincidence he exclaimed ive never been to brancaster in my life but ive promised one or two fellows to go down to the dormy house there tomorrow or the next day and have a weeks golf geoff anselman is going for one  the girl was for a moment almost goodlooking her eyes glowed her tone was eloquently appealing  youll come by and see us wont you she begged  if i may id be delighted granet promised heartily when are you going back  tomorrow youre quite sure that youll come  i shall come all right granet assured her im not so keen on golf as some of the fellows and my arms still a little dicky but im fed up with london and im not allowed even to come before the board again for a fortnight so i rather welcome the chance of getting right away the links are good i suppose  wonderful miss worth agreed eagerly and i think the clubhouse is very comfortable there are often some quite nice men staying there if only father werent so awfully peculiar the place would be almost tolerable in the season that reminds me she went on with a little sigh i must warn you about father hes the most unsociable person that ever lived  im not shy granet laughed bythebye pardon me but isnt your father the sir meyville worth who invents things im not quite sure what sort of things he added perhaps youd better post me up before i come  i shant tell you a thing isabel worth declared just now its very much better for you to know nothing whatever about him he has what i call the inventors fidgets for some reason or other if a strange person comes near the place he simply loses his head  perhaps i shant be welcome then granet remarked disconsolately  there was a flash in the girls eyes as she answered him  i can assure you that you will captain granet she said if father chooses to behave like a bear well ill try and make up for him  she glanced at him impressively and granet bowed a few minutes later in obedience to lady anselmans signal they all made their way into the lounge where coffee was being served granet made his way to geraldines side but she received him a little coldly  i have been doing my aunts behests he explained my strict orders were to make myself agreeable to a young woman who lives in a sort of bluebeards house where no visitors are allowed and smiling is prohibited  geraldine looked across at isabel worth  i never met miss worth before she said i believe her father is wonderfully clever did i hear you say that you were going out of town  granet nodded  i am going away for a few days i am going away he added dropping his voice ostensibly for a change of air i have another reason for going  he looked at her steadfastly and she forgot her vague misgivings of a few minutes ago after all his perceptions were right it was better for him to leave london for a time  i hope the change will do you good she said quietly i think perhaps you are right to go    chapter xviii  granet a few days later brought his car to a standstill in front of an ordinary fivebarred gate upon which was painted in white letters market burnham hall a slight grey mist was falling and the country inland was almost blotted from sight on the other side of the gate a sandy driver disappeared into an avenue of ragged and stunted elm trees which effectually concealed any view of the house  seems as though the girl were right granet muttered to himself however here goes  he backed his car close to the side of the hedge and laying his hand upon the latch of the gate prepared to swing it open almost immediately a figure stepped out from the shrubs  halt  granet looked with surprise at the khakiclad figure  your name and destination the man demanded  captain granet of the royal fusiliers home from the front on leave granet replied i was going up to the hall to call on miss worth  stay where you are if you please sir the man replied  he stepped back into the sentry box and spoke through a telephone in a moment or two he reappeared  pass on please sir he said  granet walked slowly up the avenue his hands behind him a frown upon his forehead perhaps after all things were not to be so easy for him on either side he could see the stretches of sand and here and there the long creeks of salt water as he came nearer to the house the smell of the sea grew stronger the tops of the trees were more bowed than ever sand was blown everywhere across the hopeless flowerbeds the house itself suddenly revealed was a grim weatherbeaten structure built on the very edge of a queer barrowlike tongue of land which ended with the house itself the sea was breaking on the few yards of beach sheer below the windows to his right was a walled garden some lawns and greenhouses to the left stables a garage and two or three labourers cottages at the front door another soldier was stationed doing sentry duty he stood on one side however and allowed granet to ring the bell  officers quartered here granet inquired  only one sir the man replied  the door was opened almost immediately by a womanservant she did not wait for granet to announce himself but motioned him to follow her into a large circular stone hall across which she led him quickly and threw open the door of the drawingroom isabel worth was standing just inside the room as though listening she held out her hand and there was no doubt about her welcome  captain granet she said almost in a whisper of course youll think we are all mad but would you mind coming upstairs into my little sittingroom  of course not granet acquiesced ill come anywhere with pleasure what a view you have from here  he glanced through the high windows at the other end of the room she laid her fingers upon his arm and led him towards the door  quietly please she whispered try and imagine that you are in a house of conspirators  she led him up the quaint stone staircase spiralshaped to the first floor arrived there she paused to listen for a moment then breathed a little more freely and led him to a small sittingroom at the end of a long passage it was a pleasant little apartment and looked sheer out over the sea she threw herself down upon a sofa with a sigh of relief and pointed to a chair  do sit down captain granet she begged i am really not in the least insane but father is you know i got back on wednesday night and was met at once with stern orders that no visitors of any sort were to be received that the tradespeople were to be interviewed at the front gatesin fact that the house was to be in a state of siege  granet appeared puzzled  but why  simply because dad has gone out of his senses she replied wearily look here  she led him cautiously to the window and pointed downwards about fifty yards out at sea was a queer wooden structure set up on strong supports from where they were nothing was to be seen but a windowless wall of framework and a rope ladder underneath a boat was tethered to one of the supports about thirty yards away a man was rowing leisurely around in another small boat  thats where father spends about twelve hours a day she said what he is doing no one knows he wont even allow me to speak of it when we meet at meals i am not supposed to allude to the fact that he has been out in that crazy place if ever he happens to speak of it he calls it his workshop  but he is not alone there granet asked  oh no there are two or three men from london and an american working with him then do you see the corner of the garden there  she pointed to a long barn or boathouse almost upon the beach before the door two sentries were standing even from where they sat they could hear the faint whirr of a dynamo  there are twenty men at work in there she said they all sleep in the barn or the potting sheds they are not allowed even to go down to the village now perhaps you can begin to understand captain granet what it is like to be here  well it all sounds very interesting he remarked but i should think it must be deadly for you your father invents no end of wonderful things doesnt he  if he does he never speaks about it the girl answered a little bitterly all that he wants from me is my absence or my silence when i came back the other night he was furious if hed thought about it im sure hed have had me stay in london now that i am here though i am simply a prisoner  granet resumed his seat and lit the cigarette which she insisted upon his smoking  well he observed it does seem hard upon you miss worth on the other hand it really is rather interesting isnt it to think that your father is such a man of mysteries  the girl sighed  i suppose so she admitted but then you see father is almost brutal about taking any one into his confidence he never tells even me a thing or encourages me to ask a question i think for that reason i have grown rather to resent his work and the ridiculous restriction he places upon my freedom because of it  a parlourmaid entered with tea a few minutes later and granet moved to his hostess side upon the sofa he showed no more interest in outside happenings he was an adept at light conversation and he made himself thoroughly agreeable for the next hour then he rose quickly to his feet  i must go he declared  she sighed  it has been so nice to have you here she said but if you only knew how difficult it was to arrange it youd understand why i hesitate to ask you to come again  why shouldnt you come and lunch with me tomorrow at the golf club he asked  she hesitated it was obvious that the suggestion appealed to her  i believe i could she assented captain chalmers has a small motorcar hed lend me and if i go out with my golf clubs it would be all right very likely father will sleep out there and we shant see anything of him until tomorrow  granet stepped once more to the window the mists had rolled up more thickly than ever and the queer little structure was almost invisible a bright light however fell upon the water a little distance away  your father has electric light out there he remarked  yes they have a wire from the shed she told him whatever hes trying to do he needs a very intense and concentrated light at times  granet drew a little sigh  well i hope its something thatll do us a bit of good he said we need it the germans are miles ahead of us with regard to all newfangled ideas  she opened her lips and closed them again granet who had suddenly stiffened into rigid attention felt a quick impulse of disappointment  i have rung the bell for my own maid she said she will show you out of the place dont let any one see you if you can help it  and tomorrow he asked you will lunch with me  i will be at the golf club she promised at one oclock  granet was conducted almost stealthily down the stairs and into the avenue halfway to the gate he paused to listen he was hidden from sight now by the gathering twilight and the rolling mists from behind the house came the softly muffled roar of the tide sweeping in and with sharper insistence the whirr of machinery from the boathouse granet lit a cigarette and walked thoughtfully away just as he climbed into the car a peculiar light through the trees startled him he stood up and watched from the top of the house a slowly revolving searchlight played upon the waters    chapter xix  it was a very cheerful little party dining that night at the dormy house club there was granet geoffrey anselman his cousin who played for cambridge and rowed two major harrison whose leave had been extended another three weeks and the secretary of the club who made up the quartette  bythebye where were you this afternoon captain granet the latter asked you left anselman to play our best ball jolly good hiding he gave us too  went out for a spin granet explained and afterwards fell fast asleep in my room wonderful air yours you know he went on  i slept like a top last night major harrison declared the first three nights i was home i never closed my eyes  granet leaned across the table to the secretary  dickens he remarked thats a queerlooking fellow at the further end of the room who is he  the secretary glanced around and smiled  you mean that little fellow with the glasses and the stoop he arrived last night and asked for a match this morning you see what a miserable wizenedup looking creature he is i found him a twelve man and he wiped the floor with me guess what his handicap is  no idea granet replied forty i should think  scratch at st andrews dickens told them his names collins i dont know anything else about him hes paid for a week and were jolly glad to get visitors at all these times  bridge or billiards young anselman asked rising  lets play billiards granet suggested the stretching across the table does me good  well have a snooker then major harrison decided  they played for some time the wizenedlooking little man came and watched them benevolently peering every now and then through his spectacles and applauding mildly any particularly good stroke at eleven oclock they turned out the lights and made their way to their rooms shortly before midnight granet in his dressinggown stole softly across the passage and opened without knocking the door of a room opposite to him the wizenedlooking little man was seated upon the edge of the bed halfdressed granet turned the key in the lock stood for a moment listening and swung slowly around  well he exclaimed softly  the tenant of the room nodded he had taken off his glasses and their absence revealed a face of strong individuality he spoke quietly but distinctly  you have explored the house  as far as i could granet replied the place is almost in a state of siege  proves that we are on the right track any way whats that building that seems to stand out in the water  how do you know about it granet demanded  i sailed out this evening hired a boat at brancaster staithe the fellow wouldnt go anywhere near market burnham though and im rather sorry i tried to make him theyve got the scares here right enough granet i asked him to let me the boat for a week and he wasnt even civil about it didnt want no strangers around these shores he told me when i paid him for the afternoon he was surly about it and kept looking at my fieldglasses  granet frowned heavily  it isnt going to be an easy matter he confessed i hear the admiralty are going to take over the whole thing within the next few days and are sending marines down hows the time  they glanced at their watches it was five minutes before midnight as though by common consent they both crossed to the window and stood looking out into the darkness a slight wind was moving amongst the treetops the night was clear but moonless about half a mile away they could just discern a corner of the clubhouse they stood watching it in silence at five minutes past twelve granet shut his watch with a click  not tonight then he whispered collins  well  what is going on in that wooden shanty  the little man dropped his voice  germany lost two submarines in one day he murmured the device which got them came from that little workshop of worths the plans are probably there or on the premises somewhere  granet groaned  as a matter of fact i have been within a few yards of the thing he said it was all fenced around with matchboarding  do you mean that you have been allowed on board the scorpion  granet nodded  i had the rottenest luck he declared i took miss conyers and her friend down to see her brother commander conyers we were invited to lunch on board at the last moment we were turned off through some glasses from the roof of the ship i saw some workmen pull down the matchboarding but i couldnt make out what the structure was  i can give you an idea collins remarked this fellow worth has got hold of some system of concentric lenses with extraordinary reflectors which enable him to see distinctly at least thirty feet under water then they have a recording instrument according to which they alter the gradient of a new gun with shells that explode under water von lowitz was on the track of something of this sort last year but he gave it up chiefly because krupps wouldnt guarantee him a shell  krupps gave it up a little too soon then granet muttered collins if we cant smash up this little establishment therell be a dozen destroyers before long rigged up with this infernal contrivance  the little man stood before the window and gazed steadfastly out seawards  theyll be here this week he said confidently youd better go now granet its all over for tonight  granet nodded and left the room quietly every one in the dormy house was sound asleep he made his way back to his own apartment without difficulty only the little man remained seated at the window with his eyes fixed upon the bank of murky clouds which lowered over the sea    chapter xx  isabel worth leaned back in the comfortable seat by granets side and breathed a little sigh of content she had enjoyed her luncheon party a deux their stroll along the sands afterwards and she was fully prepared to enjoy this short drive homewards  what a wonderful car yours is she murmured but do tell mewhat on earth have you got in behind  its just a little experimental invention of a friend of mine he explained some day we are going to try it on one of these creeks its a collapsible canvas boat  dont try it anywhere near us she laughed two of the fishermen from wells sailed in a little too close to the shed yesterday and the soldiers fired a volley at them  garnet made a grimace  do you know i am becoming most frightfully curious about your fathers work he observed  are you really she replied carelessly for my part i wouldnt even take the trouble to climb up the ladder into the workshop  but you must know something about what is going on there granet persisted  i really dont she assured him its some wonderful invention i believe but i cant help resenting anything that makes us live like hermits suspect even the tradespeople give up entertaining altogether give up even seeing our friends i hope you are not going to hurry away captain granet i havent had a soul to speak to down here for months  i dont think i shall go just yet he answered i want first to accomplish what i came here for  she turned her head very slowly and looked at him there was quite a becoming flush upon her cheeks  what did you come for she asked softly  he was silent for a moment already his foot was on the brake of the car they were drawing near the plain fivebarred gates  perhaps i am not quite sure about that myself he whispered  they had come to a standstill she descended reluctantly  i hate to send you away she sighed it seems so inhospitable will you come in for a little time the worst that can happen if we meet dad is that he might be rather rude  ill risk it with pleasure granet replied  can i see your collapsible boat she asked peering in behind  he shook his head  it isnt my secret he said and besides i dont think my friend has the patent for it yet  the sentry stood by and allowed them to pass although he looked searchingly at granet they walked slowly up the scrubby avenue to the house once granet paused to look down at the long arm of the sea on his left  you have quite a river there he remarked  she nodded  that used to be the principal waterway from burnham village quite a large boat can get down now at high tide  they entered the house and isabel gave a little gesture of dismay she clutched for a moment at granets arm an elderly man dressed in somber black clothes disgracefully dusty collarless with a mass of white hair blown all over his face was walking up and down the hall with a great pair of hornrimmed spectacles clutched in his hand he stopped short at the sound of the opening door and hurried towards them there was nothing about his appearance in the least terrifying he seemed in fact bubbling over with excited goodhumour  isabel my dear he exclaimed it is wonderful i have succeeded i have changed the principles of a lifetime made the most brilliant optical experiment which any man of science has ever ventured to essay with the resultwell you shall see i have wired to the admiralty wired for more workpeople captain chalmers is it not he went on you must tell your men to double and redouble their energies this place is worth watching now come i will show you something amazing  he turned and led them hastily towards the back door isabel gripped granets arm  he thinks you are the officer in command of the platoon here she whispered better let him go on thinking so  granet nodded  is he going to take us to the workshop  i believe so she assented  they had hard work to keep up with sir meyville as he led them hastily down the little stretch of shingle to where a man was sitting in a boat they all jumped in the man with the oars looked doubtfully for a moment at granet but pulled off at once when ordered to do so they rowed round to the front of the queer little structure a man from inside held out his hand and helped them up another young man with books piled on the floor by his side was making some calculations at a table almost the whole of the opening of the place was taken up by what seemed to be a queer medley of telescopes and lenses pointing different ways sir meyville beamed upon them as he hastily turned a handle  now he promised you shall see what no one has ever seen before see i point that arrow at that spot about fifty yards out now look through this one isabel  the girl stooped forward was silent for a moment then she gave a little cry of wonder she clutched granets arm and made him take her place he too called out softly he saw the sandy bottom covered with shells a rock with tentacles of seaweed floating from it several huge crabs a multitude of small fishes everything was clear and distinct he looked away with a little gasp  wonderful he exclaimed  sir meyvilles smile was beatific  that is my share he said down in the other workshop my partners are hard at it they too have met with success you must tell your men captain chalmers never to relax their vigil this place must be watched by night and by day my last invention was a great step forward but this is absolute success for the next few months this is the most precious spot in europe  it isnt captain chalmers father isabel interrupted  sir meyville seemed suddenly to become still he looked fixedly at granet  who are you then he demanded who are you sir  i am captain granet of the royal fusiliers back from the front wounded granet replied i can assure you that i am a perfectly trustworthy person  but i dont understand sir meyville said sharply what are you doing here  i came to call upon your daughter granet explained i had the pleasure of meeting her at lunch at lady anselmans the other day we have been playing golf together at brancaster  sir meyville began to mumble to himself as he pushed them into the boat  my fault he mutteredmy fault captain granet i thought that my daughter knew my wishes i am not at present in a position to receive guests or visitors of any description you will pardon my apparent inhospitality i shall ask you sir to kindly forget this visit and to keep away from here for the present  i shall obey your wishes of course sir granet promised i can assure you that i am quite a harmless person though  i do not doubt it sir sir meyville replied but it is the harmless people of the world who do the most mischief an idle word here or there and great secrets are given away if you will allow me i will show you a quicker way down the avenue without going to the house  granet shrugged his shoulders  just as you will sir he assented  you can go in isabel her father directed curtly i will see captain granet off  she obeyed and took leave of her guest with a little shrug of the shoulders sir meyville took granets arm and led him down the avenue  captain granet he said gravely i am an indiscreet person and i have an indiscreet daughter bearing in mind your profession i may speak to you as man to man keep what you have seen absolutely secret put a seal upon your memory go back to brancaster and dont even look again in this direction the soldiers round this place have orders not to stand on ceremony with any one and by tonight i believe we are to have an escort of marines here as well what you have seen is for the good of the country  i congratulate you heartily sir granet replied shaking hands of course ill keep away if i must i hope when this is all over though you will allow me to come and renew my acquaintance with your daughter  when it is over with pleasure sir meyville assented  granet stepped into his car and drove off the inventor stood looking after him then he spoke to the sentry and made his way across the gardens towards the boatshed  i ought to have known it from the first he muttered reciprocal refraction was the one thing to think about   granet as he drove back to the dormy house was conscious of a curious change in the weather the wind which had been blowing more or less during the last few days had suddenly dropped there was a new heaviness in the atmosphere little banks of transparent mist were drifting in from seawards more than once he stopped the car and standing up looked steadily away seawards the long stretch of marshland on which the golf links were situated was empty a slight drizzling rain was falling he found when he reached the dormy house that nearly all the men were assembled in one of the large sittingrooms a table of bridge had been made up mr collins was seated in an easychair close to the window reading a review granet accepted a cup of tea and stood on the hearthrug  how did the golf go this afternoon he inquired  i was dead off it anselman replied gloomily  our friend in the easychair there knocked spots off us  mr collins looked up and grunted and looked out of the window again  either of you fellows going to cut in at bridge young anselman continued  granet shook his head and walked to the window  i cant stick cards in the daytime  mr collins shut up his review  i agree with you sir he said i endeavoured to persuade one of these gentlemen to play another nine holesunsuccessfully i regret to state  granet lit a cigarette  well he remarked its too far to get down to the links again but ill play you a game of bowls if you like  the other glanced out upon the lawn and rose to his feet  it is an excellent suggestion he declared if you will give me five minutes to fetch my mackintosh and galoshes it would interest me to see whether i have profited by the lessons i took in scotland  they met a few moments later in the garden mr collins threw the jack with great precision and they played an end during which his superiority was apparent they strolled together across the lawn well away now from the house for the first time granet dropped his careless tone  what do you make of this change in the weather he asked quickly  its just what they were waiting for the other replied what about this afternoon  i am not scientist worse luck granet replied impatiently but i saw enough to convince me that theyve got the right idea sir meyville thought i was the man commanding the escort theyve given himactually rowed me out to the workshop and showed me the whole thing i tell you i saw it just as you described itsaw the bottom of the sea even the colour of the seaweed the holes in the rocks  and theyve got the shells too collins muttered the shells that burst under water  granet looked around they were playing the other end now  listen he said  they paused in the middle of the lawn granet held up his handkerchief and turned his cheek seaward there was still little more than a floating breath of air but his cheek was covered with moisture  i have everything ready he said just before we go to bed tonight i shall swear that i hear an aeroplane youre sure your watch is right to the second collins  i am as sure that it is right the other replied grimly as i am that tonight you and i my young friend are going to play with our lives a little more carelessly than with this china ball a good throw that i think he went on measuring it with his eye carefully come my friend youll have to improve my scotch practice is beginning to tell  geoffrey anselman threw up the window and looked out  pretty hot stuff isnt he ronnie he asked  granet glanced at his opponent with his bent shoulders his hard face hooked nose and thin gold spectacles  yes he admitted quietly hes too good for me    chapter xxi  at about halfpast ten that evening granet suddenly threw down his cue in the middle of a game of billiards and stood for a moment in a listening attitude  jove i believe thats an airship he exclaimed and hurried out of the room  they all followed him he was standing just outside the frenchwindows of the sittingroom upon the gravel walk his head upturned listening intently there was scarcely a breath of wind no moon nor any stars little clouds of grey mist hung about on the marshes shutting out their view of the sea the stillness was more than usually intense  cant hear a thing young anselman muttered at last  it may have been fancy granet admitted  a motorcycle going along the huntstanton road major harrison suggested  its a magnificent night for a raid dickens remarked glancing around  no chance of zepps over here i should say collins declared a little didactically i was looking at your map at the golf club only this morning  they all made their way back to the house granet however seemed still dissatisfied  im going to see that my cars all right he told them i left it in the open shed  he was absent for about twenty minutes when he returned they had finished the game of snooker pool without him and were all sitting on the lounge by the side of the billiard table talking of the war granet listened for a few minutes and then said goodnight a little abruptly he lit his candle outside and went slowly to his room arrived there he glanced at his watch and locked the door it was halfpast eleven he changed his clothes quickly put on some rubbersoled shoes and slipped a brandy flask and a revolver into his pocket then he sat down before his window with his watch in his hand he was conscious of a certain foreboding from which he had never been able to escape since his arrival in france and belgium he had lived through fateful hours carrying more than once his life in his hands his risk tonight was an equal one but the exhilaration seemed lacking this work in a country apparently at peace seemed somehow on a different level if it were less dangerous it was also less stimulating in those few moments the soldier blood in him called for the turmoil of war the panorama of life and death the fierce hot excitement of juggling with fate while the heavens themselves seemed raining death on every side here there was nothing but silence the soft splash of the distant sea the barking of a distant dog the danger was vivid and actual but without the stimulus of that bloodred background he glanced at his watch it wanted still ten minutes to twelve for a moment then he suffered his thoughts to go back to the new thing which had crept into his life he was suddenly back in the milan he saw the backward turn of her head the almost wistful look in her eyes as she made her little pronouncement she had broken her engagement why it was a battle indeed he was fighting with that still cold antagonist whom he half despised and half feared the man concerning whose actual personality he had felt so many doubts what if things should go wrong tonight if the whole dramatic story should be handed over for the glory and wonder of the halfpenny press he could fancy their headlines imagine even their trenchant paragraphs it was skating on the thinnest of iceand for what his fingers gripped the damp windowsill he raised himself a little higher his eyes fell upon his watchstill a minute or two to twelve slowly he stole to his door and listened the place was silent he made his way on tiptoe across the landing and entered collins room the latter was seated before the wideopen window he had blown out his candle and the room was in darkness he half turned his head at granets entrance  two minutes he exclaimed softly granet it will be tonight are you ready  absolutely  they stood by the open window in silence nothing had changed it was not yet time for the singing of the earliest birds the tiny village lay behind them silent and asleep in front nothing but the marshes uninhabited lonely and quiet the golf clubhouse empty and deserted they stood and watched their faces turned steadfastly in a certain direction gradually their eyes growing accustomed to the dim and changing light could pierce the black line above the grey where the sea came stealing up the sandy places with low murmurs throwing with every wave longer arms into the land  twelve oclock collins muttered  suddenly granets fingers dug into his shoulder from out of that pall of velvet darkness which hung below the clouds came for a single moment a vision of violet light it rose apparently from nowhere it passed away into space it was visible barely for five seconds then it had gone granet spoke with a little sob  my god he murmured theyre coming  collins was already on his feet he had straightened himself wonderfully and there was a new alertness in his manner he too wore rubber shoes and his movements were absolutely noiseless he carried a little electric torch in his hand which he flashed around the room while he placed several small articles in his pocket then he pushed open the door and listened he turned back held up his finger and nodded the two men passed down the stairs through the sittingroom out on to the lawn by a door left unfastened and round the house to the shed together they pushed the car down the slight incline of the drive granet mounted into the drivingseat and pressed the selfstarter collins took the place by his side  remember granet whispered we heard something and i met you in the hall sit tight  they sped with all the silence and smoothness of their sixcylinder up the treehung road through the sleeping village and along the narrow lane to market burnham when they were within about a hundred yards of the gate granet brought the car to a standstill  there are at least two sentries that way he said and if sir meyville told me the truth they may have a special guard of marines out tonight this is where we take to the marshes listen can you hear anything  they both held their breath  nothing yet collins muttered lets get the things out quickly  granet hurried to the back of the car ripping open the coverings in a few moments they had dragged over the side a small collapsible boat of canvas stretched across some bamboo joints with two tiny sculls they clambered up the bank  the creek must be close here granet whispered dont show a light listen  this time they could hear the sound of an engine beating away in the boathouse on the other side of the hall through the closelydrawn curtains too they could see faint fingers of light from the house on the sea  they are working still granet continued look out collins thats the creek  they pushed the boat into the middle of the black arm of water and stepped cautiously into it taking one of the paddles granet kneeling down propelled it slowly seaward once or twice they ran into the bank and had to push off but very soon their eyes grew accustomed to the darkness by degrees the creek broadened they passed close to the walls of the garden and very soon they were perceptibly nearer the quaintlysituated workshop granet paused for a moment from his labours  the hall is dark enough he muttered listen  they heard the regular pacing of a sentinel in the drive nearer to them on the top of the wall they fancied that they heard the clash of a bayonet granet dropped his voice to the barest whisper  we are close there now stretch out your hand collins can you feel a shelf of rock  its just in front of me was the stifled answer  thats for the stuff down with it  for a few moments collins was busy then with a little gasp he gripped granets arm his voice shaking with nervous repression was still almost hysterical  theyre coming granet my god theyre coming  both men turned seaward far away in the clouds it seemed they could hear a faint humming some new sound something mechanical in its regular beating yet with clamorous throatiness of some human force cleaving its way through the resistless air with every second it grew louder the men stood clutching one another  have you got the fuse ready they must hear it in a moment granet muttered  collins assented silently the reverberations became louder and louder soon the air was full of echoes from far away inland dogs were barking from a farm somewhere the other side of the road they heard the shout of a single voice  now granet whispered  collins leaned forward the fuse in his hand touched the dark substance which he had spread out upon the rock in a moment a strange unearthly green light seemed to roll back the darkness the house the workshop the trees the slowly flowing sea their own ghastly faceseverything stood revealed in a blaze of hideous awful light for a moment they forgot themselves they forgot the miracle they had brought to pass their eyes were rivetted skyward high above them something blacker than the heavens themselves stupendous huge seemed suddenly to assume to itself shape the roar of machinery was clearly audible from the house came the mingled shouting of many voices something dropped into the sea a hundred yards away with a screech and a hiss and a geyserlike fountain leapt so high that the spray reached them then there was a sharper sound as a rifle bullet whistled by  my god granet exclaimed its time we were out of this collins  he seized his scull even at that moment there was a terrific explosion a stream of lurid fire seemed to leap from the corner of the house the wall split and fell outwards and then there came another sound hideous sickly a sound granet had heard before the sound of a rifle bullet cutting its way through flesh followed by an inhuman cry for a moment collins arms whirled around him then with no other sound save that one cry he fell forward and disappeared for a single second granet leaned over the side of the boat as though to dive after him then came another roar the sand flew up in a blinding storm the whole of the creek was suddenly a raging torrent the boat was swung on a precipitous mountain of salt water and as quickly capsized granet breathless for a moment and half stunned found his way somehow to the side of the marshland and from there stumbled his way towards the road the house behind him was on fire the air seemed filled with hoarse shoutings he turned and ran for the spot where he had left the car once he fell into a salt water pool and came out wet through to the waist in the end however he reached the bank clambered over it and slipped down into the road then a light was flashed into his eyes and a bayonet was rattled at his feet there were a couple of soldiers in charge of his car  hands up was the hoarse order  granet calmly flashed his own electric torch there were at least a dozen soldiers standing around and a little company were hurrying down from the gates he switched off his light almost immediately  is any one hurt he asked  there was a dead silence he felt his arms seized on either side  the captains coming down the road one of the men said lay on to him tim    chapter xxii  granet sauntered in to breakfast a few minutes late on the following morning a little volley of questions and exclamations reached him as he stood by the sideboard  heard about the zeppelin raid  they say theres a bomb on the ninth green  market burnham hall is burnt to the ground  granet sighed as he crossed the room and took his seat at the table  if you fellows hadnt slept like oxen last night he remarked youd have known a lot more about it i saw the whole show  nonsense major harrison exclaimed  tell us all about it young anselman begged  i heard the thing just as i was beginning to undress granet explained i rushed downstairs and found collins out in the garden  where the devil is collins bythebye  they glanced at his vacant place  not down yet go on  well we could hear the vibration like anything coming from over the marsh there i got the car out and we were no sooner on the road than i could see it distinctly right above usa huge cigarshaped thing we raced along after it along the road towards market burnham just before it reached the hall it seemed to turn inland and then come back again we pulled up to watch it and collins jumped out he said hed go as far as the hall and warn them i sat in the car watching she came right round and seemed to hover over those queer sort of outbuildings there are at market burnham all at once the bombs began to drop  what are they like geoffrey anselman exclaimed  granet poured out his coffee carefully  ive seen em beforeplenty of them too he remarked but they did rain them down then all of a sudden there was a sort of glarei dont know what happened it was just as though some one had lit one of those coloured lights the hall was just as clearly visible as at noonday i could see the men running about shouting and the soldiers tumbling out of their quarters all the time the bombs were coming down like hail and a corner of the hall was in flames then the lighted stuff whatever it was burnt out and the darkness seemed as black as pitch i hung around for some time looking for collins then i went up to the house to help them extinguish the fire i didnt get back till four oclock  what about collins young anselman asked i was playing him at golf  better send up and see granet proposed i waited till i couldnt stick it any longer  they sent a servant up the reply came back quicklymr collins bed had not been slept in granet frowned a little  i suppose hell think i let him down he said i waited at least an hour for him  was any one hurt by the bombs geoffrey anselman inquired  no one seemed to be much the worse granet replied i didnt think of anything of that sort in connection with collins though perhaps he might have got hurt  well all go over and have a look for him this afternoon if he hasnt turned up anselman suggested what about playing me a round of golf this morning  suit me all right granet agreed id meant to lay up because of my arm but its better this morning well start early and get back for the papers  they motored down to the clubhouse and played their round it was a wonderful spring morning with a soft west wind blowing from the land little patches of sea lavender gave purple colour to the marshland the creeks winding their way from the sea to the village shone like quicksilver beneath the vivid sunshine it was a morning of utter and complete peace granet notwithstanding a little trouble with his arm played carefully and well when at last they reached the eighteenth green he holed a wonderful curly putt for the hole and the match  a great game his cousin declared as they left the green who the devil are these fellows  there were two soldiers standing at the gate and a military motorcar drawn up by the side of the road an orderly stepped forward and addressed granet  captain granet he asked saluting  granet nodded and stretched out his hand for the note the fingers which drew it from the envelope were perfectly steady he even lifted his head for a moment to look at a lark just overhead yet the few hastily scrawled lines were like a message of fate  the officer in command at market burnham hall would be obliged if captain granet would favour him with an immediate interview with reference to the events of last night  do you mean that you want me to go at once before luncheon he asked the orderly  the man pointed to the car  my instructions were to take you back at once sir  come and have a drink first at any rate geoffrey anselman insisted  the orderly shook his head the two soldiers were barring the gateway  some one from the war office has arrived and is waiting to speak to captain granet he announced  were all coming over after lunch young anselman protested wouldnt that do  the man made no answer granet with a shrug of the shoulders stepped into the motorcar the two soldiers mounted motorcycles and the little cavalcade turned away granet made a few efforts at conversation with his companion but meeting with no response soon relapsed into silence in less than twenty minutes the car was slowing down before the approach to the hall the lane was crowded with villagers and people from the neighbouring farmhouses who were all kept back however by a little cordon of soldiers granet closely attended by his escort made his way slowly into the avenue and up towards the house a corner of the left wing of the building was in ruins blackened and still smouldering and there was a great hole in the sandblown lawn where a bomb had apparently fallen a soldier admitted them at the front entrance and his guide led him across the hall and into a large room on the other side of the house an apartment which seemed to be half library half morningroom sir meyville and a man in uniform were talking together near the window they turned around at granets entrance and he gave a little start for the first time a thrill of fear chilled him his selfconfidence was suddenly dissipated the man who stood watching him with cold scrutiny was the one man on earth whom he fearedsurgeon major thomson    chapter xxiii  it was a queer little gathering in the drawingroom of market burnham hall queer and in a sense ominous two soldiers guarded the door another one stood with his back to the wideflung window the sunlight flashing upon his drawn bayonet granet although he looked about him for a moment curiously carried himself with ease and confidence  how do you do sir meyville he said how are you thomson  sir meyville who was in a state of great excitement took absolutely no notice of the young mans greeting thomson pointed to a chair in which granet at once seated himself  i have sent for you captain granet the former began to ask you certain questions with reference to the events of last night  delighted to tell you anything i can granet replied isnt this a little out of your line though thomson  sir meyville suddenly leaned forward  that is the young man he declared i took him to be the officer in command here and i showed him over my workshop quite a mistakeabsolutely a wrong impression  it was a mistake for which you could scarcely hold me responsible granet protested and you must really excuse me if i fail to see the connection perhaps you will tell me major thomson what i am here for  major thomson seated himself before the desk and leaned a little back in his chair  we sent for you he said because we are looking for two men who lit the magnesium light which directed the zeppelin last night to this locality one of them lies on the lawn there with a bullet through his brain we are still looking for the other  do you imagine that i can be of any assistance to you granet asked  that is our impression major thomson admitted perhaps you will be so good as to tell us what you were doing here last night  certainly granet replied about halfpast ten last night i thought i heard the engine of an airship we all went out on the lawn but could see nothing however i took that opportunity to get my car ready in case there was any excitement going later on as i was on my way upstairs i distinctly heard the sound once more i went out started my car and drove down the lane it seemed to be coming in this direction so i followed along pulled up short of the house climbed on the top of the bank and saw that extraordinary illumination from the marshland on the other side i saw a man in a small boat fall back as though he were shot a moment or two later i returned to my car and was accosted by two soldiers to whom i gave my name and address that is really all i know about the matter  major thomson nodded  you had only just arrived then when the bombs were dropped  i pulled up just before the illumination granet asserted  thomson looked at him thoughtfully  i am going to make a remark captain granet he said upon which you can comment or not as you choose was not your costume last night rather a singular one for the evening you say that you were on your way upstairs to undress when you heard the zeppelin do you wear rubber shoes and a norfolk jacket for dinner  granet for a moment bit his lip  i laid out those things in case there was anything doing he said as i told you i felt sure that i had heard an airship earlier in the evening and i meant to try and follow it if i heard it again  there was a brief silence granet lounged a little back in his chair but though his air of indifference was perfect a sickening foreboding was creeping in upon him he was conscious of failure of blind idiotic folly never before had he been guilty of such miserable shortsightedness he fought desperately against the toils which he felt were gradually closing in upon him there must be some way out  captain granet he questioner continued in his calm emotionless tone according to your story you changed your clothes and reached here at the same time as the zeppelin after having heard its approach it is four miles and a half to the dormy house club and that zeppelin must have been travelling at the rate of at least sixty miles an hour is your car capable of miracles  it is capable of sixty miles an hour granet declared  perhaps i may spare you the trouble thomson proceeded drily of further explanations captain granet when i tell you that your car was observed by one of the sentries quite a quarter of an hour before the arrival of the zeppelins and the lighting of that flare your statements to put it mildly are irreconcilable with the facts of the case i must ask you once more if you have any other explanation to give as to your movements last night  what other explanation can i give granet asked his brain working fiercely i have told you the truth what more can i say  you have told me major thomson went on and his voice seemed like the voice of fate that you arrived here in hot haste simultaneously with the lighting of that flare and the dropping of the bombs not only one of the sentries on guard here but two other people have given evidence that your car was out there in the lane for at least a quarter of an hour previous to the happenings of which i have just spoken for the last time captain granet i must ask you whether you wish to amend your explanation  there was a little movement at the further end of the room a curtain was drawn back and isabel worth came slowly towards them she stood there the curtains on either side of her ghastly pale her hands clasped in front of her twitching nervously  i am very sorry she said this is all my fault  they stared at her in amazement only granet with an effort kept his face expressionless sir meyville began to mutter to himself  god bless my soul he mumbled isabel what do you want girl cant you see that we are engaged  she took no notice of him she turned appealingly towards major thomson  can you send the soldiers away for a moment she begged i dont think that they will be needed  major thomson gave a brief order and the men left the room isabel came a little nearer to the table she avoided looking at granet  i am very sorry indeed she went on if anything i have done has caused all this trouble captain granet came down here partly to play golf partly at my invitation he was here yesterday afternoon as my father knows before he lefti asked him to come over last night  there was a breathless silence isabel was standing at the end of the table her fingers still clasped nervously together a spot of intense colour in her cheeks she kept her eyes turned sedulously away from granet sir meyville gripped her by the shoulder  what do you mean girl he demanded harshly what do you mean by all this rubbish speak out  granet looked up for a moment  dont he begged i can clear myself miss worth if any one is mad enough to have suspicions about me i should never  the truth may just as well be told she interrupted there is nothing to be ashamed of it is hideously dull down here and the life my father has asked me to lead for the last few months has been intolerable i never sleep and i invited captain granet to come over here at twelve oclock last night and take me for a motor ride i was dressed meaning to go and captain granet came to fetch me it turned out to be impossible because of all the new sentries about the place but that is why captain granet was here and that she concluded turning to major thomson is why i suppose he felt obliged to tell you what was not the truth it has been done before  there was a silence which seemed composed of many elements sir meyville worth stood with his eyes fixed upon his daughter and an expression of blank uncomprehending dismay in his features granet a frown upon his forehead was looking towards the floor thomson with the air of seeing nobody was studying them all in turn it was he who spoke first  as you justly remark miss worth he observed this sort of thing has been done before we will leave it there for the present will you come this way with me if you please captain granet i wont trouble you miss worth or you sir meyville you might not like what we are going to see  granet rose at once to his feet  of course i will come wherever you like he assented  the two men passed together side by side in momentous silence across the stone hall out of the house and round the back of the garden to a wooden shed before which was posted a sentry the man stood on one side to let them pass on the bare stone floor inside was stretched the dead body of collins the salt water was still oozing from his clothes and limbs running away in little streams there was a small blue hole in the middle of his forehead  this apparently thomson said is the man who lit the magnesium light which showed the zeppelin where to throw her bombs the thing was obviously prearranged can you identify him  identify him granet exclaimed why i was playing bowls with him yesterday afternoon he is a glasgow merchant named collins and a very fine golf player he is staying at the dormy house club  he has also another claim to distinction major thomson remarked drily for he is the man who fired those lights the sergeant who shot him fancied that he heard voices on the creek and crept up to the wall just before the flare came the sergeant i may add is under the impression that there were two men in the boat  granet shook his head dubiously  i know nothing whatever of the man or his movements he declared beyond what i have told you i have scarcely spoken a dozen words to him in my life and never before our chance meeting at the dormy house  you do not for instance happen to know how he came here from the dormy house  if you mean did he come in my car granet answered easily please let me assure you that he did not my errand here last night was indiscreet enough but i certainly shouldnt have brought another man especially a stranger with me  thank you major thomson concluded that is all i have to say to you for the present  has there been much damage done granet inquired  very little  they had reached the corner of the avenue granet glanced down towards the road  i presume he remarked that i am at liberty to depart  thomson gave a brief order to the soldier who had been attending them  you will find the car in which you came waiting to take you back captain granet he announced  the two men had paused granet was on the point of departure with the passing of his sudden apprehension of danger his curiosity was awakened  do you mind telling me major thomson he asked how it is that you holding i presume a medical appointment were selected to conduct an inquiry like this i have voluntarily submitted myself to your questioning but if i had had anything to conceal i might have been inclined to dispute your authority  thomsons face was immovable he simply pointed to the gate at the end of the avenue  if it had been necessary captain granet he said coldly i should have been able to convince you that i was acting under authority as it is i wish you goodmorning  granet hesitated but only for a moment then he shrugged his shoulders and turned away  goodmorning major  he made his way down to the lane which was still crowded with villagers and loungers he was received with a shower of questions as he climbed into the car  not much damage done that i can hear he told them all the corner of the house caught fire and the lawn looks like a sandpit  he was driven in silence back to the dormy house when he arrived there the place was deserted the other men were lunching at the golf club he made his way slowly to the impromptu shed which served for a garage his own car was standing there he looked all around to make sure that he was absolutely alone then he lifted up the cushion by the drivingseat carefully folded and arranged in the corner were the hornrimmed spectacles and the silk handkerchief of the man who was lying at market burnham with a bullet through his forehead    chapter xxiv  mr gordon jones rose to his feet it had been an interesting in some respects a momentous interview he glanced around the plain but handsomely furnished office a room which betrayed so few evidences of the worldflung power of its owner  after all sir alfred he remarked smiling i am not sure that it is downing street which rules we can touch our buttons and move armies and battleships across the face of the earth you pull down your ledger sign your name and you can strike a blow as deadly as any we can conceive  the banker smiled  let us be thankful then he said that the powers we wield are linked together in the great cause  mr gordon jones hesitated  such things i know are little to you sir alfred he continued but at the same time i want you to believe that his majestys government will not be unmindful of your help at this juncture to speak of rewards at such a time is perhaps premature i know that ordinary honours do not appeal to you yet it has been suggested to me by a certain person that i should assure you of the countrys gratitude in plain words there is nothing you may ask for which it would not be our pleasure and privilege to give you  sir alfred bowed slightly  you are very kind he said later on perhaps one may reflect at present there seems to be only one stern duty before us and for that one needs no reward  the two men parted sir alfred rose from the chair in front of his desk and threw himself into the easychair which his guest had been occupying a ray of city sunshine found its way through the tangle of tall buildings on the other side of the street lay in a zigzag path across his carpet and touched the firm lines of his thoughtful face he sat there slowly tapping the sides of the chair with his pudgy fingers so a great soldier might have sat following out the progress of his armies in different countries listening to the roar of their guns watching their advance their faltering their success and their failures sir alfreds vision was in a sense more sordid in many ways more complicated yet it too had its dramatic side he looked at the moneymarkets of the world he saw exchanges rise and fall he saw in the dim vista no khakiclad army with flashing bayonets but a long thin line of blackcoated men with sallow faces clutching their moneybags  there was a knock at the door and his secretary entered  captain granet has been here for some time sir he announced softly  the banker came back to the present he woke up indeed with a little start  show my nephew in at once he directed i shall be engaged with him for at least a quarter of an hour kindly go round to the bank of england and arrange for an interview with mr williams for three oclock this afternoon  the clerk silently withdrew granet entered a few minutes later the banker greeted him pleasantly  well ronnie he exclaimed i thought that you were going to be down in norfolk for a week come in bring your chair up to my side so this is one of my deaf mornings  granet silently obeyed sir alfred glanced around the room there was no possible hidingplace not the slightest chance of being overheard  what about it ronnie  we did our share granet answered collins was there at the dormy house club we got the signal and we lit the flare they came down to within two or three hundred feet and they must have thrown twenty bombs at least they damaged the shed but missed the workshop the house caught fire but they managed to put that out  you escaped all right im glad to see  they got collins granet said dropping his voice almost to a whisper he was shot by my side they caught me too ive been in a few tight corners but nothing tighter than that who do you think was sent down from the war office to hold an inquiry thomsonthat fellow thomson  the banker frowned  do you mean the man who is the head of the hospitals  supposed to be granet answered grimly i am beginning to wondertell me you havent heard anything more about him have you  not a word sir alfred replied why should i  nothing except that i have an uncomfortable feeling about him granet went on i wish i felt sure that he was just what he professes to be he is the one man who seems to suspect me if it hadnt been for isabel worth i was done forfinisheddown at that wretched hole he had me where i couldnt move the girl lied and got me out of it  sir alfred drummed for a moment with his fingers upon the table  i am not sure that these risks are worth while for you ronnie he said  the young man shrugged his shoulders his face certainly seemed to have grown thinner during the last few days  i dont mind it so much abroad he declared it seems a different thing there somehow but over here its all wrong its the atmosphere i suppose and that fellow thomson means mischiefim sure of it  is there any reason for illfeeling between you two the banker inquired  granet nodded  youve hit it sir  miss conyers eh  the young mans face underwent a sudden change  yes he confessed if i hadnt begun this if i hadnt gone so far into it that no other course was possible i think that i should have been content to be just what i seem to bebecause of her  sir alfred leaned back in his chair he was looking at his nephew as a man of science might have looked at some interesting specimen  well he said i suppose you simply confirm the experience of the ages but frankly you amaze me you are moving amongst the big places of life you are with those who are making history and you would be content to give the whole thing up for what you would become a commonplace easygoing young animal of a british soldier for the sake of the affection of a goodlooking wellbred commonplace british young woman i dont understand you ronald you have the blood of empiremakers in your veins your education and environment have developed an outward resemblance to the thing you profess to be but behinddont you fell the grip of the other things  i feel them right enough granet replied i have felt them for the last seven or eight years but i am feeling something else too something which i dare say you never felt something which i have never quite believed in  sir alfred leaned back in his chair  in a way he admitted this is disappointing you are right i have never felt the call of those other things when i was a young man i was frivolous simply when i felt inclined to turn from the big things of life for purposes of relaxation when an alliance was suggested to me i was content to accept it but thank heavens i have been oriental enough to keep women in my life where they belong i am disappointed in you ronnie  the young man shrugged his shoulders  i havent flinched he said  no but the soft spots there was the grim reply however let that go tell me why you came up wasnt it better to have stayed down at brancaster for a little longer  perhaps his nephew assented my arm came on a little rocky and i had to chuck golf apart from that i wasnt altogether comfortable about things at market burnham i was obliged to tell thomson that i saw nothing of collins that night but they know at the dormy house club that he started with me in the car and has never been heard of since then there was the young woman  saved you by a lie didnt she the banker remarked that may be awkward later on  im sick of my own affairs granet declared gloomily is there anything fresh up here at all  sir alfred frowned slightly  nothing very much he said at the same time there are distinct indications of a change which i dont like with certain statesmen here at the top of the tree it was perfectly easy for me to carry out any schemes which i thought necessary during the last few weeks however there has been a change nominally things are the same actually i seem to find another hand at work another hand which works with the censorship too one of my very trusted agents in harwich made the slightest slip the other day a few weeks ago he would either have been fined twenty pounds or interned do you know what happened to him on wednesday of course you dont he was arrested at one oclock and shot in half an hour then you saw the papers this morning all sailings between here and a certain little spot we know of have been stopped without a moments warning i am compelled to pause in several most interesting schemes  nothing for me i suppose granet asked a little nervously  sir alfred looked at him  not for the moment he replied but there will be very soon take hold of yourself ronnie dont look downwards so much you and i are walking in the clouds it is almost as bad to falter as to slip confessyouve been afraid  i have granet admitted not afraid of death but afraid of what might follow upon discovery i am half inclined if just one thing in the world came my way to sail for new york tomorrow and start again  when those fears come to you sir alfred continued slowly consider me i run a greater risk than you there are threads from this office stretching to many corners of england to many corners of america to most cities of europe if a man with brains should seize upon any one of them he might follow it backwardseven here  sir alfred touched his chest for a moment then his hand dropped to his side and he proceeded  for twentyeight years i have ruled the moneymarkets of the world no cabinet council is held in this country at which my influence is not represented the ministers come to me one by one for help and advice i represent the third great force of war and there isnt a single member of the present government who doesnt look upon me as the most important person in the country yet i too have enemies ronnie there is the halfpenny press theyd give a million for the chance that may come at any day theyd print my downfall in blacker lines than the declaration of war theyd shriek over my ruin with a more brazenthroated triumph even than they would greet the heralds of peace and the threads are there ronald sometimes i feel one shiver a little sometimes i have to stretch out my arm and brush too curious an inquirer into the place where curiosity ends i sit and watch and i am well served there are men this morning at buckingham palace with a vc to be pinned upon their breast who faced dangers for ten minutes less than i face day and night  granet rose to his feet  for a moment he exclaimed i had forgotten tell me he added with sudden vigour what have we done it for you made your great name in england you were eton and oxford why is it that when the giant struggle comes it should be germany who governs your heart it should be germany who calls even to me  sir alfred held out his hand his eye had caught the clock  ronnie he said have you ever wondered why in a flock of sheep every lamb knows its mother germany was the mother of our stock birth life and education count for nothing when the great days come when the mother voice speaks it isnt that we are false to england it is that we are true to our own you must go now ronnie i have an appointment  granet walked out to the street a little dazed and called for a taxi  i suppose that must be it he muttered to himself    chapter xxv  geraldine welcomed her unexpected visitor that afternoon cordially enough but a little shyly  i thought that you were going to stay at brancaster for a week she remarked as they shook hands  we meant to stay longer granet admitted but things went a little wrong first of all there was this zeppelin raid then my arm didnt go very well altogether our little excursion fizzled out and i came back last night  did you see anything of the raid geraldine inquired eagerly  rather more than i wanted he answered grimly i was motoring along the road at the time and i had to attend a perfect court martial next day with your friend thomson in the chair can you tell me miss conyers he continued watching her closely how it is that a medical major who is inspector of hospitals should be sent down from the war office to hold an inquiry upon that raid  was hugh really there she asked in a puzzled manner  he was and very officially granet replied if it werent that i had conclusive evidence to prove what i was doing there he seemed rather set on getting me into trouble  hugh is always very fair she said a little coldly  you cant solve my puzzle for me then he persisted  what puzzle  why an inspector of hospitals should hold an inquiry upon a zeppelin raid  im afraid i cannot she admitted hugh certainly seems to have become a most mysterious person but then as you know i havent seen quite so much of him lately your change captain granet doesnt seem to have done you much good has your wound been troubling you  he rose abruptly and stood before her  do you care whether my wound is troubling me or not he asked do you care anything at all about me  there was a moments silence  i care very much she confessed  he seemed suddenly a changed person the lines which had certainly appeared in his face during the last few days become more noticeable he leaned towards her eagerly  miss conyers he went on geraldine i want you to careenough for the big things dont interrupt me please listen to what i have to say somehow or other the world has gone amiss with me lately they wont have me back my place has been filled up i cant get any fighting theyve shelved me at the war office they talk about a home adjutancy i cant stick it i have lived amongst the big things too long im sick of waiting about doing nothingsick to death i want to get away theres some work i could do in america you understand  not in the least geraldine told him frankly  its my fault he declared the words all seem to be tumbling out anyhow and i dont know how to put them in the right order cant you see that i love you geraldine i want you to be my wife and i want to get right away as quickly as ever i can why not america why couldnt we be married this week and get away from everybody  she looked at him in sheer amazement amazement tempered just a little with a sort of tremulous uncertainty  but captain granet she exclaimed you cant be serious you couldnt possibly think of leaving england now  why not he protested they wont let me fight again i couldnt stand the miserable routine of home soldiering id like to get away and forget it all  i am sure you are not in earnest she said quietly no englishman could feel like that  he could if he cared for you granet insisted im afraid of everything here afraid that thomson will come back and take you away afraid of all sorts of hideous things happening during the next few months  you mustnt talk like this please she begged you know as well as i do that neither you nor i could turn our backs on england just now and be happy  he opened his lips to speak but stopped short it was obvious that she was deeply in earnest  and as for the other thing you spoke of she continued please wont you do as i beg you and not refer to it again for the present perhaps she added when the war is over we may speak of it but just now everything is so confused i too seem to have lost my bearingsyou know that i am going out to boulogne in a few days with lady headleys hospital dont look so frightened i am not an amateur nurse i can assure you i have all my certificates  to boulogne he muttered you are going to leave london  she nodded  major thomson arranged it for me a few days ago we may meet there at any time she added smiling i am perfectly certain that the war office will find you something abroad very soon  for a moment that queer look of boyish strength which had first attracted her reasserted itself his teeth came together  yes he agreed theres work for me somewhere ill find it only  she checked him hurriedly  and i am quite sure she interrupted that when you are yourself again you will agree with me these are not the times for us to have any selfish thoughts are they  until a few weeks ago he told her i thought of nothing but the war and my work in ituntil you came that is  she held out her hands to check him her eyes were eloquent  please remember she begged that it is too soon i cant bear to have you talk to me like that afterwards  there will be no afterwards for me he exclaimed bitterly  a shade of surprise became mingled with her agitation  you mustnt talk like that she protested you with your splendid courage and opportunities think what you have done already england wants the best of her sons today cant you be content to give that and to wait we have so much gratitude in our hearts we weak women for those who are fighting our battle  her words failed to inspire him he took her hand and lifted her fingers deliberately to his lips  i was foolish he groaned to think that you could feel as i do goodbye  geraldine was alone when her mother came into the room a few minutes later lady conyers was looking a little fluttered and anxious  was that captain granet she asked  geraldine nodded lady conyers anxiety deepened  well  i have sent him away geraldine said quietly until the end of the war  granet brought his car to a standstill outside the portals of that very august club in pall mall the hallporter took in his name and a few minutes his uncle joined him in the strangers room  back again so soon ronnie  granet nodded  americas off he announced shortly i thought id better let you know it must be the whole thing now  sir alfred was silent for a moment  very well he said at last only remember this my boythere must be no more risks youve been sailing quite close enough to the wind  did you call at the war office granet asked quickly  his uncle assented  i did and i saw general brice he admitted in confidence that they werent very keen about your rejoining nothing personal he went on quickly nothing serious that is to say there is a sort of impression out there that youve brought them bad luck  granet shrugged his shoulders  well he said they know their own business best what i am afraid of is being saddled with some rotten home duty  you need not be afraid of that any more ronnie his uncle told him calmly  granet turned quickly around  do you mean that they dont want to give me anything at all he demanded anxiously  sir alfred shook his head  you are too impetuous ronnie theyre willing enough to give you a home command but i have asked that it should be left over for a little time so as to leave you free  you have something in your mind thensomething definite  sir alfred looked out of the window for a moment then he laid his hand upon his nephews shoulder  i think i can promise you ronnie he said seriously that before many days have passed you shall have all the occupation you want    chapter xxvi  surgeonmajor thomson reeled for a moment and caught at the paling by his side then he recovered himself almost as quickly and leaning forward gazed eagerly at the long grey racingcar which was already passing buckingham palace and almost out of sight in the slight morning fog there was a very small cloud of white smoke drifting away into space and a faint smell of gunpowder in the air he felt his cheek and withdrawing his fingers gazed at them with a little nervous laughthey were wet with blood  he looked up and down the broad pathway for nine oclock in the morning the birdcage walk was marvellously deserted a girl however who had been driving a small car very slowly on the other side of the road suddenly swung across drew up by the kerb and leaned towards him  hughmajor thomson what is the matter with you  he dabbed his cheek with his pocket handkerchief  nothing he answered simply  dont be silly she exclaimed i felt certain that i heard a shot just now and i saw you reel and spin round for a moment and your cheek tooits all over blood  he smiled  a bullet did come my way and just graze my cheek he admitted most extraordinary thing i wonder whether one of those fellows in the park had an accident with his rifle  he glanced thoughtfully across towards where a number of khakiclad figures were dimly visible behind the railings geraldine looked at him severely  of course she began if you really think that i dont know the difference between the report of a pistol and a rifle shot  he interrupted her  i was wrong he confessed forgive me you see my head was a little turned some one did deliberately fire at me and i believe it was from a grey racingcar i couldnt see who was driving it and it was out of sight almost at once  but i never heard of such a thing she exclaimed why on earth should they fire at you you havent any enemies have you  not that i know of he assured her  she stepped from the car and came lightly over to his side  take your handkerchief away she ordered dont be foolish you forget that i am a certificated nurse  he raised his handkerchief and she looked for a moment at the long scar her face grew serious  another halfinch she murmuredhugh what an abominable thing a deliberate attempt at murder here at nine oclock in the morning in the park i cant understand it  well ive been under fire before he remarked smiling  get into my car at once she directed ill drive you to a chemists and put something on that you cant go about as you are and it will have healed up then in a day or two  he obeyed at once and she drove off  of course im a little bewildered about it still she went on i suppose you ought to go to the policestation it was really a deliberate attempt at assassination wasnt it if you had been  she paused and he completed her sentence with a humorous twinkle in his eyes  if i had been a person of importance eh well you see even i must have been in somebodys way  she drove in silence for some little distance  hugh she asked abruptly why did the war office send you down to market burnham after that zeppelin raid  his face was suddenly immovable he turned his head very slightly  did granet tell you that  she nodded  captain granet came to see me yesterday afternoon he seemed as much surprised as i was you were a little hard on him werent you  i think not  but why were you sent down she persisted i cant imagine what you have to do with a zeppelin raid  he shrugged his shoulders  i really dont think it is worth while your bothering about the bandage he said  hugh you make me so angry she exclaimed of course you may say that i havent the right to ask but still i cant see why you should be so mysterious heres the chemists now come inside with me please  he followed her obediently into the shop at the top of trafalgar square she dressed his wound deftly and adjusted a bandage around his head  if you keep that on all day she said i thinkbut i forgot i was treating you like an ordinary patient dont laugh at me sir i am sure none of your professional nurses could have tied that up any better  of course they couldnt he agreed bythebye have you obtained your papers for boulogne yet  i expect to be going next week lady headley promised to let me know this afternoon now ill take you down to the war office if you like  he took his place once more by her side  hugh she inquired have you any idea who fired that shot  none whatever he replied no definite idea that is to say it was some one who as driving a low grey car do we know any one who possesses such a thing  she frowned the exigencies of the traffic prevented her glancing towards him  only captain granet she remarked and i suppose even your dislike of him doesnt go so far as to suggest that he is likely to play the wouldbe murderer in broad daylight  it certainly does seem a rather rash and unnecessary proceeding he assented but the fact remains that some one thought it worth while  some one with a grudge against the chief inspector of hospitals she observed drily  he did not reply they drew up outside the war office  thank you very much he said for playing the good samaritan  she made a little grimace suddenly her manner became more earnest she laid her fingers upon his arm as he stood on the pavement by her side  hugh she said before you go let me tell you something i think that the real reason why i lost some of my affection for you was because you persisted in treating me without any confidence at all the little things which may have happened to you abroad the little details of your life the harmless side of your professionthere were so many things i should have been interested in and you told me nothing there were things which seemed to demand an explanation with regard to your position you ignored them you seemed to enjoy moving in a mysterious atmosphere its worse than ever now i am intelligent am i nottrustworthy  you are both he admitted gravely thank you very much for telling me this geraldine  you still have nothing to say to me she asked looking him in the face  nothing he replied  she nodded slipped in her clutch and drove off surgeonmajor thomson entered the war office and made his way up many stairs and along many wide corridors to a large room on the top floor of the building two men were seated at desks writing he passed them by with a little greeting and entered an inner apartment a pile of letters stood upon his desk he examined them one by one destroyed some made pencil remarks upon others presently there was a tap at the door and ambrose entered  chiefs compliments and he would be glad if you would step round to his room at once sir he announced  thomson locked his desk made his way to the further end of the building and was admitted through a door by which a sentry was standing to an anteroom in which a dozen people were waiting his guide passed him through to an inner apartment where a man was seated alone he glanced up at thomsons entrance  good morning thomson he said brusquely sit down please leave the room dawkes and close the door thanks thomson what about this request of yours  i felt bound to bring the matter before you sir thomson replied i made my application to the censor and you know the result  the chief swung round in his chair  look here he said the censors department has instructions to afford you every possible assistance in any researches you make there are just twentyfour names in the united kingdom which have been admitted to the privileges of free correspondence the censor has no right to touch any letters addressed to them sir alfred anselman is upon that list  thomson nodded gravely  so i have been given to understand he remarked  the chief leaned back in his chair his cold grey eyes were studying the others face  thomson he continued i know that you are not a sensationalist at the same time this request of yours is a little nerveshattering isnt it sir alfred anselman has been the chancellors righthand man it was mainly owing to his efforts that the war loan was such a success he has done more for us in the city than any other englishman he has given large sums to the various war funds his nephew is a very distinguished young officer now there suddenly comes a request from you to have the censor pass you copies of all his dutch correspondence thered be the very devil to pay if i consented  thomson cleared his throat for a moment  sir he said you and i have discussed this matter indirectly more than once you are not yet of my opinion but you will be the halfpenny press has sickened us so with the subject of spies that the man who groans about espionage today is avoided like a pestilence yet it is my impression that there is in london undetected and unsuspected a marvellous system of german espionage a company of men who have sold themselves to the enemy whose names we should have considered above reproach it is my job to sift this matter to the bottom i can only do so if you will give me supreme power over the censorship  look here thomson the chief demanded you dont suspect sir alfred anselman  i do sir  the chief was obviously dumbfounded he sat for a few moments thinking  youre a sane man too thomson he muttered but its the most astounding charge ive ever heard  its the most astounding conspiracy thomson replied i was in germany a few weeks ago as you know  i heard all about it a very brilliant but a very dangerous exploit that of yours thomson  i will tell you my impressions sir the latter continued the ignorance displayed in the german newspapers about england is entirely a matter of censorship their actual information as regards every detail of our military condition is simply amazing they know exactly what munitions are reaching our shores from abroad they know how we are paying for them they know exactly our financial condition they know all about our new guns they know just how many men we could send over to france tomorrow and how many we could get through in three months time they know the private views of every one of the cabinet ministers they knew in berlin yesterday what took place at the cabinet council the day before you must realise yourself that some of this is true how does the information get through  there are spies of course the chief admitted  the ordinary spy could make no such reports as the germans are getting hour by hour if i am to make a success of my job i want the letters of sir alfred anselman  the chief considered for several moments then he wrote a few lines on a sheet of paper  therell be the perfect devil to pay he said simply we shall have cabinet ministers running about the place like black beetles whats the matter with your head  i was shot at in the park thomson explained a man had a flying go at me from a motorcar  was he caught  thomson shook his head  i didnt try he replied i want him at liberty his time will come when i break up this conspiracy if i do it at all  the chief looked a little aggrieved  no ones even let off a popgun at me he grumbled they must think youre the more dangerous of the two thomson youd better do what you can with that order as soon as possible no telling how soon i may have to rescind it  thomson took the hint and departed he walked quickly back to his room thrust the order he had received into an envelope and sent it round to the censors department    chapter xxvii  mr gordon jones who had moved his chair a little closer to his hosts side looked reflectively around the diningroom as he sipped his port the butler remained on sufferance because of his grey hairs but the footmen who had been rather a feature of the anselman establishment had departed and their places had been filled by half a dozen of the smartest of parlourmaids one or two of whom were still in evidence  yours is certainly one of the most patriotic households sir alfred which i have entered he declared tell me again how many servants have you sent to the war  sir alfred smiled with the air of one a little proud of his record  four footmen and two chauffeurs from here eleven gardeners and three indoor servants from the country he replied that is to say nothing about the farms where i have left matters in the hands of my agents i am paying the full wages to every one of them  and thank heavens youll still have to pay us a little supertax the cabinet minister remarked smiling  sir alfred found nothing to dismay him in the prospect  you shall have every penny of it my friend he promised i have taken a quarter of a million of your war loan and i shall take the same amount of your next one i spend all my time upon your committees my own affairs scarcely interest me and yet i thought today when my car was stopped to let a company of the london regiment march down to charingcross that there wasnt one of those khakiclad young men who wasnt offering more than i  the bishop leaned forward from his place  those are noteworthy words of yours sir alfred he said there is nothing in the whole world so utterly ineffective as our own passionate gratitude must seem to ourselves when we think of all those young fellowsnot soldiers you know but young men of peace fond of their pleasures their games their sweethearts their workthrowing it all on one side passing into another life passing into the valley of shadows i too have seen those young men sir alfred  the conversation became general the host of this little dinnerparty leaned back in his place for a moment engrossed in thought it was a very distinguished if not a large company there were three cabinet ministers a high official in the war office a bishop a soldier of royal blood back for a few days from the front and his own nephewgranet he sat and looked round at them and a queer little smile played upon his lips if only the truth were known the world had never seen a stranger gathering it was a company which the king himself might have been proud to gather around him serious representative englishmenenglishmen too of great position there was not one of them who had not readily accepted his invitation there was not one of them who was not proud to sit at his table there was not one of them who did not look upon him as one of the props of the empire  there was a little rustle as one of the new parlourmaids walked smoothly to his side and presented a silver salver he took the single letter from her glanced at it for a moment carelessly and then felt as though the fingers which held it had been pierced by redhot wires the brilliant little company seemed suddenly to dissolve before his eyes he saw nothing but the marking upon that letter growing larger and larger as he gazed the veritable writing of fate pressed upon the envelope by a rubber stampby the hand perchance of a clerkopened by censor  there was a momentary singing in his ears he looked at his glass found it full raised it to his lips and drained it the ghastly moment of suspended animation passed he felt no longer that he was in a room from which all the air had been drawn he was himself again but the letter was there mr gordon jones who had been talking to the bishop leaned towards him and pointed to the envelope  is that yours sir alfred he asked  sir alfred nodded  becoming a little more stringent i see he observed holding it up  i thought i recognised the mark the other replied a most outrageous mistake i am very glad that it came under my notice you are absolutely free from the censor sir alfred  i thought so myself sir alfred remarked however i suppose an occasional mistake can scarcely be wondered at dont worry them about it please my dutch letters are simply records of the balances at my different banks mere financial details  all the same mr gordon jones insisted there has been gross neglect somewhere i will see that it is inquired into tomorrow morning  very kind of you sir alfred declared as you know i have been able to give you fragments of information now and then which would cease at once of course if my correspondence as a whole were subject to censorship an occasional mistake like this is nothing  there was another interruption this time a message had come from the houseministers would be required within the next twenty minutes the little partyit was a mens dinnerparty onlybroke up very soon sir alfred and his nephew were left alone sir alfreds fingers shook for a moment as he tore open the seal of his letter he glanced through the few lines it contained and breathed a sigh of relief  come this way ronnie he invited  they left the diningroom and eschewing the inviting luxuries of the billiard room and library passed into a small room behind plainly furnished as a business mans study granet seized his uncle by the arm  its coded i suppose  sir alfred nodded  its coded ronnie and between you and me i dont believe theyll be able to read it but whose doing is that he added pointing with his finger to the envelope  it must have been a mistake granet muttered  sir alfred glanced toward the closed door without a doubt they were alone  i dont know he said mistakes of this sort dont often occur as i looked around tonight ronnie i thoughti couldnt help thinking that our position was somewhat wonderful does it mean that this is the first breath of suspicion i wonder was it really only my fancy or did i hear tonight the first mutterings of the storm  no one can possibly suspect granet declared no one who could have influence enough to override your immunity from censorship it must have been an accident  i wonder sir alfred muttered  cant you decode it granet asked eagerly there may be news  sir alfred reentered the larger library and was absent for several minutes when he returned the message was written out in lead pencil  leave london june 4th have flares midnight buckingham palace st pauls steps gardens in front of savoy your last report received  granet glanced eagerly back at the original message it consisted of a few perfectly harmless sentences concerning various rates of exchange he gave it to his uncle with a smile  i shouldnt worry about that sir he advised  it isnt the thing itself i worry about sir alfred said thoughtfullytheyll never decode that message its the something that lies behind it its the pointing finger ronnie i thought wed last it out at any rate things look different now youre serious i suppose you dont want to go to america  i dont granet replied grimly thats all finished for the present you know very well what it is i do want  sir alfred frowned  there are plenty of wild enterprises afoot he admitted but i dont know after all that i wish you particularly to be mixed up in them  i cant hang about here much longer his nephew grumbled i get the fever in my blood to be doing something i had a try this morning  his uncle looked at him for a moment  this morning he repeated well  granet thrust his hands into his trousers pockets there was a frown upon his fine forehead  its that man i told you about he said bitterlythe man i hate hes nobody of any account but he always seems to be mixed up in any little trouble i find myself in i got out of that affair down at market burnham without the least trouble and then as you know the war office sent him down of all the people on earth to hold an inquiry sometimes i think that he suspects me i met him at a critical moment on the battlefield near niemen i always believed that he heard me speaking germanit was just after i had come back across the lines the other daywell i told you about that isabel worth saved me or i dont know where i should have been i think i shall kill that man  what did you say his name was sir alfred asked with sudden eagerness  thomson  there was a moments silence sir alfreds expression was curiously tense he leaned across the table towards his nephew  thomson he repeated my god i knew there was something i meant to tell you dont you know ronniebut of course you dont youre sure its thomsonsurgeonmajor thomson  thats the man  he is the man with the new post sir alfred declared hoarsely he is the head of the whole military intelligence department theyve set him up at the war office theyve practically given him unlimited powers  why i thought he was inspector of field hospitals granet gasped  a blind his uncle groaned he is nothing of the sort hes kitcheners own man and this he added looking at the letter must be his work    chapter xxviii  surgeonmajor thomson looked up almost eagerly as ambrose entered his room the next morning the young mans manner was dejected and there were black lines under his eyes he answered his chiefs unspoken question by a little shake of the head  no luck sir he announced i spent the whole of last night at it toonever went to bed at all ive tried it with thirtyone codes then ive taken the first line or two and tried every possible change  i couldnt make anything of it myself thomson confessed looking at the sheet of paper which even at that moment was spread out before him all the same ambrose i dont believe in it  neither do i sir the other assented eagerly i am going to have another try this afternoon perhaps therell be some more letters in then and we can tell whether theres any similarity  thomson frowned  ive a sort of feeling ambrose he said that we shant have many of these letters  why not sir  i heard by telephone just before you came thomson announced that a certain very distinguished person was on his way to see me cabinet ministers dont come here for nothing and this one happens to be a friend of sir alfreds  ambrose sighed  more interference sir he groaned i dont see how they can expect us to run our department with the civilians butting in wherever they like they want us to save the country and theyre to have the credit for it  there was a knock at the door a boy scout entered his eyes were a little protuberant his manner betokened awe  mr gordon jones sir  mr gordon jones entered without waiting for any further announcement thomson rose to his feet and received a genial handshake after which the newcomer glanced at ambrose thomson signed to his assistant to leave the room  major thomson the cabinet minister began impressively as he settled down in his chair i have come here to confer with you to throw myself to a certain extent upon your understanding and your common sense he added speaking with the pleased air of a man sure of his ground and himself  you have come to protest i suppose thomson said slowly against our having  to protest against nothing my dear sir the other interrupted simply to explain to you as i have just explained to your chief that while we possess every sympathy with and desire to give every latitude in the world to the military point of view there are just one or two very small matters in which we must claim to have a voice we have as you know a free censorship list we have put no one upon it who is not far and away above all suspicion i am given to understand that a letter addressed to sir alfred anselman was opened yesterday i went to see your chief about it this morning he has referred me to you  the letter thomson remarked was opened by my orders  i happened mr gordon jones went on to be dining at sir alfreds house when the letter was presented sir alfred i must say took it exceedingly well at the same time i have made it my business to see that this does not occur again  thomson made no sign his eyebrows however rose a little higher  the country his visitor continued will know some day what it owes to sir alfred anselman at present i can only express and that poorly my sense of personal obligation to him he has been of the greatest assistance to the government in the city and elsewhere his contributions to our funds have been magnificent his advice his sympathy invaluable he is a man inspired by the highest patriotic sentiments one of the first and most noteworthy of british citizens  thomson listened in silence and without interruption he met the wellsatisfied peroration of his visitor without comment  i am hoping to hear the latter concluded with some slight asperity in his manner that the circumstance to which i have alluded was accidental and will not be repeated  major thomson glanced thoughtfully at a little pile of documents by his side then he looked coldly towards his visitor and provided him perhaps with one of the most complete surprises of his life  i am sorry mr gordon jones he said but this is not a matter which i can discuss with you  the cabinet ministers face was a study  not discuss it he repeated blankly  major thomson shook his head  certain responsibilities he continued quietly with regard to the safe conduct of this country have been handed over to the military authorities which in this particular case i represent we are in no position for amenities or courtesies our country is in the gravest danger and nothing else is of the slightest possible significance the charge which we have accepted we shall carry out with regard to one thing only and that is our idea of what is due to the public safety  you mean in plain words mr gordon jones exclaimed that no requests from me or say for instance the prime minister would have any weight with you  none whatever major thomson replied coolly without wishing to be in any way personal i might say that there are statesmen in your government for whom you must accept a certain amount of responsibility who have been largely instrumental in bringing this hideous danger upon the country as a company of lawmakers you may or may not be excellent peoplethat is i suppose according to ones political opinions as a company of men competent to superintend the direction of a country at war you must permit me to say that i consider you have done well in placing certain matters in our hands and that you will do better still not to interfere  mr gordon jones sat quite still for several moments  major thomson he said at last i have never heard of your before and i am not prepared for a moment to say that i sympathise with your point of view but it is at least refreshing to hear any one speak his mind with such frankness i must now ask you one question whether you choose to answer it or not the letter which you have opened addressed to sir alfredyou couldnt possibly find any fault with it  it was apparently a quite harmless production major thomson confessed  do you propose to open any more  thomson shook his head  that is within our discretion sir  mr gordon jones struggled with his obvious annoyance  look here he said with an attempt at goodhumour you can at least abandon the official attitude for a moment with me tell me why of all men in the world you have chosen to suspect sir alfred anselman  i am sorry thomson replied stiffly but this is not a matter which i can discuss in any other way except officially and i do not recognise you as having any special claims for information  the minister rose to his feet those few minutes marked to him an era in his official life  you are adopting an attitude sir he said which however much i may admire it from one point of view seems to me scarcely to take into account the facts of the situation  thomson made no reply he had risen to his feet his manner clearly indicated that he considered the interview at an end mr gordon jones choked down his displeasure  when you are wanting a civil job major thomson he concluded come and give us a call good morning    chapter xxix  a lady to see you sir jarvis announced discreetly  granet turned quickly around in his chair almost instinctively he pulled down the roll top of the desk before which he was seated then he rose to his feet and held out his hand he managed with an effort to conceal the consternation which had succeeded his first impulse of surprise  miss worth he exclaimed  she came towards him confidently her hands outstretched slim dressed in sober black her cheeks as pale as ever her eyes a little more brilliant she threw her muff into a chair and a moment afterwards sank into it herself  you have been expecting me she asked eagerly  granet was a little taken aback  i have been hoping to hear from you he said you told me if you remember not to write  it was better not she assented even after you left i had a great deal of trouble that odious man major thomson put me through a regular crossexamination again and i had to tell him at last  what granet exclaimed anxiously  that we were engaged to be married she confessed there was really no other way out of it  that we were engaged granet repeated blankly  she nodded  he pressed me very hard she went on and i am afraid i made some admissionswell there were necessarywhich to say the least of it were compromising there was only one way out of it decently for me and i took it you dont mind  of course not he replied  there was father to be considered she went on he was furious at first  you told your father he interrupted  i had to she explained smoothing her muff he was there all the time that thomson man was crossexamining me  then your father believes in our engagement too  he does she answered drily or i am afraid you would have heard a little more from major thomson before now ever since that night father has been quite impossible to live with he says he has to being a part of his work all over again  the bombs really did do some damage then he asked  she nodded looking at him for a moment curiously  yes she acknowledged they did more harm than any one knows the place is like a fortress now they say that if they can find the other man who helped to light that flare he will be shot in five minutes  granet who had been standing with his elbow upon the mantelpiece leaned over and took a cigarette from a box  then for his sake let us hope that they do not find him he remarked  and ours she said softly  granet stood and looked at her steadfastly the match burning in his fingers then he threw it away and lit another the interval had been full of unadmitted tension which suddenly passed  shall you think i am horribly greedy she asked if i say that i should like something to eat i am dying of hunger  granet for a moment was startled then he moved towards the bell  how absurd of me he exclaimed of course you have just come up havent you  i have come straight from the station here she replied  he paused  where are you staying then  she shook her head  i dont know yet she admitted  you dont know he repeated  she met his gaze without flinching there was a little spot of colour in her cheeks however and her lips quivered  you see she explained things became absolutely impossible for me at market burnham i wont say that they disbelieved menot my father at any ratebut he seems to think that it was somehow my faultthat if you hadnt been there that night the thing wouldnt have happened i am watched the whole of the time in fact not a soul has said a civil word to mesince you left i just couldnt stand it any longer i packed up this morning and i came away without saying a word to any one  granet glanced at the clock it was a quarter past ten  well the first thing to do is to get you something to eat he said ringing the bell do you mind having something here or would you like to go to a restaurant  i should much prefer having it here she declared i am not fit to go anywhere and i am tired  he rang the bell and gave jarvis a few orders the girl stood up before the glass took off her hat and smoothed her hair with her hands she had the air of being absolutely at home  did you come up without any luggage at all he asked  she shook her head  i have a dressingbag and a few things downstairs on a taxicab she said i told the man to stop his engine and wait for a timeuntil i had seen you she added turning around  there was a very slight smile upon her lips the glimmer of something that was almost appealing in her eyes granet took her hand and patted it kindly her response was almost hysterical  its very sweet of you to trust me like this he said jarvis will bring you something to eat then ill take you round to your aunts where is it she livessomewhere in kensington isnt it tomorrow we must talk things over  she threw herself back once more in the easychair and glanced around her  i should like she decided to talk them over now  he glanced towards the door  just as you please he said only jarvis will be in with your sandwiches directly  she brushed aside his protest  i was obliged she continued to say that i was engaged to you to save you from somethingi dont know what the more i have thought about it the more terrible it has all seemed i am not going to even ask you for any explanation ii darent  granet looked at his cigarette for a moment thoughtfully then he threw it into the fire  perhaps you are wise he said coolly all the same when the time comes there is an explanation  it is the present which has become such a problem she went on i was driven to leave home and i dont think i can go back again father is simply furious with me and every one about the place seems to have an idea that i am somehow to blame for what happened the other night  that seems to me a little unjust he protested  it isnt unjust at all she replied brusquely ive told them all lies and ive got to pay for them i came to youwell there really wasnt anything else left for me to do was there i hope you dont think that i am horribly forward i am quite willing to admit that i like you that i liked you from the first moment we met at lady anselmans luncheon at the same time if that awful night hadnt changed everything i should have behaved just like any other stupidly and properly broughtup young womanwaited and hoped and made an idiot of myself whenever you were around and in the end i suppose been disappointed you see fate has rather changed that i had to invent our engagement to save youand here i am she added with a little nervous laugh turning her head as the door opened  jarvis entered with the sandwiches and arranged them on a small table by her side granet poured out the wine for her mixed himself a whiskeyandsoda and took a sandwich also from the plate  now tell me he began as soon as jarvis had disappeared what is there at the back of your mind about my presence there at market burnham that night  she laid down her sandwich for the first time her voice trembled granet realised that beneath all this quietness of demeanour a volcano was threatening  i have told you that i do not want to think of that night she said firmly i simply do not understand  you have something in your mind he persisted you dont believe really that that man collins who was found shot  she glanced at the door  i couldnt sleep that night she interrupted i heard your car arrive i saw you both together you and the man who was shot i sawmore than that i hadnt meant to tell you this but perhaps it is best i ask you for no explanation you see i am something of an individualist i just want one thing and about the rest i simply dont care to me to myself to my own future to my own happiness the rest is very slight and i never pretend to be anything else but a very selfish person only you know now that i have lied badly  i understand he said finish your sandwiches and i will take you to your aunts tomorrow i will write to your father  she drew a little sigh  i will do whatever you say she agreed onlyplease look at me  he stooped down a little she seized his wrists her voice was suddenly hoarse  you werent pretending altogether she pleaded dont make me feel a perfect beast you did care a little you werent just talking nonsense  she would have drawn him further down but he kept away  listen he said when i tell you that i am going to write to your father tomorrow you know what that means for the rest i must think perhaps this is the only way out of course i like you but the truth is best isnt it i hadnt any idea of this as a matter of fact i am rather in love with someone else  she caught at her breath for a moment half closed her eyes as thought to shut out something disagreeable  i dont care she muttered you see how low i have fallenill bear even that come she added springing up my aunt goes to bed before eleven you can drive me down there if you like are you going to kiss me  he bent over her a little gravely and his lips touched her forehead she caught his face suddenly between her hands and kissed him on the lips then she turned towards the door  of course i am horribly ashamed she exclaimed but thenwell im myself come along please  he followed her down into the taxi and they drove off towards kensington  how long have you known the other girl she asked abruptly  very little longer than i have known you he answered  she took off her glove he felt her hand steal into his  youll try and like me a little please she begged there hasnt been any one who cared for so many yearsnot all my life when i came outever since i came outi have behaved just like other properly wellbroughtup girls ive just sat and waited ive rather avoided men than otherwise ive sat and waited girls havent liked me much they say im odd im twentyeight now you know i havent enjoyed the last six years fathers wrapped up in his work he thinks he has done his duty if he sends me to london sometimes to stay with my aunt she is very much like him only she is wrapped up in missions instead of science neither of them seems to have time to be human  it must have been rotten for you granet said kindly  her hand clutched his she came a little nearer  year after year of it she murmured if i had been goodlooking i should have run away and gone on the stage if i had been clever i should have left home and done something but i am like millions of othersi am neither i had to sit and wait when i met you i suddenly began to realise what it would be like to care for some one i knew it wasnt any use and then this miracle happened i couldnt help it she went on doggedly i never thought of it at first it came to me like a great flash that the only way to save you  to save me from what he asked  from being shot as a spy she answered quickly there im not a fool you know you may think im a fool about you but i am not about things in general goodbye this is my aunts dont come in ring me up tomorrow morning ill meet you anywhere goodbye please i want to run away  he watched her go a little dazed a trim parlourmaid came out and after a few words of explanation superintended the disposal of her luggage in the hall then the taxicab man returned  back to sackville street granet muttered    chapter xxx  granet on his return to sackville street paid the taxicab driver ascended the stairs and let himself into his rooms with very much the air of a man who has passed through a dream a single glance around however brought him vivid realisations of his unwelcome visitor the little plate of sandwiches half finished the partly emptied bottle of wine were still there one of her gloves lay in the corner of the easychair he picked it up drew it for a moment through his fingers then crushed it into a ball and flung it into the fire jarvis who had heard him enter came from one of the back rooms  clear these things away jarvis his master ordered leave the whiskey and soda and tobacco on the table i may be late  jarvis silently obeyed as soon as he was alone granet threw himself into the easychair he was filled with a bitter sense of being entrapped he had been a little rash at market burnham perhaps but if any other man except thomson had been sent there his explanations would have been accepted without a word and all this miserable complication would have been avoided he thought over isabels coming all that she had said she had left him no loophole she had the air of a young woman who knew her own mind excellently well a single word from her to thomson and the whole superstructure of his ingeniously builtup life might tumble to pieces he sat with folded arms in a grim attitude of unrest thinking bitter thoughts they rolled into his brain like black shadows he had been honest in the first instance with ancestors from both countries he had deliberately chosen the country to which he felt the greatest attachment he remembered his long travels in germany he remembered on his return his growing disapproval of english slackness her physical and moral decadence her faults had inspired him not with the sorrow of one of her real sons but with the contempt of one only half bound to her by natural ties the ground had been laid ready for the poison he had started honestly enough his philosophy had satisfied himself he had felt no moral degradation in wearing the uniform of one country for the benefit of another all this selfdisgust he dated from the coming of geraldine conyers now he was weary of it all face to face too with a disagreeable and insistent problem  he started suddenly in his chair an interruption ordinary enough but never without a certain startling effect had broken in upon his thoughts the telephone on his table was ringing insistently he rose to his feet and glanced at the clock as he crossed the room it was five minutes past twelve as he took up the receiver a familiar voice greeted him  is that ronnie yes this is lady anselman your uncle told me to ring you up to see if you were in he wants you to come round  what tonight  do come ronnie his aunt continued i dont suppose its anything important but your uncle seems to want it no i shant see you im just going to bed i have been playing bridge im sure the duchess cheatsi have never won at her house in my life ill tell your uncle youll come then ronnie good night  granet laid down the receiver somehow or other the idea of action even at that hour of the night was a relief to him he called to jarvis and gave him a few orders afterwards he turned out and walked through the streetscuriously lit and busy it seemed to himto the corner of park lane and up to the great mansion fronting the park which had belonged to the anselmans for two generations there were few lights in the windows he was admitted at once and passed on to his uncles own servant  sir alfred is in the study sir the latter announced if you will kindly come this way  granet crossed the circular hall hung with wonderful tapestry and passed through the sumptuouslyfurnished library into the smaller business mans study in which sir alfred spent much of his time there were telephones upon his desk a tape machine and a private instrument connected with the telegraph department there was a desk for his secretary now vacant and beyond in the shadows of the apartment winged bookcases which held a collection of editions de luxe first editions and a great collection of german and russian literature admittedly unique sir alfred was sitting at his desk writing a letter he greeted his nephew with his usual cheerful nod  wait before you go harrison he said to his valet will you take anything ronald there are cigars and cigarettes here but nothing to drink harrison you can put the whiskey and soda on the side anyhow then you can wait for me in my room i shall not require any other service tonight some one must stay to let captain granet out you understand  perfectly sir the man replied  if you dont mind ronnie i will finish this letter while he brings the whiskey and soda sir alfred said  captain granet strolled around the room there was no sound for a moment but the scratching of sir alfreds quill pen across the paper presently harrison returned with the whiskey and soda sir alfred handed him a note  to be sent tonight harrison he directed no answer  the man withdrew closing the door behind him sir alfred with his hands in his pockets walked slowly around when he came back he turned out all the lights except the heavily shaded one over his desk and motioned his nephew to draw his easychair up to the side  well ronnie he said i suppose you are wondering why i have sent for you at this hour of the night  i am granet admitted frankly is there any newsanything behind the news perhaps i should say  what there is is of no account sir alfred replied we are going to talk pure human nature you and i for the next hour the fate of empires is a matter for the historians it is your fate and mine which just now counts for most  there is some trouble granet asked quicklysome suspicion  none whatever sir alfred repeated firmly my position was never more secure than it is at this second i am the trusted confidant of the cabinet i have done not only apparently but actually very important work for them financially too my influence as well as my resources have been of vast assistance to this country  granet nodded and waited he knew enough of his uncle to be aware that he would develop his statement in his own way  when all has gone well sir alfred continued when all seems absolutely peaceful and safe it is sometimes the time to pause and consider we are at that spot at the present moment you have been lucky in your way ronnie three times whilst fighting for england you have managed to penetrate the german lines and receive from them communications of the greatest importance since your return home you have been of use in various ways this last business in norfolk will not be forgotten then take my case what germany knows of our financial position our strength and our weakness is due to me that germany is at the present time holding forty millions of money belonging to the city of london is also owing to me in a dozen other ways my influence has been felt as i told you before we have both in our way been successful but we have reached the absolute limit of our effectiveness  what does that mean granet asked  it means this sir alfred explained when this war was started i with every fact and circumstance before me with more information perhaps than any other man breathing predicted peace within three months i was wrong germany today is great and unconquered but germany has lost her opportunity this may be a war of attrition or even now the unexpected may come but to all effects and purposes germany is beaten  do you mean this granet exclaimed incredulously  absolutely his uncle assured him remember that i know more than you do there is a new and imminent danger facing the dual alliance what it is you will learn soon enough the war may drag on for many months but the chances of the great german triumph we have dreamed of have passed they know it as well as we do i have seen the writing on the wall for months today i have concluded all my arrangements i have broken off all negotiations with berlin they recognise the authority and they absolve me they know that it will be well to have a friend here when the time comes for drawing up the pact  granet gripped the sides of his chair with his hand it seemed to him impossible that with these few commonplace words the fate of all europe was being pronounced  do you mean that germany will be crushed he demanded  sir alfred shook his head  i still believe that impossible he said but the peace of exhaustion will come and come surely before many months have passed it is time for us to think of ourselves so far as i am concerned well there is that one censored letternothing in itself yet damning if the code should be discovered as for you well you are safe from anything transpiring in france and although you seem to have been rather unlucky there you appear to be safe as regards norfolk you must make up your mind now to follow my lead take a home command do the rest of your soldiering quietly and shout with the others when the day of peace comes these last few months must be our great secret at heart we may have longed to call ourselves sons of a mightier nation but fate is against us we must continue englishmen  youve taken my breath away granet declared let me realise this for a moment  he sat quite still a rush of thoughts had crowded into his brain first and foremost was the thought of geraldine if he could cover up his traces if it were true that he was set free now from his pledges then he remembered his visitor of the evening and his heart sank  look here he confessed in a way this is a huge relief i like you thought it was to last for three months and i thought i could stick it while the excitement of the thing was about it was easy enough but listen uncle that norfolk affairi am not really out of that  what do you mean sir alfred demanded anxiously this fellow thomson  thomson of course granet assented but the real trouble has come to me in a different way i told you that the girl got me out of it she couldnt stand the second crossexamination she was driven into a corner and finally to clear herself said that we were engaged to be married she has come up to london came to me tonight she expects me to marry her  how much does she know sir alfred asked  everything granet groaned it was she who had told me of the waterway across the marshes she saw me there with collins just before the flare was lit she knew that i lied to them when they found me  sir alfred sighed  its a big price ronnie he said but youll have to pay it the sooner you marry the girl and close her mouth the better  if it hadnt been for that damned fellow thomson granet muttered there would never have been a suspicion  if it hadnt been for the same very enterprising gentleman sir alfred observed my correspondence would never have been tampered with  granet leaned a little forward  thomson is our one remaining danger he said i have had the feeling since first he half recognised me we met you know in belgium it was just when i was coming out of the german lines somehow or other he must have been on my track ever since i took no notice of it i thought it was simply becausebecause he was engaged to geraldine conyers  you are rivals in love too eh sir alfred remarked  geraldine conyers is the girl i want to marry granet admitted  thomson sir alfred murmured to himselfsurgeonmajor hugh thomson he seems to be the only man ronnie from whom we have the least danger to fear personally i think i am secure i do not believe that that single letter will be ever deciphered and if it is threeparts of the cabinet are my friends i could ruin the stock exchange tomorrow bring londons credit for a time at any rate below the credit of belgrade  all the same it seems to me granet declared grimly that we should both be more comfortable if there were no surgeonmajor thomson  the very last dispatches i had to deal with sir alfred continued made allusion to him they dont love some of his work in berlin i can tell you what sort of a man is he ronnie can he be bought a hundred thousand pounds would be a fortune to a man like that  there is only one way of dealing with him granet said fiercely i have tried it once i expect ill have to try again  sir alfred leaned across the table  dont be rash ronnie he advised and yet remember this the man is a real danger both to you and to me he is the only man who has had anything to do with the intelligence department here who is worth a snap of the fingers now go home ronnie you came herewell never mind what you were when you came here you are going back an englishman if they wont send you to the front again bother them for some work here and stick to it you will get no reports nor any visitors i have strangled the whole system you and i are cut loose from it we are freelances mind i still believe that in the end german progress and german culture will dominate the world but it may not be in our day it just happens that we have struck a little too soon let us make the best of things ronnie you have many years of life i have some of unabated power let us be thankful that we were wise enough to stop in time  granet rose to his feet his uncle watched him curiously  youre young of course ronnie he continued indulgently you havent yet fitted your burden on to your shoulders properly england or germany you have some of both in you after all it isnt a vital matter under which banner you travel it isnt quite like that with me i have lived here all my life and i wouldnt care to live anywhere else but thats because i carry my own country with me its english air i breathe but its a german heart i still carry with me good night ronnie remember about thomson  the two men wrung hands and granet made his way towards the door  about thomson he repeated to himself as the servant conducted him towards the door    chapter xxxi  ambrose announced a visitor early on the following morning with some show of interest  captain granet to see you sir weve a good many notes about him would you like the book  thomson shook his head  thank you he answered drily i have it in my desk but i think i can remember is he outside now  yes sir he said he wouldnt keep you for more than a few minutes if you could spare him a short interview  any luck last night  ambrose sighed  i was up till three oclock again once i thought i was on the track of it i have come to the conclusion now that its one of those codes that depend upon shifting quantities i shall start again tonight on a different idea shall i show captain granet in sir  thomson assented and a few minutes later granet entered the room he made no attempt to shake hands or to take a seat thomson looked at him coldly  well he asked abruptly what can i do for you  i dont suppose you can do anything granet replied but i am going to spend today and tomorrow too if necessary in this place bothering every one i ever heard of you have some influence i know get me a job out of this country  thomson raised his eyebrows slightly  you want to go abroad again  anywhereanyhow if they wont have me back in france although heaven knows why not can i be sent to the dardanelles or even east africa ill take out territorials if you like ill do anything sooner than be ordered to one of these infernal country towns to train young tradespeople if i dont worry i know i shall get a home appointment directly and i dont want it  thomson studied his visitor for a moment carefully  so you want to be fighting again eh he remarked  i do granet answered firmly  major thomson drew a little locked book towards him unfastened it with a key from his chain and held his hand over the page it was noticeable that his right hand slipped open a few inches the righthand drawer of his desk  you have come to me captain granet he said to ask my aid in getting you a job well if i could give you one where i was perfectly certain that you would be shot in your first skirmish i would give it to you with pleasure under present conditions however it is my impression that the further you are from any british fighting force the better it will be for the safety and welfare of that force  granets face was suddenly rigid he had turned a little paler and his eyes flashed  what do you mean he demanded  thomson had removed his hand and was glancing at the open page  there are a few notes here about you he said i will not read them all but i will give you some extracts there is your full name and parentage tracing out the amount of foreign blood which i find is in your veins there is a verbatim account of a report made to me by your brigadiergeneral in which it seems that in the fighting under his command you were three times apparently taken prisoner three times you apparently escaped the information which you brought back led to at least two disasters the information which exactly at the time you were absent seemed to come miraculously into the hands of the enemy resulted in even greater trouble for us  do you insinuate then that i am a traitor granet asked fiercely  i insinuate nothing thomson replied quietly so far as you and i are concerned we may as well i presume understand one another you are without doubt aware that my post as inspector of hospitals is a blind i am as a matter of fact chief of the intelligence department with a rank which at present i do not choose to use i have been myself to your brigadiergeneral and brought home this report and if it is any satisfaction to you to know it i brought also an urgent request that you should not be allowed to rejoin any part of the force under his control  it was simply rotten luck granet muttered  i come here to a few more notes thomson proceeded i meet you some weeks ago at a luncheon party at the ritz a belgian waiter who i learned by later inquiries was present as a prisoner in the village where you were being entertained as a guest at the german headquarters recognised you and was on the point of making a disclosure the excitement however was too much for him and he fainted he was at once removed under your auspices and died a few days later at one of your uncles country houses before he could make any statement  this is ridiculous granet exclaimed i never saw the fellow before in my life  ridiculous doubtless but a coincidence major thomson replied turning over the next page of his book a little later i find you taking an immense interest in our new destroyers trying in fact to induce young conyers to explain our wire netting system following him down to portsmouth and doing your best to discover also the meaning of a new device attached to his destroyer  that is simply absurd granet protested i was interested in the subject as any military officer would be in an important naval development my journey to portsmouth was simply an act of courtesy to miss conyers and her cousin  i find you next thomson went on immovably visiting the one french statesmen whom we in england had cause to fear in his hotel in london i find that very soon afterwards that statesman is in possession of an autograph letter from the kaiser offering peace to the french people on extraordinary terms who was the intermediary who brought that document captain granet  granets face never twitched he held himself with cold composure  these he declared are fairy tales pailleton was a friend of mine during my visit we did not speak of politics  more coincidences major thomson remarked we pass on then to that night at market burnham hall when a zeppelin was guided to the spot where sir meyville worth was experimenting on behalf of the british government and dropped destructive bombs a man was shot dead by the side of the flare that man was one of your companions at the dormy house club  i neither spoke to him nor saw him there except as a casual visitor granet insisted  that i venture to doubt major thomson replied at any rate there is enough circumstantial evidence against you in this book to warrant my taking the keenest interest in your future as a matter of fact you would have been at the tower or underneath it at this very moment but for the young lady who probably perjured herself to save you now that you know my opinion of you captain granet you will understand that i should hesitate before recommending you to any post whatever in the service of this country  granet made a stealthy movement forward he had been edging a little closer to the desk and he was barely two yards away he suddenly paused thomson had closed the drawer now and he was holding a small revolver very steadily in his right hand  granet he said that sort of thing wont do you know now what i think of you besides these little incidents which i have related you are suspected of having in the disguise of an american clergyman delivered a message from the german government to an english cabinet minister and to come to more personal matters i myself suspect you of having made two attempts on my life it is my firm belief that you are nothing more nor less than a common and dangerous german spy keep back  the veins were standing out like whipcord on granets flushed forehead he swayed on his feet twice he had seemed as though he would spring at his opponent  now listen to me thomson continued on monday i am going from southampton to boulogne for fortyeight hours to attend a court martial there there is only one decent thing you can do you know what that is ill have you exchanged if you are willing into a line regiment with your present rank your colonel will have a hint it will be your duty to meet the first german bullet you can find if you are content with that ill arrange it for you if not  major thomson paused there was a queer twisted smile at the corners of his lips  if not he concluded there is one more little note to add in this book and the account will be full you know now the terms captain granet on which you can go to the front i will give you ten days to consider  if i accept an offer like this granet protested i shall be pleading guilty to all the rubbish you have talked  if it werent for the fact major thomson told him sternly that you have worn his majestys uniform that you are a soldier and that the horror of it would bring pain to every man who has shared with you that privilege i have quite enough evidence here to bring your career to a disgraceful end i give you your chance not for your own sake but for the honour of the army what do you say  granet picked up his hat  ill think it over he muttered  he walked out of the room without any attempt at farewell pushed his way along the corridors down the steps and out into whitehall his face was distorted by a new expression a sudden hatred of thomson had blazed up in him he was at bay driven there by a relentless enemy the man who had tracked him down as he honestly believed to some extent through jealousy the thoughts framed themselves quickly in his mind with unseeing eyes he walked across trafalgar square and made his way to his club in pall mall here he wrote a few lines to isabel worth regretting that he was called out of town on military business for fortyeight hours afterwards he took a taxi and called at his rooms walked restlessly up and down while jarvis threw a few clothes into a bag changed his own apparel for a rough tweed suit and drove to paddington a few minutes later he took his place in the cornish express    chapter xxxii  granet emerged from the tregarten hotel at st marys on the following morning about halfpast eight and strolled down the narrow strip of lawn which bordered the village street a couple of boatmen advanced at once to meet him granet greeted them cheerily  yes i want a boat he admitted id like to do a bit of sailing a friend of mine was here and had a chap named rowselljob rowsell either of you answer to that name by chance  the elder of the two shook his head  my names matthew nichols he announced and this is my brotherinlaw joe lethbridge weve both of us got stout sailing craft and all the recommendations a man need have as for job rowsell well he aint herenot just at this moment so to speak  granet considered the matter briefly  well he decided it seems to me i must talk to this chap rowsell before i do anything im under a sort of promise  the two boatmen looked at one another the one who had addressed him first turned a little away  just as you like sir he announced no doubt rowsell will be up this way towards afternoon  afternoon but i want to go out at once granet protested  matthew nichols removed his pipe from his mouth and spat upon the ground thoughtfully  i doubt whether youll get job rowsell to shift before midday im none so sure hell go out at all with this norwester blowing  whats the matter with him granet asked is he lazy  the man who as yet had scarcely spoken swung round on his heel  hes no lazy sir he said thats not the right word but hes come into money some way or other job rowsell has theres none of us knows how and it aint our business but he spends most of his time in the publichouse and he seems to have taken a fancy for night sailing alone which to my mind and there are others of us as say the same aint none too healthy an occupation and thats all there is to be said of job rowsell as i knows of  its a good deal too granet remarked thoughtfully where does he live  fourth house on the left in yonder street matthew nichols replied pointing with his pipe maybe hell come if you send for him maybe he wont  i must try to keep my word to my friend granet decided if i dont find him ill come back and look for you fellows again  he turned back to the little writingroom scribbled a note and sent it down by the boots in about half an hour he was called once more out into the garden a huge loosejointed man was standing there unshaven untidily dressed and with the look in his eyes of a man who has been drinking heavily  are you job rowsell granet inquired  thats my name the man admitted is there anything wrong with it  not that i know of granet replied i want you to take me out sailing is your boat ready  the man glanced up at the sky  i dont know as i want to go he grumbled theres dirty weather about  i think youd better granet urged im not a bad payer and i can help with the boat lets go and look at her any way  they walked together down to the harbour granet said very little his companion nothing at all they stood on the jetty and gazed across to where the sailing boats were anchored  thats the saucy jane job rowsell indicated stretching out a forefinger  granet scrambled down into a small dinghy which was tied to the side of the stone wall  wed better be getting on board he suggested  rowsell stared at him for a moment but acquiesced they pulled across and boarded the saucy jane a boy whom they found on the deck took the boat back rowsell set his sails slowly but with precision the moment he stepped on board he seemed to become an altered man  where might you be wanting to go he asked youll need them oilskins sure  i want to run out to the bishop lighthouse granet announced  rowsell shook his head  its no sort of a day to face the atlantic sir he declared well try a spin round st mary and white island if you like  granet fastened his oilskins and stooped for a moment to alter one of the sails  look here he said taking his seat at the tiller this is my show job rowsell theres a five pound note for you at the end of the day if you go where i tell you and nowhere else  the man eyed him sullenly a few minutes later they were rushing out of the harbour  its a poor job sailing a pleasure boat he muttered not many of us as wouldnt sell his soul for five pounds  they reached st agnes before they came round on the first tack then with the spray beating in their faces they swung around and made for the opening between the two islands for a time the business of sailing kept them both occupied in two hours time they were standing out towards bishop lighthouse job rowsell took a long breath and filled a pipe with tobacco he was looking more himself now  ill bring her round the point there he said and well come up the channel and home by bryher  youll do nothing of the sort granet ordered keep her head out for the open sea till i tell you to swing round  rowsell looked at his passenger with troubled face  are you another of em he asked abruptly  dont you mind who i am granet answered im on a job im going to see through if a fiver isnt enough for you make it a tenner but keep her going where i put her  rowsell obeyed but his face grew darker he leaned towards his passenger  whats your game he demanded hoarsely theres some of them on the islandd have me by the throat if they only knew the things i could tell em whats your game here eh are you on the cross  i am not granet replied or i shouldnt have needed to bring you to sea i know all about you job rowsell youre doing very well and you may do a bit better by and by now sit tight and keep a still tongue in your head  they were in a queer part of the broken rocky island group there was a great indenture in the rocks up which the sea came hissing to the left round the corner the lighthouse granet drew what looked to be a large pockethandkerchief from the inner pocket of his coat pulled down their pennant with nimble fingers tied on another and hauled it up job rowsell stared at him  whats that  its the german flag you fool granet answered  ill have none of that on my boat the man declared surlily an odd fiver for a kindness  shut up granet snapped drawing his revolver from his pocket you run the boat and mind your own business rowsell im not out here to be fooled with my god  almost at their side the periscope of a submarine had suddenly appeared slowly it rose to the surface an officer in german naval uniform struggled up and called out granet spoke to him rapidly in german job rowsell started at them both then he drew a flask from his pocket and took a long pull the submarine grew nearer and granet tossed a small roll of paper across the chasm of waters all that passed between the two men was to job rowsell unintelligible the last few words however the german repeated in english  the princess hilda from southampton tomorrow at midnight he repeated thoughtfully well its a big business  its worth it granet assured him they may call it a hospital ship but it isnt i am convinced that the one man who is more dangerous to us than any other englishman will be on board  it shall then be done the other promised so  he looked upward to the flag and saluted granet a great sea bore them a little apart granet pulled down the german flag tied up a stone inside it and threw it into the next wave  you can take me back now he told the boatman  they were four hours making the harbour three times they failed to get round the last point met at each time by clouds of hissing spray when at last they sailed in there was a little crowd to watch them nichols and lethbridge stood on one side with gloomy faces  its a queer day for pleasure sailing nicholas remarked to job rowsell as he came up the wet steps of the pier  its all i want of it for a bit any way rowsell muttered pushing his way along the quay if theres any of you for a drink im your man whatho nicholslethbridge  lethbridge muttered something and turned away nichols too declined  i am not sure job rowsell the latter declared that i like your money nor the way you earn it  job rowsell stopped for a minute there was an ugly look in his sullen face  if you werent my own botherinlaw matthew nichols he said id shove those words down your throat  and if you werent my sisters husband nichols retorted turning away id take a little trip over to penzance and say a few words at the police station there  granet laughed goodhumouredly  you fellows dont need to get badtempered with one another he observed look here i shall have three days here ill take one of you each daymake a fair thing of it eh you tomorrow nichols and you the next day lethbridge im not particular about the weather as job rowsell can tell you and ive sailed a boat since i was a boy im no landlubber am i rowsell  no you can sail the boat all right rowsell admitted looking back over his shoulder youd sail it into hell itself if oned let you come on you boys if theres any one of you as fancies to drink im wet to the skin  nichols boat was duly prepared at nine oclock on the following morning lethbridge shouted to him from the rails  gentlemans changed his mind i reckon he went off on the eight oclock boat for penzance  nichols commenced stolidly to furl his sails again  its my thinking lethbridge he said as he clambered into the dinghy that theres things going on in this island which you and me dont understand im for a few plain words with job rowsell though hes my own sisters husband  plain words is more than youll get from job lethbridge replied gloomily he slept last night on the floor at the blue crown and hes there this morning clamouring for brandy and pawing the air hes got the blue devils thats what hes got  theres money nichols declared solemnly some money that is that does no one any good    chapter xxxiii  there was a shrill whistle from the captains bridge and the steamer which had scarcely yet gathered way swung slowly around rushing up towards it through the mists came a little naval launch in the stern of which a single man was seated in an incredibly short space of time it was alongside the passenger had climbed up the rope ladder the pinnace had sheered off and the steamer was once more heading towards the channel  the newlyarrived passenger was making his way towards the saloon when a voice which seemed to come from behind a pile of rugs heaped around a steamerchair arrested his progress  hugh major thomson  he stopped short geraldine shook herself free from her rugs and sat up they looked at one another in astonishment  why geraldine he exclaimed where are you off to  to boulogne of course she answered dont pretend that you are surprised why you got me the appointment yourself  of course he agreed only i had no idea that you were going just yet or that you were on this boat  they told me to come out this week she said as he drew a chair to her side and so many of the nurses and doctors were going by this boat that i thought i would come too i feel quite a professional already nearly all the women here are in nurses uniform and threequarters of the men on board are doctors where are you going hugh  just to the base and back again tomorrow he told here theres a court martial i want to attend  still mysterious she laughed what have you to do with courts martial hugh  too much just for the moment he answered lightly would you like some coffee or anything  she shook her head  no thank you i had an excellent supper before we started i looked at some of the cabins but i decided to spend the night on deck what about you you seem to have arrived in a hurry  i missed the train in london he explained they kept me at the war office then i had to come down in a government car and we couldnt quite catch up any news from ralph  i had a letter days ago she told him it was posted at harwich but he couldnt say where he was and of course he couldnt give me any news father came back from the admiralty very excited yesterday though he says that we have sunk four or five more submarines and that ralphs new equipment is an immense success bythebye is there any danger of submarines here  i shouldnt think so thomson answered they are very busy round the scilly islands but we seem to have been able to keep them out of the channel i thought we should have been convoyed though  in any case she remarked we are a hospital ship i expect theyd leave us alone major thomson she went on i wonder do you really believe all these stories of the horrible doings of the germansthe way they have treated drowning people attacked by their submarines and these hateful stories of belgium sometimes it seems to me as though there was a fog of hatred which had sprung up between the two countries and we could neither of us quite see clearly what the other was doing  i think there is something in that major thomson agreed on the other hand i think it is part of the german principle to make war ruthlessly i have seen things in belgium which i shall never forget as to the submarine business if half the things are true that we have read they seem to have behaved like brutes its queer too he went on for as a rule seamen are never cruel  they were silent for a time for some reason or other they both avoided mention of the one subject which was in the minds of both it was not until after the steward had brought him some coffee and they were more than halfway across that thomson a little abruptly asked her a question  have you seen anything of captain granet lately  nothing she replied  he turned his head slightly towards her  would it trouble you very much if he never came to see you again  she was watching the misty dawn  i do not know she answered but i think that he will come  i am not so sure he told her  do you mean that he is in any fresh trouble she asked quickly  i dont think he needs any fresh trouble exactly thomson remarked but suppose we leave him alone for a little time our meeting was so unexpected and for me such a pleasure dont let us spoil it  let us talk of other things she agreed readily tell me for instance just what does a submarine look like when it pops up out of the sea  i have never seen one close to he admitted except on the surface why do you ask  she pointed with her forefinger to a little spot almost between two banks of mist  because i fancied just now that i saw something sticking up out of the water there something which might have been the periscope of a submarine she replied  he looked in the direction which she indicated but shook his head  i can see nothing he said but in any case i dont think they would attack a hospital ship this is a dangerous area for them too we are bound to have a few destroyers close at hand i wonder if ralph  he never finished his sentence the shock which they had both read about but never dreamed of experiencing flung them without a moments warning onto their hands and feet the steamer seemed as though it had been lifted out of the water there was a report as though some great cannon had been fired off in their very ears looking along the deck it suddenly seemed to thomson that her bows were pointing to the sky the after portion where they were seated was vibrating and shaking as though they had struck a rock and only a few yards away from them towards the middle of the boat the end of the cabin was riven bare to the heavens timbers were creaking and splintering in every direction there was a great gap already in the side of the steamer as though some one had taken a cut out of it then high above the shrieking of the escaped steam and the cracking of woodwork the siren of the boat screamed out its frantic summons for help geraldine for the moment lost her nerve she began to shriek and ran towards the nearest boat into which the people were climbing like ants thomson drew her back  dont hurry he begged here  he threw open the door of a cabin which leaned over them snatched two of the lifebelts from the berth and rapidly fastened one on her there was some semblance of order on deck now that the first confusion had passed the men were all rushing to quarters three of the boats had been blown into splinters upon their davits the fourth terribly overloaded was being lowered thomson working like a madman was tying some spare belts on to a table which had floated out from the cabin more than once the boat gave a great plunge and they had to hold on to the cabin doors a huge wave broke completely over them drenching them from head to foot the top of the rail now was on a level with the sea thomson stood up for a moment and looked around then he turned to geraldine  look here he said therell be plenty of craft around to pick us up this thing cant sink keep the lifebelt on and get your arms through the belt i have tied on to the table so thats right now come over to the side  youre not going to jump overboard she cried  we are going to just step overboard he explained its the only chance throw off your fur cloak you see if we stay a moment later we shall be dragged down after the steamer we must get clear while we can  i can swim he answered quickly throwing off his coat and waistcoat this thing will support me easily believe me geraldine theres nothing to be frightened about we can keep her afloat for halfadozen hours if necessary with this only dont let go of it keep your arms through andby god quick  a huge wave broke right over their heads the boat which had nearly reached the level of the water was overturned and the air seemed full of the screaming of women the loud shouting of orders from the bridge where the captain was standing with his hands upon the fast sinking rail the water was up to their waists now in a moment they ceased to feel anything beneath their feet geraldine found herself suddenly buoyant thomson swimming with one arm locked the other in their raft  push yourself away from everything as well as you can he whispered and geraldineif anything should happen to us i never changednot for a moment  i dont believe i ever did either she sobbed holding out her hand  another wave broke over them they came up however he gripped her wet hand for a moment all around them were articles of ships furniture broken planks here and there a man swimming from close at hand came the shriek of the vanishing siren  look geraldine cried  barely fifty feet away from them was the submarine the captain and four or five of the men were on deck thomson shouted to him  cant you save some of these women  the answer was a laughhoarse brutal derisive the submarine glided away thomsons face as he looked after it was black with anger the next moment he recovered himself however he had need of all his strength  dont listen to anything geraldine he begged her they will nearly all be saved cant you hear the sirens already there are plenty of ships coming up remember we cant go down so long as we keep hold here  but youve no lifebelt on she faltered  i dont need it he assured her i can keep afloat perfectly well youre not cold  no she gasped but i feel so low down the sky seems suddenly further away oh if some one would come  there were sirens now and plenty of them close at hand out of the mist they saw a great black hull looming  theyre here all right he cried courage geraldine its only another five minutes  thirty miles an hour into a fog of mist with the spray falling like a fountain and the hiss of the seawater like devils music in their ears then the haze lifted like the curtain before the stage of a theatre and rolled away into the dim distance an officer stood by conyers side  hospital ship princess hilda just torpedoed by a submarine sir theyre picking up the survivors already were right into em sir  even as he spoke the moonlight shone down there were two trawlers and a patrol boat in sight and twenty or thirty boats rowing to the scene of the disaster suddenly there was a shout  submarine on the port bow  they swung around the sea seemed churned into a mass of soapy foam conyers gripped the rail in front of him the orders had scarcely left his lips before the guns were thundering out the coveredin structure on the lower deck blazed with an unexpected light the gun below swung slowly downwards moved by some unseen instrument columns of spray leapt into the air the roar of the guns was deafening then there was another shouta hoarse yell of excitement barely a hundred yards away the submarine wobbling strangely appeared on the surface an officer in the stern held up the white flag  we are sinking he shouted we surrender  for a single second conyers hesitated then he looked downwards the corpse of a woman went floating by a child tied on to a table was bobbing against the side the red fires flashed before his eyes the thunder of his voice broke the momentary stillness in obedience to his command the guns belched out a level line of flamethere was nothing more left of the submarine or of the men clinging on to it like flies conyers watched them disappear without the slightest change of expression  hells the only place for them he muttered send out the boats johnson and cruise around there may be something else left to be picked up  the word of command was passed forward and immediately a boat was lowered  a man and a woman clinging to a table sir an officer reported to conyers were bringing them on board  conyers moved to the side of the bridge he saw geraldine lifted into the boat and thomson as soon as she was safe clamber in after her he watched them hauled up on to the deck of the destroyer and suddenly he recognised them  my god he exclaimed as he dashed down the ladder its geraldine  she was standing on the deck the wet streaming from her supported by a sailor on either side she gasped a little when she saw him she was quite conscious and her voice was steady  we are both here ralph she cried hugh and i he saved my life thank heavens you are here  already the steward was hastening forward with brandy geraldine sipped a little and passed the glass to thomson then she turned swiftly to her brother there was an unfamiliar look in her face  ralph she muttered dont bother about us dont stop for anything else cant you find that submarine i saw them allthe menlaughing as they passed away  conyers eyes blazed for a moment with reminiscent fury then his lips parted and he broke into strange discordant merriment  theyll laugh no more in this world geraldine he cried in fierce triumph theyre down at the bottom of the sea every man and dog of them  she gripped him by the shouldergeraldine who had never willingly hurt and insect  ralph she sobbed thank god thank god you did it    chapter xxxiv  it was towards the close of an unusually long days work and major thomson sighed with relief as he realised that at last his anteroom was empty he lit a cigarette and stretched himself in his chair he had been interviewed by all manner of people had listened to dozens of suspicious stories his work had been intricate and at times full of detail on the whole a good days work he decided and he had been warmly thanked over the wires by a brigadiergeneral at harwich for his arrest and exposure of a man who had in his possession a very wonderful plan of the felixstowe land defences he lit a cigarette and glanced at his watch just then the door was hurriedly opened ambrose came in without even the usual ceremony of knocking he held a worn piece of paper in his hand there was a triumphant ring in his tone as he looked up from it towards his chief  ive done it sir he exclaimed stumbled across it quite by accident ive got the whole code its based upon the leading articles in the times of certain dates heres this last messageleave london june 4th have flares midnight buckingham palace st pauls steps gardens in front of savoy your last report received  leave london june 4th thomson repeated glancing at his calendartoday have flareszeppelins ambrose  the clerk nodded  i thought of them at once sir he agreed thats a very plain and distinct warning in a remarkably complicated code and its addressedto sir alfred anselman  a smouldering light flashed in thomsons eyes  ambrose he declared youre a brick i shant forget this just find out at once if the chiefs in his room please  there followed half an hour of breathless happenings from the chiefs room thomson hurried over to the admiralty here he was taken by one of the men whom he had called to see on to the flat roof and they stood there facing eastwards twilight was falling and there was scarcely a breath of air  its a perfect night the official remarked if they start at the right time theyll get here before any one can see them all the same were warning the whole coast and our gunstations will be served all night  shall we have a chance do you think of hitting any of them thomson asked  the sailor winked  there are a couple of gunstations i know of not far from here he said i tell you theyve got armament there which will make our friends tear their hair shells that burst in the air mind too which you neednt mind letting em have as quick as we can fire em off i shall try and get on to one of those stations myself at midnight  what time do you think theyd attack if they do get over  the other took out his watch and considered the subject  of course he reflected theyll want to make the most of the darkness but i think what theyll aim at chiefly is to get here unobserved therefore i think they wont start until its dark probably from three or four different bases that means theyll be here a little before dawn i shall just motor my people up to harrow and get back again by midnight  thomson left the admiralty a little later and took a taxi to berkeley square the servant hesitated a little at his inquiry  miss geraldine is in sir i believe he said she is in the morningroom at the moment  i shall not keep her thomson promised i know that it is nearly dinnertime  the man ushered him across the hall and threw open the door of the little room at the back of the stairs  major thomson madam he announced  geraldine rose slowly from the couch on which she had been seated standing only a few feet away from her was granet the three looked at one another for a moment and no word was spoken it was geraldine who first recovered herself  hugh she exclaimed warmly why you are another unexpected visitor  i should not have come at such a time thomson explained but i wanted just to have a word with you geraldine if you are engaged your mother would do  i am not in the least engaged geraldine assured him and i have been expecting to hear from you all day i got back from boulogne last night  none the worse i am glad to see thomson remarked  she shivered a little then she looked him full in the face and her eyes were full of unspoken things  thanks to you she murmured however she added with a little laugh i dont want to frighten you away and i know what would happen if i began to talk about our adventure i am sorry captain granet she went on turning towards where he was standing but i cannot possibly accept your aunts invitation it was very good of her to ask me and very kind of you to want me to go so much but tonight i could not leave my mother she has been having rather a fit of nerves about ralph the last few days and she hates being left alone  captain granet is trying to persuade you to leave london this evening thomson asked quietly  he wants me very much to go down to lady anselmans at reigate tonight geraldine explained i really accepted lady anselmans invitation some days ago but that was before mother was so unwell i have written your aunt captain granet she continued turning to him do please explain to her how disappointed i am and it was very nice of you to come and ask me to change my mind  there was brief but rather curious silence granet had turned away form geraldine as though to address thomson he was meeting now the silent half contemptuous challenge of the latters eyes  captain granet is showing great consideration for your comfort and safety thomson remarked  granet for a moment forgot himself his eyes flashed he was half angry half terrified  what do you mean he demanded  thomson made no immediate answer he seemed to be pondering over his words his expression was inscrutable geraldine looked from one to the other  there is something between you two which i dont understand she declared  there is a very great deal about captain granet which i am only just beginning to understand thomson said calmly you should find his solicitude about your movements this evening a great compliment geraldine it arises entirely from his desire to spare you the shock of what may turn out yet to be a very lamentable catastrophe  you two men are quite incomprehensible geraldine sighed if only either of you would speak plainly  thomson bowed  perhaps i may be able to indulge you presently he observed since you have failed to persuade miss conyers to leave london captain granet he went on turning towards the latter may i ask what your own movements are likely to be  you may not was the passionate reply they are no concern of yours  they are unfortunately thomson retorted my very intimate concern this you will remember is your ninth day of grace it is not my desire that you should suffer unduly for your humane visit here but i might remind you that under the circumstances it is a little compromising no dont interrupt me we understand one another i am quite sure  granet had taken a step backwards his face for a moment was blanched his lips opened but closed again without speech thomson was watching him closely  precisely he went on you have guessed the truth i can see we have been able within the last few hours to decode that very interesting message which reached your uncle some little time ago  geraldines bewilderment increased granets almost stupefied silence seemed to amaze her  hugh what does it all mean she cried is captain granet in trouble because he has come here to warn me of something he has not said a word except to beg me to go down into the country tonight  and he as begged you to do that thomson said because he is one of those privileged few who have been warned that tonight or tomorrow morning is the time selected for the zeppelin raid on london of which we have heard so much oh he knows all about it and his uncle and a great many of the guests they have gathered together theyll all be safe enough at reigate come captain granet what have you to say about it  granet drew himself up he looked every inch a soldier and curiously enough he seemed in his bearing and attitude to be respecting the higher rank by virtue of which thomson had spoken  tomorrow as you have reminded me is my tenth day sir he said i shall report myself at your office at nine oclock goodbye miss conyers i hope that even though i have failed major thomson may persuade you to change your mind  he left the room geraldine was so amazed that she made no movement towards ringing the bell she turned instead towards thomson  what does it mean you must tell me she insisted i am not a child  it means that what i have told you all along is the truth thomson replied earnestly you thought geraldine that i was narrow and suspicious i had powers and an office and responsibilities too which you knew nothing of that young man who has just left the room is in the pay of germany so is his uncle  what sir alfred anselman she exclaimed are you mad hugh  not in the least he assured her these are bald facts  but sir alfred anselman he has done such wonderful things for the country they all say that he ought to have been in the cabinet hugh you cant be serious  i am so far serious thomson declared grimly that an hour ago we succeeded in decoding a message from holland to sir alfred anselman advising him to leave london today we are guessing what that means we may be right and we may be wrong we shall see i come to beg you to leave the city for twentyfour hours i find granet on the same errand  but they may have warned himsome personal friend may have done it she insisted he is a man with worldwide friends and worldwide connections  they why didnt he bring the warning straight to the admiralty thomson argued if he were a patriotic englishman do you think that any other course was open to him it wont do geraldine i know more about captain granet than i am going to tell you at this moment shall we leave that subject cant we do something to persuade your mother to take you a little way from town you can collect some of your friends if you like you ought to take olive for instance we dont want a panic but there is no reason why you shouldnt tell any of your friends quietly  the door was suddenly opened the admiral put his head in  sorry he apologised i thought i heard that young granet was here  he has been and gone father geraldine told him youd better see what you can do with father she added turning to thomson  whats wrong eh whats wrong whats wrong the admiral demanded  the fact is sir seymour thomson explained weve had noticenot exactly notice but weve decoded a secret dispatch which gives us reason to believe that a zeppelin raid will be attempted on london during the next twentyfour hours i came round to try and induce geraldine to have you all move away until the things over  ill be damned if i do the admiral grunted what sneak off and leave five or six million others who havent had the tip to see all the fun not i if what you say is true thomsonand i am going straight back to the admiraltyi shall find my way on to one of the air stations myself and the women can stay at home and get ready to be useful  geraldine passed her hand through her fathers arm  thats the sort of people we are she laughed turning to thomson all the same hugh it was very nice of you to come she added i couldnt see us scuttling away into the country you know i shall go round and persuade olive to stay with me i am expecting to return to boulogne almost at once to the hospital there to bring some more wounded back i may get a little practice here  thomson picked up his hat  well he said quietly i cannot complain of your decision after all it is exactly what i expected  he made his adieux and departed the admiral sniffed as he glanced after him  very good chap thomson he remarked but he doesnt quite understand i bet you that fine young fellow granet would never have suggested our running away like frightened sheep come along my dear well go and dine    chapter xxxv  about three oclock the next morning thomson was awakened by a light touch upon his shoulder he sprang up from the couch upon which he had thrown himself ambrose was standing over him he was still in his room at the war office and fully dressed  mr gordon jones has rung up from downing street sir he announced he is with the prime minister they want to know if you could step across  ill go at once thomson agreedjust sponge my eyes and have a brush up nothing else fresh ambrose  nothing at all sir the young man replied all the newspapers in london have rung up but of course we have not answered any of them youll be careful outside please there isnt a single light anywhere and the streets are like pitch a man tried to use an electric torch on the other side of the way just now and they shot him theres a double line of sentries all round from whitehall corner  no flares this time eh thomson muttered all right ambrose i think i can feel my way there  he descended into the street but for a few moments he found himself hopelessly lost at sea so far as he could see there was no light nor any glimmer of one he reached the corner of the street like a blind man by tapping the kerbstone with his cane arrived here he stood for a moment in the middle of the road bareheaded there was not a breath of wind anywhere he made his way carefully down towards downing street meeting few people and still obliged to grope rather than walk along downing street he made his way by the railings and rang the bell at last at the premiers house he was shown at once into the council room the four or five men who were seated around a table and who looked up at his entrance bore every one of them household names the premier held out his hand  good evening major thomson he began please sit down and join us for a moment  thomson was a little surprised at the gathering  youll forgive my suggesting that this is likely to be a marked spot tonight he said  the premier smiled  well you could scarcely expect us to hide could you major thomson he remarked in any case there is not one of us who is not prepared to share what the other citizens of london have to face the country for the women and children if you please we gather sir that it is chiefly through you that we are in the fortunate position of being prepared tonight  it was through my action in a matter which i understand has been subjected to a great deal of criticism thomson replied  i admit it frankly the statesman acknowledged that particular matter the matter of your censorship of a certain letter has been the subject of a grave and earnest conference here between us all we decided to send for you we telephoned first of all to the chief but he told us that you were entirely head of your department and responsible to no one that you had beenforgive mea brilliant success and that it was his intention to interfere in no possible way with any course you chose to take i may say that he intimated as much to me when i went to him simply furious because you had removed a certain person from the list of those whose correspondence is free from censorship  what can i do for you gentlemen thomson asked  listen to us while we put a matter to you from a commonsense point of view mr gordon jones begged you see who we are we are those upon whose shoulders rests chiefly the task of ruling this country i want to tell you that we have come to a unanimous decision we say nothing about the moral or the actual guilt of sir alfred anselman how far he may have been concerned in plotting with our countrys enemies is a matter which we may know in the future but for the presentwell lets make a simple matter of itwe want him left alone  you wish him to continue in his present high position thomson said slowlya man who is convicted of having treasonable correspondence with our enemy  we wish him left alone mr gordon jones continued earnestly not for his own sake but for ours when the time comes later on it may be possible for us to deal with him today no words of mine could explain to you his exact utility he has a finger upon the moneymarkets of the world he has wealth great wealth and commands great wealth in every city frankly this man as an open enemy today could bring more harm upon us than if any neutral power you could name were to join the triple alliance remember too major thomson that there may be advantages to us in this waiting attitude since your warning his letters can be admitted to censorship you have the control of a great staff of military detectives the resources of scotland yard too are at your service have him watched day and night his letters opened his every movement followed but dont provoke him to open enmity we dont want him in the tower the scandal and the shock of it would do us enormous harm apart from the terrible financial panic which would ensue we will see to it that he does no further mischief than he may already have done we make an appeal to you all of us here tonight be guided entirely by us in this matter you have rendered the country great service by your discovery render it a greater one major thomson by keeping that discovery secret  i will not make conditions with you thomson replied gravely i will say at once that i am perfectly willing to yield to your judgement in this matter in return i ask something i have more serious charges still to bring against sir alfreds nephew will you leave the matter of dealing with this young man in my hands  with pleasure the premier agreed i think gentlemen he added looking around the table that we need not detain major thomson any longer we others have still a little business to finish  it was all over in those few minutes and thomson found himself in the street again he guided his way by the railings into whitehall the blackness seemed to him to be now less impenetrable looking fixedly eastward he seemed to be conscious of some faint lightening in the sky he heard the rumbling of carts in the road the horses mostly being led by their drivers here and there an odd taxicab which had escaped the police orders came along with one lamp lit only to be stopped in a few yards and escorted to the edge of the pavement all the way up whitehall there was one long line of taxicabs unable to ply for hire or find their way to the garages until daylight the unusualness of it all was almost stimulating at the top of the broad thoroughfare thomson turned to the left through the pall mall arch and passed into st jamess park he strolled slowly along until he came to the thoroughfare to the left leading down to the admiralty there he paused for a moment and turning around listened intently he was possessed of particularly keen hearing and it seemed to him as though from afar off he could hear the sound of a thousand muffled hammers beating upon an anvil of a strange methodical disturbance in the air he grasped the railing with one hand and gazed upward with straining eyes just at that moment he saw distinctly what appeared to be a flash of lightning in the sky followed by a report which sounded like a sharp clap of thunder then instinctively he covered his eyes with his hands from a dozen placesone close at handa long level stream of light seemed to shoot out towards the clouds there was one of them which came from near the carlton hotel which lit up the whole of the pall mall arch with startling distinctness gave him a sudden vision of the admiralty roof and as he followed it up brought a cry to his lips far away beyond even the limits of the quivering line of light there was something in the sky which seemed a little blacker than the cloud even while he looked at it from the admiralty roof came a lurid flash the hiss and screech of a shell as it dashed upwards and then the sleeping city seemed suddenly to awake and the night to become hideous not fifty yards away from him something fell in the park and all around him lumps of gravel and clods of earth fell in a shower a great elm tree fell crashing into the railings close by his side then there was a deafening explosion the thunder of falling masonry and a house by the side of the arch broke suddenly into flames a few moments later a queer sight amongst all these untoward and unexpected happenings a fire engine dashed under the arch narrowly missing the broken fragments of brick and stone swung around and a dozen firehoses commenced to play upon the flaming building  the darkness was over now and the silence there were houses on the other side of the river on fire and scarcely a moment passed without the crash of a falling bomb the air for a second or two was filled with piteous shrieks from somewhere towards charingcross shrieks drowned almost immediately by another tremendous explosion from further north every now and then looking upwards in the line of the long searchlights thomson could distinctly see the shape of one of the circling airships once the light flashed downwards and between him and buckingham palace he saw a great aeroplane coming head foremost down heard it strike the ground with a tremendous crash heard the long death cry a cry which was more like a sob of the men who perished with it  every moment the uproar became more deafening from all sorts of unsuspected places and buildings came the lightning quiver of the guns followed by the shrieking of the shells right on to the tops of the houses between where he was standing and the carlton another aeroplane fell smashing the chimneys and the windows and hanging there like a gigantic black bat there was not a soul anywhere near him but by the occasional flashes of light thomson could see soldiers and hurrying people in the admiralty square and along the strand he could hear the patter of footsteps upon the pavement but he himself remained alone a silent spellbound fascinated witness of this epic of slaughter and ruin  then came what seemed to him to be its culmination high above his head he was suddenly conscious of a downward current of air he looked up the shouting voices apparently from the falling clouds voices unfamiliar and guttural warned him of what was coming the darkness which loomed over him took shape he turned and ran for his life only a little way above his head a storm of shrapnel now was streaming from the lowered guns of the admiralty turning back to look he saw scarcely fifty yards above him the falling of a huge zeppelin he felt himself just outside its range and paused breathless with a crash which seemed to split the air the huge structure fell the far end of it all buckled up rested against the back of the admiralty the other end was only a few yards from where thomson stood at the bottom of the steps leading up into pall mall a dozen searchlights played upon it men suddenly appeared as though from underneath some of them stood for a moment and swayed like drunken men others began to run round the corner from the admiralty square a little company of soldiers came with fixed bayonets there was a shout two of the men ran on  thomson heard the crack of a rifle and saw one of them leap into the air and collapse the other one staggered and fell on his knees a dozen of them were there together with their hands stretched to the skies then thomson was conscious that one of the oilclad figures was coming in his direction making for the steps running with swift stealthy gait a flash of light gleamed upon the fugitive for a moment he wore a hat like a helmet only his face blackened with grease and his staring eyes were visible he came straight for thomson breathing heavily  hands up thomson cried  the man aimed a furious blow at him thomson who quite unconsciously had drawn a revolver from his pocket shot him through the heart watched him jump up and fall a senseless shapeless heap upon the bottom of the steps and with a queer instinct of bloodthirstiness ran down the line of the wrecked zeppelin seeking for more victims the soldiers were coming up in force now however and detachments of them were marching away their prisoners another company was stationed all around the huge craft keeping guard thomson walked back once more towards the admiralty the sky was still lurid with the reflection of many fires but the roar of the guns had diminished and for several minutes no bomb had been thrown with the revolver in his hand still smoking he ran into a man whom he knew slightly at the admiralty  thomson by god the man exclaimed what are you doing with that revolver  i dont know he answered ive just shot one of those fellows from the zeppelin how are things going  there are six zeppelins down in different parts and a couple of dozen aeroplanes the other replied woolwich is safe and the houses of parliament and whitehall heaps of reports to come in but i dont believe theyve done much damage  thomson passed on it was lighter now and the streets were thronged with people he turned once more towards the strand and stood for a moment in trafalgar square one wing of the national gallery was gone and the golden cross hotel was in flames leaning against the union club was another fallen aeroplane men and women were rushing everywhere in wild excitement he made his way down to the war office it seemed queer to find men at work still in their rooms he sent ambrose for an orderly and received a message from headquarters  damage to public buildings and property not yet estimated all dockyards and arsenals safe principal public buildings untouched only seventeen dead and forty injured reported up to five minutes ago great damage done to enemy fleet remainder in full retreat many badly damaged zeppelin just down in essex four aeroplanes between here and romford  thomson threw down his revolver  well he muttered to himself perhaps london will believe now that we are at war    chapter xxxvi  london too has its scars and london is proud of them a great morning paper declared the next morning the last and gigantic effort of german frightfulness has come and passed london was visited before dawn this morning by a fleet of sixteen zeppelins and forty aeroplanes seven of these former monsters lie stranded and wrecked in various parts of the city two are known to have collapsed in essex and another is reported to have come to grief in norfolk of the aeroplanes nineteen were shot down and of the rest so far no news has been heard the damage to life and property great though it may seem is much less than was expected such losses as we have sustained we shall bear with pride and fortitude we stand now more closely than ever in touch with our gallant allies we too bear the marks of battle in the heart of our country  thomson paused to finish his breakfast and abandoning the leading article turned to a more particular account  the loss of life the journal went on to say although regrettable is so far as accounts have reached us not large there are thirtyone civilians killed a hundred and two have been admitted into hospitals and curiously enough only one person bearing arms has suffered we regret deeply to announce the death of a very distinguished young officer captain ronald granet a nephew of sir alfred anselman a bomb passed through the roof of his house in sackville street completely shattering the apartment in which he was sitting his servant perished with him the other occupants of the building were fortunately for them away for the night  the paper slipped from thomsons fingers he looked through the windows of his room across the thames exactly opposite to him a fallen chimney and four blackened walls still smouldering were there to remind him of the great tragedy he looked down at the paper again there was no mistake it was the judgment of a higher court than his  he made his way down to the war office at a little before ten oclock the streets were crowded with people and there were throngs surrounding each of the places where bombs had been dropped towards the pall mall arch the people were standing in thousands trying to get near the wreck of the huge zeppelin which completely blocked all the traffic through st jamess park thomson paused for a moment at the top of trafalgar square and looked around him the words of the newspaper were indeed true london had her scars yet there was nothing in the faces of the people to show fear if anything there was an atmosphere all around of greater vitality of greater intensity the war had come a little nearer at last than the columns of the daily press it was the real thing with which even the everyday londoner had rubbed shoulders from cockspur street to nelsons monument the men were lined up in a long queue making their way to the recruiting office  admiral conyers paid his usual morning visit to the admiralty lunched at his club and returned home that evening in a state of suppressed excitement he found his wife and geraldine alone and at once took up his favourite position on the hearthrug  amongst the other surprises of the last twentyfour hours he announced i received one today which almost took my breath away it had reference to a person whom you both know  not poor captain granet lady conyers asked you read about him of course  nothing to do with granet poor fellow the admiral continued listen i was walking if you please for a few yards with the man who is practically responsible today for the conduct of the war at the corner of pall mall we came face to face with thomson i nodded and we were passing on when to my astonishment my companion stopped and held out both his hands thomson my dear fellow he said i came round to your rooms today but you were engaged three or four deep not another word save thisthanks when we write our history the country will know what it owes you at present thanks  major thomson lady conyers gasped  hugh geraldine echoed  the admiral smiled  we passed on he continued and i said to his lordshipwasnt that thomson the inspector of field hospitals he simply laughed at me my dear conyers he said surely you knew that was only a blind thomson is head of the entire military intelligence department he has the rank of a brigadiergeneral waiting for him when he likes to take it he prefers to remain as far as possible unknown and unrecognised because it helps him with his work now listen youve read in all the papers of course that we had warning of what was coming last night that the reason we were so successful was because every light in london had been extinguished and every gunstation was doubly manned well the warning we received was due to thomson and no one else  and to think lady conyers exclaimed that we were half afraid to tell your father that hugh was coming to dinner  geraldine had slipped from the room the admiral blew his nose  i hope geraldines going to be sensible he said ive always maintained that thomson was a fine fellow only geraldine seemed rather carried away by that young granet poor fellow one cant say anything about him now but he was just the ordinary type of showy young soldier not fit to hold a candle to a man like thomson  lady conyers was a little startled  you have such sound judgement seymour she murmured  thomson was a few minutes late for dinner but even the admiral forgave him  just ourselves thomson he said as they made their way into the diningroom what a shock the chief gave me today youve kept things pretty dark inspector of hospitals indeed  thomson smiled  that was my excuse he explained for running backwards and forwards between france and england at the beginning of the war theres no particular secret about my position now ive had a very hard fight to keep it a very hard fight to make it a useful one until last night at any rate it hasnt seemed to me that english people realised that we were at war now i hope at last that we are going to take the gloves off do you know he went on a little later that in france they think were mad honestly in my position if i had had the french laws at my back i believe that by today the war would have been over as it is when i started even my post was a farce we had to knuckle under the whole of the time to the civil authorities they wanted to fine a spy ten shillings or to bind him over to keep the peace ive never had to fight for anything so hard in my life as ive had to fight once or twice for my file of men at the tower at the beginning of the war wed catch them absolutely redhanded all they had to do was to surrender to the civil authorities and we had a city magistrate looking up statutes to see how to deal with them  there are a good many things which will make strange reading after the war is over the admiral said grimly i fancy that my late department will provide a few sensations still our very mistakes are our justification we were about as ready for war as lady conyers there is to play rugby football for oxford  it has taken us the best part of a year to realise what war means thomson assented even now there are people whom one meets every day who seem to be living in abstractions  last nights raid ought to wake a few of them up the admiral grunted i should like to have shown those devils where to have dropped a few of their little toys there are one or two men who were making laws not so long ago whod have had a hole in their roofs  geraldine laughed softly  i really think that dad feels more bloodthirsty when he talks about some of our politicians than he does about the germans she declared  some of our worst enemies are at home any way sir seymour insisted and we shall never get on with the war till weve weeded them out  where did the nearest bomb to you drop thomson inquired  the corner of st jamess street sir seymour replied there were two houses in berkeley street alight and a hole in the roof of a house in hay hill the bomb there didnt explode though sad thing about young granet wasnt it he seems to be the only service man who suffered at all  lady conyers shivered sympathetically  it was perfectly ghastly she murmured  a very promising young officer i should think the admiral continued and a very sad death brings things home to you when you remember that it was only yesterday he was here poor fellow  geraldine and her mother rose from their places a few minutes later the latter looked up at thomson as he held open the door  you wont be long will you she begged  you can take him with you if you like the admiral declared also rising to his feet he doesnt drink port and the cigarettes are in your room i have to take the chair at a recruiting meeting at holborn in a quarter of an hour the cars waiting now youll excuse me wont you thomson  of course the latter assented i must leave early myself i have to go back to the war office  geraldine took his arm and led him into the little morningroom  you see i am carrying you off in the most barefaced fashion she began motioning him to a seat by her side but really you are such an elusive person and only this morning in the midst of that awful thunder of bombs when we stood on the roof and looked at london breaking out into flames i couldnt help thinkingremembering i meanhow short a time it is since you and i were face to face with the other horror and you saved my life do you know i dont think that i have ever said thank younot properly  i think the words may go he answered smiling it was a horrible time while it lasted but it was soon over the worst part of it was seeing those others whom we could not help drifting by  i should have been with them but for you she said quietly dont think that i dont know it dont think that i dont regret sometimes hugh that i didnt trust you a little more completely you are right about so many things but hugh will you tell me something  of course  why were you so almost obstinately silent when father spoke of poor captain granets death  because i couldnt agree with what he said thomson replied i think that granets death in exactly that fashion was the best thing that could possibly have happened for him and for all of us  she shivered as she looked at him  arent you a little cruel she murmured  i am not cruel at all he assured her firmly let me quote the words of a greater mani have no enemies but the enemies of my country and for them i have no mercy  you still believe that captain granet  there is no longer any doubt as to his complete guilt as you know yourself the cipher letter warning certain people in london of the coming raid passed through his hands he even came here to warn you there were other charges against him which could have been proved up to the hilt while we are upon this subject geraldine let me finish with it absolutely only a short time ago i confronted him with his guilt i gave him ten days during which it was my hope that he would embrace the only honourable course left to him i took a risk leaving him free but during the latter part of the time he was watched day and night if he had lived until this morning there isnt any power on earth could have kept him from the tower or any judge however merciful who could have saved him from being shot  it is too awful she faltered and yetit makes me so ashamed hugh to think that i could not have trusted you more absolutely  he opened his pocketbook and a little flush of colour came suddenly into her cheeks he drew out the ring silently  will you trust yourself now and finally geraldine he asked  she held out her finger  i shall be so proud and so happy to have it again she whispered i do really feel as though i had behaved like a foolish child and i dont like the feeling at all because in these days one should be more than ordinarily serious shouldnt one shall i be able to make it up to you hugh do you think  he stooped to meet her lips  there is an atonement you might make dear he ventured do you remember a suggestion of mine at one of those historic luncheons of lady anselmans  she laughed into his eyes for a moment and then looked away  i was wondering whether you had forgotten that she confessed
