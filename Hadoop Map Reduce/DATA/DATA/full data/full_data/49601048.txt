49601048	illustration the fighter in the outdoor ring       the croxley master    a great tale of the prize ring    by    a conan doyle    illustration the fighter in the outdoor ring    new york   mcclure phillips  co   mcmvii    copyright 1907 by mcclure phillips  co     the croxley master     i   mr robert montgomery was seated at his desk his head upon his hands in a state of the blackest despondency before him was the open ledger with the long columns of dr oldacres prescriptions at his elbow lay the wooden tray with the labels in various partitions the cork box the lumps of twisted sealingwax while in front a rank of empty bottles waited to be filled but his spirits were too low for work he sat in silence with his fine shoulders bowed and his head upon his hands  outside through the grimy surgery window over a foreground of blackened brick and slate a line of enormous chimneys like cyclopean pillars upheld the lowering duncoloured cloudbank for six days in the week they spouted smoke but today the furnace fires were banked for it was sunday sordid and polluting gloom hung over a district blighted and blasted by the greed of man there was nothing in the surroundings to cheer a desponding soul but it was more than his dismal environment which weighed upon the medical assistant  his trouble was deeper and more personal the winter session was approaching he should be back again at the university completing the last year which would give him his medical degree but alas he had not the money with which to pay his class fees nor could he imagine how he could procure it sixty pounds were wanted to make his career and it might have been as many thousands for any chance there seemed to be of his obtaining it  he was roused from his black meditation by the entrance of dr oldacre himself a large cleanshaven respectable man with a prim manner and an austere face he had prospered exceedingly by the support of the local church interest and the rule of his life was never by word or action to run a risk of offending the sentiment which had made him his standard of respectability and of dignity was exceedingly high and he expected the same from his assistants his appearance and words were always vaguely benevolent a sudden impulse came over the despondent student he would test the reality of this philanthropy  i beg your pardon dr oldacre said he rising from his chair i have a great favour to ask of you  the doctors appearance was not encouraging his mouth suddenly tightened and his eyes fell  yes mr montgomery  you are aware sir that i need only one more session to complete my course  so you have told me  it is very important to me sir  naturally  the fees dr oldacre would amount to about sixty pounds  i am afraid that my duties call me elsewhere mr montgomery  one moment sir i had hoped sir that perhaps if i signed a paper promising you interest upon your money you would advance this sum to me i will pay you back sir i really will or if you like i will work it off after i am qualified  the doctors lips had thinned into a narrow line his eyes were raised again and sparkled indignantly  your request is unreasonable mr montgomery i am surprised that you should have made it consider sir how many thousands of medical students there are in this country no doubt there are many of them who have a difficulty in finding their fees am i to provide for them all or why should i make an exception in your favour i am grieved and disappointed mr montgomery that you should have put me into the painful position of having to refuse you he turned upon his heel and walked with offended dignity out of the surgery  the student smiled bitterly and turned to his work of making up the morning prescriptions it was poor and unworthy workwork which any weakling might have done as well and this was a man of exceptional nerve and sinew but such as it was it brought him his board and £1 a week enough to help him during the summer months and let him save a few pounds towards his winter keep but those class fees where were they to come from he could not save them out of his scanty wage dr oldacre would not advance them he saw no way of earning them his brains were fairly good but brains of that quality were a drug in the market he only excelled in his strength and where was he to find a customer for that but the ways of fate are strange and his customer was at hand  look yere said a voice at the door  montgomery looked up for the voice was a loud and rasping one a young man stood at the entrancea stocky bullnecked young miner in tweed sunday clothes and an aggressive necktie he was a sinisterlooking figure with dark insolent eyes and the jaw and throat of a bulldog  look yere said he again why hast thou not sent t medicine oop as thy master ordered  montgomery had become accustomed to the brutal frankness of the northern worker at first it had enraged him but after a time he had grown callous to it and accepted it as it was meant but this was something different it was insolencebrutal overbearing insolence with physical menace behind it  what name he asked coldly  barton happen i may give thee cause to mind that name yoong man mak oop t wifes medicine this very moment look ye or it will be the worse for thee  montgomery smiled a pleasant sense of relief thrilled softly through him what blessed safetyvalve was this through which his jangled nerves might find some outlet the provocation was so gross the insult so unprovoked that he could have none of those qualms which take the edge off a mans mettle he finished sealing the bottle upon which he was occupied and he addressed it and placed it carefully in the rack  look here said he turning round to the miner your medicine will be made up in its turn and sent down to you i dont allow folk in the surgery wait outside in the waitingroom if you wish to wait at all  yoong man said the miner thous got to mak t wifes medicine here and now and quick while i wait and watch thee or else happen thou might need some medicine thysel before all is over  i shouldnt advise you to fasten a quarrel upon me montgomery was speaking in the hard staccato voice of a man who is holding himself in with difficulty youll save trouble if youll go quietly if you dont youll be hurt ah you would take it then  the blows were almost simultaneousa savage swing which whistled past montgomerys ear and a straight drive which took the workman on the chin luck was with the assistant that single whizzing uppercut and the way in which it was delivered warned him that he had a formidable man to deal with but if he had underrated his antagonist his antagonist had also underrated him and had laid himself open to a fatal blow  the miners head had come with a crash against the corner of the surgery shelves and he had dropped heavily onto the ground there he lay with his bandy legs drawn up and his hands thrown abroad the blood trickling over the surgery tiles  had enough asked the assistant breathing fiercely through his nose  but no answer came the man was insensible and then the danger of his position came upon montgomery and he turned as white as his antagonist a sunday the immaculate dr oldacre with his pious connection a savage brawl with a patient he would irretrievably lose his situation if the facts came out it was not much of a situation but he could not get another without a reference and oldacre might refuse him one without money for his classes and without a situationwhat was to become of him it was absolute ruin  but perhaps he could escape exposure after all he seized his insensible adversary dragged him out into the centre of the room loosened his collar and squeezed the surgery sponge over his face he sat up at last with a gasp and a scowl  domn thee thous spoilt my necktie said he mopping up the water from his breast  im sorry i hit you so hard said montgomery apologetically  thou hit me hard i could stan such flyflappin all day twas this here press that cracked my pate for me and thou art a looky man to be able to boast as thou hast outed me and now id be obliged to thee if thou wilt give me t wifes medicine  montgomery gladly made it up and handed it to the miner  you are weak still said he wont you stay awhile and rest  t wife wants her medicine said the man and lurched out at the door  the assistant looking after him saw him rolling with an uncertain step down the street until a friend met him and they walked on arminarm the man seemed in his rough northern fashion to bear no grudge and so montgomerys fears left him there was no reason why the doctor should know anything about it he wiped the blood from the floor put the surgery in order and went on with his interrupted task hoping that he had come scathless out of a very dangerous business  yet all day he was aware of a sense of vague uneasiness which sharpened into dismay when late in the afternoon he was informed that three gentlemen had called and were waiting for him in the surgery a coroners inquest a descent of detectives an invasion of angry relativesall sorts of possibilities rose to scare him with tense nerves and a rigid face he went to meet his visitors  they were a very singular trio each was known to him by sight but what on earth the three could be doing together and above all what they could expect from him was a most inexplicable problem  the first was sorley wilson the son of the owner of the nonpareil coalpit he was a young blood of twenty heir to a fortune a keen sportsman and down for the easter vacation from magdalene college he sat now upon the edge of the surgery table looking in thoughtful silence at montgomery and twisting the ends of his small black waxed moustache  the second was purvis the publican owner of the chief beershop and well known as the local bookmaker he was a coarse cleanshaven man whose fiery face made a singular contrast with his ivorywhite bald head he had shrewd lightblue eyes with foxy lashes and he also leaned forward in silence from his chair a fat red hand upon either knee and stared critically at the young assistant  so did the third visitor fawcett the horsebreaker who leaned back his long thin legs with their boxcloth ridinggaiters thrust out in front of him tapping his protruding teeth with his ridingwhip with anxious thought in every line of his rugged bony face publican exquisite and horsebreaker were all three equally silent equally earnest and equally critical montgomery seated in the midst of them looked from one to the other  well gentlemen he observed but no answer came  the position was embarrassing  no said the horsebreaker at last no its off its nowt  stand oop lad lets see thee standin it was the publican who spoke  montgomery obeyed he would learn all about it no doubt if he were patient he stood up and turned slowly round as if in front of his tailor  its off its off cried the horsebreaker why mon the master would break him over his knee  oh that behanged for a yarn said the young cantab you can drop out if you like fawcett but ill see this thing through if i have to do it alone i dont hedge a penny i like the cut of him a great deal better than i liked ted barton  look at bartons shoulders mr wilson  lumpiness isnt always strength give me nerve and fire and breed thats what wins  ay sir you have it theeryou have it theer said the fat redfaced publican in a thick suety voice its the same wi poops get em cleanbred an fine and theyll yark the thick unsyark em out o their skins  hes ten good pund on the light side growled the horsebreaker  hes a welter weight anyhow  a hundred and thirty  a hundred and fifty if hes an ounce  well the master doesnt scale much more than that  a hundred and seventyfive  that was when he was hogfat and living high work the grease out of him and i lay theres no great difference between them have you been weighed lately mr montgomery  it was the first direct question which had been asked him he had stood in the midst of them like a horse at a fair and he was just beginning to wonder whether he was more angry or amused  i am just eleven stone said he  i said that he was a welter weight  but suppose you was trained said the publican wot then  i am always in training  in a manner of speakin do doubt he is always in trainin remarked the horsebreaker but trainin for everyday work aint the same as trainin with a trainer and i dare bet with all respec to your opinion mr wilson that theres half a stone of tallow on him at this minute  the young cantab put his fingers on the assistants upper arm then with his other hand on his wrist he bent the forearm sharply and felt the biceps as round and hard as a cricketball spring up under his fingers  feel that said he  the publican and horsebreaker felt it with an air of reverence  good lad hell do yet cried purvis  gentlemen said montgomery i think that you will acknowledge that i have been very patient with you i have listened to all that you have to say about my personal appearance and now i must really beg that you will have the goodness to tell me what is the matter  they all sat down in their serious businesslike way  thats easy done mr montgomery said the fatvoiced publican but before sayin anything we had to wait and see whether in a way of speakin there was any need for us to say anything at all mr wilson thinks there is mr fawcett who has the same right to his opinion bein also a backer and one o the committee thinks the other way  i thought him too light built and i think so now said the horsebreaker still tapping his prominent teeth with the metal head of his ridingwhip but happen he may pull through and hes a finemade buirdly young chap so if you mean to back him mr wilson  which i do  and you purvis  i aint one to go back fawcett  well ill stan to my share of the purse  and well i knew you would said purvis for it would be somethin new to find isaac fawcett as a spoilsport well then we make up the hundred for the stake among us and the fight standsalways supposin the young man is willin  excuse all this rot mr montgomery said the university man in a genial voice weve begun at the wrong end i know but well soon straighten it out and i hope that you will see your way to falling in with our views in the first place you remember the man whom you knocked out this morning he is bartonthe famous ted barton  im sure sir you may well be proud to have outed him in one round said the publican why it took morris the tenstonesix champion a deal more trouble than that before he put barton to sleep youve done a fine performance sir and happen youll do a finer if you give yourself the chance  i never heard of ted barton beyond seeing the name on a medicine label said the assistant  well you may take it from me that hes a slaughterer said the horsebreaker youve taught him a lesson that he needed for it was always a word and a blow with him and the word alone was worth five shillin in a public court he wont be so ready now to shake his nief in the face of everyone he meets however thats neither here nor there  montgomery looked at them in bewilderment  for goodness sake gentlemen tell me what it is you want me to do he cried  we want you to fight silas craggs better known as the master of croxley  but why  because ted barton was to have fought him next saturday he was the champion of the wilson coalpits and the other was the master of the ironfolk down at the croxley smelters wed matched our man for a purse of a hundred against the master but youve queered our man and he cant face such a battle with a twoinch cut at the back of his head theres only one thing to be done sir and that is for you to take his place if you can lick ted barton you may lick the master of croxley but if you dont were done for theres no one else who is in the same street with him in this district its twenty rounds twoounce gloves queensberry rules and a decision on points if you fight to the finish  for a moment the absurdity of the thing drove every other thought out of montgomerys head but then there came a sudden revulsion a hundred poundsall he wanted to complete his education was lying there ready to his hand if only that hand were strong enough to pick it up he had thought bitterly that morning that there was no market for his strength but here was one where his muscle might earn more in an hour than his brains in a year but a chill of doubt came over him  how can i fight for the coalpits said he i am not connected with them  eh lad but thou art cried old purvis weve got it down in writin and its clear enough any one connected with the coalpits doctor oldacre is the coalpit club doctor thou art his assistant what more can they want  yes thats right enough said the cantab it would be a very sporting thing of you mr montgomery if you would come to our help when we are in such a hole of course you might not like to take the hundred pounds but i have no doubt that in the case of your winning we could arrange that it should take the form of a watch or piece of plate or any other shape which might suggest itself to you you see you are responsible for our having lost our champion so we really feel that we have a claim upon you  give me a moment gentlemen it is very unexpected i am afraid the doctor would never consent to my goingin fact i am sure that he would not  but he need never knownot before the fight at any rate we are not bound to give the name of our man so long as he is within the weight limits on the day of the fight that is all that concerns any one  the adventure and the profit would either of them have attracted montgomery the two combined were irresistible  gentlemen said he ill do it  the three sprang from their seats the publican had seized his right hand the horsedealer his left and the cantab slapped him on the back  good lad good lad croaked the publican eh mon but if thou yark him thoull rise in one day from being just a common doctor to the bestknown mon twixt here and bradford thou art a witherin tyke thou art and no mistake and if thou beat the master of croxley thoull find all the beer thou want for the rest of thy life waiting for thee at the four sacks  it is the most sporting thing i ever heard of in my life said young wilson by george sir if you pull it off youve got the constituency in your pocket if you care to stand you know the outhouse in my garden  next the road  exactly i turned it into a gymnasium for ted barton youll find all you want there clubs punching ball bars dumbbells everything then youll want a sparring partner ogilvy has been acting for barton but we dont think that he is class enough barton bears you no grudge hes a goodhearted fellow though crossgrained with strangers he looked upon you as a stranger this morning but he says he knows you now he is quite ready to spar with you for practice and he will come at any hour you will name  thank you i will let you know the hour said montgomery and so the committee departed jubilant upon their way  the medical assistant sat for a little time in the surgery turning it over in his mind he had been trained originally at the university by the man who had been middleweight champion in his day it was true that his teacher was long past his prime slow upon his feet and stiff in his joints but even so he was still a tough antagonist but montgomery had found at last that he could more than hold his own with him he had won the university medal and his teacher who had trained so many students was emphatic in his opinion that he had never had one who was in the same class with him he had been exhorted to go in for the amateur championships but he had no particular ambition in that direction once he had put on the gloves with hammer tunstall in a booth at a fair and had fought three rattling rounds in which he had the worst of it but had made the prizefighter stretch himself to the uttermost there was his whole record and was it enough to encourage him to stand up to the master of croxley he had never heard of the master before but then he had lost touch of the ring during the last few years of hard work after all what did it matter if he won there was the money which meant so much to him if he lost it would only mean a thrashing he could take punishment without flinching of that he was certain if there were only one chance in a hundred of pulling it off then it was worth his while to attempt it  dr oldacre new come from church with an ostentatious prayerbook in his kidgloved hand broke in upon his meditation  you dont go to service i observe mr montgomery said he coldly  no sir i have had some business to detain me  it is very near to my heart that my household should set a good example there are so few educated people in this district that a great responsibility devolves upon us if we do not live up to the highest how can we expect these poor workers to do so it is a dreadful thing to reflect that the parish takes a great deal more interest in an approaching glovefight than in their religious duties  a glovefight sir said montgomery guiltily  i believe that to be the correct term one of my patients tells me that it is the talk of the district a local ruffian a patient of ours by the way is matched against a pugilist over at croxley i cannot understand why the law does not step in and stop so degrading an exhibition it is really a prizefight  a glove fight you said  i am informed that a twoounce glove is an evasion by which they dodge the law and make it difficult for the police to interfere they contend for a sum of money it seems dreadful and almost incredibledoes it notto think that such scenes can be enacted within a few miles of our peaceful home but you will realize mr montgomery that while there are such influences for us to counteract it is very necessary that we should live up to our highest  the doctors sermon would have had more effect if the assistant had not once or twice had occasion to test his highest and come upon it at unexpectedly humble elevations it is always so particularly easy to compound for sins were most inclined to by damning those we have no mind to in any case montgomery felt that of all the men concerned in such a fightpromoters backers spectatorsit is the actual fighter who holds the strongest and most honourable position his conscience gave him no concern upon the subject endurance and courage are virtues not vices and brutality is at least better than effeminacy  there was a little tobaccoshop at the corner of the street where montgomery got his birdseye and also his local information for the shopman was a garrulous soul who knew everything about the affairs of the district the assistant strolled down there after tea and asked in a casual way whether the tobacconist had ever heard of the master of croxley  heard of him heard of him the little man could hardly articulate in his astonishment why sir hes the first mon o the district an his names as well known in the west riding as the winner o t derby but lor sirhere he stopped and rummaged among a heap of papers they are makin a fuss about him on account o his fight wi ted barton and so the croxley herald has his life an record an here it is an thou canst read it for thysel  the sheet of the paper which he held up was a lake of print around an islet of illustration the latter was a coarse woodcut of a pugilists head and neck set in a crossbarred jersey it was a sinister but powerful face the face of a debauched hero cleanshaven strongly eyebrowed keeneyed with a huge aggressive jaw and an animal dewlap beneath it the long obstinate cheeks ran flush up to the narrow sinister eyes the mighty neck came down square from the ears and curved outwards into shoulders which had lost nothing at the hands of the local artist above was written silas craggs and beneath the master of croxley  thoull find all about him there sir said the tobacconist hes a witherin tyke he is and were proud to have him in the county if he hadnt broke his leg hed have been champion of england  broke his leg has he  yes and it set badly they ca him owd k behind his bock for thot is how his two legs look but his armswell if they was both stropped to a bench as the sayin is i wonder where the champion of england would be then  ill take this with me said montgomery and putting the paper into his pocket he returned home  it was not a cheering record which he read there the whole history of the croxley master was given in full his many victories his few defeats  born in 1857 said the provincial biographer silas craggs better known in sporting circles as the master of croxley is now in his fortieth year  hang it im only twentythree said montgomery to himself and read on more cheerfully  having in his youth shown a surprising aptitude for the game he fought his way up among his comrades until he became the recognized champion of the district and won the proud title which he still holds ambitious of a more than local fame he secured a patron and fought his first fight against jack barton of birmingham in may 1880 at the old loiterers club craggs who fought at tenstonetwo at the time had the better of fifteen rattling rounds and gained an award on points against the midlander having disposed of james dunn of rotherhithe cameron of glasgow and a youth named fernie he was thought so highly of by the fancy that he was matched against ernest willox at that time middleweight champion of the north of england and defeated him in a hardfought battle knocking him out in the tenth round after a punishing contest at this period it looked as if the very highest honours of the ring were within the reach of the young yorkshireman but he was laid upon the shelf by a most unfortunate accident the kick of a horse broke his thigh and for a year he was compelled to rest himself when he returned to his work the fracture had set badly and his activity was much impaired it was owing to this that he was defeated in seven rounds by willox the man whom he had previously beaten and afterwards by james shaw of london though the latter acknowledged that he had found the toughest customer of his career undismayed by his reverses the master adapted the style of his fighting to his physical disabilities and resumed his career of victorydefeating norton the black bobby wilson and levy cohen the latter a heavyweight conceding two stone he fought a draw with the famous billy mcquire and afterwards for a purse of fifty pounds he defeated sam hare at the pelican club london in 1891 a decision was given against him upon a foul when fighting a winning fight against jim taylor the australian middleweight and so mortified was he by the decision that he withdrew from the ring since then he has hardly fought at all save to accommodate any local aspirant who may wish to learn the difference between a barroom scramble and a scientific contest the latest of these ambitious souls comes from the wilson coalpits which have undertaken to put up a stake of £100 and back their local champion there are various rumours afloat as to who their representative is to be the name of ted barton being freely mentioned but the betting which is seven to one on the master against any untried man is a fair reflection of the feeling of the community  montgomery read it over twice and it left him with a very serious face no light matter this which he had undertaken no battle with a roughandtumble fighter who presumed upon a local reputation the mans record showed that he was firstclassor nearly so there were a few points in his favour and he must make the most of them there was agetwentythree against forty there was an old ring proverb that youth will be served but the annals of the ring offer a great number of exceptions a hard veteran full of cool valour and ringcraft could give ten or fifteen years and a beating to most striplings he could not rely too much upon his advantage in age but then there was the lameness that must surely count for a great deal and lastly there was the chance that the master might underrate his opponent that he might be remiss in his training and refuse to abandon his usual way of life if he thought that he had an easy task before him in a man of his age and habits this seemed very possible montgomery prayed that it might be so meanwhile if his opponent were the best man who ever jumped the ropes into a ring his own duty was clear he must prepare himself carefully throw away no chance and do the very best that he could but he knew enough to appreciate the difference which exists in boxing as in every sport between the amateur and the professional the coolness the power of hitting above all the capability of taking punishment count for so much those specially developed guttaperchalike abdominal muscles of the hardened pugilist will take without flinching a blow which would leave another man writhing on the ground such things are not to be acquired in a week but all that could be done in a week should be done  the medical assistant had a good basis to start from he was 5 feet 11 inchestall enough for anything on two legs as the old ring men used to saylithe and spare with the activity of a panther and a strength which had hardly yet ever found its limitations his muscular development was finely hard but his power came rather from that higher nerveenergy which counts for nothing upon a measuring tape he had the wellcurved nose and the widelyopened eye which never yet were seen upon the face of a craven and behind everything he had the driving force which came from the knowledge that his whole career was at stake upon the contest the three backers rubbed their hands when they saw him at work punching the ball in the gymnasium next morning and fawcett the horsebreaker who had written to leeds to hedge his bets sent a wire to cancel the letter and to lay another fifty at the market price of seven to one  montgomerys chief difficulty was to find time for his training without any interference from the doctor his work took him a large part of the day but as the visiting was done on foot and considerable distances had to be traversed it was a training in itself for the rest he punched the swinging ball and worked with the dumbbells for an hour every morning and evening and boxed twice a day with ted barton in the gymnasium gaining as much profit as could be got from a rushing twohanded slogger barton was full of admiration for his cleverness and quickness but doubtful about his strength hard hitting was the feature of his own style and he exacted it from others  lord sir thats a turble poor poonch for an elevenstone man he would cry thou wilt have to hit harder than that afore t master will know that thou art theer ah thots better mon thots fine he would add as his opponent lifted him across the room on the end of a right counter thots how i likes to feel em happen thoult pull through yet he chuckled with joy when montgomery knocked him into a corner eh mon thou art comin along grand thou hast fair yarked me off my legs do it again lad do it again  the only part of montgomerys training which came within the doctors observation was his diet and that puzzled him considerably  you will excuse my remarking mr montgomery that you are becoming rather particular in your tastes such fads are not to be encouraged in ones youth why do you eat toast with every meal  i find that it suits me better than bread sir  it entails unnecessary work upon the cook i observe also that you have turned against potatoes  yes sir i think that i am better without them  and you no longer drink your beer  no sir  these causeless whims and fancies are very much to be deprecated mr montgomery consider how many there are to whom these very potatoes and this very beer would be most acceptable  no doubt sir but at present i prefer to do without them  they were sitting alone at lunch and the assistant thought that it would be a good opportunity of asking leave for the day of the fight  i should be glad if you could let me have leave for saturday doctor oldacre  it is very inconvenient upon so busy a day  i should do a double days work on friday so as to leave everything in order i should hope to be back in the evening  i am afraid i cannot spare you mr montgomery  this was a facer if he could not get leave he would go without it  you will remember doctor oldacre that when i came to you it was understood that i should have a clear day every month i have never claimed one but now there are reasons why i wish to have a holiday upon saturday  doctor oldacre gave in with a very bad grace  of course if you insist upon your formal rights there is no more to be said mr montgomery though i feel that it shows a certain indifference to my comfort and the welfare of the practice do you still insist  yes sir  very good have your way  the doctor was boiling over with anger but montgomery was a valuable assistantsteady capable and hardworkingand he could not afford to lose him even if he had been prompted to advance those class fees for which his assistant had appealed it would have been against his interests to do so for he did not wish him to qualify and he desired him to remain in his subordinate position in which he worked so hard for so small a wage there was something in the cool insistence of the young man a quiet resolution in his voice as he claimed his saturday which aroused his curiosity  i have no desire to interfere unduly with your affairs mr montgomery but were you thinking of having a day in leeds upon saturday  no sir  in the country  yes sir  you are very wise you will find a quiet day among the wild flowers a very valuable restorative had you thought of any particular direction  i am going over croxley way  well there is no prettier country when once you are past the ironworks what could be more delightful than to lie upon the fells basking in the sunshine with perhaps some instructive and elevating book as your companion i should recommend a visit to the ruins of st bridgets church a very interesting relic of the early norman era by the way there is one objection which i see to your going to croxley on saturday it is upon that date as i am informed that that ruffianly glovefight takes place you may find yourself molested by the blackguards whom it will attract  i will take my chance of that sir said the assistant  on the friday night which was the last before the fight montgomerys three backers assembled in the gymnasium and inspected their man as he went through some light exercises to keep his muscles supple he was certainly in splendid condition his skin shining with health and his eyes with energy and confidence the three walked round him and exulted  hes simply ripping said the undergraduate by gad youve come out of it splendidly youre as hard as a pebble and fit to fight for your life  happen hes a trifle on the fine side said the publican runs a bit light at the loins to my way of thinkin  what weight today  ten stone eleven the assistant answered  thats only three pund off in a weeks trainin said the horsebreaker he said right when he said that he was in condition well its fine stuff all there is of it but im none so sure as there is enough he kept poking his finger into montgomery as if he were one of his horses i hear that the master will scale a hundred and sixty odd at the ringside  but theres some of that which hed like well to pull off and leave behind wi his shirt said purvis i hear theyve had a rare job to get him to drop his beer and if it had not been for that great redheaded wench of his theyd never ha done it she fair scratted the face off a potman that had brought him a gallon from t chequers they say the hussy is his sparrin partner as well as his sweetheart and that his poor wife is just breakin her heart over it hullo young un what do you want  the door of the gymnasium had opened and a lad about sixteen grimy and black with soot and iron stepped into the yellow glare of the oillamp ted barton seized him by the collar  see here thou yoong whelp this is private and we want noan o thy spyin  but i maun speak to mr wilson  the young cantab stepped forward  well my lad what is it  its aboot t fight mr wilson sir i wanted to tell your mon somethin aboot t maister  weve no time to listen to gossip my boy we know all about the master  but thou doant sir nobody knows but me and mother and we thought as wed like thy mon to know sir for we want him to fair bray him  oh you want the master fair brayed do you so do we well what

for hate said the boy and darted off into the darkness  seems to me t redheaded wench may do him more harm than good after all remarked the publican and now mr montgomery sir youve done enough for this evenin an a nine hours sleep is the best trainin before a battle happen this time tomorrow night youll be safe back again with your £100 in your pocket     ii   work was struck at one oclock at the coalpits and the ironworks and the fight was arranged for three from the croxley furnaces from wilsons coalpits from the heartsease mine from the dodd mills from the leverworth smelters the workmen came trooping each with his foxterrier or his lurcher at his heels warped with labour and twisted by toil bent double by weeklong work in the cramped coal galleries or halfblinded with years spent in front of whitehot fluid metal these men still gilded their harsh and hopeless lives by their devotion to sport it was their one relief the only thing which could distract their mind from sordid surroundings and give them an interest beyond the blackened circle which inclosed them literature art science all these things were beyond the horizon but the race the football match the cricket the fight these were things which they could understand which they could speculate upon in advance and comment upon afterwards sometimes brutal sometimes grotesque the love of sport is still one of the great agencies which make for the happiness of our people it lies very deeply in the springs of our nature and when it has been educated out a higher more refined nature may be left but it will not be of that robust british type which has left its mark so deeply on the world every one of these ruddled workers slouching with his dog at his heels to see something of the fight was a true unit of his race  it was a squally may day with bright sunbursts and driving showers montgomery worked all morning in the surgery getting his medicine made up  the weather seems so very unsettled mr montgomery remarked the doctor that i am inclined to think that you had better postpone your little country excursion until a later date  i am afraid that i must go today sir  i have just had an intimation that mrs potter at the other side of angleton wishes to see me it is probable that i shall be there all day it will be extremely inconvenient to leave the house empty so long  i am very sorry sir but i must go said the assistant doggedly  the doctor saw that it would be useless to argue and departed in the worst of bad tempers upon his mission montgomery felt easier now that he was gone he went up to his room and packed his runningshoes his fightingdrawers and his cricketsash into a handbag when he came down mr wilson was waiting for him in the surgery  i hear the doctor has gone  yes he is likely to be away all day  i dont see that it matters much its bound to come to his ears by tonight  yes its serious with me mr wilson if i win its all right i dont mind telling you that the hundred pounds will make all the difference to me but if i lose i shall lose my situation for as you say i cant keep it secret  never mind well see you through among us i only wonder the doctor has not heard for its all over the country that you are to fight the croxley champion weve had armitage up about it already hes the masters backer you know he wasnt sure that you were eligible the master said he wanted you whether you were eligible or not armitage has money on and would have made trouble if he could but i showed him that you came within the conditions of the challenge and he agreed that it was all right they think they have a soft thing on  well i can only do my best said montgomery  they lunched together a silent and rather nervous repast for montgomerys mind was full of what was before him and wilson had himself more money at stake than he cared to lose  wilsons carriage and pair were at the door the horses with blueandwhite rosettes at their ears which were the colours of the wilson coalpits well known on many a football field at the avenue gate a crowd of some hundred pitmen and their wives gave a cheer as the carriage passed to the assistant it all seemed dreamlike and extraordinarythe strangest experience of his life but with a thrill of human action and interest in it which made it passionately absorbing he lay back in the open carriage and saw the fluttering handkerchiefs from the doors and windows of the miners cottages wilson had pinned a blueandwhite rosette upon his coat and every one knew him as their champion good luck sir good luck to thee they shouted from the roadside he felt that it was like some unromantic knight riding down to sordid lists but there was something of chivalry in it all the same he fought for others as well as for himself he might fail from want of skill or strength but deep in his sombre soul he vowed that it should never be for want of heart  mr fawcett was just mounting into his highwheeled spidery dogcart with his little bit of blood between the shafts he waved his whip and fell in behind the carriage they overtook purvis the tomatofaced publican upon the road with his wife in her sunday bonnet they also dropped into the procession and then as they traversed the seven miles of the highroad to croxley their twohorsed rosetted carriage became gradually the nucleus of a comet with a loosely radiating tail from every sideroad came the miners carts the humble ramshackle traps black and bulging with their loads of noisy foultongued openhearted partisans they trailed for a long quarter of a mile behind themcracking whipping shouting galloping swearing horsemen and runners were mixed with the vehicles and then suddenly a squad of the sheffield yeomanry who were having their annual training in those parts clattered and jingled out of a field and rode as an escort to the carriage through the dustclouds round him montgomery saw the gleaming brass helmets the bright coats and the tossing heads of the chargers the delighted brown faces of the troopers it was more dreamlike than ever  and then as they approached the monstrous uncouth line of bottleshaped buildings which marked the smeltingworks of croxley their long writhing snake of dust was headed off by another but longer one which wound across their path the mainroad into which their own opened was filled by the rushing current of traps the wilson contingent halted until the others should get past the ironmen cheered and groaned according to their humour as they whirled past their antagonist rough chaff flew back and forwards like iron nuts and splinters of coal brought him up then got t hearse for to fetch him back wheres t owd klegs mon mon have thy photograph tooktwill mind thee of what thou used to look he fighthes nowt but a halfbaked doctor happen hell doctor thy croxley champion afore hes through wit  so they flashed at each other as the one side waited and the other passed then there came a rolling murmur swelling into a shout and a great break with four horses came clattering along all streaming with salmonpink ribbons the driver wore a white hat with pink rosette and beside him on the high seat were a man and a womanshe with her arm round his waist montgomery had one glimpse of them as they flashed past he with a furry cap drawn low over his brow a great frieze coat and a pink comforter round his throat she brazen redheaded brightcoloured laughing excitedly the master for it was he turned as he passed gazed hard at montgomery and gave him a menacing gaptoothed grin it was a hard wicked face bluejowled and craggy with long obstinate cheeks and inexorable eyes the break behind was full of patrons of the sportflushed ironforemen heads of departments managers one was drinking from a metal flask and raised it to montgomery as he passed and then the crowd thinned and the wilson cortège with their dragoons swept in at the rear of the others  the road led away from croxley between curving green hills gashed and polluted by the searchers for coal and iron the whole country had been gutted and vast piles of refuse and mountains of slag suggested the mighty chambers which the labor of man had burrowed beneath on the left the road curved up to where a huge building roofless and dismantled stood crumbling and forlorn with the light shining through the windowless squares  thats the old arrowsmiths factory thats where the fight is to be said wilson how are you feeling now  thank you i was never better in my life montgomery answered  by gad i like your nerve said wilson who was himself flushed and uneasy youll give us a fight for our money come what may that place on the right is the office and that has been set aside as the dressing and weighingroom  the carriage drove up to it amidst the shouts of the folk upon the hillside lines of empty carriages and traps curved down upon the winding road and a black crowd surged round the door of the ruined factory the seats as a huge placard announced were five shillings three shillings and a shilling with halfprice for dogs the takings deducting expenses were to go to the winner and it was already evident that a larger stake than a hundred pounds was in question a babel of voices rose from the door the workers wished to bring their dogs in free the men scuffled the dogs barked the crowd was a whirling eddying pool surging with a roar up to the narrow cleft which was its only outlet  the break with its salmoncoloured streamers and four reeking horses stood empty before the door of the office wilson purvis fawcett and montgomery passed in  there was a large bare room inside with square clean patches upon the grimy walls where pictures and almanacs had once hung worn linoleum covered the floor but there was no furniture save some benches and a deal table with a ewer and a basin upon it two of the corners were curtained off in the middle of the room was a weighingchair a hugely fat man with a salmon tie and a blue waistcoat with birdseye spots came bustling up to them it was armitage the butcher and grazier well known for miles round as a warm man and the most liberal patron of sport in the riding  well well he grunted in a thick fussy wheezy voice you have come then got your man got your man  here he is fit and well mr montgomery let me present you to mr armitage  glad to meet you sir happy to make your acquaintance i make bold to say sir that we of croxley admire your courage mr montgomery and that our only hope is a fair fight and no favour and the best man win thats our sentiment at croxley  and it is my sentiment also said the assistant  well you cant say fairer than that mr montgomery youve taken a large contrac in hand but a large contrac may be carried through sir as any one that knows my dealings could testify the master is ready to weigh in  so am i  you must weigh in the buff  montgomery looked askance at the tall redheaded woman who was standing gazing out of the window  thats all right said wilson get behind the curtain and put on your fightingkit  he did so and came out the picture of an athlete in white loose drawers canvas shoes and the sash of a wellknown cricket club round his waist he was trained to a hair his skin gleaming like silk and every muscle rippling down his broad shoulders and along his beautiful arms as he moved them they bunched into ivory knobs or slid into long sinuous curves as he raised or lowered his hands  what thinkest thou o that asked ted barton his second of the woman in the window  she glanced contemptuously at the young athlete  its but a poor kindness thou dost him to put a threadpaper yoong gentleman like yon against a mon as is a mon why my jock would throttle him wi one hond lashed behind him  happen he mayhappen not said barton i have but twa pund in the world but its on him every penny and no hedgin but heres t maister and rarely fine he do look  the prizefighter had come out from his curtain a squat formidable figure monstrous in chest and arms limping slightly on his distorted leg his skin had none of the freshness and clearness of montgomerys but was dusky and mottled with one huge mole amid the mat of tangled black hair which thatched his mighty breast his weight bore no relation to his strength for those huge shoulders and great arms with brown sledgehammer fists would have fitted the heaviest man that ever threw his cap into a ring but his loins and legs were slight in proportion montgomery on the other hand was as symmetrical as a greek statue it would be an encounter between a man who was specially fitted for one sport and one who was equally capable of any the two looked curiously at each other a bulldog and a highbred cleanlimbed terrier each full of spirit  how do you do  how do the master grinned again and his three jagged front teeth gleamed for an instant the rest had been beaten out of him in twenty years of battle he spat upon the floor we have a rare fine day fort  capital said montgomery  thats the good feelin i like wheezed the fat butcher good lads both of themprime ladshard meat an good bone theres no illfeelin  if he downs me gawd bless him said the master  an if we down him gawd help him interrupted the woman  haud thy tongue wench said the master impatiently who art thou to put in thy word happen i might draw my hand across thy face  the woman did not take the threat amiss  wilt have enough for thy hand to do jock said she get quit o this gradely man afore thou turn on me  the lovers quarrel was interrupted by the entrance of a new comer a gentleman with a furcollared overcoat and a very shiny tophata tophat of a degree of glossiness which is seldom seen five miles from hyde park this hat he wore at the extreme back of his head so that the lower surface of the brim made a kind of frame for his high bald forehead his keen eyes his rugged and yet kindly face he bustled in with the quiet air of possession with which the ringmaster enters the circus  its mr stapleton the referee from london said wilson  how do you do mr stapleton i was introduced to you at the big fight at the corinthian club in piccadilly  ah i dare say said the other shaking hands fact is im introduced to so many that i cant undertake to carry their names wilson is it well mr wilson glad to see you couldnt get a fly at the station and thats why im late  im sure sir said armitage we should be proud that any one so well known in the boxing world should come down to our little exhibition  not at all not at all anything in the interests of boxin all ready men weighed  weighing now sir  ah just as well i should see it done seen you before craggs saw you fight your second battle against willox you had beaten him once but he came back on you what does the indicator sayone hundred and sixtythree poundstwo off for the kitone hundred and sixtyone now my lad you jump my goodness what colours are you wearing  the anonymi cricket club  what right have you to wear them i belong to the club myself  so do i  you an amateur  yes sir  and you are fighting for a money prize  yes  i suppose you know what you are doing you realize that youre a professional pug from this onwards and that if ever you fight again  ill never fight again  happen you wont said the woman and the master turned a terrible eye upon her  well i suppose you know your own business best up you jump one hundred and fiftyone minus two one hundred and fortyninetwelve pounds difference but youth and condition on the other scale well the sooner we get to work the better for i wish to catch the seven oclock express at hellifield twenty threeminute rounds with oneminute intervals and queensberry rules those are the conditions are they not  yes sir  very good then we may go across  the two combatants had overcoats thrown over their shoulders and the whole party backers fighters seconds and the referee filed out of the room a police inspector was waiting for them in the road he had a notebook in his handthat terrible weapon which awes even the london cabman  i must take your names gentlemen in case it should be necessary to proceed for breach of peace  you dont mean to stop the fight cried armitage in a passion of indignation im mr armitage of croxley and this is mr wilson and well be responsible that all is fair and as it should be  ill take the names in case it should be necessary to proceed said the inspector impassively  but you know me well  if you was a dook or even a judge it would be all the same said the inspector its the law and theres an end ill not take upon myself to stop the fight seeing that gloves are to be used but ill take the names of all concerned silas craggs robert montgomery edward barton james stapleton of london who seconds silas craggs  i do said the woman yes you can stare but its my job and no one elses anastasias the namefour as  craggs  johnson anastasia johnson if you jug him you can jug me  who talked of juggin ye fool growled the master coom on mr armitage for im fair sick o this loiterin  the inspector fell in with the procession and proceeded as they walked up the hill to bargain in his official capacity for a front seat where he could safeguard the interests of the law and in his private capacity to lay out thirty shillings at seven to one with mr armitage through the door they passed down a narrow lane walled with a dense bank of humanity up a wooden ladder to a platform over a rope which was slung waisthigh from four cornerstakes and then montgomery realized that he was in that ring in which his immediate destiny was to be worked out on the stake at one corner there hung a blueandwhite streamer barton led him across the overcoat dangling loosely from his shoulders and he sat down on a wooden stool barton and another man both wearing white sweaters stood beside him the socalled ring was a square twenty feet each way at the opposite angle was the sinister figure of the master with his redheaded woman and a roughfaced friend to look after him at each corner were metal basins pitchers of water and sponges  during the hubbub and uproar of the entrance montgomery was too bewildered to take things in but now there was a few minutes delay for the referee had lingered behind and so he looked quietly about him it was a sight to haunt him for a lifetime wooden seats had been built in sloping upwards to the tops of the walls above instead of a ceiling a great flight of crows passed slowly across a square of grey cloud right up to the topmost benches the folk were bankedbroadcloth in front corduroys and fustian behind faces turned everywhere upon him the grey reek of the pipes filled the building and the air was pungent with the acrid smell of cheap strong tobacco everywhere among the human faces were to be seen the heads of the dogs they growled and yapped from the back benches in that dense mass of humanity one could hardly pick out individuals but montgomerys eyes caught the brazen gleam of the helmets held upon the knees of the ten yeomen of his escort at the very edge of the platform sat the reporters five of them three locals and two all the way from london but where was the allimportant referee there was no sign of him unless he were in the centre of that angry swirl of men near the door  mr stapleton had stopped to examine the gloves which were to be used and entered the building after the combatants he had started to come down that narrow lane with the human walls which led to the ring but already it had gone abroad that the wilson champion was a gentleman and that another gentleman had been appointed as referee a wave of suspicion passed through the croxley folk they would have one of their own people for a referee they would not have a stranger his path was stopped as he made for the ring excited men flung themselves in front of him they waved their fists in his face and cursed him a woman howled vile names in his ear somebody struck at him with an umbrella go thou back to lunnon we want noan o thee go thou back they yelled  stapleton with his shiny hat cocked backwards and his large bulging forehead swelling from under it looked round him from beneath his bushy brows he was in the centre of a savage and dangerous mob then he drew his watch from his pocket and held it dial upwards in his palm  in three minutes said he i will declare the fight off  they raged round him his cool face and that aggressive tophat irritated them grimy hands were raised but it was difficult somehow to strike a man who was so absolutely indifferent  in two minutes i declare the fight off  they exploded into blasphemy the breath of angry men smoked into his placid face a gnarled grimy fist vibrated at the end of his nose we tell thee we want noan o thee get thou back where thou comst from  in one minute i declare the fight off  then the calm persistence of the man conquered the swaying mutable passionate crowd  let him through mon happen therell be no fight after a  let him through  bill thou loomp let him pass dost want the fight declared off  make room for the refereeroom for the lunnon referee  and half pushed half carried he was swept up to the ring there were two chairs by the side of it one for him and one for the timekeeper he sat down his hands on his knees his hat at a more wonderful angle than ever impassive but solemn with the aspect of one who appreciates his responsibilities  mr armitage the portly butcher made his way into the ring and held up two fat hands sparkling with rings as a signal for silence  gentlemen he yelled and then in a crescendo shriek gentlemen  and ladies cried somebody for indeed there was a fair sprinkling of women among the crowd speak up owd man shouted another what price pork chops cried somebody at the back everybody laughed and the dogs began to bark armitage waved his hands amidst the uproar as if he were conducting an orchestra at last the babel thinned into silence  gentlemen he yelled the match is between silas craggs whom we call the master of croxley and robert montgomery of the wilson coalpits the match was to be under eleveneight when they were weighed just now craggs weighed elevenseven and montgomery tennine the conditions of the contest arethe best of twenty threeminute rounds with twoounce gloves should the fight run to its full length it will of course be decided upon points mr stapleton the wellknown london referee has kindly consented to see fair play i wish to say that mr wilson and i the chief backers of the two men have every confidence in mr stapleton and that we beg that you will accept his rulings without dispute  he then turned from one combatant to the other with a wave of his hand     iii   montgomerycraggs said he  a great hush fell over the huge assembly even the dogs stopped yapping one might have thought that the monstrous room was empty the two men had stood up the small white gloves over their hands they advanced from their corners and shook hands montgomery gravely craggs with a smile then they fell into position the crowd gave a long sighthe intake of a thousand excited breaths the referee tilted his chair on to its back legs and looked moodily critical from the one to the other  it was strength against activitythat was evident from the first the master stood stolidly upon his kleg it gave him a tremendous pedestal one could hardly imagine his being knocked down and he could pivot round upon it with extraordinary quickness but his advance or retreat was ungainly his frame however was so much larger and broader than that of the student and his brown massive face looked so resolute and menacing that the hearts of the wilson party sank within them there was one heart however which had not done so it was that of robert montgomery  any nervousness which he may have had completely passed away now that he had his work before him here was something definitethis hardfaced deformed hercules to beat with a career as the price of beating him he glowed with the joy of action it thrilled through his nerves he faced his man with little inandout steps breaking to the left breaking to the right feeling his way while craggs with a dull malignant eye pivoted slowly upon his weak leg his left arm half extended his right sunk low across the mark montgomery led with his left and then led again getting lightly home each time he tried again but the master had his counter ready and montgomery reeled back from a harder blow than he had given anastasia the woman gave a shrill cry of encouragement and her man let fly his right montgomery ducked under it and in an instant the two were in each others arms  break away break away said the referee  the master struck upwards on the break and shook montgomery with the blow then it was time it had been a spirited opening round the people buzzed into comment and applause montgomery was quite fresh but the hairy chest of the master was rising and falling the man passed a sponge over his head while anastasia flapped the towel before him good lass good lass cried the crowd and cheered her  the men were up again the master grimly watchful montgomery as alert as a kitten the master tried a sudden rush squattering along with his awkward gait but coming faster than one would think the student slipped aside and avoided him the master stopped grinned and shook his head then he motioned with his hand as an invitation to montgomery to come to him the student did so and led with his left but got a swinging right counter in the ribs in exchange the heavy blow staggered him and the master came scrambling in to complete his advantage but montgomery with his greater activity kept out of danger until the call of time a tame round and the advantage with the master  t maisters too strong for him said a smelter to his neighbour  ay but tothers a likely lad happen well see some sport yet he can joomp rarely  but t maister can stop and hit rarely happen hell mak him joomp when he gets his nief upon him  they were up again the water glistening upon their faces montgomery led instantly and got his right home with a sounding smack upon the masters forehead there was a shout from the colliers and silence order from the referee montgomery avoided the counter and scored with his left fresh applause and the referee upon his feet in indignation no comments gentlemen if you please during the rounds  just bide a bit growled the master  dont talkfight said the referee angrily  montgomery rubbed in the point by a flush hit upon the mouth and the master shambled back to his corner like an angry bear having had all the worst of the round  wheres thot seven to one shouted purvis the publican ill take six to one  there were no answers  five to one there were givers at that purvis booked them in a tattered notebook  montgomery began to feel happy he lay back with his legs outstretched his back against the cornerpost and one gloved hand upon each rope what a delicious minute it was between each round if he could only keep out of harms way he must surely wear this man out before the end of twenty rounds he was so slow that all his strength went for nothing youre fightin a winnin fighta winnin fight ted barton whispered in his ear go canny tak no chances you have him proper  but the master was crafty he had fought so many battles with his maimed limb that he knew how to make the best of it warily and slowly he manoeuvred round montgomery stepping forward and yet again forward until he had imperceptibly backed him into his corner the student suddenly saw a flash of triumph upon the grim face and a gleam in the dull malignant eyes the master was upon him he sprang aside and was on the ropes the master smashed in one of his terrible uppercuts and montgomery half broke it with his guard the student sprang the other way and was against the other converging rope he was trapped in the angle the master sent in another with a hoggish grunt which spoke of the energy behind it montgomery ducked but got a jab from the left upon the mark he closed with his man break away break away cried the referee montgomery disengaged and got a swinging blow on the ear as he did so it had been a damaging round for him and the croxley people were shouting their delight  gentlemen i will not have this noise stapleton roared i have been accustomed to preside at a wellconducted club and not at a beargarden this little man with the tilted hat and the bulging forehead dominated the whole assembly he was like a headmaster among his boys he glared round him and nobody cared to meet his eye  anastasia had kissed the master when he resumed his seat good lass dot again cried the laughing crowd and the angry master shook his glove at her as she flapped her towel in front of him montgomery was weary and a little sore but not depressed he had learned something he would not again be tempted into danger  for three rounds the honours were fairly equal the students hitting was the quicker the masters the harder profiting by his lesson montgomery kept himself in the open and refused to be herded into a corner sometimes the master succeeded in rushing him to the sideropes but the younger man slipped away or closed and then disengaged the monotonous break away break away of the referee broke in upon the quick low patter of rubbersoled shoes the dull thud of the blows and the sharp hissing breath of two tired men  the ninth round found both of them in fairly good condition montgomerys head was still singing from the blow that he had in the corner and one of his thumbs pained him acutely and seemed to be dislocated the master showed no sign of a touch but his breathing was the more laboured and a long line of ticks upon the referees paper showed that the student had a good show of points but one of this ironmans blows was worth three of his and he knew that without the gloves he could not have stood for three rounds against him all the amateur work that he had done was the merest tapping and flapping when compared to those frightful blows from arms toughened by the shovel and the crowbar  it was the tenth round and the fight was half over the betting now was only three to one for the wilson champion had held his own much better than had been expected but those who knew the ringcraft as well as the staying power of the old prizefighter knew that the odds were still a long way in his favour  have a care of him whispered barton as he sent his man up to the scratch have a care hell play thee a trick if he can  but montgomery saw or imagined he saw that his antagonist was tiring he looked jaded and listless and his hands drooped a little from their position his own youth and condition were beginning to tell he sprang in and brought off a fine lefthanded lead the masters return lacked his usual fire again montgomery led and again he got home then he tried his right upon the mark and the master guarded it downwards  too low too low a foul a foul yelled a thousand voices  the referee rolled his sardonic eyes slowly round seems to me this buildin is chockfull of referees said he  the people laughed and applauded but their favour was as immaterial to him as their anger  no applause please this is not a theatre he yelled  montgomery was very pleased with himself his adversary was evidently in a bad way he was piling on his points and establishing a lead he might as well make hay while the sun shone the master was looking all abroad montgomery popped one upon his blue jowl and got away without a return and then the master suddenly dropped both his hands and began rubbing his thigh ah that was it was it he had muscular cramp  go in go in cried teddy barton  montgomery sprang wildly forward and the next instant was lying half senseless with his neck nearly broken in the middle of the ring  the whole round had been a long conspiracy to tempt him within reach of one of those terrible righthand uppercuts for which the master was famous for this the listless weary bearing for this the cramp in the thigh when montgomery had sprang in so hotly he had exposed himself to such a blow as neither flesh nor blood could stand whizzing up from below with a rigid arm which put the masters eleven stone into its force it struck him under the jaw he whirled half round and fell a helpless and halfparalyzed mass a vague groan and murmur inarticulate too excited for words rose from the great audience with open mouths and staring eyes they gazed at the twitching and quivering figure  stand back stand right back shrieked the referee for the master was standing over his man ready to give him the coupdegrâce as he rose  stand back craggs this instant stapleton repeated  the master sank his hands sulkily and walked backwards to the rope with his ferocious eyes fixed upon his fallen antagonist the timekeeper called the seconds if ten of them passed before montgomery rose to his feet the fight was ended ted barton wrung his hands and danced about in an agony in his corner  as if in a dreama terrible nightmarethe student could hear the voice of the timekeeperthreefourfivehe got up on his handsixsevenhe was on his knee sick swimming faint but resolute to rise eighthe was up and the master was on him like a tiger lashing savagely at him with both hands folk held their breath as they watched those terrible blows and anticipated the pitiful endso much more pitiful where a game but helpless man refuses to accept defeat  strangely automatic is the human brain without volition without effort there shot into the memory of this bewildered staggering halfstupefied man the one thing which could have saved himthat blind eye of which the masters son had spoken it was the same as the other to look at but montgomery remembered that he had said that it was the left he reeled to the left side half felled by a drive which lit upon his shoulder the master pivoted round upon his leg and was at him in an instant  yark him lad yark him screamed the woman  hold your tongue said the referee  montgomery slipped to the left again and yet again but the master was too quick and clever for him he struck round and got him full on the face as he tried once more to break away montgomerys knees weakened under him and he fell with a groan on the floor this time he knew that he was done with bitter agony he realized as he groped blindly with his hands that he could not possibly raise himself far away and muffled he heard amid the murmurs of the multitude the fateful voice of the timekeeper counting off the seconds  onetwothreefourfivesix  time said the referee  then the pentup passion of the great assembly broke loose croxley gave a deep groan of disappointment the wilsons were on their feet yelling with delight there was still a chance for them in four more seconds their man would have been solemnly counted out but now he had a minute in which to recover the referee looked round with relaxed features and laughing eyes he loved this rough game this school for humble heroes and it was pleasant to him to intervene as a deux ex machinâ at so dramatic a moment his chair and his hat were both tilted at an extreme angle he and the timekeeper smiled at each other ted barton and the other second had rushed out and thrust an arm each under montgomerys knee the other behind his loins and so carried him back to his stool his head lolled upon his shoulder but a douche of cold water sent a shiver through him and he started and looked round him  hes a right cried the people round hes a rare brave lad good lad good lad barton poured some brandy into his mouth the mists cleared a little and he realized where he was and what he had to do but he was still very weak and he hardly dared to hope that he could survive another round  seconds out of the ring cried the referee time  the croxley master sprang eagerly off his stool  keep clear of him go easy for a bit said barton and montgomery walked out to meet his man once more  he had had two lessonsthe one when the master got him into his corner the other when he had been lured into mixing it up with so powerful an antagonist now he would be wary another blow would finish him he could afford to run no risks the master was determined to follow up his advantage and rushed at him slogging furiously right and left but montgomery was too young and active to be caught he was strong upon his legs once more and his wits had all come back to him it was a gallant sightthe lineofbattleship trying to pour its overwhelming broadside into the frigate and the frigate manoeuvring always so as to avoid it the master tried all his ringcraft he coaxed the student up by pretended inactivity he rushed at him with furious rushes towards the ropes for three rounds he exhausted every wile in trying to get at him montgomery during all this time was conscious that his strength was minute by minute coming back to him the spinal jar from an uppercut is overwhelming but evanescent he was losing all sense of it beyond a great stiffness of the neck for the first round after his downfall he had been content to be entirely on the defensive only too happy if he could stall off the furious attacks of the master in the second he occasionally ventured upon a light counter in the third he was smacking back merrily where he saw an opening his people yelled their approval of him at the end of every round even the ironworkers cheered him with that fine unselfishness which true sport engenders to most of them unspiritual and unimaginative the sight of this cleanlimbed young apollo rising above disaster and holding on while consciousness was in him to his appointed task was the greatest thing their experience had ever known  but the masters naturally morose temper became more and more murderous at this postponement of his hopes three rounds ago the battle had been in his hands now it was all to do over again round by round his man was recovering his strength by the fifteenth he was strong again in wind and limb but the vigilant anastasia saw something which encouraged her  that bash in t ribs is telling on him jock she whispered why else should he be gulping t brandy go in lad and thou hast him yet  montgomery had suddenly taken the flask from bartons hand and had a deep pull at the contents then with his face a little flushed and with a curious look of purpose which made the referee stare hard at him in his eyes he rose for the sixteenth round  game as a pairtridge cried the publican as he looked at the hardset face  mix it oop lad mix it oop cried the ironmen to their master  and then a hum of exultation ran through their ranks as they realized that their tougher harder stronger man held the vantage after all  neither of the men showed much sign of punishment small gloves crush and numb but they do not cut one of the masters eyes was even more flush with his cheek than nature had made it montgomery had two or three livid marks upon his body and his face was haggard save for that pink spot which the brandy had brought into either cheek he rocked a little as he stood opposite his man and his hands drooped as if he felt the gloves to be an unutterable weight it was evident that he was spent and desperately weary if he received one other blow it must surely be fatal to him if he brought one home what power could there be behind it and what chance was there of its harming the colossus in front of him it was the crisis of the fight this round must decide it mix it oop lad mix it oop the ironmen whooped even the savage eyes of the referee were unable to restrain the excited crowd  now at last the chance had come for montgomery he had learned a lesson from his more experienced rival why should he not play his own game upon him he was spent but not nearly so spent as he pretended that brandy was to call up his reserves to let him have strength to take full advantage of the opening when it came it was thrilling and tingling through his veins at the very moment when he was lurching and rocking like a beaten man he acted his part admirably the master felt that there was an easy task before him and rushed in with ungainly activity to finish it once for all he slapbanged away left and right boring montgomery up against the ropes swinging in his ferocious blows with those animal grunts which told of the vicious energy behind them  but montgomery was too cool to fall a victim to any of those murderous uppercuts he kept out of harms way with a rigid guard an active foot and a head which was swift to duck and yet he contrived to present the same appearance of a man who is hopelessly done the master weary from his own shower of blows and fearing nothing from so weak a man dropped his hand for an instant and at that instant montgomerys right came home  it was a magnificent blow straight clean crisp with the force of the loins and the back behind it and it landed where he had meant it toupon the exact point of that bluegrained chin flesh and blood could not stand such a blow in such a place neither valour nor hardihood can save the man to whom it comes the master fell backwards flat prostrate striking the ground with so simultaneous a clap that it was like a shutter falling from a wall a yell which no referee could control broke from the crowded benches as the giant went down he lay upon his back his knees a little drawn up his huge chest panting he twitched and shook but could not move his feet pawed convulsively once or twice it was no use he was done eightnineten said the timekeeper and the roar of a thousand voices with a deafening clap like the broadside of a ship told that the master of croxley was the master no more  montgomery stood half dazed looking down at the huge prostrate figure he could hardly realize that it was indeed all over he saw the referee motion towards him with his hand he heard his name bellowed in triumph from every side and then he was aware of some one rushing towards him he caught a glimpse of a flushed face and an aureole of flying red hair a gloveless fist struck him between the eyes and he was on his back in the ring beside his antagonist while a dozen of his supporters were endeavouring to secure the frantic anastasia he heard the angry shouting of the referee the screaming of the furious woman and the cries of the mob then something seemed to break like an overstretched banjostring and he sank into the deep deep mistgirt abyss of unconsciousness  the dressing was like a thing in a dream and so was a vision of the master with the grin of a bulldog upon his face and his three teeth amiably protruded he shook montgomery heartily by the hand  i would have been rare pleased to shake thee by the throttle lad a short while syne said he but i bear no illfeelin again thee it was a rare poonch that brought me downi have not had a better since my second fight wi billy edwards in 89 happen thou might think o goin further wi this business if thou dost and want a trainer theres not much inside t ropes as i dont know or happen thou might like to try it wi me old style and bare knuckles thou hast but to write to t ironworks to find me  but montgomery disclaimed any such ambition a canvas bag with his shareone hundred and ninety sovereignswas handed to him of which he gave ten to the master who also received some share of the gatemoney  then with young wilson escorting him on one side purvis on the other and fawcett carrying his bag behind he went in triumph to his carriage and drove amid a long roar which lined the highway like a hedge for the seven miles back to his startingpoint  its the greatest thing i ever saw in my life by george its ripping cried wilson who had been left in a kind of ecstasy by the events of the day theres a chap over barnsley way who fancies himself a bit let us spring you on him and let him see what he can make of you well put up a pursewont we purvis you shall never want a backer  at his weight said the publican im behind him i am for twenty rounds and no age country or color barred  so am i cried fawcett middleweight champion of the world thats what he ishere in the same carriage with us  but montgomery was not to be beguiled  no i have my own work to do now  and what may that be  ill use this money to get my medical degree  well weve plenty of doctors but youre the only man in the riding that could smack the croxley master off his legs however i suppose you know your own business best when youre a doctor youd best come down into these parts and youll always find a job waiting for you at the wilson coalpits  montgomery had returned by devious ways to the surgery the horses were smoking at the door and the doctor was just back from his long journey several patients had called in his absence and he was in the worst of tempers  i suppose i should be glad that you have come back at all mr montgomery he snarled when next you elect to take a holiday i trust it will not be at so busy a time  i am sorry sir that you should have been inconvenienced  yes sir i have been exceedingly inconvenienced here for the first time he looked hard at the assistant good heavens mr montgomery what have you been doing with your left eye  it was where anastasia had lodged her protest  montgomery laughed it is nothing sir said he  and you have a livid mark under your jaw it is indeed terrible that my representative should be going about in so disreputable a condition how did you receive these injuries  well sir as you know there was a little glovefight today over at croxley  and you got mixed up with that brutal crowd  i was rather mixed up with them  and who assaulted you  one of the fighters  which of them  the master of croxley  good heavens perhaps you interfered with him  well to tell the truth i did a little  mr montgomery in such a practice as mine intimately associated as it is with the highest and most progressive elements of our small community it is impossible  but just then the tentative bray of a cornetplayer searching for his keynote jarred upon their ears and an instant later the wilson colliery brass band was in full cry with see the conquering hero comes outside the surgery window there was a banner waving and a shouting crowd of miners  what is it what does it mean cried the angry doctor  it means sir that i have in the only way which was open to me earned the money which is necessary for my education it is my duty doctor oldacre to warn you that i am about to return to the university and that you should lose no time in appointing my successor  the end
