the rev uttermust dumfarthing  viii  the great fight for clean government    chapter one a little dinner with mr lucullus fyshe  the mausoleum club stands on the quietest corner of the best residential street in the city it is a grecian building of white stone about it are great elm trees with birdsthe most expensive kind of birdssinging in the branches  the street in the softer hours of the morning has an almost reverential quiet great motors move drowsily along it with solitary chauffeurs returning at 1030 after conveying the earlier of the millionaires to their downtown offices the sunlight flickers through the elm trees illuminating expensive nursemaids wheeling valuable children in little perambulators some of the children are worth millions and millions in europe no doubt you may see in the unter den linden avenue or the champs elysees a little prince or princess go past with a clattering military guard of honour but that is nothing it is not half so impressive in the real sense as what you may observe every morning on plutoria avenue beside the mausoleum club in the quietest part of the city here you may see a little toddling princess in a rabbit suit who owns fifty distilleries in her own right there in a lacquered perambulator sails past a little hooded head that controls from its cradle an entire new jersey corporation the united states attorneygeneral is suing her as she sits in a vain attempt to make her dissolve herself into constituent companies near by is a child of four in a khaki suit who represents the merger of two trunkline railways you may meet in the flickered sunlight any number of little princes and princesses far more real than the poor survivals of europe incalculable infants wave their fiftydollar ivory rattles in an inarticulate greeting to one another a million dollars of preferred stock laughs merrily in recognition of a majority control going past in a gocart drawn by an imported nurse and through it all the sunlight falls through the elm trees and the birds sing and the motors hum so that the whole world as seen from the boulevard of plutoria avenue is the very pleasantest place imaginable  just below plutoria avenue and parallel with it the trees die out and the brick and stone of the city begins in earnest even from the avenue you see the tops of the skyscraping buildings in the big commercial streets and can hear or almost hear the roar of the elevated railway earning dividends and beyond that again the city sinks lower and is choked and crowded with the tangled streets and little houses of the slums  in fact if you were to mount to the roof of the mausoleum club itself on plutoria avenue you could almost see the slums from there but why should you and on the other hand if you never went up on the roof but only dined inside among the palm trees you would never know that the slums existed which is much better  there are broad steps leading up to the club so broad and so agreeably covered with matting that the physical exertion of lifting oneself from ones motor to the door of the club is reduced to the smallest compass the richer members are not ashamed to take the steps one at a time first one foot and then the other and at tight money periods when there is a black cloud hanging over the stock exchange you may see each and every one of the members of the mausoleum club dragging himself up the steps after this fashion his restless eyes filled with the dumb pathos of a man wondering where he can put his hand on half a million dollars  but at gayer times when there are gala receptions at the club its steps are all buried under expensive carpet soft as moss and covered over with a long pavilion of red and white awning to catch the snowflakes and beautiful ladies are poured into the club by the motorful then indeed it is turned into a veritable arcadia and for a beautiful pastoral scene such as would have gladdened the heart of a poet who understood the cost of things commend me to the mausoleum club on just such an evening its broad corridors and deep recesses are filled with shepherdesses such as you never saw dressed in beautiful shimmering gowns and wearing feathers in their hair that droop off sideways at every angle known to trigonometry and there are shepherds too with broad white waistcoats and little patent leather shoes and heavy faces and congested cheeks and there is dancing and conversation among the shepherds and shepherdesses with such brilliant flashes of wit and repartee about the rise in wabash and the fall in cement that the soul of louis quatorze would leap to hear it and later there is supper at little tables when the shepherds and shepherdesses consume preferred stocks and goldinterest bonds in the shape of chilled champagne and iced asparagus and great platefuls of dividends and special quarterly bonuses are carried to and fro in silver dishes by chinese philosophers dressed up to look like waiters  but on ordinary days there are no ladies in the club but only the shepherds you may see them sitting about in little groups of two and three under the palm trees drinking whiskey and soda though of course the more temperate among them drink nothing but whiskey and lithia water and those who have important business to do in the afternoon limit themselves to whiskey and radnor or whiskey and magi water there are as many kinds of bubbling gurgling mineral waters in the caverns of the mausoleum club as ever sparkled from the rocks of homeric greece and when you have once grown used to them it is as impossible to go back to plain water as it is to live again in the forgotten house in a side street that you inhabited long before you became a member  thus the members sit and talk in undertones that float to the ear through the haze of havana smoke you may hear the older men explaining that the country is going to absolute ruin and the younger ones explaining that the country is forging ahead as it never did before but chiefly they love to talk of great national questions such as the protective tariff and the need of raising it the sad decline of the morality of the working man the spread of syndicalism and the lack of christianity in the labour class and the awful growth of selfishness among the mass of the people  so they talk except for two or three that drop off to directors meetings till the afternoon fades and darkens into evening and the noiseless chinese philosophers turn on soft lights here and there among the palm trees presently they dine at white tables glittering with cut glass and green and yellow rhine wines and after dinner they sit again among the palmtrees halfhidden in the blue smoke still talking of the tariff and the labour class and trying to wash away the memory and the sadness of it in floods of mineral waters so the evening passes into night and one by one the great motors come throbbing to the door and the mausoleum club empties and darkens till the last member is borne away and the arcadian day ends in wellearned repose                            i want you to give me your opinion very very frankly said mr lucullus fyshe on one side of the luncheon table to the rev fareforth furlong on the other  by all means said mr furlong  mr fyshe poured out a wineglassful of soda and handed it to the rector to drink  now tell me very truthfully he said is there too much carbon in it  by no means said mr furlong  andquite franklynot too much hydrogen  oh decidedly not  and you would not say that the percentage of sodium bicarbonate was too great for the ordinary taste  i certainly should not said mr furlong and in this he spoke the truth  very good then said mr fyshe i shall use it for the duke of dulham this afternoon  he uttered the name of the duke with that quiet democratic carelessness which meant that he didnt care whether half a dozen other members lunching at the club could hear or not after all what was a duke to a man who was president of the peoples traction and suburban co and the republican soda and siphon cooperative and chief director of the peoples district loan and savings if a man with a broad basis of popular support like that was proposing to entertain a duke surely there could be no doubt about his motives none at all  naturally too if a man manufactures soda himself he gets a little oversensitive about the possibility of his guests noticing the existence of too much carbon in it  in fact ever so many of the members of the mausoleum club manufacture things or cause them to be manufactured orwhat is the same thingmerge them when they are manufactured this gives them their peculiar chemical attitude towards their food one often sees a member suddenly call the head waiter at breakfast to tell him that there is too much ammonia in the bacon and another one protest at the amount of glucose in the olive oil and another that there is too high a percentage of nitrogen in the anchovy a man of distorted imagination might think this tasting of chemicals in the food a sort of nemesis of fate upon the members but that would be very foolish for in every case the head waiter who is the chief of the chinese philosophers mentioned above says that hell see to it immediately and have the percentage removed and as for the members themselves they are about as much ashamed of manufacturing and merging things as the marquis of salisbury is ashamed of the founders of the cecil family  what more natural therefore than that mr lucullus fyshe before serving the soda to the duke should try it on somebody else and what better person could be found for this than mr furlong the saintly young rector of st asaphs who had enjoyed the kind of expensive college education calculated to develop all the faculties moreover a rector of the anglican church who has been in the foreign mission field is the kind of person from whom one can find out more or less incidentally how one should address and converse with a duke and whether you call him your grace or his grace or just grace or duke or what all of which things would seem to a director of the peoples bank and the president of the republican soda co so trivial in importance that he would scorn to ask about them  so that was why mr fyshe had asked mr furlong to lunch with him and to dine with him later on in the same day at the mausoleum club to meet the duke of dulham and mr furlong realizing that a clergyman must be all things to all men and not avoid a man merely because he is a duke had accepted the invitation to lunch and had promised to come to dinner even though it meant postponing the willing workers tango class of st asaphs until the following friday  thus it had come about that mr fyshe was seated at lunch consuming a cutlet and a pint of moselle in the plain downright fashion of a man so democratic that he is practically a revolutionary socialist and doesnt mind saying so and the young rector of st asaphs was sitting opposite to him in a religious ecstasy over a salmi of duck  the duke arrived this morning did he not said mr furlong  from new york said mr fyshe he is staying at the grand palaver i sent a telegram through one of our new york directors of the traction and his grace has very kindly promised to come over here to dine  is he here for pleasure asked the rector  i understand he is mr fyshe was going to say about to invest a large part of his fortune in american securities but he thought better of it even with the clergy it is well to be careful so he substituted is very much interested in studying american conditions  does he stay long asked mr furlong  had mr lucullus fyshe replied quite truthfully he would have said not if i can get his money out of him quickly but he merely answered that i dont know  he will find much to interest him went on the rector in a musing tone the position of the anglican church in america should afford him an object of much consideration i understand he added feeling his way that his grace is a man of deep piety  very deep said mr fyshe  and of great philanthropy  very great  and i presume said the rector taking a devout sip of the unfinished soda that he is a man of immense wealth  i suppose so answered mr fyshe quite carelessly all these fellows are mr fyshe generally referred to the british aristocracy as these fellows land you know feudal estates sheer robbery i call it how the workingclass the proletariat stand for such tyranny is more than i can see mark my words furlong some day theyll rise and the whole thing will come to a sudden end  mr fyshe was here launched upon his favourite topic but he interrupted himself just for a moment to speak to the waiter  what the devil do you mean he said by serving asparagus halfcold  very sorry sir said the waiter shall i take it out  take it out of course take it out and see that you dont serve me stuff of that sort again or ill report you  very sorry sir said the waiter  mr fyshe looked at the vanishing waiter with contempt upon his features these pampered fellows are getting unbearable he said by gad if i had my way id fire the whole lot of them lock em out put em on the street that would teach em yes furlong youll live to see it that the whole workingclass will one day rise against the tyranny of the upper classes and society will be overwhelmed  but if mr fyshe had realized that at that moment in the kitchen of the mausoleum club in those sacred precincts themselves there was a walking delegate of the waiters international union leaning against a sideboard with his bowler hat over one corner of his eye and talking to a little group of the chinese philosophers he would have known that perhaps the social catastrophe was a little nearer than even he suspected                            are you inviting anyone else tonight asked mr furlong  i should have liked to ask your father said mr fyshe but unfortunately he is out of town  what mr fyshe really meant was i am extremely glad not to have to ask your father whom i would not introduce to the duke on any account  indeed mr furlong senior the father of the rector of st asaphs who was president of the new amalgamated hymnal corporation and director of the hosanna pipe and steam organ limited was entirely the wrong man for mr fyshes present purpose in fact he was reputed to be as smart a man as ever sold a bible at this moment he was out of town busied in new york with the preparation of the plates of his new hindu testament copyright but had he learned that a duke with several millions to invest was about to visit the city he would not have left it for the whole of hindustan  i suppose you are asking mr boulder said the rector  no answered mr fyshe very decidedly dismissing the name absolutely  indeed there was even better reason not to introduce mr boulder to the duke mr fyshe had made that sort of mistake once and never intended to make it again it was only a year ago on the occasion of the visit of young viscount fitzthistle to the mausoleum club that mr fyshe had introduced mr boulder to the viscount and had suffered grievously thereby for mr boulder had no sooner met the viscount than he invited him up to his huntinglodge in wisconsin and that was the last thing known of the investment of the fitzthistle fortune  this mr boulder of whom mr fyshe spoke might indeed have been seen at that moment at a further table of the lunch room eating a solitary meal an oldish man with a great frame suggesting broken strength with a white beard and with falling undereyelids that made him look as if he were just about to cry his eyes were blue and far away and his still mournful face and his great bent shoulders seemed to suggest all the power and mystery of high finance  gloom indeed hung over him for when one heard him talk of listed stocks and cumulative dividends there was as deep a tone in his quiet voice as if he spoke of eternal punishment and the wages of sin  under his great hands a chattering viscount or a sturdy duke or a popinjay italian marquis was as nothing  mr boulders methods with titled visitors investing money in america were deep he never spoke to them of money not a word he merely talked of the great american foresthe had been born sixtyfive years back in a lumber stateand when he spoke of primeval trees and the howl of the wolf at night among the pines there was the stamp of reality about it that held the visitor spellbound and when he fell to talking of his huntinglodge far away in the wisconsin timber duke earl or baron that had ever handled a doublebarrelled express rifle listened and was lost  i have a little place mr boulder would say in his deep tones that seemed almost like a sob a sort of shooting box i think youd call it up in wisconsin just a plain placehe would add almost cryingmade of logs  oh really the visitor would interject made of logs by jove how interesting  all titled people are fascinated at once with logs and mr boulder knew itat least subconsciously  yes logs he would continue still in deep sorrow just the plain cedar not squared you know the old original timber i had them cut right out of the forest  by this time the visitors excitement was obvious and is there game there he would ask  we have the timberwolf said mr boulder his voice half choking at the sadness of the thing and of course the jack wolf and the lynx  and are they ferocious  oh extremely soquite uncontrollable  on which the titled visitor was all excitement to start for wisconsin at once even before mr boulders invitation was put in words  and when he returned a week later all tanned and wearing bushwhackers boots and covered with wolf bites his whole available fortune was so completely invested in mr boulders securities that you couldnt have shaken twentyfive cents out of him upside down  yet the whole thing had been done merely incidentally round a big fire under the wisconsin timber with a dead wolf or two lying in the snow  so no wonder that mr fyshe did not propose to invite mr boulder to his little dinner no indeed in fact his one aim was to keep mr boulder and his log house hidden from the duke  and equally no wonder that as soon as mr boulder read of the dukes arrival in new york and saw by the commercial echo and financial undertone that he might come to the city looking for investments he telephoned at once to his little place in wisconsinwhich had of course a primeval telephone wire running to itand told his steward to have the place well aired and good fires lighted and he especially enjoined him to see if any of the shanty men thereabouts could catch a wolf or two as he might need them                            is no one else coming then asked the rector  oh yes president boomer of the university we shall be a party of four i thought the duke might be interested in meeting boomer he may care to hear something of the archaeological remains of the continent  if the duke did so care he certainly had a splendid chance in meeting the gigantic dr boomer the president of plutoria university  if he wanted to know anything of the exact distinction between the mexican pueblo and the navajo tribal house he had his opportunity right now if he was eager to hear a short talksay half an houron the relative antiquity of the neanderthal skull and the gravel deposits of the missouri his chance had come he could learn as much about the stone age and the bronze age in america from president boomer as he could about the gold age and the age of paper securities from mr fyshe and mr boulder  so what better man to meet a duke than an archaeological president  and if the duke should feel inclined as a result of his american visit for dr boomer who knew everything understood what the duke had come for inclined let us say to endow a chair in primitive anthropology or do any useful little thing of the sort that was only fair business all round or if he even was willing to give a moderate sum towards the general fund of plutoria universityenough let us say to enable the president to dismiss an old professor and hire a new onethat surely was reasonable enough  the president therefore had said yes to mr fyshes invitation with alacrity and had taken a look through the list of his more incompetent professors to refresh his memory                            the duke of dulham had landed in new york five days before and had looked round eagerly for a field of turnips but hadnt seen any he had been driven up fifth avenue and had kept his eyes open for potatoes but there were none nor had he seen any shorthorns in central park nor any southdowns on broadway for the duke of course like all dukes was agricultural from his norfolk jacket to his hobnailed boots  at his restaurant he had cut a potato in two and sent half of it to the head waiter to know if it was bermudian it had all the look of an early bermudian but the duke feared from the shading of it that it might be only a late trinidad and the head waiter sent it to the chef mistaking it for a complaint and the chef sent it back to the duke with a message that it was not a bermudian but a prince edward island and the duke sent his compliments to the chef and the chef sent his compliments to the duke and the duke was so pleased at learning this that he had a similar potato wrapped up for him to take away and tipped the head waiter twentyfive cents feeling that in an extravagant country the only thing to do is to go the people one better so the duke carried the potato round for five days in new york and showed it to everybody but beyond this he got no sign of agriculture out of the place at all no one who entertained him seemed to know what the beef that they gave him had been fed on no one even in what seemed the best society could talk rationally about preparing a hog for the breakfast table people seemed to eat cauliflower without distinguishing the denmark variety from the oldenburg and few if any knew silesian bacon even when they tasted it and when they took the duke out twentyfive miles into what was called the country there were still no turnips but only real estate and railway embankments and advertising signs so that altogether the obvious and visible decline of american agriculture in what should have been its leading centre saddened the dukes heart thus the duke passed four gloomy days agriculture vexed him and still more of course the money concerns which had brought him to america  money is a troublesome thing but it has got to be thought about even by those who were not brought up to it if on account of money matters one has been driven to come over to america in the hope of borrowing money the awkwardness of how to go about it naturally makes one gloomy and preoccupied had there been broad fields of turnips to walk in and holstein cattle to punch in the ribs one might have managed to borrow it in the course of gentlemanly intercourse as from one cattleman to another but in new york amid piles of masonry and roaring streettraffic and glittering lunches and palatial residences one simply couldnt do it  herein lay the truth about the duke of dulhams visit and the error of mr lucullus fyshe mr fyshe was thinking that the duke had come to lend money in reality he had come to borrow it in fact the duke was reckoning that by putting a second mortgage on dulham towers for twenty thousand sterling and by selling his scotch shooting and leasing his irish grazing and subletting his welsh coal rent he could raise altogether a hundred thousand pounds this for a duke is an enormous sum if he once had it he would be able to pay off the first mortgage on dulham towers buy in the rights of the present tenant of the scotch shooting and the claim of the present mortgagee of the irish grazing and in fact be just where he started this is ducal finance which moves always in a circle  in other words the duke was really a poor mannot poor in the american sense where poverty comes as a sudden blighting stringency taking the form of an inability to get hold of a quarter of a million dollars no matter how badly one needs it and where it passes like a stormcloud and is gone but poor in that permanent and distressing sense known only to the british aristocracy the dukes case of course was notorious and mr fyshe ought to have known of it the duke was so poor that the duchess was compelled to spend three or four months every year at a fashionable hotel on the riviera simply to save money and his eldest son the young marquis of beldoodle had to put in most of his time shooting big game in uganda with only twenty or twentyfive beaters and with so few carriers and couriers and such a dearth of elephant men and hyena boys that the thing was a perfect scandal the duke indeed was so poor that a younger son simply to add his efforts to those of the rest was compelled to pass his days in mountain climbing in the himalayas and the dukes daughter was obliged to pay long visits to minor german princesses putting up with all sorts of hardship and while the ducal family wandered about in this wayclimbing mountains and shooting hyenas and saving money the dukes place or seat dulham towers was practically shut up with no one in it but servants and housekeepers and gamekeepers and tourists and the picture galleries except for artists and visitors and villagers were closed and the town house except for the presence of servants and tradesmen and secretaries was absolutely shut but the duke knew that rigid parsimony of this sort if kept up for a generation or two will work wonders and this sustained him and the duchess knew it and it sustained her in fact all the ducal family knowing that it was only a matter of a generation or two took their misfortune very cheerfully  the only thing that bothered the duke was borrowing money this was necessary from time to time when loans or mortgages fell in but he hated it it was beneath him his ancestors had often taken money but had never borrowed it and the duke chafed under the necessity there was something about the process that went against the grain to sit down in pleasant converse with a man perhaps almost a gentleman and then lead up to the subject and take his money from him seemed to the dukes mind essentially low he could have understood knocking a man over the head with a fire shovel and taking his money but not borrowing it  so the duke had come to america where borrowing is notoriously easy any member of the mausoleum club for instance would borrow fifty cents to buy a cigar or fifty thousand dollars to buy a house or five millions to buy a railroad with complete indifference and pay it back too if he could and think nothing of it in fact ever so many of the dukes friends were known to have borrowed money in america with magical ease pledging for it their seats or their pictures or one of their daughtersanything  so the duke knew it must be easy and yet incredible as it may seem he had spent four days in new york entertained everywhere and made much of and hadnt borrowed a cent he had been asked to lunch in a riverside palace and fool that he was had come away without so much as a dollar to show for it he had been asked to a country house on the hudson and like an idiothe admitted it himselfhadnt asked his host for as much as his train fare he had been driven twice round central park in a motor and had been taken tamely back to his hotel not a dollar the richer the thing was childish and he knew it but to save his life the duke didnt know how to begin none of the things that he was able to talk about seemed to have the remotest connection with the subject of money the duke was able to converse reasonably well over such topics as the approaching downfall of england they had talked of it at dulham towers for sixty years or over the duty of england towards china or the duty of england to persia or its duty to aid the young turk movement and its duty to check the old servia agitation the duke became so interested in these topics and in explaining that while he had never been a little englander he had always been a big turk and that he stood for a small bulgaria and a restricted austria that he got further and further away from the topic of money which was what he really wanted to come to and the duke rose from his conversations with a look of such obvious distress on his face that everybody realized that his anxiety about england was killing him  and then suddenly light had come it was on his fourth day in new york that he unexpectedly ran into the viscount belstairs they had been together as young men in nigeria and as middleaged men in st petersburg and belstairs who was in abundant spirits and who was returning to england on the gloritania at noon the next day explained to the duke that he had just borrowed fifty thousand pounds on security that wouldnt be worth a halfpenny in england  and the duke said with a sigh how the deuce do you do it belstairs  do what  borrow it said the duke how do you manage to get people to talk about it here i am wanting to borrow a hundred thousand and im hanged if i can even find an opening  at which the viscount had said pooh pooh you dont need any opening just borrow it straight outask for it across a dinner table just as youd ask for a match they think nothing of it here  across the dinner table repeated the duke who was a literal man  certainly said the viscount not too soon you knowsay after a second glass of wine i assure you its absolutely nothing  and it was just at that moment that a telegram was handed to the duke from mr lucullus fyshe praying him as he was reported to be visiting the next day the city where the mausoleum club stands to make acquaintance with him by dining at that institution  and the duke being as i say a literal man decided that just as soon as mr fyshe should give him a second glass of wine that second glass should cost mr fyshe a hundred thousand pounds sterling  and oddly enough at about the same moment mr fyshe was calculating that provided he could make the duke drink a second glass of the mausoleum champagne that glass would cost the duke about five million dollars                            so the very morning after that the duke had arrived on the new york express in the city and being an ordinary democratic commercial sort of place absorbed in its own affairs it made no fuss over him whatever the morning edition of the plutopian citizen simply said we understand that the duke of dulham arrives at the grand palaver this morning after which it traced the dukes pedigree back to jock of ealing in the twelfth century and let the matter go at that and the noon edition of the peoples advocate merely wrote we learn that duke dulham is in town he is a relation of jack ealing but the commercial echo and financial undertone appearing at four oclock printed in its stockmarket columns the announcement we understand that the duke of dulham who arrives in town today is proposing to invest a large sum of money in american industrials  and of course that announcement reached every member of the mausoleum club within twenty minutes                            the duke of dulham entered the mausoleum club that evening at exactly seven of the clock he was a short thick man with a shaven face red as a brick and grizzled hair and from the look of him he could have got a job at sight in any lumber camp in wisconsin he wore a dinner jacket just like an ordinary person but even without his norfolk coat and his hobnailed boots there was something in the way in which he walked up the long main hall of the mausoleum club that every imported waiter in the place recognized in an instant  the duke cast his eye about the club and approved of it it seemed to him a modest quiet place very different from the staring ostentation that one sees too often in a german hof or an italian palazzo he liked it  mr fyshe and mr furlong were standing in a deep alcove or bay where there was a fire and indiarubber trees and pictures with shaded lights and a whiskeyandsoda table there the duke joined them mr fyshe he had met already that afternoon at the palaver and he called him fyshe as if he had known him forever and indeed after a few minutes he called the rector of st asaphs simply furlong for he had been familiar with the anglican clergy in so many parts of the world that he knew that to attribute any peculiar godliness to them socially was the worst possible taste  by jove said the duke turning to tap the leaf of a rubber tree with his finger that fellows a nigerian isnt he  i hardly know said mr fyshe i imagine so and he added youve been in nigeria duke  oh some years ago said the duke after big game you knowfine place for it  did you get any asked mr fyshe  not much said the duke a hippo or two  ah said mr fyshe  and of course now and then a giro the duke went on and added my sister was luckier though she potted a rhino one day straight out of a doolie i call that rather good  mr fyshe called it that too  ah now heres a good thing the duke went on looking at a picture he carried in his waistcoat pocket an eyeglass that he used for pictures and for tamworth hogs and he put it to his eye with one hand keeping the other in the left pocket of his jacket and thisthis is a very good thing  i believe so said mr fyshe  you really have some awfully good things here continued the duke he had seen far too many pictures in too many places ever to speak of values or compositions or anything of that sort the duke merely looked at a picture and said now heres a good thing or ah here now is a very good thing or i say heres a really good thing  no one could get past this sort of criticism the duke had long since found it bulletproof  they showed me some rather good things in new york he went on but really the things you have here seem to be awfully good things  indeed the duke was truly pleased with the pictures for something in their composition or else in the soft expensive light that shone on them enabled him to see in the distant background of each a hundred thousand sterling and that is a very beautiful picture indeed  when you come to our side of the water fyshe said the duke i must show you my botticelli  had mr fyshe who knew nothing of art expressed his real thought he would have said show me your which but he only answered i shall be delighted to see it  in any case there was no time to say more for at this moment the portly figure and the great face of dr boomer president of plutoria university loomed upon them and with him came a great burst of conversation that blew all previous topics into fragments he was introduced to the duke and shook hands with mr furlong and talked to both of them and named the kind of cocktail that he wanted all in one breath and in the very next he was asking the duke about the babylonian hieroglyphic bricks that his grandfather the thirteenth duke had brought home from the euphrates and which every archaeologist knew were preserved in the dukes library at dulham towers and though the duke hadnt known about the bricks himself he assured dr boomer that his grandfather had collected some really good things quite remarkable  and the duke having met a man who knew about his grandfather felt in his own element in fact he was so delighted with dr boomer and the nigerian rubber tree and the shaded pictures and the charm of the whole place and the certainty that half a million dollars was easily findable in it that he put his eyeglass back in his pocket and said  a charming club you have here really most charming  yes said mr fyshe in a casual tone a comfortable place we like to think  but if he could have seen what was happening below in the kitchens of the mausoleum club mr fyshe would have realized that just then it was turning into a most uncomfortable place  for the walking delegate with his hat on sideways who had haunted it all day was busy now among the assembled chinese philosophers writing down names and distributing strikers cards of the international union and assuring them that the boys of the grand palaver had all walked out at seven and that all the boys of the commercial and the union and of every restaurant in town were out an hour ago  and the philosophers were taking their cards and hanging up their waiters coats and putting on shabby jackets and bowler hats worn sideways and changing themselves by a wonderful transformation from respectable chinese to slouching loafers of the lowest type  but mr fyshe being in an alcove and not in the kitchens saw nothing of these things not even when the head waiter shaking with apprehension appeared with cocktails made by himself in glasses that he himself had had to wipe did mr fyshe absorbed in the easy urbanity of the duke notice that anything was amiss  neither did his guests for dr boomer having discovered that the duke had visited nigeria was asking him his opinion of the famous bimbaweh remains of the lower niger the duke confessed that he really hadnt noticed them and the doctor assured him that strabo had indubitably mentioned them he would show the duke the very passage and that they apparently lay if his memory served him about halfway between oohat and ohat whether above oohat and below ohat or above ohat and below oohat he would not care to say for a certainty for that the duke must wait till the president had time to consult his library  and the duke was fascinated forthwith with the presidents knowledge of nigerian geography and explained that he had once actually descended from below timbuctoo to oohat in a doolie manned only by four swats  so presently having drunk the cocktails the party moved solemnly in a body from the alcove towards the private diningroom upstairs still busily talking of the bimbaweh remains and the swats and whether the doolie was or was not the original goatskin boat of the book of genesis  and when they entered the private diningroom with its snowwhite table and cut glass and flowers as arranged by a retreating philosopher now heading towards the gaiety theatre with his hat over his eyes the duke again exclaimed  really you have a most comfortable clubdelightful  so they sat down to dinner over which mr furlong offered up a grace as short as any that are known even to the anglican clergy and the head waiter now in deep distressfor he had been sending out telephone messages in vain to the grand palaver and the continental like the captain of a sinking shipserved oysters that he had opened himself and poured rhine wine with a trembling hand for he knew that unless by magic a new chef and a waiter or two could be got from the palaver all hope was lost  but the guests still knew nothing of his fears dr boomer was eating his oysters as a nigerian hippo might eat up the crew of a doolie in great mouthfuls and commenting as he did so upon the luxuriousness of modern life  and in the pause that followed the oysters he illustrated for the duke with two pieces of bread the essential difference in structure between the mexican pueblo and the tribal house of the navajos and lest the duke should confound either or both of them with the adobe hut of the bimbaweh tribes he showed the difference at once with a couple of olives  by this time of course the delay in the service was getting noticeable mr fyshe was directing angry glances towards the door looking for the reappearance of the waiter and growling an apology to his guests but the president waved the apology aside  in my college days he said i should have considered a plate of oysters an ample meal i should have asked for nothing more we eat he said too much  this of course started mr fyshe on his favourite topic luxury he exclaimed i should think so it is the curse of the age the appalling growth of luxury the piling up of money the ease with which huge fortunes are made good thought the duke here we are coming to it these are the things that are going to ruin us mark my words the whole thing is bound to end in a tremendous crash i dont mind telling you dukemy friends here i am sure know it alreadythat i am more or less a revolutionary socialist i am absolutely convinced sir that our modern civilization will end in a great social catastrophe mark what i sayand here mr fyshe became exceedingly impressivea great social catastrophe some of us may not live to see it perhaps but you for instance furlong are a younger man you certainly will  but here mr fyshe was understating the case they were all going to live to see it right on the spot  for it was just at this moment when mr fyshe was talking of the social catastrophe and explaining with flashing eyes that it was bound to come that it came and when it came it lit of all places in the world right there in the private diningroom of the mausoleum club  for the gloomy head waiter reentered and leaned over the back of mr fyshes chair and whispered to him  eh what said mr fyshe  the head waiter his features stricken with inward agony whispered again  the infernal damn scoundrels said mr fyshe starting back in his chair on strike in this club its an outrage  im very sorry sir i didnt like to tell you sir id hoped i might have got help from the outside but it seems sir the hotels are all the same way  do you mean to say said mr fyshe speaking very slowly that there is no dinner  im sorry sir moaned the waiter it appears the chef hadnt even cooked it beyond whats on the table sir theres nothing  the social catastrophe had come  mr fyshe sat silent with his fist clenched dr boomer with his great face transfixed stared at the empty oystershells thinking perhaps of his college days the duke with his hundred thousand dashed from his lips in the second cup of champagne that was never served thought of his politeness first and murmured something about taking them to his hotel  but there is no need to follow the unhappy details of the unended dinner mr fyshes one idea was to be gone he was too true an artist to think that finance could be carried on over the tablecloth of a secondrate restaurant or on an empty stomach in a deserted club the thing must be done over again he must wait his time and begin anew  and so it came about that the little dinner party of mr lucullus fyshe dissolved itself into its constituent elements like broken pieces of society in the great cataclysm portrayed by mr fyshe himself  the duke was bowled home in a snorting motor to the brilliant rotunda of the grand palaver itself waiterless and supperless  the rector of st asaphs wandered off home to his rectory musing upon the contents of its pantry  and mr fyshe and the gigantic doctor walked side by side homewards along plutoria avenue beneath the elm trees nor had they gone any great distance before dr boomer fell to talking of the duke  a charming man he said delightful i feel extremely sorry for him  no worse off i presume than any of the rest of us growled mr fyshe who was feeling in the sourest of democratic moods a man doesnt need to be a duke to have a stomach  oh pooh pooh said the president waving the topic aside with his hand in the air i dont refer to that oh not at all i was thinking of his financial positionan ancient family like the dulhams it seems too bad altogether  for of course to an archaeologist like dr boomer an intimate acquaintance with the pedigree and fortunes of the greater ducal families from jock of ealing downwards was nothing it went without saying as beside the neanderthal skull and the bimbaweh ruins it didnt count  mr fyshe stopped absolutely still in his tracks his financial position he questioned quick as a lynx  certainly said dr boomer i had taken it for granted that you knew the dulham family are practically ruined the duke i imagine is under the necessity of mortgaging his estates indeed i should suppose he is here in america to raise money  mr fyshe was a man of lightning action any man accustomed to the stock exchange learns to think quickly  one moment he cried i see we are right at your door may i just run in and use your telephone i want to call up boulder for a moment  two minutes later mr fyshe was saying into the telephone oh is that you boulder i was looking for you in vain todaywanted you to meet the duke of dulham who came in quite unexpectedly from new york felt sure youd like to meet him wanted you at the club for dinner and now it turns out that the clubs all upsetwaiters strike or some such rascalityand the palaver so i hear is in the same fix could you possibly  here mr fyshe paused listening a moment and then went on yes yes an excellent ideamost kind of you pray do send your motor to the hotel and give the duke a bite of dinner no i wouldnt join you thanks most kind good night  and within a few minutes more the motor of mr boulder was rolling down from plutoria avenue to the grand palaver hotel  what passed between mr boulder and the duke that evening is not known that they must have proved congenial company to one another there is no doubt in fact it would seem that dissimilar as they were in many ways they found a common bond of interest in sport and it is quite likely that mr boulder may have mentioned that he had a huntinglodgewhat the duke would call a shootingboxin wisconsin woods and that it was made of logs rough cedar logs not squared and that the timber wolves and others which surrounded it were of a ferocity without parallel  those who know the duke best could measure the effect of that upon his temperament  at any rate it is certain that mr lucullus fyshe at his breakfasttable next morning chuckled with suppressed joy to read in the plutopian citizen the item  we learn that the duke of dulham who has been paying a brief visit to the city leaves this morning with mr asmodeus boulder for the wisconsin woods we understand that mr boulder intends to show his guest who is an ardent sportsman something of the american wolf                            and so the duke went whirling westwards and northwards with mr boulder in the drawingroom end of a pullman car that was all littered up with doublebarrelled express rifles and leather game bags and lynx catchers and wolf traps and heaven knows what and the duke had on his very roughest sportingsuit made apparently of alligator hide and as he sat there with a rifle across his knees while the train swept onwards through open fields and broken woods the real country at last towards the wisconsin forest there was such a light of genial happiness in his face that had not been seen there since he had been marooned in the mud jungles of upper burmah  and opposite mr boulder looked at him with fixed silent eyes and murmured from time to time some renewed information of the ferocity of the timberwolf  but of wolves other than the timberwolf and fiercer still into whose hands the duke might fall in america he spoke never a word  nor is it known in the record what happened in wisconsin and to the mausoleum club the duke and his visit remained only as a passing and a pleasant memory    chapter two the wizard of finance  down in the city itself just below the residential street where the mausoleum club is situated there stands overlooking central square the grand palaver hotel it is in truth at no great distance from the club not half a minute in ones motor in fact one could almost walk it  but in central square the quiet of plutoria avenue is exchanged for another atmosphere there are fountains that splash unendingly and mingle their music with the sound of the motorhorns and the clatter of the cabs there are real trees and little green benches with people reading yesterdays newspaper and grass cut into plots among the asphalt there is at one end a statue of the first governor of the state lifesize cut in stone and at the other a statue of the last ever so much larger than life cast in bronze and all the people who pass by pause and look at this statue and point at it with walkingsticks because it is of extraordinary interest in fact it is an example of the new electrochemical process of casting by which you can cast a state governor any size you like no matter what you start from those who know about such things explain what an interesting contrast the two statues are for in the case of the governor of a hundred years ago one had to start from plain rough material and work patiently for years to get the effect whereas now the material doesnt matter at all and with any sort of scrap treated in the gas furnace under tremendous pressure one may make a figure of colossal size like the one in central square  so naturally central square with its trees and its fountains and its statues is one of the places of chief interest in the city but especially because there stands along one side of it the vast pile of the grand palaver hotel it rises fifteen stories high and fills all one side of the square it has overlooking the trees in the square twelve hundred rooms with three thousand windows and it would have held all george washingtons army even people in other cities who have never seen it know it well from its advertising the most homelike hotel in america so it is labelled in all the magazines the expensive ones on the continent in fact the aim of the company that owns the grand palaverand they do not attempt to conceal itis to make the place as much a home as possible therein lies its charm it is a home you realize that when you look up at the grand palaver from the square at night when the twelve hundred guests have turned on the lights of the three thousand windows you realize it at theatre time when the great string of motors come sweeping to the doors of the palaver to carry the twelve hundred guests to twelve hundred seats in the theatres at four dollars a seat but most of all do you appreciate the character of the grand palaver when you step into its rotunda aladdins enchanted palace was nothing to it it has a vast ceiling with a hundred glittering lights and within it night and day is a surging crowd that is never still and a babel of voices that is never hushed and over all there hangs an enchanted cloud of thin blue tobacco smoke such as might enshroud the conjured vision of a magician of baghdad or damascus  in and through the rotunda there are palm trees to rest the eye and rubber trees in boxes to soothe the mind and there are great leather lounges and deep armchairs and here and there huge brass ashbowls as big as etruscan tearjugs along one side is a counter with grated wickets like a bank and behind it are five clerks with flattened hair and tall collars dressed in long black frockcoats all day like members of a legislature they have great books in front of them in which they study unceasingly and at their lightest thought they strike a bell with the open palm of their hand and at the sound of it a page boy in a monkey suit with gp stamped all over him in brass bounds to the desk and off again shouting a call into the unheeding crowd vociferously the sound of it fills for a moment the great space of the rotunda it echoes down the corridors to the side it floats softly melodious through the palm trees of the ladies palm room it is heard fainter and fainter in the distant grill and in the depths of the barber shop below the level of the street the barber arrests a momentthe drowsy hum of his shampoo brushes to catch the soundas might a miner in the sunken galleries of a coastal mine cease in his toil a moment to hear the distant murmur of the sea  and the clerks call for the pages the pages call for the guests and the guests call for the porters the bells clang the elevators rattle till home itself was never half so homelike                            a call for mr tomlinson a call for mr tomlinson  so went the sound echoing through the rotunda  and as the page boy found him and handed him on a salver a telegram to read the eyes of the crowd about him turned for a moment to look upon the figure of tomlinson the wizard of finance  there he stood in his wideawake hat and his long black coat his shoulders slightly bent with his fiftyeight years anyone who had known him in the olden days on his bush farm beside tomlinsons creek in the country of the great lakes would have recognized him in a moment there was still on his face that strange puzzled look that it habitually wore only now of course the financial papers were calling it unfathomable there was a certain way in which his eye roved to and fro inquiringly that might have looked like perplexity were it not that the financial undertone had recognized it as the searching look of a captain of industry one might have thought that for all the goodness in it there was something simple in his face were it not that the commercial and pictorial review had called the face inscrutable and had proved it so with an illustration that left no doubt of the matter indeed the face of tomlinson of tomlinsons creek now tomlinson the wizard of finance was not commonly spoken of as a face by the paragraphers of the saturday magazine sections but was more usually referred to as a mask and it would appear that napoleon the first had had one also the saturday editors were never tired of describing the strange impressive personality of tomlinson the great dominating character of the newest and highest finance from the moment when the interim prospectus of the erie auriferous consolidated had broken like a tidal wave over stock exchange circles the picture of tomlinson the sleeping shareholder of uncomputed millions had filled the imagination of every dreamer in a nation of poets  they all described him and when each had finished he began again  the face so wrote the editor of the our own men section of ourselves monthly is that of a typical american captain of finance hard yet with a certain softness broad but with a certain length ductile but not without its own firmness  the mouth so wrote the editor of the success column of brains is strong but pliable the jaw firm and yet movable while there is something in the set of the ear that suggests the swift eager mind of the born leader of men  so from state to state ran the portrait of tomlinson of tomlinsons creek drawn by people who had never seen him so did it reach out and cross the ocean till the french journals inserted a picture which they used for such occasions and called it monsieur tomlinson nouveau capitaine de la haute finance en amerique and the german weeklies inserting also a suitable picture from their stock marked it herr tomlinson amerikanischer industrie und finanzcapitan thus did tomlinson float from tomlinsons creek beside lake erie to the very banks of the danube and the drave  some writers grew lyric about him what visions they asked could one but read them must lie behind the quiet dreaming eyes of that inscrutable face  they might have read them easily enough had they but had the key anyone who looked upon tomlinson as he stood there in the roar and clatter of the great rotunda of the grand palaver with the telegram in his hand fumbling at the wrong end to open it might have read the visions of the mastermind had he but known their nature they were simple enough for the visions in the mind of tomlinson wizard of finance were for the most part those of a windswept hillside farm beside lake erie where tomlinsons creek runs down to the low edge of the lake and where the offshore wind ripples the rushes of the shallow water that and the vision of a frame house and the snake fences of the fourth concession road where it falls to the lakeside and if the eyes of the man are dreamy and abstracted it is because there lies over the vision of this vanished farm an infinite regret greater in its compass than all the shares the erie auriferous consolidated has ever thrown upon the market                            when tomlinson had opened the telegram he stood with it for a moment in his hand looking the boy full in the face his look had in it that peculiar faraway quality that the newspapers were calling napoleonic abstraction in reality he was wondering whether to give the boy twentyfive cents or fifty  the message that he had just read was worded morning quotations show preferred a g falling rapidly recommend instant sale no confidence send instructions  the wizard of finance took from his pocket a pencil it was a carpenters pencil and wrote across the face of the message buy me quite a bit more of the same yours truly  this he gave to the boy take it over to him he said pointing to the telegraph corner of the rotunda then after another pause he mumbled here sonny and gave the boy a dollar  with that he turned to walk towards the elevator and all the people about him who had watched the signing of the message knew that some big financial deal was going througha coup in fact they called it  the elevator took the wizard to the second floor as he went up he felt in his pocket and gripped a quarter then changed his mind and felt for a fiftycent piece and finally gave them both to the elevator boy after which he walked along the corridor till he reached the corner suite of rooms a palace in itself for which he was paying a thousand dollars a month ever since the erie auriferous consolidated company had begun tearing up the bed of tomlinsons creek in cahoga county with its hydraulic dredges  well mother he said as he entered  there was a woman seated near the window a woman with a plain homely face such as they wear in the farm kitchens of cahoga county and a set of fashionable clothes upon her such as they sell to the ladies of plutoria avenue  this was mother the wife of the wizard of finance and eight years younger than himself and she too was in the papers and the public eye and whatsoever the shops had fresh from paris at fabulous prices that they sold to mother they had put a balkan hat upon her with an upright feather and they had hung gold chains on her and everything that was most expensive they had hung and tied on mother you might see her emerging any morning from the grand palaver in her beetleback jacket and her balkan hat a figure of infinite pathos and whatever she wore the lady editors of spring notes and causerie du boudoir wrote it out in french and one paper had called her a belle chatelaine and another had spoken of her as a grande dame which the tomlinsons thought must be a misprint  but in any case for tomlinson the wizard of finance it was a great relief to have as his wife a woman like mother because he knew that she had taught school in cahoga county and could hold her own in the city with any of them  so mother spent her time sitting in her beetle jacket in the thousanddollar suite reading new novels in brilliant paper covers and the wizard on his trips up and down to the rotunda brought her the very best the ones that cost a dollar fifty because he knew that out home she had only been able to read books like nathaniel hawthorne and walter scott that were only worth ten cents                            hows fred said the wizard laying aside his hat and looking towards the closed door of an inner room is he better  some said mother hes dressed but hes lying down  fred was the son of the wizard and mother in the inner room he lay on a sofa a great hulking boy of seventeen in a flowered dressinggown fancying himself ill there was a packet of cigarettes and a box of chocolates on a chair beside him and he had the blind drawn and his eyes halfclosed to impress himself  yet this was the same boy that less than a year ago on tomlinsons creek had worn a rough store suit and set his sturdy shoulders to the bucksaw at present fortune was busy taking from him the golden gifts which the fairies of cahoga county lake erie had laid in his cradle seventeen years ago  the wizard tiptoed into the inner room and from the open door his listening wife could hear the voice of the boy saying in a tone as of one distraught with suffering  is there any more of that jelly  could he have any do you suppose asked tomlinson coming back  its all right said mother if it will sit on his stomach for this in the dietetics of cahoga county is the sole test all those things can be eaten which will sit on the stomach anything that wont sit there is not eatable  do you suppose i could get them to get any questioned tomlinson would it be all right to telephone down to the office or do you think it would be better to ring  perhaps said his wife it would be better to look out into the hall and see if there isnt someone round that would tell them  this was the kind of problem with which tomlinson and his wife in their thousanddollar suite in the grand palaver grappled all day and when presently a tall waiter in dressclothes appeared and said jelly yes sir immediately sir would you like sir maraschino sir or portovino sir tomlinson gazed at him gloomily wondering if he would take five dollars  what does the doctor say is wrong with fred asked tomlinson when the waiter had gone  he dont just say said mother he said he must keep very quiet he looked in this morning for a minute or two and he said hed look in later in the day again but he said to keep fred very quiet  exactly in other words fred had pretty much the same complaint as the rest of dr slyders patients on plutoria avenue and was to be treated in the same way dr slyder who was the most fashionable practitioner in the city spent his entire time moving to and fro in an almost noiseless motor earnestly advising people to keep quiet you must keep very quiet for a little while he would say with a sigh as he sat beside a sickbed as he drew on his gloves in the hall below he would shake his head very impressively and say you must keep him very quiet and so pass out quite soundlessly by this means dr slyder often succeeded in keeping people quiet for weeks it was all the medicine that he knew but it was enough and as his patients always got wellthere being nothing wrong with themhis reputation was immense  very naturally the wizard and his wife were impressed with him they had never seen such therapeutics in cahoga county where the practice of medicine is carried on with forceps pumps squirts splints and other instruments of violence  the waiter had hardly gone when a boy appeared at the door this time he presented to tomlinson not one telegram but a little bundle of them  the wizard read them with a lengthening face the first ran something like this congratulate you on your daring market turned instantly and the next your opinion justified market rose have sold at 20 points profit and a third your forecast entirely correct c p rose at once send further instructions  these and similar messages were from brokers offices and all of them were in the same tone one told him that c p was up and another t g p had passed 129 and another that t c r r had risen tenall of which things were imputed to the wonderful sagacity of tomlinson whereas if they had told him that x y z had risen to the moon he would have been just as wise as to what it meant  well said the wife of the wizard as her husband finished looking through the reports how are things this morning are they any better  no said tomlinson and he sighed as he said it this is the worst day yet its just been a shower of telegrams and mostly all the same i cant do the figuring of it like you can but i reckon i must have made another hundred thousand dollars since yesterday  you dont say so said mother and they looked at one another gloomily  and half a million last week wasnt it said tomlinson as he sank into a chair im afraid mother he continued its no good we dont know how we werent brought up to it  all of which meant that if the editor of the monetary afternoon or financial sunday had been able to know what was happening with the two wizards he could have written up a news story calculated to electrify all america  for the truth was that tomlinson the wizard of finance was attempting to carry out a coup greater than any as yet attributed to him by the press he was trying to lose his money that in the sickness of his soul crushed by the grand palaver overwhelmed with the burden of high finance had become his aim to be done with it to get rid of his whole fortune  but if you own a fortune that is computed anywhere from fifty millions up with no limit at the top if you own onehalf of all the preferred stock of an erie auriferous consolidated that is digging gold in hydraulic bucketfuls from a quarter of a mile of river bed the task of losing it is no easy matter  there are men no doubt versed in finance who might succeed in doing it but they have a training that tomlinson lacked invest it as he would in the worst securities that offered the most rickety of stock the most fraudulent bonds back it came to him when he threw a handful away back came two in its place and at every new coup the crowd applauded the incomparable daring the unparalleled prescience of the wizard  like the touch of midas his hand turned everything to gold  mother he repeated its no use its like this here destiny as the books call it                            the great fortune that tomlinson the wizard of finance was trying his best to lose had come to him with wonderful suddenness as yet it was hardly six months old as to how it had originated there were all sorts of stories afloat in the weekly illustrated press they agreed mostly on the general basis that tomlinson had made his vast fortune by his own indomitable pluck and dogged industry some said that he had been at one time a mere farm hand who by sheer doggedness had fought his way from the haymow to the control of the produce market of seventeen states others had it that he had been a lumberjack who by sheer doggedness had got possession of the whole lumber forest of the lake district others said that he had been a miner in a lake superior copper mine who had by the doggedness of his character got a practical monopoly of the copper supply these saturday articles at any rate made the saturday reader rigid with sympathetic doggedness himself which was all that the editor who was doggedly trying to make the paper pay wanted to effect  but in reality the making of tomlinsons fortune was very simple the recipe for it is open to anyone it is only necessary to own a hillside farm beside lake erie where the uncleared bush and the broken fields go straggling down to the lake and to have running through it a creek such as that called tomlinsons brawling among the stones and willows and to discover in the bed of a creeka gold mine  that is all  nor is it necessary in these wellordered days to discover the gold for ones self one might have lived a lifetime on the farm as tomlinsons father had and never discover it for ones self for that indeed the best medium of destiny is a geologist let us say the senior professor of geology at plutoria university that was how it happened  the senior professor so it chanced was spending his vacation near by on the shores of the lake and his time was mostly passedfor how better can a man spend a month of pleasurein looking for outcroppings of devonian rock of the posttertiary period for which purpose he carried a vacation hammer in his pocket and made from time to time a note or two as he went along or filled his pockets with the chippings of vacation rocks  so it chanced that he came to tomlinsons creek at the very point where a great slab of devonian rock bursts through the clay of the bank when the senior professor of geology saw it and noticed a stripe like a mark on a tigers backa fault he called itthat ran over the face of the block he was at it in an instant beating off fragments with his little hammer  tomlinson and his boy fred were logging in the underbrush near by with a long chain and yoke of oxen but the geologist was so excited that he did not see them till the sound of his eager hammer had brought them to his side they took him up to the frame house in the clearing where the chatelaine was hoeing a potato patch with a mans hat on her head and they gave him buttermilk and soda cakes but his hand shook so that he could hardly eat them  the geologist left cahoga station that night for the city with a newspaper full of specimens inside his suitcase and he knew that if any person or persons would put up money enough to tear that block of rock away and follow the fissure down there would be found there something to astonish humanity geologists and all                            after that point in the launching of a gold mine the rest is easy generous warmhearted men interested in geology were soon found there was no stint of money the great rock was torn sideways from its place and from beneath it the crumbled glittering rockdust that sparkled in the sun was sent in little boxes to the testing laboratories of plutoria university there the senior professor of geology had sat up with it far into the night in a darkened laboratory with little blue flames playing underneath crucibles as in a magicians cavern and with the door locked and as each sample that he tested was set aside and tied in a cardboard box by itself he labelled it aur p 75 and the pen shook in his hand as he marked it for to professors of geology those symbols mean this is seventyfive per cent pure gold so it was no wonder that the senior professor of geology working far into the night among the blue flames shook with excitement not of course for the golds sake as money he had no time to think of that but because if this thing was true it meant that an auriferous vein had been found in what was devonian rock of the posttertiary stratification and if that was so it upset enough geology to spoil a textbook it would mean that the professor could read a paper at the next pangeological conference that would turn the whole assembly into a bedlam  it pleased him too to know that the men he was dealing with were generous they had asked him to name his own price or the tests that he made and when he had said two dollars per sample they had told him to go right ahead the professor was not i suppose a mercenary man but it pleased him to think that he could clean up sixteen dollars in a single evening in his laboratory it showed at any rate that businessmen put science at its proper value strangest of all was the fact that the men had told him that even this ore was apparently nothing to what there was it had all come out of one single spot in the creek not the hundredth part of the whole claim lower down where they had thrown the big dam across to make the bed dry they were taking out this same stuff and even better so they said in cartloads the hydraulic dredges were tearing it from the bed of the creek all day and at night a great circuit of arc lights gleamed and sputtered over the roaring labour of the friends of geological research  thus had the erie auriferous consolidated broken in a tidal wave over financial circles on the stock exchange in the downtown offices and among the palm trees of the mausoleum club they talked of nothing else and so great was the power of the wave that it washed tomlinson and his wife along on the crest of it and landed them fifty feet up in their thousanddollar suite in the grand palaver and as a result of it mother wore a beetleback jacket and tomlinson received a hundred telegrams a day and fred quit school and ate chocolates  but in the business world the most amazing thing about it was the wonderful shrewdness of tomlinson  the first sign of it had been that he had utterly refused to allow the erie auriferous consolidated as the friends of geology called themselves to take over the top half of the tomlinson farm for the bottom part he let them give him onehalf of the preferred stock in the company in return for their supply of development capital this was their own proposition in fact they reckoned that in doing this they were trading about two hundred thousand dollars worth of machinery for say ten million dollars of gold but it frightened them when tomlinson said yes to the offer and when he said that as to common stock they might keep it it was no use to him they were alarmed and uneasy till they made him take a block of it for the sake of market confidence  but the top end of the farm he refused to surrender and the friends of applied geology knew that there must be something pretty large behind this refusal the more so as the reason that tomlinson gave was such a simple one he said that he didnt want to part with the top end of the place because his father was buried on it beside the creek and so he didnt want the dam higher up not for any consideration  this was regarded in business circles as a piece of great shrewdness says his father is buried there eh devilish shrewd that  it was so long since any of the members of the exchange or the mausoleum club had wandered into such places as cahoga county that they did not know that there was nothing strange in what tomlinson said his father was buried there on the farm itself in a grave overgrown with raspberry bushes and with a wooden headstone encompassed by a square of cedar rails and slept as many another pioneer of cahoga is sleeping  devilish smart idea they said and forthwith half the financial men of the city buried their fathers or professed to have done so in likely placesalong the prospective rightofway of a suburban railway for example in fact in any place that marked them out for the joyous resurrection of an expropriation purchase  thus the astounding shrewdness of tomlinson rapidly became a legend the more so as he turned everything he touched to gold  they narrated little stories of him in the whiskeyandsoda corners of the mausoleum club  i put it to him in a casual way related for example mr lucullus fyshe casually but quite frankly i said see here this is just a bagatelle to you no doubt but to me it might be of some use t c bonds i said have risen twentytwo and a half in a week you know as well as i do that they are only collateral trust and that the stock underneath never could and never can earn a par dividend now i said mr tomlinson tell me what all that means would you believe it the fellow looked me right in the face in that queer way he has and he said i dont know  he said he didnt know repeated the listener in a tone of amazement and respect by jove eh he said he didnt know the mans a wizard  and he looked as if he didnt went on mr fyshe thats the deuce of it that man when he wants to can put on a look sir that simply means nothing absolutely nothing  in this way tomlinson had earned his name of the wizard of american finance  and meantime tomlinson and his wife within their suite at the grand palaver had long since reached their decision for there was one aspect and only one in which tomlinson was really and truly a wizard he saw clearly that for himself and his wife the vast fortune that had fallen to them was of no manner of use what did it bring them the noise and roar of the city in place of the silence of the farm and the racket of the great rotunda to drown the remembered murmur of the waters of the creek  so tomlinson had decided to rid himself of his new wealth save only such as might be needed to make his son a different kind of man from himself  for fred of course he said its different but out of such a lot as that itll be easy to keep enough for him itll be a grand thing for fred this money he wont have to grow up like you and me hell have opportunities we never got he was getting them already the opportunity to wear seven dollar patent leather shoes and a bellshaped overcoat with a silk collar to lounge into movingpicture shows and eat chocolates and smoke cigarettesall these opportunities he was gathering immediately presently when he learned his way round a little he would get still bigger ones  hes improving fast said mother she was thinking of his patent leather shoes  hes popular said his father i notice it downstairs he sasses any of them just as he likes and no matter how busy they are as soon as they see its fred theyre all ready to have a laugh with him  certainly they were as any hotel clerk with plastered hair is ready to laugh with the son of a multimillionaire its a certain sense of humour that they develop  but for us mother said the wizard well be rid of it the gold is there its not right to keep it back but well just find a way to pass it on to folks that need it worse than we do  for a time they had thought of giving away the fortune but how who did they know that would take it  it had crossed their mindsfor who could live in the city a month without observing the imposing buildings of plutoria university as fine as any departmental store in townthat they might give it to the college  but there it seemed the way was blocked  you see mother said the puzzled wizard were not known were strangers id look fine going up there to the college and saying i want to give you people a million dollars theyd laugh at me  but dont one read it in the papers his wife had protested where mr carnegie gives ever so much to the colleges more than all weve got and they take it  thats different said the wizard hes in with them they all know him why hes a sort of chairman of different boards of colleges and he knows all the heads of the schools and the professors so its no wonder that if he offers to give a pension or anything they take it just think of me going up to one of the professors up there in the middle of his teaching and saying id like to give you a pension for life imagine it think what hed say  but the tomlinsons couldnt imagine it which was just as well  so it came about that they had embarked on their system mother who knew most arithmetic was the leading spirit she tracked out all the stocks and bonds in the front page of the financial undertone and on her recommendation the wizard bought they knew the stocks only by their letters but this itself gave a touch of high finance to their deliberations  id buy some of this rop if i was you said mother its gone down from 127 to 107 in two days and i reckon itll be all gone in ten days or so  wouldnt gg deb be better it goes down quicker  well its a quick one she assented but it dont go down so steady you cant rely on it you take ones like rop and trr pfd they go down all the time and you know where you are  as a result of which tomlinson would send his instructions he did it all from the rotunda in a way of his own that he had evolved with a telegraph clerk who told him the names of brokers and he dealt thus through brokers whom he never saw as a result of this the sluggish rop and trr would take as sudden a leap into the air as might a mule with a galvanic shock applied to its tail at once the word was whispered that the tomlinson interests were after the rop to reorganize it and the whole floor of the exchange scrambled for the stock  and so it was that after a month or two of these operations the wizard of finance saw himself beaten  its no good mother he repeated its just a kind of destiny  destiny perhaps it was  but if the wizard of finance had known it at this very moment when he sat with the aladdins palace of his golden fortune reared so strangely about him destiny was preparing for him still stranger things  destiny so it would seem was devising its own ways and means of dealing with tomlinsons fortune as one of the ways and means destiny was sending at this moment as its special emissaries two huge portly figures wearing gigantic goloshes and striding downwards from the halls of plutoria university to the grand palaver hotel and one of these was the gigantic dr boomer the president of the college and the other was his professor of greek almost as gigantic as himself and they carried in their capacious pockets bundles of pamphlets on archaeological remains of mitylene and the use of the greek pluperfect and little treatises such as education and philanthropy by dr boomer and the excavation of mitylene an estimate of cost by dr boyster boomer on the foundation and maintenance of chairs etc  many a man in city finance who had seen dr boomer enter his office with a bundle of these monographs and a fighting glitter in his eyes had sunk back in his chair in dismay for it meant that dr boomer had tracked him out for a benefaction to the university and that all resistance was hopeless  when dr boomer once laid upon a capitalists desk his famous pamphlet on the use of the greek pluperfect it was as if an arabian sultan had sent the fatal bowstring to a condemned pasha or morgan the buccaneer had served the deathsign on a shuddering pirate  so they came nearer and nearer shouldering the passersby the sound of them as they talked was like the roaring of the sea as homer heard it never did castor and pollux come surging into battle as dr boomer and dr boyster bore down upon the grand palaver hotel  tomlinson the wizard of finance had hesitated about going to the university the university was coming to him as for those millions of his he could take his choicedormitories apparatus campuses buildings endowment anything he liked but choose he must and if he feared that after all his fortune was too vast even for such a disposal dr boomer would show him how he might use it in digging up ancient mitylene or modern smyrna or the lost cities of the plain of pactolus if the size of the fortune troubled him dr boomer would dig him up the whole african sahara from alexandria to morocco and ask for more  but if destiny held all this for tomlinson in its outstretched palm before it it concealed stranger things still beneath the folds of its toga  there were enough surprises there to turn the faces of the whole directorate of the erie auriferous consolidated as yellow as the gold they mined  for at this very moment while the president of plutoria university drew nearer and nearer to the grand palaver hotel the senior professor of geology was working again beside the blue flames in his darkened laboratory and this time there was no shaking excitement over him nor were the labels that he marked as sample followed sample in the tests the same as those of the previous marking not by any means  and his grave face as he worked in silence was as still as the stones of the posttertiary period    chapter three the arrested philanthropy of mr tomlinson  this mr tomlinson is our campus said president boomer as they passed through the iron gates of plutoria university  for camping said the wizard  not exactly answered the president though it would of course suit for that nihil humunum alienum eh and he broke into a loud explosive laugh while his spectacles irradiated that peculiar form of glee derived from a latin quotation by those able to enjoy it dr boyster walking on the other side of mr tomlinson joined in the laugh in a deep reverberating chorus  the two had the wizard of finance between them and they were marching him up to the university he was taken along much as is an arrested man who has promised to go quietly they kept their hands off him but they watched him sideways through their spectacles at the least sign of restlessness they doused him with latin the wizard of finance having been marked out by dr boomer and dr boyster as a prospective benefactor was having latin poured over him to reduce him to the proper degree of plasticity  they had already put him through the first stage they had three days ago called on him at the grand palaver and served him with a pamphlet on the excavation of mitylene as a sort of writ tomlinson and his wife had looked at the pictures of the ruins and from the appearance of them they judged that mitylene was in mexico and they said that it was a shame to see it in that state and that the united states ought to intervene  as the second stage on the path of philanthropy the wizard of finance was now being taken to look at the university dr boomer knew by experience that no rich man could look at it without wanting to give it money  and here the president had found that there is no better method of dealing with businessmen than to use latin on them for other purposes the president used other things for example at a friendly dinner at the mausoleum club where light conversation was in order dr boomer chatted as has been seen on the archaeological remains of the navajos in the same way at mrs rasselyerbrowns dante luncheons he generally talked of the italian cinquecentisti and whether gian gobbo della scala had left a greater name than can grande della spiggiola but such talk as that was naturally only for women businessmen are much too shrewd for that kind of thing in fact so shrewd are they as president boomer had long since discovered that nothing pleases them so much as the quiet firm assumption that they know latin it is like writing them up an asset so it was that dr boomer would greet a business acquaintance with a roaring salutation of terque quaterque beatus or stand wringing his hand off to the tune of oh et presidium et dulce decus meum  this caught them every time  you dont said tomlinson the wizard in a hesitating tone as he looked at the smooth grass of the campus i suppose raise anything on it  no no this is only for field sports said the president sunt quos curriculo  to which dr boyster on the other side added like a chorus pulverem olympicum  this was their favourite quotation it always gave president boomer a chance to speak of the final letter m in latin poetry and to say that in his opinion the socalled elision of the final m was more properly a dropping of the vowel with a repercussion of the two last consonants he supported this by quoting ammianus at which dr boyster exclaimed pooh ammianus more dog latin and appealed to mr tomlinson as to whether any rational man nowadays cared what ammianus thought  to all of which tomlinson answered never a word but looked steadily first at one and then at the other dr boomer said afterwards that the penetration of tomlinson was wonderful and that it was excellent to see how boyster tried in vain to draw him and boyster said afterwards that the way in which tomlinson quietly refused to be led on by boomer was delicious and that it was a pity that aristophanes was not there to do it justice  all of which was happening as they went in at the iron gates and up the elm avenue of plutoria university  the university as everyone knows stands with its great gates on plutoria avenue and with its largest buildings those of the faculties of industrial and mechanical science fronting full upon the street  these buildings are exceptionally fine standing fifteen stories high and comparing favourably with the best departmental stores or factories in the city indeed after nightfall when they are all lighted up for the evening technical classes and when their testing machinery is in full swing and there are students going in and out in overall suits people have often mistaken the university or this newer part of it for a factory a foreign visitor once said that the students looked like plumbers and president boomer was so proud of it that he put the phrase into his next commencement address and from there the newspapers got it and the associated press took it up and sent it all over the united states with the heading have appearance of plumbers plutoria university congratulated on character of students and it was a proud day indeed for the heads of the industrial science faculty  but the older part of the university stands so quietly and modestly at the top end of the elm avenue so hidden by the leaves of it that no one could mistake it for a factory this indeed was once the whole university and had stood there since colonial days under the name concordia college it had been filled with generations of presidents and professors of the older type with long white beards and rusty black clothes and salaries of fifteen hundred dollars  but the change both of name and of character from concordia college to plutoria university was the work of president boomer he had changed it from an oldfashioned college of the bygone type to a university in the true modern sense at plutoria they now taught everything concordia college for example had no teaching of religion except lectures on the bible now they had lectures also on confucianism mohammedanism buddhism with an optional course on atheism for students in the final year  and of course they had long since admitted women and there were now beautiful creatures with cleo de merode hair studying astronomy at oaken desks and looking up at the teacher with eyes like comets the university taught everything and did everything it had whirling machines on the top of it that measured the speed of the wind and deep in its basements it measured earthquakes with a seismograph it held classes on forestry and dentistry and palmistry it sent life classes into the slums and death classes to the city morgue it offered such a vast variety of themes topics and subjects to the students that there was nothing that a student was compelled to learn while from its own presses in its own pressbuilding it sent out a shower of bulletins and monographs like driven snow from a rotary plough  in fact it had become as president boomer told all the businessmen in town not merely a university but a universitas in the true sense and every one of its faculties was now a facultas in the real acceptance of the word and its studies properly and truly studia indeed if the businessmen would only build a few more dormitories and put up enough money to form an adequate fondatum or fundum then the good work might be looked upon as complete  as the three walked up the elm avenue there met them a little stream of students with college books and female students with wingedvictory hats and professors with last years overcoats and some went past with a smile and others with a shiver  thats professor withers said the president in a sympathetic voice as one of the shivering figures went past poor withers and he sighed  whats wrong with him said the wizard is he sick  no not sick said the president quietly and sadly merely inefficient  inefficient  unfortunately so mind you i dont mean inefficient in every sense by no means if anyone were to come to me and say boomer can you put your hand for me on a firstclass botanist id say take withers id say it in a minute this was true he would have in fact if anyone had made this kind of rash speech dr boomer would have given away half the professoriate  well whats wrong with him repeated tomlinson i suppose he aint quite up to the mark in some ways eh  precisely said the president not quite up to the marka very happy way of putting it capax imperii nisi imperasset as no doubt you are thinking to yourself the fact is that withers though an excellent fellow cant manage large classes with small classes he is all right but with large classes the man is lost he cant handle them  he cant eh said the wizard  no but what can i do there he is i cant dismiss him i cant pension him ive no money for it  here the president slackened a little in his walk and looked sideways at the prospective benefactor but tomlinson gave no sign  a second professorial figure passed them on the other side  there again said the president thats another case of inefficiencyprofessor shottat our senior professor of english  whats wrong with him asked the wizard  he cant handle small classes said the president with large classes he is really excellent but with small ones the man is simply hopeless  in this fashion before mr tomlinson had measured the length of the avenue he had had ample opportunity to judge of the crying need of money at plutoria university and of the perplexity of its president he was shown professors who could handle the first year but were powerless with the second others who were all right with the second but broke down with the third while others could handle the third but collapsed with the fourth there were professors who were all right in their own subject but perfectly impossible outside of it others who were so occupied outside of their own subject that they were useless inside of it others who knew their subject but couldnt lecture and others again who lectured admirably but didnt know their subject  in short it was clearas it was meant to bethat the need of the moment was a sum of money sufficient to enable the president to dismiss everybody but himself and dr boyster the latter stood in a class all by himself he had known the president for fortyfive years ever since he was a fat little boy with spectacles in a classical academy stuffing himself on irregular greek verbs as readily as if on oysters  but it soon appeared that the need for dismissing the professors was only part of the trouble there were the buildings to consider  this i am ashamed to say said dr boomer as they passed the imitation greek portico of the old concordia college building is our original home the fons et origo of our studies our faculty of arts  it was indeed a dilapidated building yet there was a certain majesty about it too especially when one reflected that it had been standing there looking much the same at the time when its students had trooped off in a flock to join the army of the potomac and much the same indeed three generations before that when the classes were closed and the students clapped threecornered hats on their heads and were off to enlist as minute men with flintlock muskets under general washington  but dr boomers one idea was to knock the building down and to build on its site a real facultas ten storeys high with elevators in it  tomlinson looked about him humbly as he stood in the main hall the atmosphere of the place awed him there were bulletins and timetables and notices stuck on the walls that gave evidence of the activity of the place professor slithers will be unable to meet his classes today ran one of them and another professor withers will not meet his classes this week and another owing to illness professor shottat will not lecture this month while still another announced owing to the indisposition of professor podge all botanical classes are suspended but professor podge hopes to be able to join in the botanical picnic excursion to loon lake on saturday afternoon you could judge of the grinding routine of the work from the nature of these notices anyone familiar with the work of colleges would not heed it but it shocked tomlinson to think how often the professors of the college were stricken down by overwork  here and there in the hall set into niches were bronze busts of men with roman faces and bare necks and the edge of a toga cast over each shoulder  who would these be asked tomlinson pointing at them some of the chief founders and benefactors of the faculty answered the president and at this the hopes of tomlinson sank in his heart for he realized the class of man one had to belong to in order to be accepted as a university benefactor  a splendid group of men are they not said the president we owe them much this is the late mr hogworth a man of singularly large heart here he pointed to a bronze figure wearing a wreath of laurel and inscribed guliemus hogworth litt doc he had made a great fortune in the produce business and wishing to mark his gratitude to the community he erected the anemometer the windmeasure on the roof of the building attaching to it no other condition than that his name should be printed in the weekly reports immediately beside the velocity of the wind the figure beside him is the late mr underbugg who founded our lectures on the four gospels on the sole stipulation that henceforth any reference of ours to the four gospels should be coupled with his name  whats that after his name asked tomlinson  litt doc said the president doctor of letters our honorary degree we are always happy to grant it to our benefactors by a vote of the faculty  here dr boomer and dr boyster wheeled half round and looked quietly and steadily at the wizard of finance to both their minds it was perfectly plain that an honourable bargain was being struck  yes mr tomlinson said the president as they emerged from the building no doubt you begin to realize our unhappy position money money money he repeated halfmusingly if i had the money id have that whole building down and dismantled in a fortnight  from the central building the three passed to the museum building where tomlinson was shown a vast skeleton of a diplodocus maximus and was specially warned not to confuse it with the dinosaurus perfectus whose bones however could be bought if anyone any man of large heart would come to the university and say straight out gentlemen what can i do for you better still it appeared the whole museum which was hopelessly antiquated being twentyfive years old could be entirely knocked down if a sufficient sum was forthcoming and its curator who was as ancient as the dinosaurus itself could be dismissed on halfpay if any man had a heart large enough for the dismissal  from the museum they passed to the library where there were fulllength portraits of more founders and benefactors in long red robes holding scrolls of paper and others sitting holding pens and writing on parchment with a greek temple and a thunderstorm in the background  and here again it appeared that the crying need of the moment was for someone to come to the university and say gentlemen what can i do for you on which the whole library for it was twenty years old and out of date might be blown up with dynamite and carted away  but at all this the hopes of tomlinson sank lower and lower the red robes and the scrolls were too much for him  from the library they passed to the tall buildings that housed the faculty of industrial and mechanical science and here again the same pitiful lack of money was everywhere apparent for example in the physical science department there was a mass of apparatus for which the university was unable to afford suitable premises and in the chemical department there were vast premises for which the university was unable to buy apparatus and so on indeed it was part of dr boomers method to get himself endowed first with premises too big for the apparatus and then by appealing to public spirit to call for enough apparatus to more than fill the premises by means of which system industrial science at plutoria university advanced with increasing and gigantic strides  but most of all the electric department interested the wizard of finance and this time his voice lost its hesitating tone and he looked straight at dr boomer as he began  i have a boy  ah said dr boomer with a huge ejaculation of surprise and relief you have a boy  there were volumes in his tone what it meant was now indeed we have got you where we want you and he exchanged a meaning look with the professor of greek  within five minutes the president and tomlinson and dr boyster were gravely discussing on what terms and in what way fred might be admitted to study in the faculty of industrial science the president on learning that fred had put in four years in cahoga county section no 3 school and had been head of his class in ciphering nodded his head gravely and said it would simply be a matter of a pro tanto that in fact he felt sure that fred might be admitted ad eundem but the real condition on which they meant to admit him was of course not mentioned  one door only in the faculty of industrial and mechanical science they did not pass a heavy oak door at the end of a corridor bearing the painted inscription geological and metallurgical laboratories stuck in the door was a card with the words they were conceived in the courteous phrases of mechanical science which is almost a branch of business in the real sense busykeep out  dr boomer looked at the card ah yes he said gildas is no doubt busy with his tests we wont disturb him the president was always proud to find a professor busy it looked well  but if dr boomer had known what was going on behind the oaken door of the department of geology and metallurgy he would have felt considerably disturbed himself  for here again gildas senior professor of geology was working among his blue flames at a final test on which depended the fate of the erie auriferous consolidated and all connected with it  before him there were some twenty or thirty packets of crumpled dust and splintered ore that glittered on the testingtable it had been taken up from the creek along its whole length at even spaces twenty yards apart by an expert sent down in haste by the directorate after gildass second report and heavily bribed to keep his mouth shut  and as professor gildas stood and worked at the samples and tied them up after analysis in little white cardboard boxes he marked each one very carefully and neatly with the words pyrites worthless  beside the professor worked a young demonstrator of last years graduation class it was he in fact who had written the polite notice on the card  what is the stuff anyway he asked  a sulphuret of iron said the professor or iron pyrites in colour and appearance it is practically identical with gold indeed in all ages he went on dropping at once into the classroom tone and adopting the professional habit of jumping backwards twenty centuries in order to explain anything properly it has been readily mistaken for the precious metal the ancients called it fools gold martin frobisher brought back four shiploads of it from baffin land thinking that he had discovered an eldorado there are large deposits of it in the mines of cornwall and it is just possible here the professor measured his words as if speaking of something that he wouldnt promise that the cassiterides of the phoenicians contained deposits of the same sulphuret indeed i defy anyone he continued for he was piqued in his scientific pride to distinguish it from gold without a laboratorytest in large quantities i concede its lack of weight would betray it to a trained hand but without testing its solubility in nitric acid or the fact of its burning with a blue flame under the blowpipe it cannot be detected in short when crystallized in dodecahedrons  is it any good broke in the demonstrator  good said the professor oh you mean commercially not in the slightest much less valuable than let us say ordinary mud or clay in fact it is absolutely good for nothing  they were silent for a moment watching the blue flames above the brazier  then gildas spoke again oddly enough he said the first set of samples were undoubtedly pure goldnot the faintest doubt of that that is the really interesting part of the matter these gentlemen concerned in the enterprise will of course lose their money and i shall therefore decline to accept the very handsome fee which they had offered me for my services but the main feature the real point of interest in this matter remains here we have undoubtedly a sporadic depositwhat miners call a pocketof pure gold in a devonian formation of the posttertiary period this once established we must revise our entire theory of the distribution of igneous and aqueous rocks in fact i am already getting notes together for a paper for the pangeological under the heading auriferous excretions in the devonian strata a working hypothesis i hope to read it at the next meeting  the young demonstrator looked at the professor with one eye halfclosed  i dont think i would if i were you he said  now this young demonstrator knew nothing or practically nothing of geology because he came of one of the richest and best families in town and didnt need to but he was a smart young man dressed in the latest fashion with brown boots and a crosswise tie and he knew more about money and business and the stock exchange in five minutes than professor gildas in his whole existence  why not said the professor  why dont you see whats happened  eh said gildas  what happened to those first samples when that bunch got interested and planned to float the company dont you see somebody salted them on you  salted them on me repeated the professor mystified  yes salted them somebody got wise to what they were and swopped them on you for the real thing so as to get your certified report that the stuff was gold  i begin to see muttered the professor somebody exchanged the samples some person no doubt desirous of establishing the theory that a sporadic outcropping of the sort might be found in a posttertiary formation i see i see no doubt he intended to prepare a paper on it and prove his thesis by these tests i see it all  the demonstrator looked at the professor with a sort of pity  youre on he said and he laughed softly to himself                            well said dr boomer after tomlinson had left the university what do you make of him the president had taken dr boyster over to his house beside the campus and there in his study had given him a cigar as big as a rope and taken another himself this was a sign that dr boomer wanted dr boysters opinion in plain english without any latin about it  remarkable man said the professor of greek wonderful penetration and a man of very few words of course his game is clear enough  entirely so asserted dr boomer  its clear enough that he means to give the money on two conditions  exactly said the president  first that we admit his son who is quite unqualified to the senior studies in electrical science and second that we grant him the degree of doctor of letters those are his terms can we meet them  oh certainly as to the son there is no difficulty of course as to the degree its only a question of getting the faculty to vote it i think we can manage it                            vote it they did that very afternoon true if the members of the faculty had known the things that were being whispered and more than whispered in the city about tomlinson and his fortune no degree would ever have been conferred on him but it so happened that at that moment the whole professoriate was absorbed in one of those great educational crises which from time to time shake a university to its base the meeting of the faculty that day bid fair to lose all vestige of decorum in the excitement of the moment for as dean elderberry foible the head of the faculty said the motion that they had before them amounted practically to a revolution the proposal was nothing less than the permission of the use of leadpencils instead of pen and ink in the sessional examinations of the university anyone conversant with the inner life of a college will realize that to many of the professoriate this was nothing less than a last wild onslaught of socialistic democracy against the solid bulwarks of society they must fight it back or die on the walls to others it was one more step in the splendid progress of democratic education comparable only to such epochmaking things as the abandonment of the cap and gown and the omission of the word sir in speaking to a professor  no wonder that the fight raged elderberry foible his fluffed white hair almost on end beat in vain with his gavel for order finally chang of physiology who was a perfect dynamo of energy and was known frequently to work for three or four hours at a stretch proposed that the faculty should adjourn the question and meet for its further discussion on the following saturday morning this revolutionary suggestion involving work on saturday reduced the meeting to a mere turmoil in the midst of which elderberry foible proposed that the whole question of the use of leadpencils should be adjourned till that day six months and that meantime a new special committee of seventeen professors with power to add to their number to call witnesses and if need be to hear them should report on the entire matter de novo this motion after the striking out of the words de novo and the insertion of ab initio was finally carried after which the faculty sank back completely exhausted into its chair the need of afternoon tea and toast stamped on every face  and it was at this moment that president boomer who understood faculties as few men have done quietly entered the room laid his silk hat on a volume of demosthenes and proposed the vote of a degree of doctor of letters for edward tomlinson he said that there was no need to remind the faculty of tomlinsons services to the nation they knew them of the members of the faculty indeed some thought that he meant the tomlinson who wrote the famous monologue on the iota subscript while others supposed that he referred to the celebrated philosopher tomlinson whose new book on the indivisibility of the inseparable was just then maddening the entire world in any case they voted the degree without a word still faint with exhaustion                            but while the university was conferring on tomlinson the degree of doctor of letters all over the city in business circles they were conferring on him far other titles idiot scoundrel swindler were the least of them every stock and share with which his name was known to be connected was coming down with a run wiping out the accumulated profits of the wizard at the rate of a thousand dollars a minute  they not only questioned his honesty but they went further and questioned his business capacity  the man said mr lucullus fyshe sitting in the mausoleum club and breathing freely at last after having disposed of all his holdings in the erie auriferous is an ignoramus i asked him only the other day quite casually a perfectly simple business question i said to him tc bonds have risen twentytwo and a half in a week you know and i know that they are only collateral trust and that the stock underneath never could and never would earn a par dividend now i said for i wanted to test the fellow tell me what that means would you believe me he looked me right in the face in that stupid way of his and he said i dont know  he said he didnt know repeated the listener contemptuously the man is a damn fool                            the reason of all this was that the results of the researches of the professor of geology were being whispered among the directorate of the erie auriferous and the directors and chief shareholders were busily performing the interesting process called unloading nor did ever a farmer of cahoga county in haying time with a thunderstorm threatening unload with greater rapidity than did the major shareholders of the auriferous mr lucullus fyshe traded off a quarter of his stock to an unwary member of the mausoleum club at a drop of thirty per cent and being too prudent to hold the rest on any terms he conveyed it at once as a benefaction in trust to the plutorian orphans and foundlings home while the purchaser of mr fyshes stock learning too late of his folly rushed for his lawyers to have the shares conveyed as a gift to the home for incurables  mr asmodeus boulder transferred his entire holdings to the imbeciles relief society and mr furlong senior passed his over to a chinese mission as fast as pen could traverse paper  down at the office of skinyer and beatem the lawyers of the company they were working overtime drawing up deeds and conveyances and trusts in perpetuity with hardly time to put them into typewriting within twentyfour hours the entire stock of the company bid fair to be in the hands of idiots orphans protestants foundlings imbeciles missionaries chinese and other unfinancial people with tomlinson the wizard of finance as the senior shareholder and majority control and whether the gentle wizard as he sat with mother planning his vast benefaction to plutoria university would have felt more at home with his new group of fellowshareholders than his old it were hard to say  but meantime at the office of skinyer and beatem all was activity for not only were they drafting the conveyances of the perpetual trusts as fast as legal brains working overtime could do it but in another part of the office a section of the firm were busily making their preparations against the expected actions for fraud and warrants of distraint and injunctions against disposal of assets and the whole battery of artillery which might open on them at any moment and they worked like a corps of military engineers fortifying an escarpment with the joy of battle in their faces  the storm might break at any moment already at the office of the financial undertone the type was set for a special extra with a heading three inches high               collapse      of the erie consolidated     arrest of the man tomlinson        expected this afternoon  skinyer and beatem had paid the editor who was crooked two thousand dollars cash to hold back that extra for twentyfour hours and the editor had paid the reporting staff who were crooked twentyfive dollars each to keep the news quiet and the compositors who were also crooked ten dollars per man to hold their mouths shut till the morning with the result that from editors and subeditors and reporters and compositors the news went seething forth in a flood that the erie auriferous consolidated was going to shatter into fragments like the bursting of a dynamite bomb it rushed with a thousand whispering tongues from street to street till it filled the corridors of the law courts and the lobbies of the offices and till every honest man that held a share of the stock shivered in his tracks and reached out to give sell or destroy it only the unwinking idiots and the mild orphans and the calm deaf mutes and the impassive chinese held tight to what they had so gathered the storm till all the town like the great rotunda of the grand palaver was filled with a silent call for mr tomlinson voiceless and ominous  and while all this was happening and while at skinyer and beatems they worked with frantic pens and clattering type there came a knock at the door hesitant and uncertain and before the eyes of the astounded office there stood in his wideawake hat and long black coat the figure of the man tomlinson himself  and skinyer the senior partner no sooner heard what tomlinson wanted than he dashed across the outer office to his partners room with his hyena face all excitement as he said  beatem beatem come over to my room this man is absolutely the biggest thing in america for sheer calmness and nerve i never heard of anything to approach him what do you think he wants to do  what said beatem  why hes giving his entire fortune to the university  by gad ejaculated beatem and the two lawyers looked at one another lost in admiration of the marvellous genius and assurance of tomlinson                            yet what had happened was very simple  tomlinson had come back from the university filled with mingled hope and hesitation the university he saw needed the money and he hoped to give it his entire fortune to put dr boomer in a position to practically destroy the whole place but like many a modest man he lacked the assurance to speak out he felt that up to the present the benefactors of the university had been men of an entirely different class from himself it was mother who solved the situation for him  well father she said theres one thing ive learned already since weve had money if you want to get a thing done you can always find people to do it for you if you pay them why not go to those lawyers that manage things for the company and get them to arrange it all for you with the college  as a result tomlinson had turned up at the door of the skinyer and beatem office                            quite so mr tomlinson said skinyer with his pen already dipped in the ink a perfectly simple matter i can draw up a draft of conveyance with a few strokes of the pen in fact we can do it on the spot  what he meant was in fact we can do it so fast that i can pocket a fee of five hundred dollars right here and now while you have the money to pay me  now then he continued let us see how it is to run  well said tomlinson i want you to put it that i give all my stock in the company to the university  all of it said skinyer with a quiet smile to beatem  every cent of it sir said tomlinson just write down that i give all of it to the college  very good said skinyer and he began to write i soandso and soandso of the county of soandsocahoga i think you said mr tomlinson  yes sir said the wizard i was raised there  do hereby give assign devise transfer and the transfer is hereby given devised and assigned all those stocks shares hereditaments etc which i hold in the etc etc all several and whateveryou will observe mr tomlinson i am expressing myself with as great brevity as possibleto that institution academy college school university now known and reputed to be plutoria university of the city of etc etc  he paused a moment now what special objects or purposes shall i indicate he asked  whereupon tomlinson explained as best he could and skinyer working with great rapidity indicated that the benefaction was to include a demolition fund for the removal of buildings a retirement fund for the removal of professors an apparatus fund for the destruction of apparatus and a general sinking fund for the obliteration of anything not otherwise mentioned  and id like to do something if i could for mr boomer himself just as man to man said tomlinson  all right said beatem and he could hardly keep his face straight give him a chunk of the stockgive him half a million  i will said tomlinson he deserves it  undoubtedly said mr skinyer  and within a few minutes the whole transaction was done and tomlinson filled with joy was wringing the hands of skinyer and beatem and telling them to name their own fee  they had meant to anyway                            is that legal do you suppose said beatem to skinyer after the wizard had gone will it hold water  oh i dont think so said skinyer not for a minute in fact rather the other way if they make an arrest for fraudulent flotation this conveyance i should think would help to send him to the penitentiary but i very much doubt if they can arrest him mind you the fellow is devilish shrewd you know and i know that he planned this whole flotation with a full knowledge of the fraud you and i know itvery goodbut we know it more from our trained instinct in such things than by any proof the fellow has managed to surround himself with such an air of good faith from start to finish that it will be deuced hard to get at him  what will he do now said beatem  i tell you what hell do mark my words within twentyfour hours hell clear out and be out of the state and if they want to get him theyll have to extradite i tell you hes a man of extraordinary capacity the rest of us are nowhere beside him  in which perhaps there was some truth                            well mother said the wizard when he reached the thousanddollar suite after his interview with skinyer and beatem his face irradiated with simple joy its done ive put the college now in a position it never was in before nor any other college the lawyers say so themselves  thats good said mother  yes and its a good thing i didnt lose the money when i tried to you see mother what i hadnt realized was the good that could be done with all that money if a man put his heart into it they can start in as soon as they like and tear down those buildings my but its just wonderful what you can do with money im glad i didnt lose it  so they talked far into the evening that night they slept in an aladdins palace filled with golden fancies  and in the morning the palace and all its visions fell tumbling about their heads in sudden and awful catastrophe for with tomlinsons first descent to the rotunda it broke the whole great space seemed filled with the bulletins and the broadside sheets of the morning papers the crowd surging to and fro buying the papers men reading them as they stood and everywhere in great letters there met his eye              collapse       of the erie auriferous       the great gold swindle     arrest of the man tomlinson       expected this morning  so stood the wizard of finance beside a pillar the paper fluttering in his hand his eyes fixed while about him a thousand eager eyes and rushing tongues sent shame into his stricken heart  and there his boy fred sent from upstairs found him and at the sight of the seething crowd and his fathers stricken face aged as it seemed all in a moment the boys soul woke within him what had happened he could not tell only that his father stood there dazed beaten and staring at him on every side in giant letters       arrest of the man tomlinson  come father come upstairs he said and took him by the arm dragging him through the crowd  in the next halfhour as they sat and waited for the arrest in the false grandeur of the thousanddollar suitetomlinson his wife and fredthe boy learnt more than all the teaching of the industrial faculty of plutoria university could have taught him in a decade adversity laid its hand upon him and at its touch his adolescent heart turned to finer stuff than the salted gold of the erie auriferous as he looked upon his fathers broken figure waiting meekly for arrest and his mothers blubbered face a great wrath burned itself into his soul  when the sheriff comes said tomlinson and his lip trembled as he spoke he had no other picture of arrest than that  they cant arrest you father broke out the boy youve done nothing you never swindled them i tell you if they try to arrest you ill and his voice broke and stopped upon a sob and his hands clenched in passion  you stay here you and mother ill go down give me your money and ill go and pay them and well get out of this and go home they cant stop us theres nothing to arrest you for  nor was there fred paid the bill unmolested save for the prying eyes and babbling tongues of the rotunda  and a few hours from that while the town was still ringing with news of his downfall the wizard with his wife and son walked down from their thousanddollar suite into the corridor their hands burdened with their satchels a waiter with something between a sneer and an obsequious smile upon his face reached out for the valises wondering if it was still worth while  you get to hell out of that said fred he had put on again his rough store suit in which he had come from cahoga county and there was a dangerous look about his big shoulders and his set jaw and the waiter slunk back  so did they pass unarrested and unhindered through corridor and rotunda to the outer portals of the great hotel  beside the door of the palaver as they passed out was a tall official with a uniform and a round hat he was called by the authorities a chasseur or a commissionaire or some foreign name to mean that he did nothing  at the sight of him the wizards face flushed for a moment with a look of his old perplexity  i wonder he began to murmur how much i ought  not a damn cent father said fred as he shouldered past the magnificent chasseur let him work  with which admirable doctrine the wizard and his son passed from the portals of the grand palaver                            nor was there any arrest either then or later in spite of the expectations of the rotunda and the announcements of the financial undertone the man tomlinson was not arrested neither as he left the grand palaver nor as he stood waiting at the railroad station with fred and mother for the outgoing train for cahoga county  there was nothing to arrest him for that was not the least strange part of the career of the wizard of finance for when all the affairs of the erie auriferous consolidated were presently calculated up by the labours of skinyer and beatem and the legal representatives of the orphans and the idiots and the deafmutes they resolved themselves into the most beautiful and complete cipher conceivable the salted gold about paid for the cost of the incorporation certificate the development capital had disappeared and those who lost most preferred to say the least about it and as for tomlinson if one added up his gains on the stock market before the fall and subtracted his bill at the grand palaver and the thousand dollars which he gave to skinyer and beatem to recover his freehold on the lower half of his farm and the cost of three tickets to cahoga station the debit and credit account balanced to a hair  thus did the whole fortune of tomlinson vanish in a night even as the golden palace seen in the mirage of a desert sunset may fade before the eyes of the beholder and leave no trace behind                            it was some months after the collapse of the erie auriferous that the university conferred upon tomlinson the degree of doctor of letters in absentia a university must keep its word and dean elderberry foible who was honesty itself had stubbornly maintained that a vote of the faculty of arts once taken and written in the minute book became as irrefragable as the devonian rock itself  so the degree was conferred and dean elderberry foible standing in a long red gown before dr boomer seated in a long blue gown read out after the ancient custom of the college the latin statement of the award of the degree of doctor of letters eduardus tomlinsonius vir clarrisimus doctissimus praestissimus and a great many other things all ending in issimus  but the recipient was not there to receive he stood at that moment with his boy fred on a windy hillside beside lake erie where tomlinsons creek ran again untrammelled to the lake nor was the scene altered to the eye for tomlinson and his son had long since broken a hole in the dam with pickaxe and crowbar and day by day the angry water carried down the vestiges of the embankment till all were gone the cedar poles of the electric lights had been cut into fencerails the wooden shanties of the italian gang of auriferous workers had been torn down and split into fire wood and where they had stood the burdocks and the thistles of the luxuriant summer conspired to hide the traces of their shame nature reached out its hand and drew its coverlet of green over the grave of the vanished eldorado  and as the wizard and his son stood upon the hillside they saw nothing but the land sloping to the lake and the creek murmuring again to the willows while the offshore wind rippled the rushes of the shallow water    chapter four the yahibahi oriental society of mrs rasselyerbrown  mrs rasselyerbrown lived on plutoria avenue in a vast sandstone palace in which she held those fashionable entertainments which have made the name of rasselyerbrown what it is mr rasselyerbrown lived there also  the exterior of the house was more or less a model of the facade of an italian palazzo of the sixteenth century if one questioned mrs rasselyerbrown at dinner in regard to this which was only a fair return for drinking five dollar champagne she answered that the facade was cinquecentisti but that it reproduced also the saracenic mullioned window of the siennese school but if the guest said later in the evening to mr rasselyerbrown that he understood that his house was cinquecentisti he answered that he guessed it was after which remark and an interval of silence mr rasselyerbrown would probably ask the guest if he was dry  so from that one can tell exactly the sort of people the rasselyerbrowns were  in other words mr rasselyerbrown was a severe handicap to mrs rasselyerbrown he was more than that the word isnt strong enough he was as mrs rasselyerbrown herself confessed to her confidential circle of three hundred friends a drag he was also a tie and a weight and a burden and in mrs rasselyerbrowns religious moments a crucifix even in the early years of their married life some twenty or twentyfive years ago her husband had been a drag on her by being in the coal and wood business it is hard for a woman to have to realize that her husband is making a fortune out of coal and wood and that people know it it ties one down what a woman wants most of allthis of course is merely a quotation from mrs rasselyerbrowns own thoughts as expressed to her three hundred friendsis room to expand to grow the hardest thing in the world is to be stifled and there is nothing more stifling than a husband who doesnt know a giotto from a carlo dolci but who can distinguish nut coal from egg and is never asked to dinner without talking about the furnace  these of course were early trials they had passed to some extent or were at any rate garlanded with the roses of time  but the drag remained  even when the retail coal and wood stage was long since over it was hard to have to put up with a husband who owned a coal mine and who bought pulp forests instead of illuminated missals of the twelfth century a coal mine is a dreadful thing at a dinnertable it humbles one so before ones guests  it wouldnt have been so badthis mrs rasselyerbrown herself admittedif mr rasselyerbrown did anything this phrase should be clearly understood it meant if there was any one thing that he did for instance if he had only collected anything thus there was mr lucullus fyshe who made sodawater but at the same time everybody knew that he had the best collection of broken italian furniture on the continent there wasnt a sound piece among the lot  and there was the similar example of old mr feathertop he didnt exactly collect things he repudiated the name he was wont to say dont call me a collector im not i simply pick things up just where i happen to be rome warsaw bucharest anywhereand it is to be noted what fine places these are to happen to be and to think that mr rasselyerbrown would never put his foot outside of the united states whereas mr feathertop would come back from what he called a run to europe and everybody would learn in a week that he had picked up the back of a violin in dresden actually discovered it in a violin shop and the lid of an etruscan kettle he had lighted on it by pure chance in a kettle shop in etruria and mrs rasselyerbrown would feel faint with despair at the nonentity of her husband  so one can understand how heavy her burden was  my dear she often said to her bosom friend miss snagg i shouldnt mind things so much the things she wouldnt mind were let us say the two million dollars of standing timber which brown limited the ominous business name of mr rasselyerbrown were buying that year if mr rasselyerbrown did anything but he does nothing every morning after breakfast off to his wretched office and never back till dinner and in the evening nothing but his club or some business meeting one would think he would have more ambition how i wish i had been a man  it was certainly a shame  so it came that in almost everything she undertook mrs rasselyerbrown had to act without the least help from her husband every wednesday for instance when the dante club met at her house they selected four lines each week to meditate on and then discussed them at lunch mrs rasselyerbrown had to carry the whole burden of ither very phrase the whole burdenalone anyone who has carried four lines of dante through a moselle lunch knows what a weight it is  in all these things her husband was useless quite useless it is not right to be ashamed of ones husband and to do her justice mrs rasselyerbrown always explained to her three hundred intimates that she was not ashamed of him in fact that she refused to be but it was hard to see him brought into comparison at their own table with superior men put him for instance beside mr sikleigh snoop the sexpoet and where was he nowhere he couldnt even understand what mr snoop was saying and when mr snoop would stand on the hearthrug with a cup of tea balanced in his hand and discuss whether sex was or was not the dominant note in botticelli mrs rasselyerbrown would be skulking in a corner in his illfitting dress suit his wife would often catch with an agonized ear such scraps of talk as when i was first in the coal and wood business or its a coal that burns quicker than egg but it hasnt the heating power of nut or even in a low undertone the words if youre feeling dry while hes reading and this at a time when everybody in the room ought to have been listening to mr snoop  nor was even this the whole burden of mrs rasselyerbrown there was another part of it which was perhaps more real though mrs rasselyerbrown herself never put it into words in fact of this part of her burden she never spoke even to her bosom friend miss snagg nor did she talk about it to the ladies of the dante club nor did she make speeches on it to the members of the womens afternoon art society nor to the monday bridge club  but the members of the bridge club and the art society and the dante club all talked about it among themselves  stated very simply it was this mr rasselyerbrown drank it was not meant that he was a drunkard or that he drank too much or anything of that sort he drank that was all  there was no excess about it mr rasselyerbrown of course began the day with an eyeopenerand after all what alert man does not wish his eyes well open in the morning he followed it usually just before breakfast with a bracerand what wiser precaution can a businessman take than to brace his breakfast on his way to business he generally had his motor stopped at the grand palaver for a moment if it was a raw day and dropped in and took something to keep out the damp if it was a cold day he took something to keep out the cold and if it was one of those clear sunny days that are so dangerous to the system he took whatever the bartender a recognized health expert suggested to tone the system up after which he could sit down in his office and transact more business and bigger business in coal charcoal wood pulp pulpwood and woodpulp in two hours than any other man in the business could in a week naturally so for he was braced and propped and toned up and his eyes had been opened and his brain cleared till outside of very big business indeed few men were on a footing with him  in fact it was business itself which had compelled mr rasselyerbrown to drink it is all very well for a junior clerk on twenty dollars a week to do his work on sandwiches and malted milk in big business it is not possible when a man begins to rise in business as mr rasselyerbrown had begun twentyfive years ago he finds that if he wants to succeed he must cut malted milk clear out in any position of responsibility a man has got to drink no really big deal can be put through without it if two keen men sharp as flint get together to make a deal in which each intends to outdo the other the only way to succeed is for them to adjourn to some such place as the luncheonroom of the mausoleum club and both get partially drunk this is what is called the personal element in business and beside it plodding industry is nowhere  most of all do these principles hold true in such manly outofdoor enterprises as the forest and timber business where one deals constantly with chief rangers and pathfinders and woodstalkers whose very names seem to suggest a horn of whiskey under a hemlock tree  butlet it be repeated and carefully understoodthere was no excess about mr rasselyerbrowns drinking indeed whatever he might be compelled to take during the day and at the mausoleum club in the evening after his return from his club at night mr rasselyerbrown made it a fixed rule to take nothing he might perhaps as he passed into the house step into the diningroom and take a very small drink at the sideboard but this he counted as part of the return itself and not after it and he might if his brain were overfatigued drop down later in the night in his pajamas and dressinggown when the house was quiet and compose his mind with a brandy and water or something suitable to the stillness of the hour but this was not really a drink mr rasselyerbrown called it a nip and of course any man may need a nip at a time when he would scorn a drink                            but after all a woman may find herself again in her daughter there at least is consolation for as mrs rasselyerbrown herself admitted her daughter dulphemia was herself again there were of course differences certain differences of face and appearance mr snoop had expressed this fact exquisitely when he said that it was the difference between a burnejones and a dante gabriel rossetti but even at that the mother and daughter were so alike that people certain people were constantly mistaking them on the street and as everybody that mistook them was apt to be asked to dine on fivedollar champagne there was plenty of temptation towards error  there is no doubt that dulphemia rasselyerbrown was a girl of remarkable character and intellect so is any girl who has beautiful golden hair parted in thick bands on her forehead and deep blue eyes soft as an italian sky  even the oldest and most serious men in town admitted that in talking to her they were aware of a grasp a reach a depth that surprised them thus old judge longerstill who talked to her at dinner for an hour on the jurisdiction of the interstate commerce commission felt sure from the way in which she looked up in his face at intervals and said how interesting that she had the mind of a lawyer and mr brace the consulting engineer who showed her on the tablecloth at dessert with three forks and a spoon the method in which the overflow of the spillway of the gatun dam is regulated felt assured from the way she leaned her face on her hand sideways and said how extraordinary that she had the brain of an engineer similarly foreign visitors to the social circles of the city were delighted with her viscount fitzthistle who explained to dulphemia for half an hour the intricacies of the irish situation was captivated at the quick grasp she showed by asking him at the end without a seconds hesitation and which are the nationalists  this kind of thing represents female intellect in its best form every man that is really a man is willing to recognize it at once as to the young men of course they flocked to the rasselyerbrown residence in shoals there were batches of them every sunday afternoon at five oclock encased in long black frockcoats sitting very rigidly in upright chairs trying to drink tea with one hand one might see athletic young college men of the football team trying hard to talk about italian music and italian tenors from the grand opera doing their best to talk about college football there were young men in business talking about art and young men in art talking about religion and young clergymen talking about business because of course the rasselyerbrown residence was the kind of cultivated home where people of education and taste are at liberty to talk about things they dont know and to utter freely ideas that they havent got it was only now and again when one of the professors from the college across the avenue came booming into the room that the whole conversation was pulverized into dust under the hammer of accurate knowledge  the whole process was what was called by those who understood such things a salon many people said that mrs rasselyerbrowns afternoons at home were exactly like the delightful salons of the eighteenth century and whether the gatherings were or were not salons of the eighteenth century there is no doubt that mr rasselyerbrown under whose care certain favoured guests dropped quietly into the back alcove of the diningroom did his best to put the gathering on a par with the best saloons of the twentieth  now it so happened that there had come a singularly slack moment in the social life of the city the grand opera had sung itself into a huge deficit and closed there remained nothing of it except the efforts of a committee of ladies to raise enough money to enable signor puffi to leave town and the generous attempt of another committee to gather funds in order to keep signor pasti in the city beyond this opera was dead though the fact that the deficit was nearly twice as large as it had been the year before showed that public interest in music was increasing it was indeed a singularly trying time of the year it was too early to go to europe and too late to go to bermuda it was too warm to go south and yet still too cold to go north in fact one was almost compelled to stay at homewhich was dreadful  as a result mrs rasselyerbrown and her three hundred friends moved backwards and forwards on plutoria avenue seeking novelty in vain they washed in waves of silk from tango teas to bridge afternoons they poured in liquid avalanches of colour into crowded receptions and they sat in glittering rows and listened to lectures on the enfranchisement of the female sex but for the moment all was weariness  now it happened whether by accident or design that just at this moment of general ennui mrs rasselyerbrown and her three hundred friends first heard of the presence in the city of mr yahibahi the celebrated oriental mystic he was so celebrated that nobody even thought of asking who he was or where he came from they merely told one another and repeated it that he was the celebrated yahibahi they added for those who needed the knowledge that the name was pronounced yahhybahhy and that the doctrine taught by mr yahibahi was boohooism this latter if anyone inquired further was explained to be a form of shoodooism only rather more intense in fact it was esotericon receipt of which information everybody remarked at once how infinitely superior the oriental peoples are to ourselves  now as mrs rasselyerbrown was always a leader in everything that was done in the best circles on plutoria avenue she was naturally among the first to visit mr yahibahi  my dear she said in describing afterwards her experience to her bosom friend miss snagg it was most interesting we drove away down to the queerest part of the city and went to the strangest little house imaginable up the narrowest stairs one ever sawquite eastern in fact just like a scene out of the koran  how fascinating said miss snagg but as a matter of fact if mr yahibahis house had been inhabited as it might have been by a streetcar conductor or a railway brakesman mrs rasselyerbrown wouldnt have thought it in any way peculiar or fascinating  it was all hung with curtains inside she went on with figures of snakes and indian gods perfectly weird  and did you see mr yahibahi asked miss snagg  oh no my dear i only saw his assistant mr ram spudd such a queer little round man a bengalee i believe he put his back against a curtain and spread out his arms sideways and wouldnt let me pass he said that mr yahibahi was in meditation and mustnt be disturbed  how delightful echoed miss snagg  but in reality mr yahibahi was sitting behind the curtain eating a tencent can of pork and beans  what i like most about eastern people went on mrs rasselyerbrown is their wonderful delicacy of feeling after i had explained about my invitation to mr yahibahi to come and speak to us on boohooism and was going away i took a dollar bill out of my purse and laid it on the table you should have seen the way mr ram spudd took it he made the deepest salaam and said isis guard you beautiful lady such perfect courtesy and yet with the air of scorning the money as i passed out i couldnt help slipping another dollar into his hand and he took it as if utterly unaware of it and muttered osiris keep you o flower of women and as i got into the motor i gave him another dollar and he said osis and osiris both prolong your existence o lily of the ricefield and after he had said it he stood beside the door of the motor and waited without moving till i left he had such a strange rapt look as if he were still expecting something  how exquisite murmured miss snagg it was her business in life to murmur such things as this for mrs rasselyerbrown on the whole reckoning grand opera tickets and dinners she did very well out of it  is it not said mrs rasselyerbrown so different from our men i felt so ashamed of my chauffeur our new man you know he seemed such a contrast beside ram spudd the rude way in which the opened the door and the rude way in which he climbed on to his own seat and the rudeness with which he turned on the poweri felt positively ashamed and he so managed iti am sure he did it on purposethat the car splashed a lot of mud over mr spudd as it started  yet oddly enough the opinion of other people on this new chauffeur that of miss dulphemia rasselyerbrown herself for example to whose service he was specially attached was very different  the great recommendation of him in the eyes of miss dulphemia and her friends and the thing that gave him a touch of mystery wasand what higher qualification can a chauffeur wantthat he didnt look like a chauffeur at all  my dear dulphie whispered miss philippa furlong the rectors sister who was at that moment dulphemias second self as they sat behind the new chauffeur dont tell me that he is a chauffeur because he isnt he can chauffe of course but thats nothing  for the new chauffeur had a bronzed face hard as metal and a stern eye and when he put on a chauffeurs overcoat some how it seemed to turn into a military greatcoat and even when he put on the round cloth cap of his profession it was converted straightway into a military shako and by miss dulphemia and her friends it was presently reportedor was inventedthat he had served in the philippines which explained at once the scar upon his forehead which must have been received at iloilo or huilahuila or some other suitable place  but what affected miss dulphemia brown herself was the splendid rudeness of the chauffeurs manner it was so different from that of the young men of the salon thus when mr sikleigh snoop handed her into the car at any time he would dance about saying allow me and permit me and would dive forward to arrange the robes but the philippine chauffeur merely swung the door open and said to dulphemia get in and then slammed it  this of course sent a thrill up the spine and through the imagination of miss dulphemia rasselyerbrown because it showed that the chauffeur was a gentleman in disguise she thought it very probable that he was a british nobleman a younger son very wild of a ducal family and she had her own theories as to why he had entered the service of the rasselyerbrowns to be quite candid about it she expected that the philippine chauffeur meant to elope with her and every time he drove her from a dinner or a dance she sat back luxuriously wishing and expecting the elopement to begin                            but for the time being the interest of dulphemia as of everybody else that was anybody at all centred round mr yahibahi and the new cult of boohooism  after the visit of mrs rasselyerbrown a great number of ladies also in motors drove down to the house of mr yahibahi and all of them whether they saw mr yahibahi himself or his bengalee assistant mr ram spudd came back delighted  such exquisite tact said one such delicacy as i was about to go i laid a five dollar gold piece on the edge of the little table mr spudd scarcely seemed to see it he murmured osiris help you and pointed to the ceiling i raised my eyes instinctively and when i lowered them the money had disappeared i think he must have caused it to vanish  oh im sure he did said the listener  others came back with wonderful stories of mr yahibahis occult powers especially his marvellous gift of reading the future  mrs buncomhearst who had just lost her third husbandby divorcehad received from mr yahibahi a glimpse into the future that was almost uncanny in its exactness she had asked for a divination and mr yahibahi had effected one by causing her to lay six tendollar pieces on the table arranged in the form of a mystic serpent over these he had bent and peered deeply as if seeking to unravel their meaning and finally he had given her the prophecy many things are yet to happen before others begin  how does he do it asked everybody                            as a result of all this it naturally came about that mr yahibahi and mr ram spudd were invited to appear at the residence of mrs rasselyerbrown and it was understood that steps would be taken to form a special society to be known as the yahibahi oriental society  mr sikleigh snoop the sexpoet was the leading spirit in the organization he had a special fitness for the task he had actually resided in india in fact he had spent six weeks there on a stopover ticket of a roundtheworld 635 dollar steamship pilgrimage and he knew the whole country from jehumbapore in bhootal to jehumbalabad in the carnatic so he was looked upon as a great authority on india china mongolia and all such places by the ladies of plutoria avenue  next in importance was mrs buncomhearst who became later by a perfectly natural process the president of the society she was already president of the daughters of the revolution a society confined exclusively to the descendants of washingtons officers and others she was also president of the sisters of england an organization limited exclusively to women born in england and elsewhere of the daughters of kossuth made up solely of hungarians and friends of hungary and other nations and of the circle of franz joseph which was composed exclusively of the partisans and others of austria in fact ever since she had lost her third husband mrs buncomhearst had thrown herselfthat was her phraseinto outside activities her one wish was on her own statement to lose herself so very naturally mrs rasselyerbrown looked at once to mrs buncomhearst to preside over the meetings of the new society                            the large diningroom at the rasselyerbrowns had been cleared out as a sort of auditorium and in it some fifty or sixty of mrs rasselyerbrowns more intimate friends had gathered the whole meeting was composed of ladies except for the presence of one or two men who represented special cases there was of course little mr spillikins with his vacuous face and football hair who was there as everybody knew on account of dulphemia and there was old judge longerstill who sat leaning on a goldheaded stick with his head sideways trying to hear some fraction of what was being said he came to the gathering in the hope that it would prove a likely place for seconding a vote of thanks and saying a few wordshalf an hours talk perhapson the constitution of the united states failing that he felt sure that at least someone would call him this eminent old gentleman and even that was better than staying at home  but for the most part the audience was composed of women and they sat in a little buzz of conversation waiting for mr yahibahi  i wonder called mrs buncomhearst from the chair if some lady would be good enough to write minutes miss snagg i wonder if you would be kind enough to write minutes could you  i shall be delighted said miss snagg but im afraid theres hardly time to write them before we begin is there  oh but it would be all right to write them afterwards chorussed several ladies who understood such things its quite often done that way  and i should like to move that we vote a constitution said a stout lady with a double eyeglass  is that carried said mrs buncomhearst all those in favour please signify  nobody stirred  carried said the president and perhaps you would be good enough mrs fyshe she said turning towards the stout lady to write the constitution  do you think it necessary to write it said mrs fyshe i should like to move if i may that i almost wonder whether it is necessary to write the constitutionunless of course anybody thinks that we really ought to  ladies said the president you have heard the motion all those against it  there was no sign  all those in favour of it  there was still no sign  lost she said  then looking across at the clock on the mantelpiece and realizing that mr yahibahi must have been delayed and that something must be done she said  and now ladies as we have in our midst a most eminent gentleman who probably has thought more deeply about constitutions than  all eyes turned at once towards judge longerstill but as fortune had it at this very moment mr sikleigh snoop entered followed by mr yahibahi and mr ram spudd  mr yahibahi was tall his drooping oriental costume made him taller still he had a long brown face and liquid brown eyes of such depth that when he turned them full upon the ladies before him a shiver of interest and apprehension followed in the track of his glance  my dear said miss snagg afterwards he seemed simply to see right through us  this was correct he did  mr ram spudd presented a contrast to his superior he was short and round with a dimpled mahogany face and eyes that twinkled in it like little puddles of molasses his head was bound in a turban and his body was swathed in so many bands and sashes that he looked almost circular the clothes of both mr yahibahi and ram spudd were covered with the mystic signs of buddha and the seven serpents of vishnu  it was impossible of course for mr yahibahi or mr ram spudd to address the audience their knowledge of english was known to be too slight for that their communications were expressed entirely through the medium of mr snoop and even he explained afterwards that it was very difficult the only languages of india which he was able to speak he said with any fluency were gargamic and gumaic both of these being old dravidian dialects with only two hundred and three words in each and hence in themselves very difficult to converse in mr yahibahi answered in what mr snoop understood to be the iramic of the vedas a very rich language but one which unfortunately he did not understand the dilemma is one familiar to all oriental scholars  all of this mr snoop explained in the opening speech which he proceeded to make and after this he went on to disclose amid deep interest the general nature of the cult of boohooism he said that they could best understand it if he told them that its central doctrine was that of bahee indeed the first aim of all followers of the cult was to attain to bahee anybody who could spend a certain number of hours each day say sixteen in silent meditation on boohooism would find his mind gradually reaching a condition of bahee the chief aim of bahee itself was sacrifice a true follower of the cult must be willing to sacrifice his friends or his relatives and even strangers in order to reach bahee in this way one was able fully to realize oneself and enter into the higher indifference beyond this further meditation and fastingby which was meant living solely on fish fruit wine and meatone presently attained to complete swaraj or control of self and might in time pass into the absolute nirvana or the negation of emptiness the supreme goal of boohooism  as a first step to all this mr snoop explained each neophyte or candidate for holiness must after searching his own heart send ten dollars to mr yahibahi gold it appeared was recognized in the cult of boohooism as typifying the three chief virtues whereas silver or paper money did not even national banknotes were only regarded as do or a halfway palliation and outside currencies such as canadian or mexican bills were looked upon as entirely boo or contemptible the oriental view of money said mr snoop was far superior to our own but it also might be attained by deep thought and as a beginning by sending ten dollars to mr yahibahi  after this mr snoop in conclusion read a very beautiful hindu poem translating it as he went along it began o cow standing beside the ganges and apparently without visible occupation and it was voted exquisite by all who heard it the absence of rhyme and the entire removal of ideas marked it as far beyond anything reached as yet by occidental culture  when mr snoop had concluded the president called upon judge longerstill for a few words of thanks which he gave followed by a brief talk on the constitution of the united states  after this the society was declared constituted mr yahibahi made four salaams one to each point of the compass and the meeting dispersed  and that evening over fifty dinner tables everybody discussed the nature of bahee and tried in vain to explain it to men too stupid to understand                            now it so happened that on the very afternoon of this meeting at mrs rasselyerbrowns the philippine chauffeur did a strange and peculiar thing he first asked mr rasselyerbrown for a few hours leave of absence to attend the funeral of his mother inlaw this was a request which mr rasselyerbrown on principle never refused to a manservant  whereupon the philippine chauffeur no longer attired as one visited the residence of mr yahibahi he let himself in with a marvellous little key which he produced from a very wonderful bunch of such he was in the house for nearly half an hour and when he emerged the notebook in his breast pocket had there been an eye to read it would have been seen to be filled with stranger details in regard to oriental mysticism than even mr yahibahi had given to the world so strange were they that before the philippine chauffeur returned to the rasselyerbrown residence he telegraphed certain and sundry parts of them to new york but why he should have addressed them to the head of a detective bureau instead of to a college of oriental research it passes the imagination to conceive but as the chauffeur duly reappeared at motortime in the evening the incident passed unnoticed                            it is beyond the scope of the present narrative to trace the progress of boohooism during the splendid but brief career of the yahibahi oriental society there could be no doubt of its success its principles appealed with great strength to all the more cultivated among the ladies of plutoria avenue there was something in the oriental mysticism of its doctrines which rendered previous belief stale and puerile the practice of the sacred rites began at once the ladies counters of the plutorian banks were inundated with requests for tendollar pieces in exchange for banknotes at dinner in the best houses nothing was eaten except a thin soup or bru followed by fish succeeded by meat or by game especially such birds as are particularly pleasing to buddha as the partridge the pheasant and the woodcock after this except for fruits and wine the principle of swaraj or denial of self was rigidly imposed special oriental dinners of this sort were given followed by listening to the reading of oriental poetry with closed eyes and with the mind as far as possible in a state of stoj or negation of thought  by this means the general doctrine of boohooism spread rapidly indeed a great many of the members of the society soon attained to a stage of bahee or the higher indifference that it would have been hard to equal outside of juggapore or jumbumbabad for example when mrs buncomhearst learned of the remarriage of her second husbandshe had lost him three years before owing to a difference of opinion on the emancipation of womenshe showed the most complete bahee possible and when miss snagg learned that her brother in venezuela had dieda very sudden death brought on by drinking rum for seventeen yearsand had left her ten thousand dollars the bahee which she exhibited almost amounted to nirvana  in fact the very general dissemination of the oriental idea became more and more noticeable with each week that passed some members attained to so complete a bahee or higher indifference that they even ceased to attend the meetings of the society others reached a swaraj or control of self so great that they no longer read its pamphlets while others again actually passed into nirvana to a complete negation of self so rapidly that they did not even pay their subscriptions  but features of this sort of course are familiar wherever a successful occult creed makes its way against the prejudices of the multitude  the really notable part of the whole experience was the marvellous demonstration of occult power which attended the final seance of the society the true nature of which is still wrapped in mystery  for some weeks it had been rumoured that a very special feat or demonstration of power by mr yahibahi was under contemplation in fact the rapid spread of swaraj and of nirvana among the members rendered such a feat highly desirable just what form the demonstration would take was for some time a matter of doubt it was whispered at first that mr yahibahi would attempt the mysterious eastern rite of burying ram spudd alive in the garden of the rasselyerbrown residence and leaving him there in a state of stoj or suspended inanition for eight days but this project was abandoned owing to some doubt apparently in the mind of mr ram spudd as to his astral fitness for the high state of stoj necessitated by the experiment  at last it became known to the members of the poosh or inner circle under the seal of confidence that mr yahibahi would attempt nothing less than the supreme feat of occultism namely a reincarnation or more correctly a reastralization of buddha  the members of the inner circle shivered with a luxurious sense of mystery when they heard of it  has it ever been done before they asked of mr snoop  only a few times he said once i believe by jambum the famous yogi of the carnatic once perhaps twice by boohoo the founder of the sect but it is looked upon as extremely rare mr yahi tells me that the great danger is that if the slightest part of the formula is incorrectly observed the person attempting the astralization is swallowed up into nothingness however he declares himself willing to try                            the seance was to take place at mrs rasselyerbrowns residence and was to be at midnight  at midnight said each member in surprise and the answer was yes at midnight you see midnight here is exactly midday in allahabad in india  this explanation was of course ample midnight repeated everybody to everybody else is exactly midday in allahabad that made things perfectly clear whereas if midnight had been midday in timbuctoo the whole situation would have been different  each of the ladies was requested to bring to the seance some ornament of gold but it must be plain gold without any setting of stones  it was known already that according to the cult of boohooism gold plain gold is the seat of the three virtuesbeauty wisdom and grace therefore according to the creed of boohooism anyone who has enough gold plain gold is endowed with these virtues and is all right all that is needed is to have enough of it the virtues follow as a consequence  but for the great experiment the gold used must not be set with stones with the one exception of rubies which are known to be endowed with the three attributes of hindu worship modesty loquacity and pomposity  in the present case it was found that as a number of ladies had nothing but gold ornaments set with diamonds a second exception was made especially as mr yahibahi on appeal decided that diamonds though less pleasing to buddha than rubies possessed the secondary hindu virtues of divisibility movability and disposability  on the evening in question the residence of mrs rasselyerbrown might have been observed at midnight wrapped in utter darkness no lights were shown a single taper brought by ram spudd from the taj mohal and resembling in its outer texture those sold at the fiveandten store near mr spudds residence burned on a small table in the vast diningroom the servants had been sent upstairs and expressly enjoined to retire at half past ten moreover mr rasselyerbrown had had to attend that evening at the mausoleum club a meeting of the trustees of the church of st asaph and he had come home at eleven oclock as he always did after diocesan work of this sort quite used up in fact so fatigued that he had gone upstairs to his own suite of rooms sideways his knees bending under him so utterly used up was he with his church work that as far as any interest in what might be going on in his own residence he had attained to a state of bahee or higher indifference that even buddha might have envied  the guests as had been arranged arrived noiselessly and on foot all motors were left at least a block away they made their way up the steps of the darkened house and were admitted without ringing the door opening silently in front of them mr yahibahi and mr ram spudd who had arrived on foot carrying a large parcel were already there and were behind a screen in the darkened room reported to be in meditation  at a whispered word from mr snoop who did duty at the door all furs and wraps were discarded in the hall and laid in a pile then the guests passed silently into the great dining room there was no light in it except the dim taper which stood on a little table on this table each guest as instructed laid an ornament of gold and at the same time was uttered in a low voice the word ksvoo this means o buddha i herewith lay my unworthy offering at thy feet take it and keep it for ever it was explained that this was only a form                            what is he doing whispered the assembled guests as they saw mr yahibahi pass across the darkened room and stand in front of the sideboard  hush said mr snoop hes laying the propitiatory offering for buddha  its an indian rite whispered mrs rasselyerbrown  mr yahibahi could be seen dimly moving to and fro in front of the sideboard there was a faint clinking of glass  he has to set out a glass of burmese brandy powdered over with nutmeg and aromatics whispered mrs rasselyerbrown i had the greatest hunt to get it all for him he said that nothing but burmese brandy would do because in the hindu religion the god can only be invoked with burmese brandy or failing that hennessys with three stars which is not entirely displeasing to buddha  the aromatics whispered mr snoop are supposed to waft a perfume or incense to reach the nostrils of the god the glass of propitiatory wine and the aromatic spices are mentioned in the vishnubuddayat  mr yahibahi his preparations completed was now seen to stand in front of the sideboard bowing deeply four times in an oriental salaam the light of the single taper had by this time burned so dim that his movements were vague and uncertain his body cast great flickering shadows on the halfseen wall from his throat there issued a low wail in which the word wah wah could be distinguished  the excitement was intense  what does wah mean whispered mr spillikins  hush said mr snoop it means o buddha wherever thou art in thy lofty nirvana descend yet once in astral form before our eyes  mr yahibahi rose he was seen to place one finger on his lips and then silently moving across the room he disappeared behind the screen of what mr ram spudd was doing during this period there is no record it was presumed that he was still praying  the stillness was now absolute  we must wait in perfect silence whispered mr snoop from the extreme tips of his lips  everybody sat in strained intensity silent looking towards the vague outline of the sideboard  the minutes passed no one moved all were spellbound in expectancy  still the minutes passed the taper had flickered down till the great room was almost in darkness  could it be that by some neglect in the preparations the substitution perhaps of the wrong brandy the astralization could not be effected  but no  quite suddenly it seemed everybody in the darkened room was aware of a presence that was the word as afterwards repeated in a hundred confidential discussions a presence one couldnt call it a body it wasnt it was a figure an astral form a presence  buddha they gasped as they looked at it  just how the figure entered the room the spectators could never afterwards agree some thought it appeared through the wall deliberately astralizing itself as it passed through the bricks others seemed to have seen it pass in at the farther door of the room as if it had astralized itself at the foot of the stairs in the back of the hall outside  be that as it may there it stood before them the astralized shape of the indian deity so that to every lip there rose the halfarticulated word buddha or at least to every lip except that of mrs rasselyerbrown from her there came no sound  the figure as afterwards described was attired in a long shirak such as is worn by the grand llama of tibet and resembling if the comparison were not profane a modern dressinggown the legs if one might so call them of the apparition were enwrapped in loose punjahamas a word which is said to be the origin of the modern pyjamas while the feet if they were feet were encased in loose slippers  buddha moved slowly across the room arrived at the sideboard the astral figure paused and even in the uncertain light buddha was seen to raise and drink the propitiatory offering that much was perfectly clear whether buddha spoke or not is doubtful certain of the spectators thought that he said must a fagotnit which is hindustanee for blessings on this house to mrs rasselyerbrowns distracted mind it seemed as if buddha said i must have forgotten it but this wild fancy she never breathed to a soul  silently buddha recrossed the room slowly wiping one arm across his mouth after the hindu gesture of farewell  for perhaps a full minute after the disappearance of buddha not a soul moved then quite suddenly mrs rasselyerbrown unable to stand the tension any longer pressed an electric switch and the whole room was flooded with light  there sat the affrighted guests staring at one another with pale faces  but to the amazement and horror of all the little table in the centre stood emptynot a single gem not a fraction of the gold that had lain upon it was left all had disappeared  the truth seemed to burst upon everyone at once there was no doubt of what had happened  the gold and the jewels had been deastralized under the occult power of the vision they had been demonetized engulfed into the astral plane along with the vanishing buddha  filled with the sense of horror still to come somebody pulled aside the little screen they fully expected to find the lifeless bodies of mr yahibahi and the faithful ram spudd what they saw before them was more dreadful still the outer oriental garments of the two devotees lay strewn upon the floor the long sash of yahibahi and the thick turban of ram spudd were side by side near them almost sickening in its repulsive realism was the thick black head of hair of the junior devotee apparently torn from his scalp as if by lightning and bearing a horrible resemblance to the castoff wig of an actor  the truth was too plain  they are engulfed cried a dozen voices at once  it was realized in a flash that yahibahi and ram spudd had paid the penalty of their daring with their lives through some fatal neglect against which they had fairly warned the participants of the seance the two orientals had been carried bodily in the astral plane  how dreadful murmured mr snoop we must have made some awful error  are they deastralized murmured mrs buncomhearst  not a doubt of it said mr snoop  and then another voice in the group was heard to say we must hush it up we cant have it known  on which a chorus of voices joined in everybody urging that it must be hushed up  couldnt you try to reastralize them said somebody to mr snoop  no no said mr snoop still shaking better not try to we must hush it up if we can  and the general assent to this sentiment showed that after all the principles of bahee or indifference to others had taken a real root in the society  hush it up cried everybody and there was a general move towards the hall  good heavens exclaimed mrs buncomhearst our wraps  deastralized said the guests  there was a moment of further consternation as everybody gazed at the spot where the illfated pile of furs and wraps had lain  never mind said everybody lets go without themdont stay just think if the police should  and at the word police all of a sudden there was heard in the street the clanging of a bell and the racing gallop of the horses of the police patrol wagon  the police cried everybody hush it up hush it up for of course the principles of bahee are not known to the police  in another moment the doorbell of the house rang with a long and violent peal and in a second as it seemed the whole hall was filled with bulky figures uniformed in blue  its all right mrs rasselyerbrown cried a loud firm voice from the sidewalk we have them both everything is here we got them before theyd gone a block but if you dont mind the police must get a couple of names for witnesses in the warrant  it was the philippine chauffeur but he was no longer attired as such he wore the uniform of an inspector of police and there was the metal badge of the detective department now ostentatiously outside his coat  and beside him one on each side of him there stood the deastralized forms of yahibahi and ram spudd they wore long overcoats doubtless the contents of the magic parcels and the philippine chauffeur had a grip of iron on the neck of each as they stood mr spudd had lost his oriental hair and the face of mr yahibahi perhaps in the struggle which had taken place had been scraped white in patches  they were making no attempt to break away indeed mr spudd with that complete bahee or submission to fate which is attained only by long services in state penitentiaries was smiling and smoking a cigarette  we were waiting for them explained a tall police officer to the two or three ladies who now gathered round him with a return of courage they had the stuff in a handcart and were pushing it away the chief caught them at the corner and rang the patrol from there youll find everything all right i think ladies he added as a burly assistant was seen carrying an armload of furs up the steps  somehow many of the ladies realized at the moment what cheery safe reliable people policemen in blue are and what a friendly familiar shelter they offer against the wiles of oriental occultism  are they old criminals someone asked  yes maam theyve worked this same thing in four cities already and both of them have done time and lots of it theyve only been out six months no need to worry over them he concluded with a shrug of the shoulders  so the furs were restored and the gold and the jewels parcelled out among the owners and in due course mr yahibahi and mr ram spudd were lifted up into the patrol wagon where they seated themselves with a composure worthy of the best traditions of jehumbabah and bahoolapore in fact mr spudd was heard to address the police as boys and to remark that they had got them good that time  so the seance ended and the guests vanished and the yahibahi society terminated itself without even a vote of dissolution  and in all the later confidential discussions of the episode only one point of mysticism remained after they had time really to reflect on it free from all danger of arrest the members of the society realized that on one point the police were entirely off the truth of things for mr yahibahi whether a thief or not and whether he came from the orient or as the police said from missouri had actually succeeded in reastralizing buddha  nor was anyone more emphatic on this point than mrs rasselyerbrown herself  for after all she said if it was not buddha who was it  and the question was never answered    chapter five the love story of mr peter spillikins  almost any day on plutoria avenue or thereabouts you may see little mr spillikins out walking with his four tall sons who are practically as old as himself  to be exact mr spillikins is twentyfour and bob the oldest of the boys must be at least twenty their exact ages are no longer known because by a dreadful accident their mother forgot them this was at a time when the boys were all at mr wackems academy for exceptional youths in the foothills of tennessee and while their mother mrs everleigh was spending the winter on the riviera and felt that for their own sake she must not allow herself to have the boys with her  but now of course since mrs everleigh has remarried and become mrs everleighspillikins there is no need to keep them at mr wackems any longer mr spillikins is able to look after them  mr spillikins generally wears a little top hat and an english morning coat the boys are in eton jackets and black trousers which at their mothers wish are kept just a little too short for them this is because mrs everleighspillikins feels that the day will come some daysay fifteen years hencewhen the boys will no longer be children and meantime it is so nice to feel that they are still mere boys bob is the eldest but sib the youngest is the tallest whereas willie the third boy is the dullest although this has often been denied by those who claim that gib the second boy is just a trifle duller thus at any rate there is a certain equality and good fellowship all round  mrs everleighspillikins is not to be seen walking with them she is probably at the racemeet being taken there by captain cormorant of the united states navy which mr spillikins considers very handsome of him every now and then the captain being in the navy is compelled to be at sea for perhaps a whole afternoon or even several days in which case mrs everleighspillikins is very generally taken to the hunt club or the country club by lieutenant hawk which mr spillikins regards as awfully thoughtful of him or if lieutenant hawk is also out of town for the day as he sometimes has to be because he is in the united states army mrs everleighspillikins is taken out by old colonel shake who is in the state militia and who is at leisure all the time  during their walks on plutoria avenue one may hear the four boys addressing mr spillikins as father and dad in deep bullfrog voices  say dad drawls bob couldnt we all go to the ball game  no say dad says gib lets all go back to the house and play fivecent pool in the billiardroom  all right boys says mr spillikins and a few minutes later one may see them all hustling up the steps of the everleighspillikinss mansion quite eager at the prospect and all talking together                            now the whole of this daily panorama to the eye that can read it represents the outcome of the tangled love story of mr spillikins which culminated during the summer houseparty at castel casteggio the woodland retreat of mr and mrs newberry  but to understand the story one must turn back a year or so to the time when mr peter spillikins used to walk on plutoria avenue alone or sit in the mausoleum club listening to the advice of people who told him that he really ought to get married                            in those days the first thing that one noticed about mr peter spillikins was his exalted view of the other sex every time he passed a beautiful woman in the street he said to himself i say even when he met a moderately beautiful one he murmured by jove when an easter hat went sailing past or a group of summer parasols stood talking on a leafy corner mr spillikins ejaculated my word at the opera and at tango teas his projecting blue eyes almost popped out of his head  similarly if he happened to be with one of his friends he would murmur i say do look at that beautiful girl or would exclaim i say dont look but isnt that an awfully pretty girl across the street or at the opera old man dont let her see you looking but do you see that lovely girl in the box opposite  one must add to this that mr spillikins in spite of his large and bulging blue eyes enjoyed the heavenly gift of short sight as a consequence he lived in a world of amazingly beautiful women and as his mind was focused in the same way as his eyes he endowed them with all the virtues and graces which ought to adhere to fiftydollar flowered hats and cerise parasols with ivory handles  nor to do him justice did mr spillikins confine his attitude to his view of women alone he brought it to bear on everything every time he went to the opera he would come away enthusiastic saying by jove isnt it simply splendid of course i havent the ear to appreciate itim not musical you knowbut even with the little that i know its great it absolutely puts me to sleep and of each new novel that he bought he said its a perfectly wonderful book of course i havent the head to understand it so i didnt finish it but its simply thrilling similarly with painting its one of the most marvellous pictures i ever saw he would say of course ive no eye for pictures and i couldnt see anything in it but its wonderful  the career of mr spillikins up to the point of which we are speaking had hitherto not been very satisfactory or at least not from the point of view of mr boulder who was his uncle and trustee mr boulders first idea had been to have mr spillikins attend the university dr boomer the president had done his best to spread abroad the idea that a university education was perfectly suitable even for the rich that it didnt follow that because a man was a university graduate he need either work or pursue his studies any further that what the university aimed to do was merely to put a certain stamp upon a man that was all and this stamp according to the tenor of the presidents convocation addresses was perfectly harmless no one ought to be afraid of it as a result a great many of the very best young men in the city who had no need for education at all were beginning to attend college it marked said dr boomer a revolution  mr spillikins himself was fascinated with his studies the professors seemed to him living wonders  by jove he said the professor of mathematics is a marvel you ought to see him explaining trigonometry on the blackboard you cant understand a word of it he hardly knew which of his studies he liked best physics he said is a wonderful study i got five per cent in it but by jove i had to work for it id go in for it altogether if theyd let me  but that was just the troublethey wouldnt and so in course of time mr spillikins was compelled for academic reasons to abandon his life work his last words about it were gad i nearly passed in trigonometry and he always said afterwards that he had got a tremendous lot out of the university  after that as he had to leave the university his trustee mr boulder put mr spillikins into business it was of course his own business one of the many enterprises for which mr spillikins ever since he was twentyone had already been signing documents and countersigning cheques so mr spillikins found himself in a mahogany office selling wholesale oil and he liked it he said that business sharpened one up tremendously  im afraid mr spillikins a caller in the mahogany office would say that we cant meet you at five dollars four seventy is the best we can do on the present market  my dear chap said mr spillikins thats all right after all thirty cents isnt much eh what dash it old man we wont fight about thirty cents how much do you want  well at four seventy well take twenty thousand barrels  by jove said mr spillikins twenty thousand barrels gad you want a lot dont you pretty big sale eh for a beginner like me i guess unclell be tickled to death  so tickled was he that after a few weeks of oilselling mr boulder urged mr spillikins to retire and wrote off many thousand dollars from the capital value of his estate  so after this there was only one thing for mr spillikins to do and everybody told him sonamely to get married spillikins said his friends at the club after they had taken all his loose money over the card table you ought to get married  think so said mr spillikins  goodness knows he was willing enough in fact up to this point mr spillikinss whole existence had been one long aspiring sigh directed towards the joys of matrimony  in his brief college days his timid glances had wandered by an irresistible attraction towards the seats on the righthand side of the class room where the girls of the first year sat with golden pigtails down their backs doing trigonometry  he would have married any of them but when a girl can work out trigonometry at sight what use can she possibly have for marriage none mr spillikins knew this and it kept him silent and even when the most beautiful girl in the class married the demonstrator and thus terminated her studies in her second year spillikins realized that it was only because the man was undeniably a demonstrator and knew things  later on when spillikins went into business and into society the same fate pursued him he loved for at least six months georgiana mcteague the niece of the presbyterian minister of st osophs he loved her so well that for her sake he temporarily abandoned his pew at st asaphs which was episcopalian and listened to fourteen consecutive sermons on hell but the affair got no further than that once or twice indeed spillikins walked home with georgiana from church and talked about hell with her and once her uncle asked him into the manse for cold supper after evening service and they had a long talk about hell all through the meal and upstairs in the sittingroom afterwards but somehow spillikins could get no further with it he read up all he could about hell so as to be able to talk with georgiana but in the end it failed a young minister fresh from college came and preached at st osophs six special sermons on the absolute certainty of eternal punishment and he married miss mcteague as a result of it  and meantime mr spillikins had got engaged or practically so to adelina lightleigh not that he had spoken to her but he considered himself bound to her for her sake he had given up hell altogether and was dancing till two in the morning and studying action bridge out of a book for a time he felt so sure that she meant to have him that he began bringing his greatest friend edward ruff of the college football team of whom spillikins was very proud up to the lightleighs residence he specially wanted adelina and edward to be great friends so that adelina and he might ask edward up to the house after he was married and they got to be such great friends and so quickly that they were married in new york that autumn after which spillikins used to be invited up to the house by edward and adelina they both used to tell him how much they owed him and they too used to join in the chorus and say you know peter youre awfully silly not to get married  now all this had happened and finished at about the time when the yahibahi society ran its course at its first meeting mr spillikins had met dulphemia rasselyerbrown at the very sight of her he began reading up the life of buddha and a translation of the upanishads so as to fit himself to aspire to live with her even when the society ended in disaster mr spillikinss love only burned the stronger consequently as soon as he knew that mr and mrs rasselyerbrown were going away for the summer and that dulphemia was to go to stay with the newberrys at castel casteggio this latter place the summer retreat of the newberrys became the one spot on earth for mr peter spillikins  naturally therefore mr spillikins was presently transported to the seventh heaven when in due course of time he received a note which said we shall be so pleased if you can come out and spend a week or two with us here we will send the car down to the thursday train to meet you we live here in the simplest fashion possible in fact as mr newberry says we are just roughing it but i am sure you dont mind for a change dulphemia is with us but we are quite a small party  the note was signed margaret newberry and was written on heavy cream paper with a silver monogram such as people use when roughing it                            the newberrys like everybody else went away from town in the summertime mr newberry being still in business after a fashion it would not have looked well for him to remain in town throughout the year it would have created a bad impression on the market as to how much he was making  in fact in the early summer everybody went out of town the few who ever revisited the place in august reported that they hadnt seen a soul on the street  it was a sort of longing for the simple life for nature that came over everybody some people sought it at the seaside where nature had thrown out her broad plank walks and her long piers and her vaudeville shows others sought it in the heart of the country where nature had spread her oiled motor roads and her wayside inns others like the newberrys preferred to rough it in country residences of their own  some of the people as already said went for business reasons to avoid the suspicion of having to work all the year round others went to europe to avoid the reproach of living always in america others perhaps most people went for medical reasons being sent away by their doctors not that they were ill but the doctors of plutoria avenue such as doctor slyder always preferred to send all their patients out of town during the summer months no welltodo doctor cares to be bothered with them and of course patients even when they are anxious to go anywhere on their own account much prefer to be sent there by their doctor  my dear madam dr slyder would say to a lady who as he knew was most anxious to go to virginia theres really nothing i can do for you here he spoke the truth its not a case of treatment its simply a matter of dropping everything and going away now why dont you go for a month or two to some quiet place where you will simply do nothing she never as he knew did anything anyway what do you say to hot springs virginiaabsolute quiet good golf not a soul there plenty of tennis or else he would say my dear madam youre simply worn out why dont you just drop everything and go to canadaperfectly quiet not a soul there and i believe nowadays quite fashionable  thus after all the patients had been sent away dr slyder and his colleagues of plutoria avenue managed to slip away themselves for a month or two heading straight for paris and vienna there they were able so they said to keep in touch with what continental doctors were doing they probably were  now it so happened that both the parents of miss dulphemia rasselyerbrown had been sent out of town in this fashion mrs rasselyerbrowns distressing experience with yahibahi had left her in a condition in which she was utterly fit for nothing except to go on a mediterranean cruise with about eighty other people also fit for nothing  mr rasselyerbrown himself though never exactly an invalid had confessed that after all the fuss of the yahibahi business he needed bracing up needed putting into shape and had put himself into dr slyders hands the doctor had examined him questioned him searchingly as to what he drank and ended by prescribing port wine to be taken firmly and unflinchingly during the evening and for the daytime at any moment of exhaustion a light cordial such as rye whiskey or rum and vichy water in addition to which dr slyder had recommended mr rasselyerbrown to leave town  why dont you go down to nagahakett on the atlantic he said  is that in maine said mr rasselyerbrown in horror  oh dear me no answered the doctor reassuringly its in new brunswick canada excellent place most liberal licence laws first class cuisine and a bar in the hotel no tourists no golf too cold to swimjust the place to enjoy oneself  so mr rasselyerbrown had gone away also and as a result dulphemia rasselyerbrown at the particular moment of which we speak was declared by the boudoir and society column of the plutorian daily dollar to be staying with mr and mrs newberry at their charming retreat castel casteggio  the newberrys belonged to the class of people whose one aim in the summer is to lead the simple life mr newberry himself said that his one idea of a vacation was to get right out into the bush and put on old clothes and just eat when he felt like it  this was why he had built castel casteggio it stood about forty miles from the city out among the wooded hills on the shore of a little lake except for the fifteen or twenty residences like it that dotted the sides of the lake it was entirely isolated the only way to reach it was by the motor road that wound its way among leafy hills from the railway station fifteen miles away every foot of the road was private property as all nature ought to be the whole country about castel casteggio was absolutely primeval or at any rate as primeval as scotch gardeners and french landscape artists could make it the lake itself lay like a sparkling gem from natures workshopexcept that they had raised the level of it ten feet stonebanked the sides cleared out the brush and put a motor road round it beyond that it was pure nature  castel casteggio itself a beautiful house of white brick with sweeping piazzas and glittering conservatories standing among great trees with rolling lawns broken with flowerbeds as the ground sloped to the lake was perhaps the most beautiful house of all at any rate it was an ideal spot to wear old clothes in to dine early at 730 and except for tennis parties motorboat parties lawn teas and golf to live absolutely to oneself  it should be explained that the house was not called castel casteggio because the newberrys were italian they were not nor because they owned estates in italy they didnt nor had travelled there they hadnt indeed for a time they had thought of giving it a welsh name or a scotch but the beautiful country residence of the asteriskthomsons had stood close by in the same primeval country was already called pennygwrydd and the woodland retreat of the hyphenjoneses just across the little lake was called strathythannaclee and the charming chalet of the wilsonsmiths was called yodeldudel so it seemed fairer to select an italian name                            by jove miss furlong how awfully good of you to come down  the little suburban traintwo cars only both first class for the train went nowhere except out into the primeval wildernesshad drawn up at the diminutive roadside station mr spillikins had alighted and there was miss philippa furlong sitting behind the chauffeur in the newberrys motor she was looking as beautiful as only the younger sister of a high church episcopalian rector can look dressed in white the colour of saintliness on a beautiful morning in july  there was no doubt about philippa furlong her beauty was of that peculiar and almost sacred kind found only in the immediate neighbourhood of the high church clergy it was admitted by all who envied or admired her that she could enter a church more gracefully move more swimmingly up the aisle and pray better than any girl on plutoria avenue  mr spillikins as he gazed at her in her white summer dress and wide picture hat with her parasol nodding above her head realized that after all religion as embodied in the younger sisters of the high church clergy fills a great place in the world  by jove he repeated how awfully good of you  not a bit said philippa hop in dulphemia was coming but she couldnt is that all you have with you  the last remark was ironical it referred to the two quite large steamer trunks of mr spillikins that were being loaded together with his suitcase tennis racket and golf kit on to the fore part of the motor mr spillikins as a young man of social experience had roughed it before he knew what a lot of clothes one needs for it  so the motor sped away and went bowling noiselessly over the oiled road and turning corners where the green boughs of the great trees almost swished in their faces and rounding and twisting among curves of the hills as it carried spillikins and philippa away from the lower domain or ordinary fields and farms up into the enchanted country of private property and the magic castles of casteggio and pennygwrydd  mr spillikins must have assured philippa at least a dozen times in starting off how awfully good it was of her to come down in the motor and he was so pleased at her coming to meet him that philippa never even hinted that the truth was that she had expected somebody else on the same train for to a girl brought up in the principles of the high church the truth is a very sacred thing she keeps it to herself  and naturally with such a sympathetic listener it was not long before mr spillikins had begun to talk of dulphemia and his hopes  i dont know whether she really cares for me or not said mr spillikins but i have pretty good hope the other day or at least about two months ago at one of the yahibahi meetingsyou were not in that were you he said breaking off  only just at the beginning said philippa we went to bermuda  oh yes i remember do you know i thought it pretty rough at the end especially on ram spudd i liked him i sent him two pounds of tobacco to the penitentiary last week you can get it in to them you know if you know how  but what were you going to say asked philippa  oh yes said mr spillikins and he realized that he had actually drifted off the topic of dulphemia a thing that had never happened to him before i was going to say that at one of the meetings you know i asked her if i might call her dulphemia  and what did she say to that asked philippa  she said she didnt care what i called her so i think that looks pretty good dont you  awfully good said philippa  and a little after that i took her slippers home from the charity ball at the grand palaver archie jones took her home herself in his car but i took her slippers shed forgotten them i thought that a pretty good sign wasnt it you wouldnt let a chap carry round your slippers unless you knew him pretty well would you miss philippa  oh no nobody would said philippa this of course was a standing principle of the anglican church  and a little after that dulphemia and charlie mostyn and i were walking to mrs buncomhearsts musical and wed only just started along the street when she stopped and sent me back for her musicme mind you not charlie that seems to me awfully significant  it seems to speak volumes said philippa  doesnt it said mr spillikins you dont mind my telling you all about this miss philippa he added  incidentally mr spillikins felt that it was all right to call her miss philippa because she had a sister who was really miss furlong so it would have been quite wrong as mr spillikins realized to have called miss philippa by her surname in any case the beauty of the morning was against it  i dont mind a bit said philippa i think its awfully nice of you to tell me about it  she didnt add that she knew all about it already  you see said mr spillikins youre so awfully sympathetic it makes it so easy to talk to you with other girls especially with clever ones even with dulphemia i often feel a perfect jackass beside them but i don t feel that way with you at all  dont you really said philippa but the honest admiration in mr spillikins protruding blue eyes forbade a sarcastic answer  by jove said mr spillikins presently with complete irrelevance i hope you dont mind my saying it but you look awfully well in whitestunning he felt that a man who was affianced or practically so was allowed the smaller liberty of paying honest compliments  oh this old thing laughed philippa with a contemptuous shake of her dress but up here you know we just wear anything she didnt say that this old thing was only two weeks old and had cost eighty dollars or the equivalent of one persons pew rent at st asaphs for six months  and after that they had only time so it seemed to mr spillikins for two or three remarks and he had scarcely had leisure to reflect what a charming girl philippa had grown to be since she went to bermudathe effect no doubt of the climate of those fortunate islandswhen quite suddenly they rounded a curve into an avenue of nodding trees and there were the great lawn and wide piazzas and the conservatories of castel casteggio right in front of them  here we are said philippa and theres mr newberry out on the lawn                            now here mr newberry was saying a little later waving his hand is where you get what i think the finest view of the place  he was standing at the corner of the lawn where it sloped dotted with great trees to the banks of the little lake and was showing mr spillikins the beauties of castel casteggio  mr newberry wore on his short circular person the summer costume of a man taking his ease and careless of dress plain white flannel trousers not worth more than six dollars a leg an ordinary white silk shirt with a rolled collar that couldnt have cost more than fifteen dollars and on his head an ordinary panama hat say forty dollars  by jove said mr spillikins as he looked about him at the house and the beautiful lawn with its great trees its a lovely place  isnt it said mr newberry but you ought to have seen it when i took hold of it to make the motor road alone i had to dynamite out about a hundred yards of rock and then i fetched up cement tons and tons of it and boulders to buttress the embankment  did you really said mr spillikins looking at mr newberry with great respect  yes and even that was nothing to the house itself do you know i had to go at least forty feet for the foundations first i went through about twenty feet of loose clay after that i struck sand and id no sooner got through that than by george i landed in eight feet of water i had to pump it out i think i took out a thousand gallons before i got clear down to the rock then i took my solid steel beams in fiftyfoot lengths here mr newberry imitated with his arms the action of a man setting up a steel beam and set them upright and bolted them on the rock after that i threw my steel girders across clapped on my roof rafters all steel in sixtyfoot pieces and then just held it easily just supported it a bit and let it sink gradually to its place  mr newberry illustrated with his two arms the action of a huge house being allowed to sink slowly to a firm rest  you dont say so said mr spillikins lost in amazement at the wonderful physical strength that mr newberry must have  excuse me just a minute broke off mr newberry while i smooth out the gravel where youre standing youve rather disturbed it im afraid  oh im awfully sorry said mr spillikins  oh not at all not at all said his host i dont mind in the least its only on account of mcalister  who asked mr spillikins  my gardener he doesnt care to have us walk on the gravel paths it scuffs up the gravel so but sometimes one forgets  it should be said here for the sake of clearness that one of the chief glories of castel casteggio lay in its servants all of them it goes without saying had been brought from great britain the comfort they gave to mr and mrs newberry was unspeakable in fact as they themselves admitted servants of the kind are simply not to be found in america  our scotch gardener mrs newberry always explained is a perfect character i dont know how we could get another like him do you know my dear he simply wont allow us to pick the roses and if any of us walk across the grass he is furious and he positively refuses to let us use the vegetables he told me quite plainly that if we took any of his young peas or his early cucumbers he would leave we are to have them later on when hes finished growing them  how delightful it is to have servants of that sort the lady addressed would murmur so devoted and so different from servants on this side of the water just imagine my dear my chauffeur when i was in colorado actually threatened to leave me merely because i wanted to reduce his wages i think its these wretched labour unions  im sure it is of course we have trouble with mcalister at times but hes always very reasonable when we put things in the right light last week for example i was afraid that we had gone too far with him he is always accustomed to have a quart of beer every morning at halfpast tenthe maids are told to bring it out to him and after that he goes to sleep in the little arbour beside the tulip bed and the other day when he went there he found that one of our guests who hadnt been told was actually sitting in there reading of course he was furious i was afraid for the moment that he would give notice on the spot  what would you have done  positively my dear i dont know but we explained to him at once that it was only an accident and that the person hadnt known and that of course it wouldnt occur again after that he was softened a little but he went off muttering to himself and that evening he dug up all the new tulips and threw them over the fence we saw him do it but we didnt dare say anything  oh no echoed the other lady if you had you might have lost him  exactly and i dont think we could possibly get another man like him at least not on this side of the water                            but come said mr newberry after he had finished adjusting the gravel with his foot there are mrs newberry and the girls on the verandah lets go and join them  a few minutes later mr spillikins was talking with mrs newberry and dulphemia rasselyerbrown and telling mrs newberry what a beautiful house she had beside them stood philippa furlong and she had her arm around dulphemias waist and the picture that they thus made with their heads close together dulphemias hair being golden and philippas chestnutbrown was such that mr spillikins had no eyes for mrs newberry nor for castel casteggio nor for anything so much so that he practically didnt see at all the little girl in green that stood unobtrusively on the further side of mrs newberry indeed though somebody had murmured her name in introduction he couldnt have repeated it if asked two minutes afterwards his eyes and his mind were elsewhere  but hers were not  for the little girl in green looked at mr spillikins with wide eyes and when she looked at him she saw all at once such wonderful things about him as nobody had ever seen before  for she could see from the poise of his head how awfully clever he was and from the way he stood with his hands in his side pockets she could see how manly and brave he must be and of course there was firmness and strength written all over him in short she saw as she looked such a peter spillikins as truly never existed or could existor at least such a peter spillikins as no one else in the world had ever suspected before  all in a moment she was ever so glad that she accepted mrs newberrys invitation to castel casteggio and hadnt been afraid to come for the little girl in green whose christian name was norah was only what is called a poor relation of mrs newberry and her father was a person of no account whatever who didnt belong to the mausoleum club or to any other club and who lived with norah on a street that nobody who was anybody lived upon norah had been asked up a few days before out of the city to give her airwhich is the only thing that can be safely and freely given to poor relations thus she had arrived at castel casteggio with one diminutive trunk so small and shabby that even the servants who carried it upstairs were ashamed of it in it were a pair of brand new tennis shoes at ninety cents reduced to seventyfive and a white dress of the kind that is called almost evening and such few other things as poor relations might bring with fear and trembling to join in the simple rusticity of the rich  thus stood norah looking at mr spillikins  as for him such is the contrariety of human things he had no eyes for her at all  what a perfectly charming house this is mr spillikins was saying he always said this on such occasions but it seemed to the little girl in green that he spoke with wonderful social ease  i am so glad you think so said mrs newberry this was what she always answered youve no idea what work it has been this year we put in all this new glass in the east conservatory over a thousand panes such a tremendous business  i was just telling mr spillikins said mr newberry about the work we had blasting out the motor road you can see the gap where it lies better from here i think spillikins i must have exploded a ton and a half of dynamite on it  by jove said mr spillikins it must be dangerous work eh i wonder you arent afraid of it  one simply gets used to it thats all said newberry shrugging his shoulders but of course it is dangerous i blew up two italians on the last job he paused a minute and added musingly hardy fellows the italians i prefer them to any other people for blasting  did you blow them up yourself asked mr spillikins  i wasnt here answered mr newberry in fact i never care to be here when im blasting we go to town but i had to foot the bill for them all the same quite right too the risk of course was mine not theirs thats the law you know they cost me two thousand each  but come said mrs newberry i think we must go and dress for dinner franklin will be frightfully put out if were late franklin is our butler she went on seeing that mr spillikins didnt understand the reference and as we brought him out from england we have to be rather careful with a good man like franklin one is always so afraid of losing himand after last night we have to be doubly careful  why last night asked mr spillikins  oh it wasnt much said mrs newberry in fact it was merely an accident only it just chanced that at dinner quite late in the meal when we had had nearly everything we dine very simply here mr spillikins mr newberry who was thirsty and who wasnt really thinking what he was saying asked franklin to give him a glass of hock franklin said at once im very sorry sir i dont care to serve hock after the entree  and of course he was right said dulphemia with emphasis exactly he was perfectly right they know you know we were afraid that there might be trouble but mr newberry went and saw franklin afterwards and he behaved very well over it but suppose we go and dress its halfpast six already and weve only an hour                            in this congenial company mr spillikins spent the next three days  life at castel casteggio as the newberrys loved to explain was conducted on the very simplest plan early breakfast country fashion at nine oclock after that nothing to eat till lunch unless one cared to have lemonade or bottled ale sent out with a biscuit or a macaroon to the tennis court lunch itself was a perfectly plain midday meal lasting till about 130 and consisting simply of cold meats say four kinds and salads with perhaps a made dish or two and for anybody who cared for it a hot steak or a chop or both after that one had coffee and cigarettes in the shade of the piazza and waited for afternoon tea this latter was served at a wicker table in any part of the grounds that the gardener was not at that moment clipping trimming or otherwise using afternoon tea being over one rested or walked on the lawn till it was time to dress for dinner  this simple routine was broken only by irruptions of people in motors or motor boats from pennygwrydd or yodeldudel chalet  the whole thing from the point of view of mr spillikins or dulphemia or philippa represented rusticity itself  to the little girl in green it seemed as brilliant as the court of versailles especially evening dinnera plain home meal as the others thought itwhen she had four glasses to drink out of and used to wonder over such problems as whether you were supposed when franklin poured out wine to tell him to stop or to wait till he stopped without being told to stop and other similar mysteries such as many people before and after have meditated upon  during all this time mr spillikins was nerving himself to propose to dulphemia rasselyerbrown in fact he spent part of his time walking up and down under the trees with philippa furlong and discussing with her the proposal that he meant to make together with such topics as marriage in general and his own unworthiness  he might have waited indefinitely had he not learned on the third day of his visit that dulphemia was to go away in the morning to join her father at nagahakett  that evening he found the necessary nerve to speak and the proposal in almost every aspect of it was most successful  by jove spillikins said to philippa furlong next morning in explaining what had happened she was awfully nice about it i think she must have guessed in a way dont you what i was going to say but at any rate she was awfully nicelet me say everything i wanted and when i explained what a fool i was she said she didnt think i was half such a fool as people thought me but its all right it turns out that she isnt thinking of getting married i asked her if i might always go on thinking of her and she said i might  and that morning when dulphemia was carried off in the motor to the station mr spillikins without exactly being aware how he had done it had somehow transferred himself to philippa  isnt she a splendid girl he said at least ten times a day to norah the little girl in green and norah always agreed because she really thought philippa a perfectly wonderful creature there is no doubt that but for a slight shift of circumstances mr spillikins would have proposed to miss furlong indeed he spent a good part of his time rehearsing little speeches that began of course i know im an awful ass in a way or of course i know that im not at all the sort of fellow and so on  but not one of them ever was delivered  for it so happened that on the thursday one week after mr spillikinss arrival philippa went again to the station in the motor and when she came back there was another passenger with her a tall young man in tweed and they both began calling out to the newberrys from a distance of at least a hundred yards  and both the newberrys suddenly exclaimed why its tom and rushed off to meet the motor and there was such a laughing and jubilation as the two descended and carried toms valises to the verandah that mr spillikins felt as suddenly and completely out of it as the little girl in green herselfespecially as his ear had caught among the first things said the words congratulate us mrs newberry were engaged  after which mr spillikins had the pleasure of sitting and listening while it was explained in wicker chairs on the verandah that philippa and tom had been engaged already for ever so longin fact nearly two weeks only they had agreed not to say a word to anybody till tom had gone to north carolina and back to see his people  and as to who tom was or what was the relation between tom and the newberrys mr spillikins neither knew or cared nor did it interest him in the least that philippa had met tom in bermuda and that she hadnt known that he even knew the newberrys nor any other of the exuberant disclosures of the moment in fact if there was any one period rather than another when mr spillikins felt corroborated in his private view of himself it was at this moment  so the next day tom and philippa vanished together  we shall be quite a small party now said mrs newberry in fact quite by ourselves till mrs everleigh comes and she wont be here for a fortnight  at which the heart of the little girl in green was glad because she had been afraid that other girls might be coming whereas she knew that mrs everleigh was a widow with four sons and must be ever so old past forty  the next few days were spent by mr spillikins almost entirely in the society of norah he thought them on the whole rather pleasant days but slow to her they were an uninterrupted dream of happiness never to be forgotten  the newberrys left them to themselves not with any intent it was merely that they were perpetually busy walking about the grounds of castel casteggio blowing up things with dynamite throwing steel bridges over gullies and hoisting heavy timber with derricks nor were they to blame for it for it had not always been theirs to command dynamite and control the forces of nature there had been a time now long ago when the two newberrys had lived both of them on twenty dollars a week and mrs newberry had made her own dresses and mr newberry had spent vigorous evenings in making handmade shelves for their sittingroom that was long ago and since then mr newberry like many other people of those earlier days had risen to wealth and castel casteggio while others like norahs father had stayed just where they were  so the newberrys left peter and norah to themselves all day even after dinner in the evening mr newberry was very apt to call to his wife in the dusk from some distant corner of the lawn  margaret come over here and tell me if you dont think we might cut down this elm tear the stump out by the roots and throw it into the ravine  and the answer was one minute edward just wait till i get a wrap  before they came back the dusk had grown to darkness and they had redynamited half the estate  during all of which time mr spillikins sat with norah on the piazza he talked and she listened he told her for instance all about his terrific experiences in the oil business and about his exciting career at college or presently they went indoors and norah played the piano and mr spillikins sat and smoked and listened in such a house as the newberrys where dynamite and the greater explosives were everyday matters a little thing like the use of tobacco in the drawingroom didnt count as for the music go right ahead said mr spillikins im not musical but i dont mind music a bit  in the daytime they played tennis there was a court at one end of the lawn beneath the trees all chequered with sunlight and mingled shadow very beautiful norah thought though mr spillikins explained that the spotted light put him off his game in fact it was owing entirely to this bad light that mr spillikinss fast drives wonderful though they were somehow never got inside the service court  norah of course thought mr spillikins a wonderful player she was gladin fact it suited them bothwhen he beat her six to nothing she didnt know and didnt care that there was no one else in the world that mr spillikins could beat like that once he even said to her  by gad you dont play half a bad game you know i think you know with practice youd come on quite a lot  after that the games were understood to be more or less in the form of lessons which put mr spillikins on a pedestal of superiority and allowed any bad strokes on his part to be viewed as a form of indulgence  also as the tennis was viewed in this light it was norahs part to pick up the balls at the net and throw them back to mr spillikins he let her do this not from rudeness for it wasnt in him but because in such a primeval place as castel casteggio the natural primitive relation of the sexes is bound to reassert itself  but of love mr spillikins never thought he had viewed it so eagerly and so often from a distance that when it stood here modestly at his very elbow he did not recognize its presence his mind had been fashioned as it were to connect love with something stunning and sensational with easter hats and harem skirts and the luxurious consciousness of the unattainable  even at that there is no knowing what might have happened tennis in the chequered light of sun and shadow cast by summer leaves is a dangerous game there came a day when they were standing one each side of the net and mr spillikins was explaining to norah the proper way to hold a racquet so as to be able to give those magnificent backhand sweeps of his by which he generally drove the ball halfway to the lake and explaining this involved putting his hand right over norahs on the handle of the racquet so that for just half a second her hand was clasped tight in his and if that halfsecond had been lengthened out into a whole second it is quite possible that what was already subconscious in his mind would have broken its way triumphantly to the surface and norahs hand would have stayed in hishow willingly for the rest of their two lives  but just at that moment mr spillikins looked up and he said in quite an altered tone  by jove whos that awfully goodlooking woman getting out of the motor  and their hands unclasped norah looked over towards the house and said  why its mrs everleigh i thought she wasnt coming for another week  i say said mr spillikins straining his short sight to the uttermost what perfectly wonderful golden hair eh why its norah began and then she stopped it didnt seem right to explain that mrs everleighs hair was dyed and whos that tall chap standing beside her said mr spillikins  i think its captain cormorant but i dont think hes going to stay hes only brought her up in the motor from town by jove how good of him said spillikins and this sentiment in regard to captain cormorant though he didnt know it was to become a keynote of his existence  i didnt know she was coming so soon said norah and there was weariness already in her heart certainly she didnt know it still less did she know or anyone else that the reason of mrs everleighs coming was because mr spillikins was there she came with a set purpose and she sent captain cormorant directly back in the motor because she didnt want him on the premises  oughtnt we to go up to the house said norah  all right said mr spillikins with great alacrity lets go                            now as this story began with the information that mrs everleigh is at present mrs everleighspillikins there is no need to pursue in detail the stages of mr spillikinss wooing its course was swift and happy mr spillikins having seen the back of mrs everleighs head had decided instantly that she was the most beautiful woman in the world and that impression is not easily corrected in the halflight of a shaded drawingroom nor across a dinnertable lighted only with candles with deep red shades nor even in the daytime through a veil in any case it is only fair to state that if mrs everleigh was not and is not a singularly beautiful woman mr spillikins still doesnt know it and in point of attraction the homage of such experts as captain cormorant and lieutenant hawk speaks for itself  so the course of mr spillikinss love for love it must have been ran swiftly to its goal each stage of it was duly marked by his comments to norah  she is a splendid woman he said so sympathetic she always seems to know just what ones going to say  so she did for she was making him say it  by jove he said a day later mrs everleighs an awfully fine woman isnt she i was telling her about my having been in the oil business for a little while and she thinks that id really be awfully good in money things she said she wished she had me to manage her money for her  this also was quite true except that mrs everleigh had not made it quite clear that the management of her money was of the form generally known as deficit financing in fact her money was very crudely stated nonexistent and it needed a lot of management  a day or two later mr spillikins was saying i think mrs everleigh must have had great sorrow dont you yesterday she was showing me a photograph of her little boyshe has a little boy you know  yes i know said norah she didnt add that she knew that mrs everleigh had four  and she was saying how awfully rough it is having him always away from her at dr somethings academy where he is  and very soon after that mr spillikins was saying with quite a quaver in his voice  by jove yes im awfully lucky i never thought for a moment that shed have me you knowa woman like her with so much attention and everything i cant imagine what she sees in me  which was just as well  and then mr spillikins checked himself for he noticedthis was on the verandah in the morningthat norah had a hat and jacket on and that the motor was rolling towards the door  i say he said are you going away  yes didnt you know norah said i thought you heard them speaking of it at dinner last night i have to go home fathers alone you know  oh im awfully sorry said mr spillikins we shant have any more tennis  goodbye said norah and as she said it and put out her hand there were tears brimming up into her eyes but mr spillikins being short of sight didnt see them  goodbye he said  then as the motor carried her away he stood for a moment in a sort of reverie perhaps certain things that might have been rose unformed and inarticulate before his mind and then a voice called from the drawingroom within in a measured and assured tone  peter darling where are you  coming cried mr spillikins and he came                            on the second day of the engagement mrs everleigh showed to peter a little photograph in a brooch  this is gib my second little boy she said  mr spillikins started to say i didnt know and then checked himself and said by gad what a finelooking little chap eh im awfully fond of boys  dear little fellow isnt he said mrs everleigh hes really rather taller than that now because this picture was taken a little while ago  and the next day she said this is willie my third boy and on the day after that she said this is sib my youngest boy im sure youll love him  im sure i shall said mr spillikins he loved him already for being the youngest                            and so in the fulness of timenor was it so very full either in fact only about five weekspeter spillikins and mrs everleigh were married in st asaphs church on plutoria avenue and the wedding was one of the most beautiful and sumptuous of the weddings of the september season there were flowers and bridesmaids in long veils and tall ushers in frockcoats and awnings at the church door and strings of motors with weddingfavours on imported chauffeurs and all that goes to invest marriage on plutoria avenue with its peculiar sacredness the face of the young rector mr fareforth furlong wore the added saintliness that springs from a fivehundred dollar fee the whole town was there or at least everybody that was anybody and if there was one person absent one who sat by herself in the darkened drawingroom of a dull little house on a shabby street who knew or cared  so after the ceremony the happy couplefor were they not soleft for new york there they spent their honeymoon they had thought of goingit was mr spillikinss ideato the coast of maine but mrs everleighspillikins said that new york was much nicer so restful whereas as everyone knows the coast of maine is frightfully noisy  moreover it so happened that before the everleighspillikinses had been more than four or five days in new york the ship of captain cormorant dropped anchor in the hudson and when the anchor of that ship was once down it generally stayed there so the captain was able to take the everleighspillikinses about in new york and to give a tea for mrs everleighspillikins on the deck of his vessel so that she might meet the officers and another tea in a private room of a restaurant on fifth avenue so that she might meet no one but himself  and at this tea captain cormorant said among other things did he kick up rough at all when you told him about the money  and mrs everleigh now mrs everleighspillikins said not he i think he is actually pleased to know that i havent any do you know arthur hes really an awfully good fellow and as she said it she moved her hand away from under captain cormorants on the teatable  i say said the captain dont get sentimental over him                            so that is how it is that the everleighspillikinses came to reside on plutoria avenue in a beautiful stone house with a billiardroom in an extension on the second floor through the windows of it one can almost hear the click of the billiard balls and a voice saying hold on father you had your shot    chapter six the rival churches of st asaph and st osoph  the church of st asaph more properly call st asaphs in the fields stands among the elm trees of plutoria avenue opposite the university its tall spire pointing to the blue sky its rector is fond of saying that it seems to him to point as it were a warning against the sins of a commercial age more particularly does he say this in his lenten services at noonday when the businessmen sit in front of him in rows their bald heads uncovered and their faces stamped with contrition as they think of mergers that they should have made and real estate that they failed to buy for lack of faith  the ground on which st asaphs stands is worth seven dollars and a half a foot the mortgagees as they kneel in prayer in their long frockcoats feel that they have built upon a rock it is a beautifully appointed church there are windows with priceless stained glass that were imported from normandy the rector himself swearing out the invoices to save the congregation the grievous burden of the customs duty there is a pipe organ in the transept that cost ten thousand dollars to install the debentureholders as they join in the morning anthem love to hear the dulcet notes of the great organ and to reflect that it is as good as new just behind the church is st asaphs sunday school with a tenthousand dollar mortgage of its own and below that again on the side street is the building of the young mens guild with a bowlingalley and a swimmingbath deep enough to drown two young men at a time and a billiardroom with seven tables it is the rectors boast that with a guild house such as that there is no need for any young man of the congregation to frequent a saloon nor is there  and on sunday mornings when the great organ plays and the mortgagees and the bondholders and the debentureholders and the sunday school teachers and the billiardmarkers all lift up their voices together there is emitted from st asaphs a volume of praise that is practically as fine and effective as paid professional work  st asaphs is episcopal as a consequence it has in it and about it all those things which go to make up the episcopal churchbrass tablets let into its walls blackbirds singing in its elm trees parishioners who dine at eight oclock and a rector who wears a little crucifix and dances the tango  on the other hand there stands upon the same street not a hundred yards away the rival church of st osophpresbyterian down to its very foundations in bedrock thirty feet below the level of the avenue it has a short squat towerand a low roof and its narrow windows are glazed with frosted glass it has dark spruce trees instead of elms crows instead of blackbirds and a gloomy minister with a shovel hat who lectures on philosophy on weekdays at the university he loves to think that his congregation are made of the lowly and the meek in spirit and to reflect that lowly and meek as they are there are men among them that could buy out half the congregation of st asaphs  st osophs is only presbyterian in a special sense it is in fact too presbyterian to be any longer connected with any other body whatsoever it seceded some forty years ago from the original body to which it belonged and later on with three other churches it seceded from the group of seceding congregations still later it fell into a difference with the three other churches on the question of eternal punishment the word eternal not appearing to the elders of st osophs to designate a sufficiently long period the dispute ended in a secession which left the church of st osoph practically isolated in a world of sin whose approaching fate it neither denied nor deplored  in one respect the rival churches of plutoria avenue had had a similar history each of them had moved up by successive stages from the lower and poorer parts of the city forty years ago st asaphs had been nothing more than a little frame church with a tin spire away in the west of the slums and st osophs a square diminutive building away in the east but the site of st asaphs had been bought by a brewing company and the trustees shrewd men of business themselves rising into wealth had rebuilt it right in the track of the advancing tide of a real estate boom the elders of st osoph quiet men but illumined by an inner light had followed suit and moved their church right against the side of an expanding distillery thus both the churches as decade followed decade made their way up the slope of the city till st asaphs was presently gloriously expropriated by the street railway company and planted its spire in triumph on plutoria avenue itself but st osophs followed with each change of site it moved nearer and nearer to st asaphs its elders were shrewd men with each move of their church they took careful thought in the rebuilding in the manufacturing district it was built with sixteen windows on each side and was converted at a huge profit into a bicycle factory on the residential street it was made long and deep and was sold to a movingpicture company without the alteration of so much as a pew as a last step a syndicate formed among the members of the congregation themselves bought ground on plutoria avenue and sublet it to themselves as a site for the church at a nominal interest of five per cent per annum payable nominally every three months and secured by a nominal mortgage  as the two churches moved their congregations or at least all that was best of themsuch members as were sharing in the rising fortunes of the citymoved also and now for some six or seven years the two churches and the two congregations had confronted one another among the elm trees of the avenue opposite to the university  but at this point the fortunes of the churches had diverged st asaphs was a brilliant success st osophs was a failure even its own trustees couldnt deny it at a time when st asaphs was not only paying its interest but showing a handsome surplus on everything it undertook the church of st osoph was moving steadily backwards  there was no doubt of course as to the cause everybody knew it it was simply a question of men and as everybody said one had only to compare the two men conducting the churches to see why one succeeded and the other failed  the reverend edward fareforth furlong of st asaphs was a man who threw his whole energy into his parish work the subtleties of theological controversy he left to minds less active than his own his creed was one of works rather than of words and whatever he was doing he did it with his whole heart whether he was lunching at the mausoleum club with one of his church wardens or playing the flutewhich he played as only the episcopal clergy can play itaccompanied on the harp by one of the fairest of the ladies of his choir or whether he was dancing the new episcopal tango with the younger daughters of the elder parishioners he threw himself into it with all his might he could drink tea more gracefully and play tennis better than any clergyman on this side of the atlantic he could stand beside the white stone font of st asaphs in his long white surplice holding a whiterobed infant worth half a million dollars looking as beautifully innocent as the child itself and drawing from every matron of the congregation with unmarried daughters the despairing cry what a pity that he has no children of his own  equally sound was his theology no man was known to preach shorter sermons or to explain away the book of genesis more agreeably than the rector of st asaphs and if he found it necessary to refer to the deity he did so under the name of jehovah or jah or even yaweh in a manner calculated not to hurt the sensitiveness of any of the parishioners people who would shudder at brutal talk of the older fashion about the wrath of god listened with wellbred interest to a sermon on the personal characteristics of jah in the same way mr furlong always referred to the devil not as satan but as su or swa which took all the sting out of him beelzebub he spoke of as behelzawbab which rendered him perfectly harmless the garden of eden he spoke of as the paradeisos which explained it entirely the flood as the diluvium which cleared it up completely and jonah he named after the correct fashion jon nah which put the whole situation his being swallowed by baloo or the great lizard on a perfectly satisfactory footing hell itself was spoken of as sheol and it appeared that it was not a place of burning but rather of what one might describe as moral torment this settled sheol once and for all nobody minds moral torment in short there was nothing in the theological system of mr furlong that need have occasioned in any of his congregation a moments discomfort  there could be no greater contrast with mr fareforth furlong than the minister of st osophs the rev dr mcteague who was also honorary professor of philosophy at the university the one was young the other was old the one could dance the other could not the one moved about at church picnics and lawn teas among a bevy of disciples in pink and blue sashes the other moped around under the trees of the university campus with blinking eyes that saw nothing and an abstracted mind that had spent fifty years in trying to reconcile hegel with st paul and was still busy with it mr furlong went forward with the times dr mcteague slid quietly backwards with the centuries  dr mcteague was a failure and all his congregation knew it he is not up to date they said that was his crowning sin he dont go forward any said the business members of the congregation that old man believes just exactly the same sort of stuff now that he did forty years ago whats more he preaches it you cant run a church that way can you  his trustees had done their best to meet the difficulty they had offered dr mcteague a twoyears vacation to go and see the holy land he refused he said he could picture it they reduced his salary by fifty per cent he never noticed it they offered him an assistant but he shook his head saying that he didnt know where he could find a man to do just the work that he was doing meantime he mooned about among the trees concocting a mixture of st paul with hegel three parts to one for his sunday sermon and one part to three for his monday lecture  no doubt it was his dual function that was to blame for his failure and this perhaps was the fault of dr boomer the president of the university dr boomer like all university presidents of today belonged to the presbyterian church or rather to state it more correctly he included presbyterianism within himself he was of course a member of the board of management of st osophs and it was he who had urged very strongly the appointment of dr mcteague then senior professor of philosophy as minister  a saintly man he said the very man for the post if you should ask me whether he is entirely at home as a professor of philosophy on our staff at the university i should be compelled to say no we are forced to admit that as a lecturer he does not meet our views he appears to find it difficult to keep religion out of his teaching in fact his lectures are suffused with a rather dangerous attempt at moral teaching which is apt to contaminate our students but in the church i should imagine that would be if anything an advantage indeed if you were to come to me and say boomer we wish to appoint dr mcteague as our minister i should say quite frankly take him  so dr mcteague had been appointed then to the surprise of everybody he refused to give up his lectures in philosophy he said he felt a call to give them the salary he said was of no consequence he wrote to mr furlong senior the father of the episcopal rector and honorary treasurer of the plutoria university and stated that he proposed to give his lectures for nothing the trustees of the college protested they urged that the case might set a dangerous precedent which other professors might follow while fully admitting that dr mcteagues lectures were well worth giving for nothing they begged him to reconsider his offer but he refused and from that day on in spite of all offers that he should retire on double his salary that he should visit the holy land or syria or armenia where the dreadful massacres of christians were taking place dr mcteague clung to his post with a tenacity worthy of the best traditions of scotland his only internal perplexity was that he didnt see how when the time came for him to die twenty or thirty years hence they would ever be able to replace him such was the situation of the two churches on a certain beautiful morning in june when an unforeseen event altered entirely the current of their fortunes                            no thank you juliana said the young rector to his sister across the breakfast tableand there was something as near to bitterness in his look as his saintly smoothshaven face was capable of reflectingno thank you no more porridge prunes no no thank you i dont think i care for any and by the way he added dont bother to keep any lunch for me i have a great deal of businessthat is of work in the parishto see to and i must just find time to get a bite of something to eat when and where i can  in his own mind he was resolving that the place should be the mausoleum club and the time just as soon as the head waiter would serve him  after which the reverend edward fareforth furlong bowed his head for a moment in a short silent blessingthe one prescribed by the episcopal church in america for a breakfast of porridge and prunes  it was their first breakfast together and it spoke volumes to the rector he knew what it implied it stood for his elder sister julianas views on the need of personal sacrifice as a means of grace the rector sighed as he rose he had never missed his younger sister philippa now married and departed so keenly philippa had had opinions of her own on bacon and eggs and on lamb chops with watercress as a means of stimulating the soul but juliana was different the rector understood now exactly why it was that his father had exclaimed on the news of philippas engagement without a seconds hesitation then of course juliana must live with you nonsense my dear boy nonsense its my duty to spare her to you after all i can always eat at the club they can give me a bite of something or other surely to a man of my age edward food is really of no consequence no no juliana must move into the rectory at once  the rectors elder sister rose she looked tall and sallow and forbidding in the plain black dress that contrasted sadly with the charming clerical costumes of white and pink and the broad episcopal hats with flowers in them that philippa used to wear for morning work in the parish  for what time shall i order dinner she asked you and philippa used to have it at halfpast seven did you not dont you think that rather too late  a trifle perhaps said the rector uneasily he didnt care to explain to juliana that it was impossible to get home any earlier from the kind of the dansant that everybody was giving just now but dont trouble about dinner i may be working very late if i need anything to eat i shall get a biscuit and some tea at the guild rooms or  he didnt finish the sentence but in his mind he added or else a really firstclass dinner at the mausoleum club or at the newberrys or the rasselyerbrownsanywhere except here  if you are going then said juliana may i have the key of the church  a look of pain passed over the rectors face he knew perfectly well what juliana wanted the key for she meant to go into his church and pray in it  the rector of st asaphs was he trusted as broadminded a man as an anglican clergyman ought to be he had no objection to any reasonable use of his churchfor a thanksgiving festival or for musical recitals for examplebut when it came to opening up the church and using it to pray in the thing was going a little too far what was more he had an idea from the look on julianas face that she meant to pray for him this for a clergy man was hard to bear philippa like the good girl that she was had prayed only for herself and then only at the proper times and places and in a proper praying costume the rector began to realize what difficulties it might make for a clergyman to have a religious sister as his housemate  but he was never a man for unseemly argument it is hanging in my study he said  and with that the rev fareforth furlong passed into the hall took up the simple silk hat the stick and gloves of the working clergyman and walked out on to the avenue to begin his days work in the parish  the rectors parish viewed in its earthly aspect was a singularly beautiful place for it extended all along plutoria avenue where the street is widest and the elm trees are at their leafiest and the motors at their very drowsiest it lay up and down the shaded side streets of the residential district darkened with great chestnuts and hushed in a stillness that was almost religion itself there was not a house in the parish assessed at less than twentyfive thousand and in very heart of it the mausoleum club with its smooth white stone and its grecian architecture carried one back to the ancient world and made one think of athens and of paul preaching on mars hill it was all considered a splendid thing to fight sin in such a parish and to keep it out of it for kept out it was one might look the length and breadth of the broad avenue and see no sign of sin all along it there was certainly none in the smooth faces of the chauffeurs trundling their drowsy motors no sign of it in the expensive children paraded by imported nursemaids in the chequered light of the shaded street least of all was there any sign of it in the stock exchange members of the congregation as they walked along side by side to their lunch at the mausoleum club their silk hats nodding together in earnest colloquy on shares preferred and profits undivided so might have walked so must have walked the very fathers of the church themselves  whatever sin there was in the city was shoved sideways into the roaring streets of commerce where the elevated railway ran and below that again into the slums here there must have been any quantity of sin the rector of st asaphs was certain of it many of the richer of his parishioners had been down in parties late at night to look at it and the ladies of his congregation were joined together into all sorts of guilds and societies and bands of endeavour for stamping it out and driving it under or putting it into jail till it surrendered  but the slums lay outside the rectors parish he had no right to interfere they were under the charge of a special mission or auxiliary a remnant of the st asaphs of the past placed under the care of a divinity student at four hundred dollars per annum his charge included all the slums and three police courts and two music halls and the city jail one sunday afternoon in every three months the rector and several ladies went down and sang hymns for him in his missionhouse but his work was really very easy a funeral for example at the mission was a simple affair meaning nothing more than the preparation of a plain coffin and a glassless hearse and the distribution of a few artificial everlasting flowers to women crying in their aprons a thing easily done whereas in st asaphs parish where all the really important souls were a funeral was a large event requiring taste and tact and a nice shading of delicacy in distinguishing mourners from beneficiaries and private grief from business representation at the ceremony a funeral with a plain coffin and a hearse was as nothing beside an interment with a casket smothered in hothouse syringas borne in a coach and followed by special reporters from the financial papers  it appeared to the rector afterwards as almost a shocking coincidence that the first person whom he met upon the avenue should have been the rev dr mcteague himself mr furlong gave him the form of amiable good morning that the episcopal church always extends to those in error but he did not hear it the ministers head was bent low his eyes gazed into vacancy and from the movements of his lips and from the fact that he carried a leather case of notes he was plainly on his way to his philosophical lecture but the rector had no time to muse upon the abstracted appearance of his rival for as always happened to him he was no sooner upon the street than his parish work of the day began in fact he had hardly taken a dozen steps after passing dr mcteague when he was brought up standing by two beautiful parishioners with pink parasols  oh mr furlong exclaimed one of them so fortunate to happen to catch you we were just going into the rectory to consult you should the girlsfor the lawn tea for the guild on friday you knowwear white dresses with light blue sashes all the same or do you think we might allow them to wear any coloured sashes that they like what do you think  this was an important problem in fact there was a piece of parish work here that it took the reverend fareforth half an hour to attend to standing the while in earnest colloquy with the two ladies under the shadow of the elm trees but a clergyman must never be grudging of his time  goodbye then they said at last are you coming to the browning club this morning oh so sorry but we shall see you at the musicale this afternoon shall we not  oh i trust so said the rector  how dreadfully hard he works said the ladies to one another as they moved away  thus slowly and with many interruptions the rector made his progress along the avenue at times he stopped to permit a pinkcheeked infant in a perambulator to beat him with a rattle while he inquired its age of an episcopal nurse gay with flowing ribbons he lifted his hat to the bright parasols of his parishioners passing in glistening motors bowed to episcopalians nodded amiably to presbyterians and even acknowledged with his lifted hat the passing of persons of graver forms of error  thus he took his way along the avenue and down a side street towards the business district of the city until just at the edge of it where the trees were about to stop and the shops were about to begin he found himself at the door of the hymnal supply corporation limited the premises as seen from the outside combined the idea of an office with an ecclesiastical appearance the door was as that of a chancel or vestry there was a large plateglass window filled with bibles and testaments all spread open and showing every variety of language in their pages these were marked arabic syriac coptic ojibway irish and so forth on the window in small white lettering were the words hymnal supply corporation and below that hosanna pipe and steam organ incorporated and still lower the legend bible society of the good shepherd limited  there was no doubt of the sacred character of the place here laboured mr furlong senior the father of the rev edward fareforth he was a man of many activities president and managing director of the companies just mentioned trustee and secretary of st asaphs honorary treasurer of the university etc and each of his occupations and offices was marked by something of a supramundane character something higher than ordinary business his different official positions naturally overlapped and brought him into contact with himself from a variety of angles thus he sold himself hymn books at a price per thousand made as a business favour to himself negotiated with himself the purchase of the tenthousanddollar organ making a price on it to himself that he begged himself to regard as confidential and as treasurer of the college he sent himself an informal note of enquiry asking if he knew of any sound investment for the annual deficit of the college funds a matter of some sixty thousand dollars a year which needed very careful handling any manand there are many suchwho has been concerned with business dealings of this sort with himself realizes that they are more satisfactory than any other kind  to what better person then could the rector of st asaphs bring the quarterly accounts and statements of his church than to mr furlong senior  the outer door was opened to the rector by a sanctified boy with such a face as is only found in the choirs of the episcopal church in an outer office through which the rector passed were two sacred stenographers with hair as golden as the daffodils of sheba copying confidential letters on absolutely noiseless typewriters they were making offers of bibles in halfcarload lots at two and a half per cent reduction offering to reduce st mark by two cents on condition of immediate export and to lay down st john fob san francisco for seven cents while regretting that they could deliver fifteen thousand rock of ages in missouri on no other terms than cash  the sacred character of their work lent them a preoccupation beautiful to behold  in the room beyond them was a whitehaired confidential clerk venerable as the song of solomon and by him mr fareforth furlong was duly shown into the office of his father  good morning edward said mr furlong senior as he shook hands i was expecting you and while i think of it i have just had a letter from philippa she and tom will be home in two or three weeks she writes from egypt she wishes me to tell you as no doubt you have already anticipated that she thinks she can hardly continue to be a member of the congregation when they come back no doubt you felt this yourself  oh entirely said the rector surely in matters of belief a wife must follow her husband  exactly especially as toms uncles occupy the position they do with regard to mr furlong jerked his head backwards and pointed with his thumb over his shoulder in a way that his son knew was meant to indicate st osophs church  the overend brothers who were toms uncles his name being tom overend were as everybody knew among the principal supporters of st osophs not that they were by origin presbyterians but they were selfmade men which put them once and for all out of sympathy with such a place as st asaphs we made ourselves the two brothers used to repeat in defiance of the catechism of the anglican church they never wearied of explaining how mr dick the senior brother had worked overtime by day to send mr george the junior brother to school by night and how mr george had then worked overtime by night to send mr dick to school by day thus they had come up the business ladder hand over hand landing later on in life on the platform of success like two corpulent acrobats panting with the strain of it for years mr george would explain we had father and mother to keep as well then they died and dick and me saw daylight by which he meant no harm at all but only stated a fact and concealed the virtue of it  and being selfmade men they made it a point to do what they could to lessen the importance of such an institution as st asaphs church by the same contrariety of nature the two overend brothers their business name was overend brothers limited were supporters of the dissentient young mens guild and the second or rival university settlement and of anything or everything that showed a likelihood of making trouble on this principle they were warm supporters and friends of the rev dr mcteague the minister had even gone so far as to present to the brothers a copy of his philosophical work mcteagues exposition of the kantian hypothesis and the two brothers had read it through in the office devoting each of them a whole morning to it mr dick the senior brother had said that he had never seen anything like it and mr george the junior had declared that a man who could write that was capable of anything  on the whole it was evident that the relations between the overend family and the presbyterian religion were too intimate to allow mrs tom overend formerly miss philippa furlong to sit anywhere else of a sunday than under dr mcteague  philippa writes continued mr furlong that under the circumstances she and tom would like to do something for your church she would likeyes i have the letter hereto give you as a surprise of course either a new font or a carved pulpit or perhaps a cheque she wishes me on no account to mention it to you directly but to ascertain indirectly from you what would be the better surprise  oh a cheque i think said the rector one can do so much more with it after all  precisely said his father he was well aware of many things that can be done with a cheque that cannot possibly be done with a font  thats settled then resumed mr furlong and now i suppose you want me to run my eye over your quarterly statements do you not before we send them in to the trustees that is what youve come for is it not  yes said the rector drawing a bundle of blue and white papers from his pocket i have everything with me our showing is i believe excellent though i fear i fail to present it as clearly as it might be done  mr furlong senior spread the papers on the table before him and adjusted his spectacles to a more convenient angle he smiled indulgently as he looked at the documents before him  i am afraid you would never make an accountant edward he said  i fear not said the rector  your items said his father are entered wrongly here for example in the general statement you put down distribution of coals to the poor to your credit in the same way bibles and prizes to the sunday school you again mark to your credit why dont you see my boy that these things are debits when you give out bibles or distribute fuel to the poor you give out something for which you get no return it is a debit on the other hand such items as church offertory scholars pennies etc are pure profit surely the principle is clear  i think i see it better now said the rev edward  perfectly plain isnt it his father went on and here again paupers burial fund a loss enter it as such christmas gift to verger and sexton an absolute lossyou get nothing in return widows mite fines inflicted in sunday school etc these are profit write them down as such by this method you see in ordinary business we can tell exactly where we stand anything which we give out without return or reward we count as a debit all that we take from others without giving in return we count as so much to our credit  ah yes murmured the rector i begin to understand  very good but after all edward i mustnt quarrel with the mere form of your accounts the statement is really a splendid showing i see that not only is our mortgage and debenture interest all paid to date but that a number of our enterprises are making a handsome return i notice for example that the girls friendly society of the church not only pays for itself but that you are able to take something out of its funds and transfer it to the mens book club excellent and i observe that you have been able to take a large portion of the soup kitchen fund and put it into the rectors picnic account very good indeed in this respect your figures are a model for church accounts anywhere  mr furlong continued his scrutiny of the accounts excellent he murmured and on the whole an annual surplus i see of several thousands but stop a bit he continued checking himself whats this are you aware edward that you are losing money on your foreign missions account  i feared as much said edward  its incontestable look at the figures for yourself missionarys salary so much clothes and books to converts so much voluntary and other offerings of converts so much why youre losing on it edward exclaimed mr furlong and he shook his head dubiously at the accounts before him  i thought protested his son that in view of the character of the work itself  quite so answered his father quite so i fully admit the force of that i am only asking you is it worth it mind you i am not speaking now as a christian but as a businessman is it worth it  i thought that perhaps in view of the fact of our large surplus in other directions  exactly said his father a heavy surplus it is precisely on that point that i wished to speak to you this morning you have at present a large annual surplus and there is every prospect under providencein fact i think in any caseof it continuing for years to come if i may speak very frankly i should say that as long as our reverend friend dr mcteague continues in his charge of st osophsand i trust that he may be spared for many years to comeyou are likely to enjoy the present prosperity of your church very good the question arises what disposition are we to make of our accumulating funds  yes said the rector hesitating  i am speaking to you now said his father not as the secretary of your church but as president of the hymnal supply company which i represent here now please understand edward i dont want in any way to force or control your judgment i merely wish to show you certainshall i say certain opportunities that present themselves for the disposal of our funds the matter can be taken up later formally by yourself and the trustees of the church as a matter of fact i have already written to myself as secretary in the matter and i have received what i consider a quite encouraging answer let me explain what i propose  mr furlong senior rose and opening the door of the office  everett he said to the ancient clerk kindly give me a bible  it was given to him  mr furlong stood with the bible poised in his hand  now we he went on i mean the hymnal supply corporation have an idea for bringing out an entirely new bible  a look of dismay appeared on the saintly face of the rector  a new bible he gasped  precisely said his father a new bible this oneand we find it every day in our businessis all wrong  all wrong said the rector with horror in his face  my dear boy exclaimed his father pray pray do not misunderstand me dont imagine for a moment that i mean wrong in a religious sense such a thought could never i hope enter my mind all that i mean is that this bible is badly made up  badly made up repeated his son as mystified as ever  i see that you do not understand me what i mean is this let me try to make myself quite clear for the market of today this bibleand he poised it again on his hand as if to test its weight is too heavy the people of today want something lighter something easier to get hold of now if  but what mr furlong was about to say was lost forever to the world  for just at this juncture something occurred calculated to divert not only mr furlongs sentence but the fortunes and the surplus of st asaphs itself at the very moment when mr furlong was speaking a newspaper delivery man in the street outside handed to the sanctified boy the office copy of the noonday paper and the boy had no sooner looked at its headlines than he said how dreadful being sanctified he had no stronger form of speech than that but he handed the paper forthwith to one of the stenographers with hair like the daffodils of sheba and when she looked at it she exclaimed how awful and she knocked at once at the door of the ancient clerk and gave the paper to him and when he looked at it and saw the headline the ancient clerk murmured ah in the gentle tone in which very old people greet the news of catastrophe or sudden death  but in his turn he opened mr furlongs door and put down the paper laying his finger on the column for a moment without a word  mr furlong stopped short in his sentence dear me he said as his eyes caught the item of news how very dreadful  what is it said the rector  dr mcteague answered his father he has been stricken with paralysis  how shocking said the rector aghast but when i saw him only this morning  it has just happened said his father following down the column of the newspaper as he spoke this morning at the university in his classroom at a lecture dear me how dreadful i must go and see the president at once  mr furlong was about to reach for his hat and stick when at that moment the aged clerk knocked at the door  dr boomer he announced in a tone of solemnity suited to the occasion  dr boomer entered shook hands in silence and sat down  you have heard our sad news i suppose he said he used the word our as between the university president and his honorary treasurer  how did it happen asked mr furlong  most distressing said the president dr mcteague it seems had just entered his ten oclock class the hour was about tentwenty and was about to open his lecture when one of his students rose in his seat and asked a question it is a practice continued dr boomer which i need hardly say we do not encourage the young man i believe was a newcomer in the philosophy class at any rate he asked dr mcteague quite suddenly it appears how he could reconcile his theory of transcendental immaterialism with a scheme of rigid moral determinism dr mcteague stared for a moment his mouth so the class assert painfully open the student repeated the question and poor mcteague fell forward over his desk paralysed  is he dead gasped mr furlong  no said the president but we expect his death at any moment dr slyder i may say is with him now and is doing all he can  in any case i suppose he could hardly recover enough to continue his college duties said the young rector  out of the question said the president i should not like to state that of itself mere paralysis need incapacitate a professor dr thrum our professor of the theory of music is as you know paralysed in his ears and mr slant our professor of optics is paralysed in his right eye but this is a case of paralysis of the brain i fear it is incompatible with professorial work  then i suppose said mr furlong senior we shall have to think of the question of a successor  they had both been thinking of it for at least three minutes we must said the president for the moment i feel too stunned by the sad news to act i have merely telegraphed to two or three leading colleges for a locum tenens and sent out a few advertisements announcing the chair as vacant but it will be difficult to replace mcteague he was a man added dr boomer rehearsing in advance unconsciously no doubt his forthcoming oration over dr mcteagues death of a singular grasp a breadth of culture and he was able as few men are to instil what i might call a spirit of religion into his teaching his lectures indeed were suffused with moral instruction and exercised over his students an influence second only to that of the pulpit itself  he paused  ah yes the pulpit said mr furlong there indeed you will miss him  that said dr boomer very reverently is our real loss deep irreparable i suppose indeed i am certain we shall never again see such a man in the pulpit of st osophs which reminds me he added more briskly i must ask the newspaper people to let it be known that there will be service as usual the day after tomorrow and that dr mcteagues death will of course make no differencethat is to sayi must see the newspaper people at once                            that afternoon all the newspaper editors in the city were busy getting their obituary notices ready for the demise of dr mcteague  the death of dr mcteague wrote the editor of the commercial and financial undertone a paper which had almost openly advocated the ministers dismissal for five years back comes upon us as an irreparable loss his place will be difficult nay impossible to fill whether as a philosopher or a divine he cannot be replaced  we have no hesitation in saying so wrote the editor of the plutorian times a threecent morning paper which was able to take a broad or threecent point of view of men and things that the loss of dr mcteague will be just as much felt in europe as in america to germany the news that the hand that penned mcteagues shorter exposition of the kantian hypothesis has ceased to write will come with the shock of poignant anguish while to france  the editor left the article unfinished at that point after all he was a ready writer and he reflected that there would be time enough before actually going to press to consider from what particular angle the blow of mcteagues death would strike down the people of france  so ran in speech and in writing during two or three days the requiem of dr mcteague  altogether there were more kind things said of him in the three days during which he was taken for dead than in thirty years of his lifewhich seemed a pity  and after it all at the close of the third day dr mcteague feebly opened his eyes  but when he opened them the world had already passed on and left him behind    chapter seven the ministrations of the rev uttermust dumfarthing  well then gentlemen i think we have all agreed upon our man  mr dick overend looked around the table as he spoke at the managing trustees of st osophs church they were assembled in an upper committee room of the mausoleum club their official place of meeting was in a board room off the vestry of the church but they had felt a draught in it some four years ago which had wafted them over to the club as their place of assembly in the club there were no draughts  mr dick overend sat at the head of the table his brother george beside him and dr boomer at the foot beside them were mr boulder mr skinyer of skinyer and beatem and the rest of the trustees  you are agreed then on the reverend uttermust dumfarthing  quite agreed murmured several trustees together  a most remarkable man said dr boomer i heard him preach in his present church he gave utterance to thoughts that i have myself been thinking for years i never listened to anything so sound or so scholarly  i heard him the night he preached in new york said mr boulder he preached a sermon to the poor he told them they were no good i never heard outside of a scotch pulpit such splendid invective  is he scotch said one of the trustees  of scotch parentage said the university president i believe he is one of the dumfarthings of dunfermline dumfries  everybody said oh and there was a pause  is he married asked one of the trustees i understand answered dr boomer that he is a widower with one child a little girl  does he make any conditions  none whatever said the chairman consulting a letter before him except that he is to have absolute control and in regard to salary these two points settled he says he places himself entirely in our hands  and the salary asked someone  ten thousand dollars said the chairman payable quarterly in advance  a chorus of approval went round the table good excellent a firstclass man muttered the trustees just what we want  i am sure gentlemen said mr dick overend voicing the sentiments of everybody we do not want a cheap man several of the candidates whose names have been under consideration here have been in many respectsin point of religious qualification let us saymost desirable men the name of dr mcskwirt for example has been mentioned with great favour by several of the trustees but hes a cheap man i feel we dont want him  what is mr dumfarthing getting where he is asked mr boulder  nine thousand nine hundred said the chairman  and dr mcskwirt  fourteen hundred dollars  well that settles it exclaimed everybody with a burst of enlightenment  and so it was settled  in fact nothing could have been plainer  i suppose said mr george overend as they were about to rise that we are quite justified in taking it for granted that dr mcteague will never be able to resume work  oh absolutely for granted said dr boomer poor mcteague i hear from slyder that he was making desperate efforts this morning to sit up in bed his nurse with difficulty prevented him  is his power of speech gone asked mr boulder  practically so in any case dr slyder insists on his not using it in fact poor mcteagues mind is a wreck his nurse was telling me that this morning he was reaching out his hand for the newspaper and seemed to want to read one of the editorials it was quite pathetic concluded dr boomer shaking his head  so the whole matter was settled and next day all the town knew that st osophs church had extended a call to the rev uttermust dumfarthing and that he had accepted it                            within a few weeks of this date the reverend uttermust dumfarthing moved into the manse of st osophs and assumed his charge and forthwith he became the sole topic of conversation on plutoria avenue have you seen the new minister of st osophs everybody asked have you been to hear dr dumfarthing were you at st osophs church on sunday morning ah you really should go most striking sermon i ever listened to  the effect of him was absolute and instantaneous there was no doubt of it  my dear said mrs buncomhearst to one of her friends in describing how she had met him i never saw a more striking man such power in his face mr boulder introduced him to me on the avenue and he hardly seemed to see me at all simply scowled i was never so favourably impressed with any man  on his very first sunday he preached to his congregation on eternal punishment leaning forward in his black gown and shaking his fist at them dr mcteague had never shaken his fist in thirty years and as for the rev fareforth furlong he was incapable of it  but the rev uttermust dumfarthing told his congregation that he was convinced that at least seventy per cent of them were destined for eternal punishment and he didnt call it by that name but labelled it simply and forcibly hell the word had not been heard in any church in the better part of the city for a generation the congregation was so swelled next sunday that the minister raised the percentage to eightyfive and everybody went away delighted young and old flocked to st osophs before a month had passed the congregation at the evening service at st asaphs church was so slender that the offertory as mr furlong senior himself calculated was scarcely sufficient to pay the overhead charge of collecting it  the presence of so many young men sitting in serried files close to the front was the only feature of his congregation that extorted from the rev mr dumfarthing something like approval  it is a joy to me to see he remarked to several of his trustees that there are in the city so many godly young men whatever the elders may be  but there may have been a secondary cause at work for among the godly young men of plutoria avenue the topic of conversation had not been have you heard the new presbyterian minister but have you seen his daughter you havent well say  for it turned out that the child of dr uttermust dumfarthing socalled by the trustees was the kind of child that wears a little round hat straight from paris with an upright feather in it and a silk dress in four sections and shoes with high heels that would have broken the heart of john calvin moreover she had the distinction of being the only person on plutoria avenue who was not one whit afraid of the reverend uttermust dumfarthing she even amused herself in violation of all rules by attending evening service at st asaphs where she sat listening to the reverend edward and feeling that she had never heard anything so sensible in her life  im simply dying to meet your brother she said to mrs tom overend otherwise philippa hes such a complete contrast with father she knew no higher form of praise fathers sermons are always so frightfully full of religion  and philippa promised that meet him she should  but whatever may have been the effect of the presence of catherine dumfarthing there is no doubt the greater part of the changed situation was due to dr dumfarthing himself  everything he did was calculated to please he preached sermons to the rich and told them they were mere cobwebs and they liked it he preached a special sermon to the poor and warned them to be mighty careful he gave a series of weekly talks to workingmen and knocked them sideways and in the sunday school he gave the children so fierce a talk on charity and the need of giving freely and quickly that such a stream of pennies and nickels poured into catherine dumfarthings sunday school fund as hadnt been seen in the church in fifty years  nor was mr dumfarthing different in his private walk of life he was heard to speak openly of the overend brothers as men of wrath and they were so pleased that they repeated it to half the town it was the best business advertisement they had had for years  dr boomer was captivated with the man true scholarship he murmured as dr dumfarthing poured undiluted greek and hebrew from the pulpit scorning to translate a word of it under dr boomers charge the minister was taken over the length and breadth of plutoria university and reviled it from the foundations up  our library said the president two hundred thousand volumes  aye said the minister a powerful heap of rubbish ill be bound  the photograph of our last years graduating class said the president  a poor lot to judge by the faces of them said the minister  this dr dumfarthing is our new radiographic laboratory mr spiff our demonstrator is preparing slides which i believe actually show the movements of the atom itself do they not mr spiff  ah said the minister piercing mr spiff from beneath his dark brows it will not avail you young man  dr boomer was delighted poor mcteague he saidand by the way boyster i hear that mcteague is trying to walk again a great error it shouldnt be allowedpoor mcteague knew nothing of science  the students themselves shared in the enthusiasm especially after dr dumfarthing had given them a sunday afternoon talk in which he showed that their studies were absolutely futile as soon as they knew this they went to work with a vigour that put new life into the college                            meantime the handsome face of the reverend edward fareforth furlong began to wear a sad and weary look that had never been seen on it before he watched the congregation drifting from st asaphs to st osophs and was powerless to prevent it his sadness reached its climax one bright afternoon in the late summer when he noticed that even his episcopal blackbirds were leaving his elms and moving westward to the spruce trees of the manse  he stood looking at them with melancholy on his face why edward cried his sister philippa as her motor stopped beside him how doleful you look get into the car and come out into the country for a ride let the parish teas look after themselves for today  tom philippas husband was driving his own carhe was rich enough to be able toand seated with philippa in the car was an unknown person as prettily dressed as philippa herself to the rector she was presently introduced as miss catherine somethinghe didnt hear the rest of it nor did he need to it was quite plain that her surname whatever it was was a very temporary and transitory affair  so they sped rapidly out of the city and away out into the country mile after mile through cool crisp air and among woods with the touch of autumn bright already upon them and with blue sky and great still clouds white overhead and the afternoon was so beautiful and so bright that as they went along there was no talk about religion at all nor was there any mention of mothers auxiliaries or girls friendly societies nor any discussion of the poor it was too glorious a day but they spoke instead of the new dances and whether they had come to stay and of such sensible topics as that then presently as they went on still further philippa leaned forwards and talked to tom over his shoulder and reminded him that this was the very road to castel casteggio and asked him if he remembered coming up it with her to join the newberrys ever so long ago whatever it was that tom answered it is not recorded but it is certain that it took so long in the saying that the reverend edward talked in teteatete with catherine for fifteen measured miles and was unaware that it was more than five minutes among other things he said and she agreedor she said and he agreedthat for the new dances it was necessary to have always one and the same partner and to keep that partner all the time and somehow simple sentiments of that sort when said direct into a pair of listening blue eyes behind a purple motor veil acquire an infinite significance  then not much after that say three or four minutes they were all of a sudden back in town again running along plutoria avenue and to the rectors surprise the motor was stopping outside the manse and catherine was saying oh thank you ever so much philippa it was just heavenly which showed that the afternoon had had its religious features after all what said the rectors sister as they moved off again didnt you know thats catherine dumfarthing                            when the rev fareforth furlong arrived home at the rectory he spent an hour or so in the deepest of deep thought in an armchair in his study nor was it any ordinary parish problem that he was revolving in his mind he was trying to think out some means by which his sister juliana might be induced to commit the sin of calling on the daughter of a presbyterian minister  the thing had to be represented as in some fashion or other an act of selfdenial a form of mortification of the flesh otherwise he knew juliana would never do it but to call on miss catherine dumfarthing seemed to him such an altogether delightful and unspeakably blissful process that he hardly knew how to approach the topic so when juliana presently came home the rector could find no better way of introducing the subject than by putting it on the ground of philippas marriage to miss dumfarthings fathers trustees nephew  juliana he said dont you think that perhaps on account of philippa and tom you oughtor at least it might be best for you to call on miss dumfarthing  juliana turned to her brother as he laid aside her bonnet and her black gloves  ive just been there this afternoon she said  there was something as near to a blush on her face as her brother had ever seen  but she was not there he said  no answered juliana but mr dumfarthing was i stayed and talked some time with him waiting for her  the rector gave a sort of whistle or rather that blowing out of air which is the episcopal symbol for it  didnt you find him pretty solemn he said  solemn answered his sister surely edward a man in such a calling as his ought to be solemn  i dont mean that exactly said the rector i meanerhard bitter so to speak  edward exclaimed juliana how can you speak so mr dumfarthing hard mr dumfarthing bitter why edward the man is gentleness and kindness itself i dont think i ever met anyone so full of sympathy of compassion with suffering  julianas face had flushed it was quite plain that she saw things in the reverend uttermust dumfarthingas some one woman does in every manthat no one else could see  the reverend edward was abashed i wasnt thinking of his character he said i was thinking rather of his doctrines wait till you have heard him preach  juliana flushed more deeply still i heard him last sunday evening she said  the rector was silent and his sister as if impelled to speak went on  and i dont see edward how anyone could think him a hard or bigoted man in his creed he walked home with me to the gate just now and he was speaking of all the sin in the world and of how few how very few people can be saved and how many will have to be burned as worthless and he spoke so beautifully he regrets it edward regrets it deeply it is a real grief to him  on which juliana half in anger withdrew and her brother the rector sat back in his chair with smiles rippling all over his saintly face for he had been wondering whether it would be possible even remotely possible to get his sister to invite the dumfarthings to high tea at the rectory some day at six oclock evening dinner was out of the question and now he knew within himself that the thing was as good as done                            while such things as these were happening and about to happen there were many others of the congregation of st asaphs beside the rector to whom the growing situation gave cause for serious perplexities indeed all who were interested in the church the trustees and the mortgagees and the underlying debentureholders were feeling anxious for some of them underlay the sunday school whose scholars offerings had declined forty per cent and others underlay the new organ not yet paid for while others were lying deeper still beneath the ground site of the church with seven dollars and a half a square foot resting on them  i dont like it said mr lucullus fyshe to mr newberry they were both prominent members of the congregation i dont like the look of things i took up a block of furlongs bonds on his guild building from what seemed at the time the best of motives the interest appeared absolutely certain now its a month overdue on the last quarter i feel alarmed  neither do i like it said mr newberry shaking his head and im sorry for fareforth furlong an excellent fellow fyshe excellent i keep wondering sunday after sunday if there isnt something i can do to help him out one might do something further perhaps in the way of new buildings or alterations i have in fact offeredby myself i mean and without other aidto dynamite out the front of his church underpin it and put him in a norman gateway either that or blast out the back of it where the choir sit just as he likes i was thinking about it last sunday as they were singing the anthem and realizing what a lot one might do there with a few sticks of dynamite  i doubt it said mr fyshe in fact newberry to speak very frankly i begin to ask myself is furlong the man for the post  oh surely said mr newberry in protest  personally a charming fellow went on mr fyshe but is he all said and done quite the man to conduct a church in the first place he is not a businessman  no said mr newberry reluctantly that i admit  very good and secondly even in the matter of his religion itself one always feels as if he were too little fixed too unstable he simply moves with the times that at least is what people are beginning to say of him that he is perpetually moving with the times it doesnt do newberry it doesnt do whereupon mr newberry went away troubled and wrote to fareforth furlong a confidential letter with a signed cheque in it for the amount of mr fyshes interest and with such further offerings of dynamite of underpinning and blasting as his conscience prompted  when the rector received and read the note and saw the figures of the cheque there arose such a thankfulness in his spirit as he hadnt felt for months and he may well have murmured for the repose of mr newberrys soul a prayer not found in the rubric of king james  all the more cause had he to feel light at heart for as it chanced it was on that same evening that the dumfarthings father and daughter were to take tea at the rectory indeed a few minutes before six oclock they might have been seen making their way from the manse to the rectory  on their way along the avenue the minister took occasion to reprove his daughter for the worldliness of her hat it was a little trifle from new york that she had bought out of the sunday school moneya temporary loan and a little further on he spoke to her severely about the parasol she carried and further yet about the strange fashion specially condemned by the old testament in which she wore her hair so catherine knew in her heart from this that she must be looking her very prettiest and went into the rectory radiant  the tea was of course an awkward meal at the best there was an initial difficulty about grace not easily surmounted and when the rev mr dumfarthing sternly refused tea as a pernicious drink weakening to the system the anglican rector was too ignorant of the presbyterian system to know enough to give him scotch whiskey  but there were bright spots in the meal as well the rector was even able to ask catherine sideways as a personal question if she played tennis and she was able to whisper behind her hand not allowed and to make a face in the direction of her father who was absorbed for the moment in a theological question with juliana indeed before the conversation became general again the rector had contrived to make a rapid arrangement with catherine whereby she was to come with him to the newberrys tennis court the day following and learn the game with or without permission  so the tea was perhaps a success in its way and it is noteworthy that juliana spent the days that followed it in reading calvins institutes specially loaned to her and dumfarthing on the certainty of damnation a gift and in praying for her brothera task practically without hope during which same time the rector in white flannels and catherine in a white duck skirt and blouse were flying about on the green grass of the newberrys court and calling love love all to one another so gaily and so brazenly that even mr newberry felt that there must be something in it  but all these things came merely as interludes in the moving currents of greater events for as the summer faded into autumn and autumn into winter the anxieties of the trustees of st asaphs began to call for action of some sort                            edward said the rectors father on the occasion of their next quarterly discussion i cannot conceal from you that the position of things is very serious your statements show a falling off in every direction your interest is everywhere in arrears your current account overdrawn to the limit at this rate you know the end is inevitable your debenture and bondholders will decide to foreclose and if they do you know there is no power that can stop them even with your limited knowledge of business you are probably aware that there is no higher power that can influence or control the holder of a first mortgage  i fear so said the rev edward very sadly  do you not think perhaps that some of the shortcoming lies with yourself continued mr furlong is it not possible that as a preacher you fail somewhat do not as it were deal sufficiently with fundamental things as others do you leave untouched the truly vital issues such things as the creation death and if i may refer to it the life beyond the grave  as a result of which the reverend edward preached a series of special sermons on the creation for which he made a special and arduous preparation in the library of plutoria university he said that it had taken a million possibly a hundred million years of quite difficult work to accomplish and that though when we looked at it all was darkness still we could not be far astray if we accepted and held fast to the teachings of sir charles lyell the book of genesis he said was not to be taken as meaning a day when it said a day but rather something other than a mere day and the word light meant not exactly light but possibly some sort of phosphorescence and that the use of the word darkness was to be understood not as meaning darkness but to be taken as simply indicating obscurity and when he had quite finished the congregation declared the whole sermon to be mere milk and water it insulted their intelligence they said after which a week later the rev dr dumfarthing took up the same subject and with the aid of seven plain texts pulverized the rector into fragments  one notable result of the controversy was that juliana furlong refused henceforth to attend her brothers church and sat even at morning service under the minister of st osophs  the sermon was i fear a mistake said mr furlong senior perhaps you had better not dwell too much on such topics we must look for aid in another direction in fact edward i may mention to you in confidence that certain of your trustees are already devising ways and means that may help us out of our dilemma  indeed although the reverend edward did not know it a certain idea or plan was already germinating in the minds of the most influential supporters of st asaphs  such was the situation of the rival churches of st asaph and st osoph as the autumn slowly faded into winter during which time the elm trees on plutoria avenue shivered and dropped their leaves and the chauffeurs of the motors first turned blue in their faces and then when the great snows came were suddenly converted into liveried coachmen with tall bearskins and whiskers like russian horseguards changing back again to bluenosed chauffeurs the very moment of a thaw during this time also the congregation of the reverend fareforth furlong was diminishing month by month and that of the reverend uttermust dumfarthing was so numerous that they filled up the aisles at the back of the church here the worshippers stood and froze for the minister had abandoned the use of steam heat in st osophs on the ground that he could find no warrant for it  during the same period other momentous things were happening such as that juliana furlong was reading under the immediate guidance of dr dumfarthing the history of the progress of disruption in the churches of scotland in ten volumes such also as that catherine dumfarthing was wearing a green and gold winter suit with russian furs and a balkan hat and a circassian feather which cut a wide swath of destruction among the young men on plutoria avenue every afternoon as she passed moreover by the strangest of coincidences she scarcely ever seemed to come along the snowcovered avenue without meeting the reverend edwarda fact which elicited new exclamations of surprise from them both every day and by an equally strange coincidence they generally seemed although coming in different directions to be bound for the same place towards which they wandered together with such slow steps and in such oblivion of the passersby that even the children on the avenue knew by instinct whither they were wandering  it was noted also that the broken figure of dr mcteague had reappeared upon the street leaning heavily upon a stick and greeting those he met with such a meek and willing affability as if in apology for his stroke of paralysis that all who talked with him agreed that mcteagues mind was a wreck  he stood and spoke to me about the children for at least a quarter of an hour related one of his former parishioners asking after them by name and whether they were going to school yet and a lot of questions like that he never used to speak of such things poor old mcteague im afraid he is getting soft in the head i know said the person addressed his mind is no good he stopped me the other day to say how sorry he was to hear about my brothers illness i could see from the way he spoke that his brain is getting feeble hes losing his grip he was speaking of how kind people had been to him after his accident and there were tears in his eyes i think hes getting batty  nor were even these things the most momentous happenings of the period for as winter slowly changed to early spring it became known that something of great portent was under way it was rumoured that the trustees of st asaphs church were putting their heads together this was striking news the last time that the head of mr lucullus fyshe for example had been placed side by side with that of mr newberry there had resulted a merger of four sodawater companies bringing what was called industrial peace over an area as big as texas and raising the price of soda by three peaceful cents per bottle and the last time that mr furlong seniors head had been laid side by side with those of mr rasselyerbrown and mr skinyer they had practically saved the country from the horrors of a coal famine by the simple process of raising the price of nut coal seventyfive cents a ton and thus guaranteeing its abundance  naturally therefore when it became known that such redoubtable heads as those of the trustees and the underlying mortgagees of st asaphs were being put together it was fully expected that some important development would follow it was not accurately known from which of the assembled heads first proceeded the great idea which was presently to solve the difficulties of the church it may well have come from that of mr lucullus fyshe certainly a head which had brought peace out of civil war in the hardware business by amalgamating ten rival stores and had saved the very lives of five hundred employees by reducing their wages fourteen per cent was capable of it  at any rate it was mr fyshe who first gave the idea a definite utterance  its the only thing furlong he said across the lunch table at the mausoleum club its the one solution the two churches cant live under the present conditions of competition we have here practically the same situation as we had with two rum distilleriesthe output is too large for the demand one or both of the two concerns must go under its their turn just now but these fellows are business men enough to know that it may be ours tomorrow well offer them a business solution well propose a merger  ive been thinking of it said mr furlong senior i suppose its feasible  feasible exclaimed mr fyshe why look whats being done every day everywhere from the standard oil company downwards  you would hardly i think said mr furlong with a quiet smile compare the standard oil company to a church well no i suppose not said mr fyshe and he too smiledin fact he almost laughed the notion was too ridiculous one could hardly compare a mere church to a thing of the magnitude and importance of the standard oil company  but on a lesser scale continued mr fyshe its the same sort of thing as for the difficulties of it i neednt remind you of the much greater difficulties we had to grapple with in the rum merger there you remember a number of the women held out as a matter of principle it was not mere business with them church union is different in fact it is one of the ideas of the day and everyone admits that what is needed is the application of the ordinary business principles of harmonious combination with a propererrestriction of output and general economy of operation  very good said mr furlong im sure if youre willing to try the rest of us are  all right said mr fyshe i thought of setting skinyer of skinyer and beatem to work on the form of the organization as you know he is not only a deeply religious man but he has already handled the tin pot combination and the united hardware and the associated tanneries he ought to find this quite simple                            within a day or two mr skinyer had already commenced his labours i must first he said get an accurate idea of the existing legal organization of the two churches  for which purpose he approached the rector of st asaphs i just want to ask you mr furlong said the lawyer a question or two as to the exact constitution the form so to speak of your church what is it is it a single corporate body  i suppose said the rector thoughtfully one would define it as an indivisible spiritual unit manifesting itself on earth quite so interrupted mr skinyer but i dont mean what it is in the religious sense i mean in the real sense i fail to understand said mr furlong  let me put it very clearly said the lawyer where does it get its authority  from above said the rector reverently  precisely said mr skinyer no doubt but i mean its authority in the exact sense of the term  it was enjoined on st peter began the rector but mr skinyer interrupted him  that i am aware of he said but what i mean iswhere does your church get its power for example to hold property to collect debts to use distraint against the property of others to foreclose its mortgages and to cause judgement to be executed against those who fail to pay their debts to it you will say at once that it has these powers direct from heaven no doubt that is true and no religious person would deny it but we lawyers are compelled to take a narrower a less elevating point of view are these powers conferred on you by the state legislature or by some higher authority  oh by a higher authority i hope said the rector very fervently whereupon mr skinyer left him without further questioning the rectors brain being evidently unfit for the subject of corporation law  on the other hand he got satisfaction from the rev dr dumfarthing at once  the church of st osoph said the minister is a perpetual trust holding property as such under a general law of the state and able as such to be made the object of suit or distraint i speak with some assurance as i had occasion to enquire into the matter at the time when i was looking for guidance in regard to the call i had received to come here                            its a quite simple matter mr skinyer presently reported to mr fyshe one of the churches is a perpetual trust the other practically a state corporation each has full control over its property provided nothing is done by either to infringe the purity of its doctrine  just what does that mean asked mr fyshe  it must maintain its doctrine absolutely pure otherwise if certain of its trustees remain pure and the rest do not those who stay pure are entitled to take the whole of the property this i believe happens every day in scotland where of course there is great eagerness to remain pure in doctrine  and what do you define as pure doctrine asked mr fyshe  if the trustees are in dispute said mr skinyer the courts decide but any doctrine is held to be a pure doctrine if all the trustees regard it as a pure doctrine  i see said mr fyshe thoughtfully its the same thing as what we called permissible policy on the part of directors in the tin pot combination  exactly assented mr skinyer and it means that for the merger we need nothingi state it very franklyexcept general consent                            the preliminary stages of the making of the merger followed along familiar business lines the trustees of st asaphs went through the process known as approaching the trustees of st osophs first of all for example mr lucullus fyshe invited mr asmodeus boulder of st osophs to lunch with him at the mausoleum club the cost of the lunch as is usual in such cases was charged to the general expense account of the church of course nothing whatever was said during the lunch about the churches or their finances or anything concerning them such discussion would have been a gross business impropriety a few days later the two brothers overend dined with mr furlong senior the dinner being charged directly to the contingencies account of st asaphs after which mr skinyer and his partner mr beatem went to the spring races together on the profit and loss account of st osophs and philippa overend and catherine dumfarthing were taken by the unforeseen disbursements account to the grand opera followed by a midnight supper  all of these things constituted what was called the promotion of the merger and were almost exactly identical with the successive stages of the making of the amalgamated distilleries and the associated tin pot corporation which was considered a most hopeful sign                            do you think theyll go into it asked mr newberry of mr furlong senior anxiously after all what inducement have they  every inducement said mr furlong all said and done theyve only one large assetdr dumfarthing were really offering to buy up dr dumfarthing by pooling our assets with theirs  and what does dr dumfarthing himself say to it  ah there i am not so sure said mr furlong that may be a difficulty so far there hasnt been a word from him and his trustees are absolutely silent about his views however we shall soon know all about it skinyer is asking us all to come together one evening next week to draw up the articles of agreement  has he got the financial basis arranged then  i believe so said mr furlong his idea is to form a new corporation to be known as the united church limited or by some similar name all the present mortgagees will be converted into unified bondholders the pew rents will be capitalized into preferred stock and the common stock drawing its dividend from the offertory will be distributed among all members in standing skinyer says that it is really an ideal form of church union one that he thinks is likely to be widely adopted it has the advantage of removing all questions of religion which he says are practically the only remaining obstacle to a union of all the churches in fact it puts the churches once and for all on a business basis  but what about the question of doctrine of belief asked mr newberry  skinyer says he can settle it answered mr furlong                            about a week after the above conversation the united trustees of st asaphs and st osophs were gathered about a huge eggshaped table in the board room of the mausoleum club they were seated in intermingled fashion after the precedent of the recent tin pot amalgamation and were smoking huge black cigars specially kept by the club for the promotion of companies and chargeable to expenses of organization at fifty cents a cigar there was an air of deep peace brooding over the assembly as among men who have accomplished a difficult and meritorious task  well then said mr skinyer who was in the chair with a pile of documents in front of him i think that our general basis of financial union may be viewed as settled  a murmur of assent went round the meeting the terms are set forth in the memorandum before us which you have already signed only one other pointa minor oneremains to be considered i refer to the doctrines or the religious belief of the new amalgamation  is it necessary to go into that asked mr boulder  not entirely perhaps said mr skinyer still there have been as you all know certain pointsi wont say of disagreementbut let us say of friendly argumentbetween the members of the different churchessuch things for example here he consulted his papers as the theory of the creation the salvation of the soul and so forth have been mentioned in this connection i have a memorandum of them here though the points escape me for the moment these you may say are not matters of first importance especially as compared with the intricate financial questions which we have already settled in a satisfactory manner still i think it might be well if i were permitted with your unanimous approval to jot down a memorandum or two to be afterwards embodied in our articles  there was a general murmur of approval very good said mr skinyer settling himself back in his chair now first in regard to the creation here he looked all round the meeting in a way to command attentionis it your wish that we should leave that merely to a gentlemens agreement or do you want an explicit clause  i think it might be well said mr dick overend to leave no doubt about the theory of the creation  good said mr skinyer i am going to put it down then something after this fashion on and after let us say august 1st proximo the process of the creation shall be held and is hereby held to be such and such only as is acceptable to a majority of the holders of common and preferred stock voting pro rata is that agreed  carried cried several at once  carried repeated mr skinyer now let us pass onhere he consulted his notesto item two eternal punishment i have made a memorandum as follows should any doubts arise on or after august first proximo as to the existence of eternal punishment they shall be settled absolutely and finally by a prorata vote of all the holders of common and preferred stock is that agreed  one moment said mr fyshe do you think that quite fair to the bondholders after all as the virtual holders of the property they are the persons most interested i should like to amend your clause and make it readi am not phrasing it exactly but merely giving the sense of itthat eternal punishment should be reserved for the mortgagees and bondholders  at this there was an outbreak of mingled approval and dissent several persons speaking at once in the opinion of some the stockholders of the company especially the preferred stockholders had as good a right to eternal punishment as the bondholders presently mr skinyer who had been busily writing notes held up his hand for silence  gentlemen he said will you accept this as a compromise we will keep the original clause but merely add to it the words but no form of eternal punishment shall be declared valid if displeasing to a threefifths majority of the holders of bonds  carried carried cried everybody  to which i think we need only add said mr skinyer a clause to the effect that all other points of doctrine belief or religious principle may be freely altered amended reversed or entirely abolished at any general annual meeting  there was a renewed chorus of carried carried and the trustees rose from the table shaking hands with one another and lighting fresh cigars as they passed out of the club into the night air  the only thing that i dont understand said mr newberry to dr boomer as they went out from the club arm in arm for they might now walk in that fashion with the same propriety as two of the principals in a distillery merger the only thing that i dont understand is why the reverend mr dumfarthing should be willing to consent to the amalgamation  do you really not know said dr boomer  no  you have heard nothing  not a word said mr newberry  ah rejoined the president i see that our men have kept it very quietnaturally so in view of the circumstances the truth is that the reverend mr dumfarthing is leaving us  leaving st osophs exclaimed mr newberry in utter astonishment  to our great regret he has had a calla most inviting field of work he says a splendid opportunity they offered him ten thousand one hundred we were only giving him ten thousand here though of course that feature of the situation would not weigh at all with a man like dumfarthing  oh no of course not said mr newberry  as soon as we heard of the call we offered him ten thousand three hundrednot that that would make any difference to a man of his character indeed dumfarthing was still waiting and looking for guidance when they offered him eleven thousand we couldnt meet it it was beyond us though we had the consolation of knowing that with such a man as dumfarthing the money made no difference  and he has accepted the call  yes he accepted it today he sent word to mr dick overend our chairman that he would remain in his manse looking for light until twothirty after which if we had not communicated with him by that hour he would cease to look for it  dear me said mr newberry deep in reflection so that when your trustees came to the meeting  exactly said dr boomerand something like a smile passed across his features for a moment dr dumfarthing had already sent away his telegram of acceptance  why then said mr newberry at the time of our discussion tonight you were in the position of having no minister  not at all we had already appointed a successor  a successor  certainly it will be in tomorrow mornings papers the fact is that we decided to ask dr mcteague to resume his charge  dr mcteague repeated mr newberry in amazement but surely his mind is understood to be  oh not at all interrupted dr boomer his mind appears if anything to be clearer and stronger than ever dr slyder tells us that paralysis of the brain very frequently has this effect it soothes the brainclears it as it were so that very often intellectual problems which occasioned the greatest perplexity before present no difficulty whatever afterwards dr mcteague i believe finds no trouble now in reconciling st pauls dialectic with hegel as he used to he says that so far as he can see they both mean the same thing  well well said mr newberry and will dr mcteague also resume his philosophical lectures at the university  we think it wiser not said the president while we feel that dr mcteagues mind is in admirable condition for clerical work we fear that professorial duties might strain it in order to get the full value of his remarkable intelligence we propose to elect him to the governing body of the university there his brain will be safe from any shock as a professor there would always be the fear that one of his students might raise a question in his class this of course is not a difficulty that arises in the pulpit or among the governors of the university  of course not said mr newberry                            thus was constituted the famous union or merger of the churches of st asaph and st osoph viewed by many of those who made it as the beginning of a new era in the history of the modern church  there is no doubt that it has been in every way an eminent success  rivalry competition and controversies over points of dogma have become unknown on plutoria avenue the parishioners of the two churches may now attend either of them just as they like as the trustees are fond of explaining it doesnt make the slightest difference the entire receipts of the churches being now pooled are divided without reference to individual attendance at each half year there is issued a printed statement which is addressed to the shareholders of the united churches limited and is hardly to be distinguished in style or material from the annual and semiannual reports of the tin pot amalgamation and the united hardware and other quasireligious bodies of the sort your directors the last of these documents states are happy to inform you that in spite of the prevailing industrial depression the gross receipts of the corporation have shown such an increase as to justify the distribution of a stock dividend of special offertory stock cumulative which will be offered at par to all holders of common or preferred shares you will also be gratified to learn that the directors have voted unanimously in favour of a special presentation to the rev uttermust dumfarthing on the occasion of his approaching marriage it was earnestly debated whether this gift should take the form as at first suggested of a cash presentation or as afterwards suggested of a written testimonial in the form of an address the latter course was finally adopted as being more fitting to the circumstances and the address has accordingly been prepared setting forth to the rev dr dumfarthing in old english lettering and wording the opinion which is held of him by his former parishioners  the approaching marriage referred of course to dr dumfarthings betrothal to juliana furlong it was not known that he had ever exactly proposed to her but it was understood that before giving up his charge he drew her attention in very severe terms to the fact that as his daughter was now leaving him he must either have someone else to look after his manse or else be compelled to incur the expense of a paid housekeeper this latter alternative he said was not one that he cared to contemplate he also reminded her that she was now at a time of life when she could hardly expect to pick and choose and that her spiritual condition was one of at least great uncertainty these combined statements are held under the law of scotland at any rate to be equivalent to an offer of marriage  catherine dumfarthing did not join her father in his new manse she first remained behind him as the guest of philippa overend for a few weeks while she was occupied in packing up her things after that she stayed for another two or three weeks to unpack them this had been rendered necessary by a conversation held with the reverend edward fareforth furlong in a shaded corner of the overends garden after which in due course of time catherine and edward were married the ceremony being performed by the reverend dr mcteague whose eyes filled with philosophical tears as he gave them his blessing  so the two churches of st asaph and st osoph stand side by side united and at peace their bells call softly back and forward to one another on sunday mornings and such is the harmony between them that even the episcopal rooks in the elm trees of st asaphs and the presbyterian crows in the spruce trees of st osophs are known to exchange perches on alternate sundays    chapter eight the great fight for clean government  as to the government of this city said mr newberry leaning back in a leather armchair at the mausoleum club and lighting a second cigar its rotten thats all  absolutely rotten assented mr dick overend ringing the bell for a second whiskey and soda  corrupt said mr newberry between two puffs of his cigar  full of graft said mr overend flicking his ashes into the grate  crooked aldermen said mr newberry  a bum city solicitor said mr overend and an infernal grafter for treasurer  yes assented mr newberry and then leaning forwards in his chair and looking carefully about the corridors of the club he spoke behind his hand and said and the mayors the biggest grafter of the lot and whats more he added sinking his voice to a whisper the time has come to speak out about it fearlessly  mr overend nodded its a tyranny he said  worse than russia rejoined mr newberry                            they had been sitting in a quiet corner of the clubit was on a sunday eveningand had fallen into talking first of all of the present rottenness of the federal politics of the united statesnot argumentatively or with any heat but with the reflective sadness that steals over an elderly man when he sits in the leather armchair of a comfortable club smoking a good cigar and musing on the decadence of the present day the rottenness of the federal government didnt anger them it merely grieved them  they could rememberboth of themhow different everything was when they were young men just entering on life when mr newberry and mr dick overend were young men went into congress from pure patriotism there was no such thing as graft or crookedness as they both admitted in those days and as for the united states senatehere their voices were almost hushed in awewhy when they were young the united states senate  but no neither of them could find a phrase big enough for their meaning  they merely repeated as for the united states senate and then shook their heads and took long drinks of whiskey and soda  then naturally speaking of the rottenness of the federal government had led them to talk of the rottenness of the state legislature how different from the state legislatures that they remembered as young men not merely different in the matter of graft but different so mr newberry said in the calibre of the men he recalled how he had been taken as a boy of twelve by his father to hear a debate he would never forget it giants he said that was what they were in fact the thing was more like a witenagemot than a legislature he said he distinctly recalled a man whose name he didnt recollect speaking on a question he didnt just remember what either for or against he just couldnt recall which it thrilled him he would never forget it it stayed in his memory as if it were yesterday  but as for the present legislaturehere mr dick overend sadly nodded assent in advance to what he knew was comingas for the present legislaturewellmr newberry had had he said occasion to visit the state capital a week before in connection with a railway bill that he was trying tothat is that he was anxious toin short in connection with a railway bill and when he looked about him at the men in the legislaturepositively he felt ashamed he could put it no other way than thatashamed  after which from speaking of the crookedness of the state government mr newberry and mr dick overend were led to talk of the crookedness of the city government and they both agreed as above that things were worse than in russia what secretly irritated them both most was that they had lived and done business under this infernal corruption for thirty or forty years and hadnt noticed it they had been too busy  the fact was that their conversation reflected not so much their own original ideas as a general wave of feeling that was passing over the whole community  there had come a momentquite suddenly it seemedwhen it occurred to everybody at the same time that the whole government of the city was rotten the word is a strong one but it is the one that was used look at the aldermen they saidrotten look at the city solicitor rotten and as for the mayor himselfphew  the thing came like a wave everybody felt it at once people wondered how any sane intelligent community could tolerate the presence of a set of corrupt scoundrels like the twenty aldermen of the city their names it was said were simply a byword throughout the united states for rank criminal corruption this was said so widely that everybody started hunting through the daily papers to try to find out who in blazes were aldermen anyhow twenty names are hard to remember and as a matter of fact at the moment when this wave of feeling struck the city nobody knew or cared who were aldermen anyway  to tell the truth the aldermen had been much the same persons for about fifteen or twenty years some were in the produce business others were butchers two were grocers and all of them wore blue checkered waistcoats and red ties and got up at seven in the morning to attend the vegetable and other markets nobody had ever really thought about themthat is to say nobody on plutoria avenue sometimes one saw a picture in the paper and wondered for a moment who the person was but on looking more closely and noticing what was written under it one said oh i see an alderman and turned to something else  whose funeral is that a man would sometimes ask on plutoria avenue oh just one of the city aldermen a passerby would answer hurriedly oh i see i beg your pardon i thought it might be somebody important  at which both laughed                            it was not just clear how and where this movement of indignation had started people said that it was part of a new wave of public morality that was sweeping over the entire united states certainly it was being remarked in almost every section of the country chicago newspapers were attributing its origin to the new vigour and the fresh ideals of the middle west in boston it was said to be due to a revival of the grand old new england spirit in philadelphia they called it the spirit of william penn in the south it was said to be the reassertion of southern chivalry making itself felt against the greed and selfishness of the north while in the north they recognized it at once as a protest against the sluggishness and ignorance of the south in the west they spoke of it as a revolt against the spirit of the east and in the east they called it a reaction against the lawlessness of the west but everywhere they hailed it as a new sign of the glorious unity of the country  if therefore mr newberry and mr overend were found to be discussing the corrupt state of their city they only shared in the national sentiments of the moment in fact in the same city hundreds of other citizens as disinterested as themselves were waking up to the realization of what was going on as soon as people began to look into the condition of things in the city they were horrified at what they found it was discovered for example that alderman schwefeldampf was an undertaker think of it in a city with a hundred and fifty deaths a week and sometimes even better an undertaker sat on the council a city that was about to expropriate land and to spend four hundred thousand dollars for a new cemetery had an undertaker on the expropriation committee itself and worse than that alderman undercutt was a butcher in a city that consumed a thousand tons of meat every week and alderman ohooliganit leaked outwas an irishman imagine it an irishman sitting on the police committee of the council in a city where thirtyeight and a half out of every hundred policemen were irish either by birth or parentage the thing was monstrous  so when mr newberry said its worse than russia he meant it every word                            now just as mr newberry and mr dick overend were finishing their discussion the huge bulky form of mayor mcgrath came ponderously past them as they sat he looked at them sideways out of his eyeshe had eyes like plums in a mottled faceand being a born politician he knew by the very look of them that they were talking of something that they had no business to be talking about butbeing a politicianhe merely said good evening gentlemen without a sign of disturbance  good evening mr mayor said mr newberry rubbing his hands feebly together and speaking in an ingratiating tone there is no more pitiable spectacle than an honest man caught in the act of speaking boldly and fearlessly of the evildoer  good evening mr mayor echoed mr dick overend also rubbing his hands warm evening is it not  the mayor gave no other answer than that deep guttural grunt which is technically known in municipal interviews as refusing to commit oneself  did he hear whispered mr newberry as the mayor passed out of the club  i dont care if he did whispered mr dick overend  half an hour later mayor mcgrath entered the premises of the thomas jefferson club which was situated in the rear end of a saloon and pool room far down in the town  boys he said to alderman ohooligan and alderman gorfinkel who were playing freezeout poker in a corner behind the pool tables you want to let the boys know to keep pretty dark and go easy theres a lot of talk i dont like about the elections going round the town let the boys know that just for a while the darker they keep the better  whereupon the word was passed from the thomas jefferson club to the george washington club and thence to the eureka club coloured and to the kossuth club hungarian and to various other centres of civic patriotism in the lower parts of the city and forthwith such a darkness began to spread over them that not even honest diogenes with his lantern could have penetrated their doings  if them stiffs wants to make trouble said the president of the george washington club to mayor mcgrath a day or two later they wont never know what theyve bumped up against  well said the heavy mayor speaking slowly and cautiously and eyeing his henchman with quiet scrutiny you want to go pretty easy now i tell you  the look which the mayor directed at his satellite was much the same glance that morgan the buccaneer might have given to one of his lieutenants before throwing him overboard                            meantime the wave of civic enthusiasm as reflected in the conversations of plutoria avenue grew stronger with every day  the thing is a scandal said mr lucullus fyshe why these fellows down at the city hall are simply a pack of rogues i had occasion to do some business there the other day it was connected with the assessment of our soda factories and do you know i actually found that these fellows take money  i say said mr peter spillikins to whom he spoke i say you dont say  its a fact repeated mr fyshe they take money i took the assistant treasurer aside and i said i want such and such done and i slipped a fifty dollar bill into his hand and the fellow took it took it like a shot  he took it gasped mr spillikins  he did said mr fyshe there ought to be a criminal law for that sort of thing  i say exclaimed mr spillikins they ought to go to jail for a thing like that  and the infernal insolence of them mr fyshe continued i went down the next day to see the deputy assistant about a thing connected with the same matter told him what i wanted and passed a fifty dollar bill across the counter and the fellow fairly threw it back at me in a perfect rage he refused it  refused it gasped mr spillikins i say  conversations such as this filled up the leisure and divided the business time of all the best people in the city  in the general gloomy outlook however one bright spot was observable the wave had evidently come just at the opportune moment for not only were civic elections pending but just at this juncture four or five questions of supreme importance would be settled by the incoming council there was for instance the question of the expropriation of the traction company a matter involving many millions there was the decision as to the renewal of the franchise of the citizens light companya vital question there was also the four hundred thousand dollar purchase of land for the new addition to the cemetery a matter that must be settled and it was felt especially on plutoria avenue to be a splendid thing that the city was waking up in the moral sense at the very time when these things were under discussion all the shareholders of the traction company and the citizens lightand they included the very best the most highminded people in the cityfelt that what was needed now was a great moral effort to enable them to lift the city up and carry it with them or if not all of it at any rate as much of it as they could  its a splendid movement said mr fyshe he was a leading shareholder and director of the citizens light what a splendid thing to think that we shant have to deal for our new franchise with a set of corrupt rapscallions like these present aldermen do you know furlong that when we approached them first with a proposition for a renewal for a hundred and fifty years they held us up said it was too long imagine that a hundred and fifty years only a century and a half too long for the franchise they expect us to install all our poles string our wires set up our transformers in their streets and then perhaps at the end of a hundred years find ourselves compelled to sell out at a beggarly valuation of course we knew what they wanted they meant us to hand them over fifty dollars each to stuff into their rascally pockets  outrageous said mr furlong  and the same thing with the cemetery land deal went on mr lucullus fyshe do you realize that if the movement hadnt come along and checked them those scoundrels would have given that rogue schwefeldampf four hundred thousand dollars for his fifty acres just think of it  i dont know said mr furlong with a thoughtful look upon his face that four hundred thousand dollars is an excessive price in and of itself for that amount of land  certainly not said mr fyshe very quietly and decidedly looking at mr furlong in a searching way as he spoke it is not a high price it seems to me speaking purely as an outsider a very fair reasonable price for fifty acres of suburban land if it were the right land if for example it were a case of making an offer for that very fine stretch of land about twenty acres is it not which i believe your corporation owns on the other side of the cemetery i should say four hundred thousand is a most modest price  mr furlong nodded his head reflectively  you had thought had you not of offering it to the city said mr fyshe  we did said mr furlong at a more or less nominal sumfour hundred thousand or whatever it might be we felt that for such a purpose almost sacred as it were one would want as little bargaining as possible  oh none at all assented mr fyshe  our feeling was went on mr furlong that if the city wanted our land for the cemetery extension it might have it at its own figurefour hundred thousand half a million in fact at absolutely any price from four hundred thousand up that they cared to put on it we didnt regard it as a commercial transaction at all our reward lay merely in the fact of selling it to them  exactly said mr fyshe and of course your land was more desirable from every point of view schwefeldampfs ground is encumbered with a growth of cypress and evergreens and weeping willows which make it quite unsuitable for an uptodate cemetery whereas yours as i remember it is bright and opena loose sandy soil with no trees and very little grass to overcome  yes said mr furlong we thought too that our ground having the tanneries and the chemical factory along the farther side of it was an ideal place for he paused seeking a mode of expressing his thought  for the dead said mr fyshe with becoming reverence and after this conversation mr fyshe and mr furlong senior understood one another absolutely in regard to the new movement  it was astonishing in fact how rapidly the light spread  is rasselyerbrown with us asked someone of mr fyshe a few days later  heart and soul answered mr fyshe hes very bitter over the way these rascals have been plundering the city on its coal supply he says that the city has been buying coal wholesale at the pit mouth at three fiftyutterly worthless stuff he tells me he has heard it said that everyone of these scoundrels has been paid from twentyfive to fifty dollars a winter to connive at it  dear me said the listener  abominable is it not said mr fyshe but as i said to rasselyerbrown what can one do if the citizens themselves take no interest in these things take your own case i said to him how is it that you a coal man are not helping the city in this matter why dont you supply the city he shook his head i wouldnt do it at threefifty he said no i answered but will you at five he looked at me for a moment and then he said fyshe ill do it at five or at anything over that they like to name if we get a new council in they may name their own figure good i said i hope all the other businessmen will be animated with the same spirit                            thus it was that the light broke and spread and illuminated in all directions people began to realize the needs of the city as they never had before mr boulder who owned among other things a stone quarry and an asphalt company felt that the paving of the streets was a disgrace mr skinyer of skinyer and beatem shook his head and said that the whole legal department of the city needed reorganization it needed he said new blood but he added always in a despairing tone how could one expect to run a department with the head of it drawing only six thousand dollars the thing was impossible if he argued they could superannuate the present chief solicitor and get a man a good man mr skinyer laid emphasis on this at say fifteen thousand there might be some hope  of course said mr skinyer to mr newberry in discussing the topic one would need to give him a proper staff of assistants so as to take off his hands all the routine workthe mere appearance in court the preparation of briefs the office consultation the tax revision and the purely legal work in that case he would have his hands free to devote himself entirely to those things whichin fact to turn his attention in whatever direction he might feel it was advisable to turn it                            within a week or two the public movement had found definite expression and embodied itself in the clean government association this was organized by a group of leading and disinterested citizens who held their first meeting in the largest upstairs room of the mausoleum club mr lucullus fyshe mr boulder and others keenly interested in obtaining simply justice for the stockholders of the traction and the citizens light were prominent from the start mr rasselyerbrown mr furlong senior and others were there not from special interest in the light or traction questions but as they said themselves from pure civic spirit dr boomer was there to represent the university with three of his most presentable professors cultivated men who were able to sit in a firstclass club and drink whiskey and soda and talk as well as any businessman present mr skinyer mr beatem and others represented the bar dr mcteague blinking in the blue tobacco smoke was there to stand for the church there were allround enthusiasts as well such as mr newberry and the overend brothers and mr peter spillikins  isnt it fine whispered mr spillikins to mr newberry to see a set of men like these all going into a thing like this not thinking of their own interests a bit                            mr fyshe as chairman addressed the meeting he told them they were there to initiate a great free voluntary movement of the people it had been thought wise he said to hold it with closed doors and to keep it out of the newspapers this would guarantee the league against the old underhand control by a clique that had hitherto disgraced every part of the administration of the city he wanted he said to see everything done henceforth in broad daylight and for this purpose he had summoned them there at night to discuss ways and means of action after they were once fully assured of exactly what they wanted to do and how they meant to do it the league he said would invite the fullest and freest advice from all classes in the city there were none he said amid great applause that were so lowly that they would not be invitedonce the platform of the league was settledto advise and cooperate all might help even the poorest subscription lists would be prepared which would allow any sum at all from one to five dollars to be given to the treasurer the league was to be democratic or nothing the poorest might contribute as little as one dollar even the richest would not be allowed to give more than five moreover he gave notice that he intended to propose that no actual official of the league should be allowed under its bylaws to give anything he himselfif they did him the honour to make him president as he had heard it hinted was their intentionwould be the first to bow to this rule he would efface himself he would obliterate himself content in the interests of all to give nothing he was able to announce similar pledges from his friends mr boulder mr furlong dr boomer and a number of others  quite a storm of applause greeted these remarks by mr fyshe who flushed with pride as he heard it  now gentlemen he went on this meeting is open for discussion remember it is quite informal anyone may speak i as chairman make no claim to control or monopolize the discussion let everyone understand  well then mr chairman began mr dick overend  one minute mr overend said mr fyshe i want everyone to understand that he may speak as  may i say then began mr newberry  pardon me mr newberry said mr fyshe i was wishing first to explain that not only may all participate but that we invite  in that case began mr newberry  before you speak interrupted mr fyshe let me add one word we must make our discussion as brief and to the point as possible i have a great number of things which i wish to say to the meeting and it might be well if all of you would speak as briefly and as little as possible has anybody anything to say  well said mr newberry what about organization and officers  we have thought of it said mr fyshe we were anxious above all things to avoid the objectionable and corrupt methods of a slate and a prepared list of officers which has disgraced every part of our city politics until the present time mr boulder mr furlong and mr skinyer and myself have therefore prepared a short list of offices and officers which we wish to submit to your fullest freest consideration it runs thus hon president mr l fyshe hon vicepresident mr a boulder hon secretary mr furlong hon treasurer mr o skinyer et ceterai neednt read it all youll see it posted in the hall later is that carried carried very good said mr fyshe  there was a moments pause while mr furlong and mr skinyer moved into seats beside mr fyshe and while mr furlong drew from his pocket and arranged the bundle of minutes of the meeting which he had brought with him as he himself said he was too neat and methodical a writer to trust to jotting them down on the spot  dont you think said mr newberry i speak as a practical man that we ought to do something to get the newspapers with us  most important assented several members  what do you think dr boomer asked mr fyshe of the university president will the newspapers be with us  dr boomer shook his head doubtfully its an important matter he said there is no doubt that we need more than anything the support of a clean wholesome unbiassed press that cant be bribed and is not subject to money influence i think on the whole our best plan would be to buy up one of the city newspapers  might it not be better simply to buy up the editorial staff said mr dick overend  we might do that admitted dr boomer there is no doubt that the corruption of the press is one of the worst factors that we have to oppose but whether we can best fight it by buying the paper itself or buying the staff is hard to say  suppose we leave it to a committee with full power to act said mr fyshe let us direct them to take whatever steps may in their opinion be best calculated to elevate the tone of the press the treasurer being authorized to second them in every way i for one am heartily sick of old underhand connection between city politics and the city papers if we can do anything to alter and elevate it it will be a fine work gentlemen well worth whatever it costs us                            thus after an hour or two of such discussion the clean government league found itself organized and equipped with a treasury and a programme and a platform the latter was very simple as mr fyshe and mr boulder said there was no need to drag in specific questions or try to define the action to be taken towards this or that particular detail such as the hundredandfiftyyear franchise beforehand the platform was simply expressed as honesty purity integrity this as mr fyshe said made a straight flat clean issue between the league and all who opposed it  this first meeting was of course confidential but all that it did was presently done over again with wonderful freshness and spontaneity at a large public meeting open to all citizens there was a splendid impromptu air about everything for instance when somebody away back in the hall said i move that mr lucullus fyshe be president of the league mr fyshe lifted his hand in unavailing protest as if this were the newest idea he had ever heard in his life  after all of which the clean government league set itself to fight the cohorts of darkness it was not just known where these were but it was understood that they were there all right somewhere in the platform speeches of the epoch they figured as working underground working in the dark working behind the scenes and so forth but the strange thing was that nobody could state with any exactitude just who or what it was that the league was fighting it stood for honesty purity and integrity that was all you could say about it  take for example the case of the press at the inception of the league it has been supposed that such was the venality and corruption of the city newspapers that it would be necessary to buy one of them but the word clean government had been no sooner uttered than it turned out that every one of the papers in the city was in favour of it in fact had been working for it for years  they vied with one another now in giving publicity to the idea the plutorian times printed a dotted coupon on the corner of its front sheet with the words are you in favour of clean government if so send us ten cents with this coupon and your name and address the plutorian citizen and home advocate went even further it printed a coupon which said are you out for a clean city if so send us twentyfive cents to this office we pledge ourselves to use it  the newspapers did more than this they printed from day to day such pictures as the portrait of mr fyshe with the legend below mr lucullus fyshe who says that government ought to be by the people from the people for the people and to the people and the next day another labelled mr p spillikins who says that all men are born free and equal and the next day a picture with the words tract of ground offered for cemetery by mr furlong showing rear of tanneries with head of mr furlong inserted  it was of course plain enough that certain of the aldermen of the old council were to be reckoned as part of the cohort of darkness that at least was clear we want no more men in control of the stamp of alderman gorfinkel and alderman schwefeldampf so said practically every paper in the city the public sense revolts at these men they are vultures who have feasted too long on the prostrate corpses of our citizens and so on the only trouble was to discover who or what had ever supported alderman gorfinkel and alderman schwefeldampf the very organizations that might have seemed to be behind them were evidently more eager for clean government than the league itself  the thomas jefferson club out for clean government so ran the newspaper headings of one day and of the next will help to clean up city government eureka club coloured endorses the league is done with darkness and the day after that sons of hungary share in good work kossuth club will vote with the league  so strong indeed was the feeling against the iniquitous aldermen that the public demand arose to be done with a council of aldermen altogether and to substitute government by a board the newspapers contained editorials on the topic each day and it was understood that one of the first efforts of the league would be directed towards getting the necessary sanction of the legislature in this direction to help to enlighten the public on what such government meant professor proaser of the university he was one of the three already referred to gave a public lecture on the growth of council government he traced it from the amphictionic council of greece as far down as the oligarchical council of venice it was thought that had the evening been longer he would have traced it clean down to modern times  but most amazing of all was the announcement that was presently made and endorsed by mr lucullus fyshe in an interview that mayor mcgrath himself would favour clean government and would become the official nominee of the league itself this certainly was strange but it would perhaps have been less mystifying to the public at large had they been able to listen to certain of the intimate conversations of mr fyshe and mr boulder  you say then said mr boulder to let mcgraths name stand  we cant do without him said mr fyshe he has seven of the wards in the hollow of his hand if we take his offer he absolutely pledges us every one of them  can you rely on his word said mr boulder  i think he means to play fair with us answered mr fyshe i put it to him as a matter of honour between man and man a week ago since then i have had him carefully dictaphoned and im convinced hes playing straight  how far will he go with us said mr boulder  he is willing to throw overboard gorfinkel schwefeldampf and undercutt he says he must find a place for ohooligan the irish he says dont care for clean government they want irish government  i see said mr boulder very thoughtfully and in regard to the renewal of the franchise and the expropriation tell me just exactly what his conditions are  but mr fyshes answer to this was said so discreetly and in such a low voice that not even the birds listening in the elm trees outside the mausoleum club could hear it  no wonder then that if even the birds failed to know everything about the clean government league there were many things which such good people as mr newberry and mr peter spillikins never heard at all and never guessed                            each week and every day brought fresh triumphs to the onward march of the movement  yes gentlemen said mr fyshe to the assembled committee of the clean government league a few days later i am glad to be able to report our first victory mr boulder and i have visited the state capital and we are able to tell you definitely that the legislature will consent to change our form of government so as to replace our council by a board  hear hear cried all the committee men together  we saw the governor said mr fyshe indeed he was good enough to lunch with us at the pocahontas club he tells us that what we are doing is being done in every city and town of the state he says that the days of the oldfashioned city council are numbered they are setting up boards everywhere  excellent said mr newberry  the governor assures us that what we want will be done the chairman of the democratic state committee he was good enough to dine with us at the buchanan club has given us the same assurance so also does the chairman of the republican state committee who was kind enough to be our guest in a box at the lincoln theatre it is most gratifying concluded mr fyshe to feel that the legislature will give us such a hearty such a thoroughly american support  you are sure of this are you questioned mr newberry you have actually seen the members of the legislature  it was not necessary said mr fyshe the governor and the different chairmen have them so well fixedthat is to say they have such confidence in the governor and their political organizers that they will all be prepared to give us what i have described as thoroughly american support  you are quite sure persisted mr newberry about the governor and the others you mentioned  mr fyshe paused a moment and then he said very quietly we are quite sure and he exchanged a look with mr boulder that meant volumes to those who would read it                            i hope you didnt mind my questioning you in that fashion said mr newberry as he and mr fyshe strolled home from the club the truth is i didnt feel sure in my own mind just what was meant by a board and getting them to give us government by a board i know im speaking like an ignoramus ive really not paid as much attention in the past to civic politics as i ought to have but what is the difference between a council and a board  the difference between a council and a board repeated mr fyshe  yes said mr newberry the difference between a council and a board  or call it said mr fyshe reflectively the difference between a board and a council  precisely said mr newberry  its not altogether easy to explain said mr fyshe one chief difference is that in the case of a board sometimes called a commission the salary is higher you see the salary of an alderman or councillor in most cities is generally not more than fifteen hundred or two thousand dollars the salary of a member of a board or commission is at least ten thousand that gives you at once a very different class of men as long as you only pay fifteen hundred you get your council filled up with men who will do any kind of crooked work for fifteen hundred dollars as soon as you pay ten thousand you get men with larger ideas  i see said mr newberry  if you have a fifteen hundred dollar man mr fyshe went on you can bribe him at any time with a fiftydollar bill on the other hand your tenthousanddollar man has a wider outlook if you offer him fifty dollars for his vote on the board hed probably laugh at you  ah yes said mr newberry i see the idea a fifteenhundreddollar salary is so low that it will tempt a lot of men into office merely for what they can get out of it  thats it exactly answered mr fyshe                            from all sides support came to the new league the women of the citythere were fifty thousand of them on the municipal voters listwere not behind the men though not officials of the league they rallied to its cause  mr fyshe said mrs buncomhearst who called at the office of the president of the league with offers of support tell me what we can do i represent fifty thousand women voters of this city  this was a favourite phrase of mrs buncomhearsts though it had never been made quite clear how or why she represented them  we want to help we women you know weve any amount of initiative if youll only tell us what to do you know mr fyshe weve just as good executive ability as you men if youll just tell us what to do couldnt we hold a meeting of our own all our own to help the league along  an excellent idea said mr fyshe  and could you not get three or four men to come and address it so as to stir us up asked mrs buncomhearst anxiously  oh certainly said mr fyshe  so it was known after this that the women were working side by side with the men the tea rooms of the grand palaver and the other hotels were filled with them every day busy for the cause one of them even invented a perfectly charming election scarf to be worn as a sort of badge to show ones allegiance and its great merit was that it was so fashioned that it would go with anything  yes said mr fyshe to his committee one of the finest signs of our movement is that the women of the city are with us whatever we may think gentlemen of the question of womans rights in generaland i think we know what we do thinkthere is no doubt that the influence of women makes for purity in civic politics i am glad to inform the committee that mrs buncomhearst and her friends have organized all the working women of the city who have votes they tell me that they have been able to do this at a cost as low as five dollars per woman some of the womenforeigners of the lower classes whose sense of political morality is as yet imperfectly developedhave been organized at a cost as low as one dollar per vote but of course with our native american women with a higher standard of education and morality we can hardly expect to do it as low as that                            nor were the women the only element of support added to the league  gentlemen reported dr boomer the president of the university at the next committee meeting i am glad to say that the spirit which animates us has spread to the students of the university they have organized entirely by themselves and on their own account a students fair play league which has commenced its activities i understand that they have already ducked alderman gorfinkel in a pond near the university i believe they are looking for alderman schwefeldampf tonight i understand they propose to throw him into the reservoir the leaders of thema splendid set of young fellowshave given me a pledge that they will do nothing to bring discredit on the university  i think i heard them on the street last night said mr newberry  i believe they had a procession said the president  yes i heard them they were shouting rah rah rah clean government clean government rah rah it was really inspiring to hear them  yes said the president they are banded together to put down all the hoodlumism and disturbance on the street that has hitherto disgraced our municipal elections last night as a demonstration they upset two streetcars and a milk wagon  i heard that two of them were arrested said mr dick overend  only by an error said the president there was a mistake it was not known that they were students the two who were arrested were smashing the windows of the car after it was upset with their hockey sticks a squad of police mistook them for rioters as soon as they were taken to the police station the mistake was cleared up at once the chiefofpolice telephoned an apology to the university i believe the league is out again tonight looking for alderman schwefeldampf but the leaders assure me there will be no breach of the peace whatever as i say i think their idea is to throw him into the reservoir  in the face of such efforts as these opposition itself melted rapidly away the plutorian times was soon able to announce that various undesirable candidates were abandoning the field alderman gorfinkel it said who it will be recalled was thrown into a pond last week by the students of the college was still confined to his bed when interviewed by our representative mr gorfinkel stated that he should not offer himself as a candidate in the approaching election he was he said weary of civic honours he had had enough he felt it incumbent on him to step out and make way for others who deserved their turn as well as himself in future he proposed to confine his whole attention to his misfit semiready establishment which he was happy to state was offering as nobby a line of early fall suiting as was ever seen at the price                            there is no need to recount here in detail the glorious triumph of the election day itself it will always be remembered as the purest cleanest election ever held in the precincts of the city the citizens organization turned out in overwhelming force to guarantee that it should be so bands of dr boomers students armed with baseball bats surrounded the polls to guarantee fair play any man wishing to cast an unclean vote was driven from the booth all those attempting to introduce any element of brute force or rowdyism into the election were cracked over the head in the lower part of the town scores of willing workers recruited often from the humblest classes kept order with pickaxes in every part of the city motor cars supplied by all the leading businessmen lawyers and doctors of the city acted as patrols to see that no unfair use should be made of other vehicles in carrying voters to the polls  it was a foregone victory from the firstoverwhelming and complete the cohorts of darkness were so completely routed that it was practically impossible to find them as it fell dusk the streets were filled with roaring and surging crowds celebrating the great victory for clean government while in front of every newspaper office huge lantern pictures of mayor mcgrath the champion of pure government and o skinyer the peoples solicitor and the other nominees of the league called forth cheer after cheer of frenzied enthusiasm                            they held that night in celebration a great reception at the mausoleum club on plutoria avenue given at its own suggestion by the city the city indeed insisted on it  nor was there ever witnessed even in that home of art and refinement a scene of greater charm in the spacious corridor of the club a hungarian band wafted viennese music from tyrolese flutes through the rubber trees there was champagne bubbling at a score of sideboards where noiseless waiters poured it into goblets as broad and flat as floating waterlily leaves and through it all moved the shepherds and shepherdesses of that beautiful arcadiathe shepherds in their tuxedo jackets with vast white shirtfronts broad as the map of africa with spotless white waistcoats girdling their equators wearing heavy gold watchchains and little patent shoes blacker than sin itselfand the shepherdesses in foaming billows of silks of every colour of the kaleidoscope their hair bound with glittering headbands or coiled with white feathers the very symbol of municipal purity one would search in vain the pages of pastoral literature to find the equal of it  and as they talked the good news spread from group to group that it was already known that the new franchise of the citizens light was to be made for two centuries so as to give the company a fair chance to see what it could do at the word of it the grave faces of manly bondholders flushed with pride and the soft eyes of listening shareholders laughed back in joy for they had no doubt or fear now that clean government had come they knew what the company could do  thus all night long outside of the club the soft note of the motor horns arriving and departing wakened the sleeping leaves of the elm trees with their message of good tidings and all night long within its lighted corridors the bubbling champagne whispered to the listening rubber trees of the new salvation of the city so the night waxed and waned till the slow day broke dimming with its cheap prosaic glare the shaded beauty of the artificial light and the people of the citythe best of themdrove home to their wellearned sleep and the othersin the lower parts of the cityrose to their daily toil    end
