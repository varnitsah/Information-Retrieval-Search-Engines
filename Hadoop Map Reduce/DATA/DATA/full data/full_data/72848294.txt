 ciceros life for the next two years was made conspicuous by a series of speeches which were produced by his exile and his return these are remarkable for the praise lavished on himself and by the violence with which he attacked his enemies it must be owned that never was abuse more abusive or selfpraise uttered in language more laudatory1 cicero had now done all that was useful in his public life the great monuments of his literature are to come none of these had as yet been written except a small portion of his lettersabout a tenthand of these he thought no more in regard to the public than do any ordinary letterwriters of today some poems had been produced and a history of his own consulship in greek but these are unknown to us he had already become the greatest orator perhaps of all timeand we have many of the speeches spoken by him some we havethose five namely telling the story of verresnot intended to be spoken but written for the occasion of the day rather than with a view to permanent literature he had been quæstor Ædile prætor and consul with singular and undeviating success he had been honest in the exercise of public functions when to be honest was to be singular he had bought golden opinions from all sorts of people he had been true to his country and useful alsoa combination which it was given to no other public man of those days to achieve having been prætor and consul he had refused the accustomed rewards and had abstained from the provinces his speeches with but few exceptions had hitherto been made in favor of honesty they are declamations against injustice against bribery against cruelty and all on behalf of decent civilized life had he died then he would not have become the hero of literature the marvel among men of letters whom the reading world admires but he would have been a great man and would have saved himself from the bitterness of cæsarean tongues  his public work was in truth done his further service consisted of the government of cilicia for a yearan employment that was odious to him though his performance of it was a blessing to the province after that there came the vain struggle with cæsar the attempt to make the best of cæsar victorious the last loud shriek on behalf of the republic and then all was over the fourteen years of life which yet remained to him sufficed for erecting that literary monument of which i have spoken but his public usefulness was done to the reader of his biography it will seem that these coming fourteen years will lack much of the grace which adorned the last twenty the biographer will be driven to make excuses which he will not do without believing in the truth of them but doubting much whether he may beget belief in others he thinks that he can see the man passing from one form to anotherhis doubting devotion to pompey his enforced adherence to cæsar his passionate opposition to antony but he can still see him true to his country and ever on the alert against tyranny and on behalf of pure patriotism  at the present we have to deal with cicero in no vacillating spirit but loudly exultant and loudly censorious within the two years following his return he made a series of speeches in all of which we find the altered tone of his mind there is no longer that belief in the ultimate success of justice and ultimate triumph of the republic which glowed in his verrine and catiline orations he is forced to descend in his aspirations it is not whether rome shall be free or the bench of justice pure but whether cicero shall be avenged and gabinius punished it may have been rightit was rightthat cicero should be avenged and gabinius punished but it must be admitted that the subjects are less alluring  his first oration as generally received was made to the senate in honor of his return the second was addressed to the people on the same subject the third was spoken to the college of priests with the view of recovering the ground on which his house had stood and which clodius had attempted to alienate forever by dedicating it to a pretended religious purpose the next as coming on our list though not so in time was addressed again to the senate concerning official reports made by the public soothsayers as interpreters of occult signs as to whether certain portents had been sent by the gods to show that cicero ought not to have back his house before this was made he had defended sextius who as tribune had been peculiarly serviceable in assisting his return this was before a bench of judges and separated from this though made apparently at the same time is a violent attack upon vatinius one of cæsars creatures who was a witness against sextius then there is a seventh regarding the disposition of the provinces among the proprætors and proconsuls the object of which was to enforce the recall of piso from macedonia and gabinius from syria and to win cæsars favor by showing that cæsar should be allowed to keep the two gauls and illyricum to these must be added two others made within the same period for cælius and balbus the close friendship between cicero and the young man cælius was one of the singular details of the orators life balbus was a spaniard attached to cæsar and remarkable as having been the first man not an italian who achieved the honor of the consulship  it has been disputed whether the first four of these orations were really the work of cicero certain german critics and english scholars having declared them to be parum ciceroniastoo little like cicero that is the phrase used by nobbe who published a valuable edition of all ciceros works after the text of ernesti in a single volume mr long in his introduction to these orations denounces them in language so strong as to rob them of all chance of absolute acceptance from those who know the accuracy of mr longs scholarship2 there may probably have been subsequent interpolations the first of the four however is so closely referred to by cicero himself in the speech made by him two years subsequently in the defence of plancius that the fact of an address to the senate in the praise of those who had assisted him in his return cannot be doubted and we are expressly told by the orator that because of the importance of the occasion he had written it out before he spoke it3 as to the latinity it is not within my scope nor indeed within my power to express a confident opinion but as to the matter of the speech i think that cicero in his then frame of mind might have uttered what is attributed to him having said so much i shall best continue my narrative by dealing with the four speeches as though they were genuine  sidenote bc 57 ætat 50  cicero landed at brundisium on the 5th of august the day on which his recall from exile had been enacted by the people and there met his daughter tullia who had come to welcome him back to italy on that her birthday but she had come as a widow having just lost her first husband piso frugi at this time she was not more than nineteen years old of tullias feelings we know nothing from her own expressions as they have not reached us but from the warmth of her fathers love for her and by the closeness of their friendship we are led to imagine that the joy of her life depended more on him than on any of her three husbands she did not live long with either of them and died soon after the birth of a child having been divorced from the third i take it there was much of triumph in the meeting though piso frugi had died so lately  the return of cicero to rome was altogether triumphant it must be remembered that the contemporary accounts we have had of it are altogether from his own pen they are taken chiefly from the orations i have named above though subsequent allusions to the glory of his return to rome are not uncommon in his works but had his boasting not been true the contradictions to them would have been made in such a way as to have reached our ears plutarch indeed declares that ciceros account of the glory of his return fell short of the truth  it may be taken for granted that with that feeble monster the citizen populace of rome cicero had again risen to a popularity equal to that which had been bestowed upon him when he had just driven catiline out of rome of what nature were the crowds who were thus loud in the praise of their great consul and as loud afterward in their rejoicings at the return of the great exile we must form our own opinion from circumstantial evidence there was a mass of people with keen ears taking artistic delight in eloquence and in personal graces but determined to be idle and to be fed as well as amused in their idleness and there were also vast bands of men ready to fightbands of gladiators they have been called though it is probable that but few of them had ever been trained to the arenawhose business it was to shout as well as to fight on behalf of their patrons we shall not be justified in supposing that those who on the two occasions named gave their sweet voices for cicero were only the wellordered though idle proportion of the people whereas they who had voted against him in favor of clodius had all been assassins bullies and swordsmen we shall probably be nearer the mark if we imagine that the citizens generally were actuated by the prevailing feelings of their leaders at the moment but were carried into enthusiasm when enabled without detriment to their interests to express their feelings for one who was in truth popular with them when cicero after the death of the five conspirators declared that the men had livedvixerunthis own power was sufficient to insure the people that they would be safe in praising him when he came back to rome pompey had been urgent for his return and cæsar had acceded to it when the bill was passed for banishing him the triumvirate had been against him and clodius had been able to hound on his crew but milo also had a crew and milo was ciceros friend as the clodian crew helped to drive cicero from rome so did milos crew help to bring him back again  cicero on reaching rome went at once to the capitol to the temple of jupiter and there returned thanks for the great thing that had been done for him he was accompanied by a vast procession who from the temple went with him to his brothers house where he met his wife and where he resided for a time his own house in the close neighborhood had been destroyed he reached rome on the 4th of september and on the 5th an opportunity was given to the then hero of the day for expressing his thanks to the senate for what they had done for him his intellect had not grown rusty in macedonia though he had been idle on the 5th cicero spoke to the senate on the 6th to the people before the end of the month he made a much longer speech to the priests in defence of his own property out of the full heart the mouth speaks and his heart was very full of the subject  his first object was to thank the senate and the leading members of it for their goodness to him the glowing language in which this is done goes against the grain with us when we read continuously the events of his life as told by himself his last grievous words had been expressions of despair addressed to atticus now he breaks out into a pæan of triumph we have to remember that eight months had intervened and that the time had sufficed to turn darkness into light if i cannot thank you as i ought o conscript fathers for the undying favors which you have conferred on me on my brother and my children ascribe it i beseech you to the greatness of the things you have done for me and not to the defect of my virtue then he praises the two consuls naming them lentulus and metellusmetellus as the reader will remember having till lately been his enemy he lauds the prætors and the tribunes two of the latter members having opposed his return but he is loudest in praise of pompeythat sampsiceramus that hierosolymarius that arabarches into whose character he had seen so clearly when writing from macedonia to atticusthat cn pompey who by his valor his glory his achievements stands conspicuously the first of all nations of all ages of all history we cannot but be angry when we read the words though we may understand how well he understood that he was impotent to do anything for the republic unless he could bring such a man as pompey to act with him we must remember too how impossible it was that one roman should rise above the falsehood common to romans we cannot ourselves always escape even yet from the atmosphere of duplicity in which policy delights he describes the state of rome in his absence when i was gone youyou the senatecould decree nothing for your citizens or for your allies or for the dependent kings the judges could give no judgment the people could not record their votes the senate availed nothing by its authority you saw only a silent forum a speechless senatehouse a city dumb and deserted we may suppose that rome was what cicero described it to be when he was in exile and cæsar had gone to his provinces but its condition had been the result of the crushing tyranny of the triumvirate rather than of ciceros absence  lentulus the present consul had been he says a second father almost a god to him but he would not have needed the hand of a consul to raise him from the ground had he not been wounded by consular hands catulus one of romes best citizens had told him that though rome had now and again suffered from a bad consul she had never before been afflicted by two together while there was one consul worthy of the name catulus had declared that cicero would be safe but there had come two two together whose spirits had been so narrow so low so depraved so burdened with greed and ignorance that they had been unable to comprehend much less to sustain the splendor of the name of consul not consuls were they but buyers and sellers of provinces these were piso and gabinius of whom the former was now governor of macedonia and the latter of syria ciceros scorn against these men who as consuls had permitted his exile became a passion with him his subsequent hatred of antony was not as bitter he had come there to thank the assembled senators for their care of him but he is carried off so violently by his anger that he devotes a considerable portion of his speech to these indignant utterances the reader does not regret it abuse makes better reading than praise has a stronger vitality and seems alas to come more thoroughly from the heart those who think that genuine invective has its charms would ill spare piso and gabinius  he goes back to his eulogy and names various prætors and officers who have worked on his behalf then he declares that by the view of the present consul lentulus a decree has been passed in his favor more glorious than has been awarded to any other single roman citizennamely that from all italy those who wished well to their country should be collected together for the purpose of bringing him back from his banishmenthim cicero there is much in this in praise of lentulus but more in praise of cicero throughout these orations we feel that cicero is put forward as the hero whereas piso and gabinius are the demons of the piece what could i leave as a richer legacy to my posterity he goes on to say opening another clause of his speech than that the senate should have decreed that the citizen who had not come forward in my defence was one regardless of the republic by these boastings though he was at the moment at the top of the ladder of popularity he was offending the selfimportance of all around him he was offending especially pompey with whom it was his fate to have to act4 but that was little to the offence he was giving to those who were to come many centuries after him who would not look into the matter with sufficient accuracy to find that his vanity deserved forgiveness because of his humanity and desire for progress o lentulus he says at the end of the oration since i am restored to the republic as with me the republic is itself restored i will slacken nothing in my efforts at liberty but if it may be possible will add something to my energy in translating a word here and there as i have done i feel at every expression my incapacity there is no such thing as good translation if you wish to drink the water with its life and vigor in it you must go to the fountain and drink it there  on the day following he made a similar speech to the peopleif indeed the speech we have was from his mouth or his penas to which it has been remarked that in it he made no allusion to clodius though he was as bitter as ever against the late consuls from this we may gather that though his audience was delighted to hear him even in his selfpraise there might have been dispute had he spoken ill of one who had been popular as tribune his praise of pompey was almost more fulsome than that of the day before and the same may be said of his selfglorification of his brothers devotion to him he speaks in touching words but in words which make us remember how untrue to him afterward was that very brother there are phrases so magnificent throughout this short piece that they obtain from us as they are read forgiveness for the writers faults sic ulciscar facinorum singula let the reader of latin turn to chapter ix of the oration and see how the speaker declares that he will avenge himself against the evildoers whom he has denounced  cicero though he had returned triumphant had come back ruined in purse except so far as he could depend on the senate and the people for reimbursing to him the losses to which he had been subjected the decree of the senate had declared that his goods should be returned to him but the validity of such a promise would depend on the value which might be put upon the goods in question his house on the palatine hill had been razed to the ground his tusculan and formian villas had been destroyed his books his pictures his marble columns his very trees had been stolen but worst of all an attempt had been made to deprive him forever of the choicest spot of ground in all the city the park lane of rome by devoting the space which had belonged to him to the service of one of the gods clodius had caused something of a temple to liberty to be built there because ground so consecrated was deemed at rome as with us to be devoted by consecration to the perpetual service of religion it was with the view of contesting this point that cicero made his next speech pro domo sua for the recovery of his house before the bench of priests in rome it was for the priests to decide this question the senate could decree the restitution of property generally but it was necessary that that spot of ground should be liberated from the thraldom of sacerdotal tenure by sacerdotal interference these priests were all men of high birth and distinction in the republic nineteen among them were consulares or pastconsuls superstitious awe affects more lightly the consciences of priests than the hearts of those who trust the priests for their guidance familiarity does breed contempt cicero in making this speech probably felt that if he could carry the people with him the college of priests would not hold the prey with grasping hands the nineteen consulares would care little for the sanctity of the ground if they could be brought to wish well to cicero he did his best he wrote to atticus concerning it a few days after the speech was made and declared that if he had ever spoken well on any occasion he had done so then so deep had been his grief and so great the importance of the occasion5 and he at once informs his friend of the decision of the bench and of the ground on which it was based if he who declares that he dedicated the ground had not been appointed to that business by the people nor had been expressly commanded by the people to do it then that spot of ground can be restored without any breach of religion cicero asserts that he was at once congratulated on having gained his cause the world knowing very well that no such authority had been conferred on clodius in the present mood of rome all the priests with the nineteen consulares were no doubt willing that cicero should have back his ground the senate had to interpret the decision and on the discussion of the question among them clodius endeavored to talk against time when however he had spoken for three hours he allowed himself to be coughed down it may be seen that in some respects even roman fortitude has been excelled in our days  in the first portion of this speech pro domo sua cicero devotes himself to a matter which has no bearing on his house concomitant with ciceros return there had come a famine in rome such a calamity was of frequent occurrence though i doubt whether their famines ever led to mortality so frightful as that which desolated ireland just before the repeal of the corn laws no records as far as i am aware have reached us of men perishing in the streets but scarcity was not uncommon and on such occasions complaints would become very loud the feeding of the people was a matter of great difficulty and subject to various chances we do not at all know what was the number to be fed including the free and the slaves but have been led by surmises to suppose that it was under a million even in the time of augustus but even though the number was no more than five hundred thousand at this time the procuring of food must have been a complicated and difficult matter it was not produced in the country it was imported chiefly from sicily and africa and was plentiful or the reverse not only in accordance with the seasons but as certain officers of state were diligent and honest or fraudulent and rapacious we know from one of the verrine orations the nature of the laws on the subject but cannot but marvel that even with the assistance of such laws the supply could be maintained with any fair proportion to the demand the people looked to the government for the supply and when it fell short would make their troubles known with seditious grumblings which would occasionally assume the guise of insurrection at this period of ciceros return food had become scarce and dear and clodius who was now in arms against pompey as well as against cicero caused it to be believed that the strangers flocking into rome to welcome cicero had eaten up the food which should have filled the bellies of the people an idea farther from truth could hardly have been entertained no chance influx of visitors on such a population could have had the supposed effect but the idea was spread abroad and it was necessary that something should be done to quiet the minds of the populace pompey had hitherto been the resource in state difficulties pompey had scattered the pirates who seem however at this period to have been gathering head again pompey had conquered mithridates let pompey have a commission to find food for rome pompey himself entertained the idea of a commission which should for a time give him almost unlimited power cæsar was increasing his legions and becoming dominant in the west pompey who still thought himself the bigger man of the two felt the necessity of some great step in rivalry of cæsar the proposal made on his behalf was that all the treasure belonging to the state should be placed at his disposal that he should have an army and a fleet and should be for five years superior in authority to every proconsul in his own province this was the first great struggle made by pompey to strangle the growing power of cæsar it failed altogether6 the fear of cæsar had already become too great in the bosoms of roman senators to permit them to attempt to crush him in his absence but a mitigated law was passed enjoining pompey to provide the food required and conferring upon him certain powers cicero was nominated as his first lieutenant and accepted the position he never acted however giving it up to his brother quintus a speech which he made to the people on the passing of the law is not extant but as there was hot blood about it in rome he took the opportunity of justifying the appointment of pompey in the earlier portion of this oration to the priests it must be understood that he did not lend his aid toward giving those greater powers which pompey was anxious to obtain his trust in pompey had never been a perfect trust since the first days of the triumvirate to ciceros thinking both pompey and cæsar were conspirators against the republic cæsar was the bolder and therefore the more dangerous it might probably come to pass that the services of pompey would be needed for restraining cæsar pompey naturally belonged to the optimates while cæsar was as naturally a conspirator but there never again could come a time in which cicero would willingly intrust pompey with such power as was given to him nine years before by the lex manilia nevertheless he could still say grand things in praise of pompey to pompey have been intrusted wars without number wars most dangerous to the state wars by sea and wars by land wars extraordinary in their nature if there be a man who regrets that this has been done that man must regret the victories which rome has won but his abuse of clodius is infinitely stronger than his praise of pompey for the passages in which he alluded to the sister of clodius i must refer the reader to the speech itself it is impossible here to translate them or to describe them and these words were spoken before the college of priests of whom nineteen were consulares and they were prepared with such care that cicero specially boasted of them to atticus and declares that they should be put into the hands of all young orators montesquieu says that the roman legislators in establishing their religion had no view of using it for the improvement of manners or of morals7 the nature of their rites and ceremonies gives us evidence enough that it was so if further testimony were wanting it might be found in this address ad pontifices cicero himself was a man of singularly clean life as a roman nobleman but in abusing his enemy he was restrained by no sense of what we consider the decency of language  he argues the question as to his house very well as he did all questions he tells the priests that the whole joy of his restoration must depend on their decision citizens who had hitherto been made subject to such penalties had been malefactors whereas it was acknowledged of him that he had been a benefactor to the city clodius had set up on the spot not a statue of liberty but as was well known to all men the figure of a greek prostitute the priests had not been consulted the people had not ratified the proposed consecration of the necessity of such authority he gives various examples and this has been done he says by an impure and impious enemy of all religionsby this man among women and woman among menwho has gone through the ceremony so hurriedly so violently that his mind and his tongue and his voice have been equally inconsistent with each other my fortune he says as he ends his speech all moderate as it is will suffice for me the memory of my name will be a patrimony sufficient for my children but if his house be so taken from him so stolen so falsely dedicated to religion he cannot live without disgrace of course he got back his house and with his house about £16000 for its reerection and £4000 for the damage done to the tusculan villa with £2000 for the formian villa with these sums he was not contented and indeed they could hardly have represented fairly the immense injury done to him  sidenote bc 56 ætat 51  so ended the work of the year of his return from the following year besides the speeches we have twentysix letters of which nine were written to lentulus the late consul who had now gone to cilicia as proconsul lentulus had befriended him and he found it necessary to show his gratitude by a continued correspondence and by a close attendance to the interests of the absent officer these letters are full of details of roman politics too intricate for such a work as thisperhaps i might almost say too uninteresting as they refer specially to lentulus himself in one of them he tells his friend that he has at last been able to secure the friendship of pompey for him it was after all but a show of friendship he has supped with pompey and says that when he talks to pompey everything seems to go well no one can be more gracious than pompey but when he sees the friends by whom pompey is surrounded he knows as all others know that the affair is in truth going just as he would not have it8 we feel as we read these letters in which pompeys name is continually before us how much pompey prevailed by his personal appearance by his power of saying gracious things and then again by his power of holding his tongue you know the slowness of the man he says to lentulus and his silence9 a slow cautious hypocritical man who knew well how to use the allurements of personal manners these letters to lentulus are full of flattery  there are five letters to his brother quintus dealing with the politics of the time especially with the then king of egypt who was to be or was not to be restored from all these things however i endeavor to abstain as much as possible as matters not peculiarly affecting the character of cicero he gives his brother an account of the doings in the senate which is interesting as showing us how that august assembly conducted itself while pompey was speaking with much dignity clodius and his supporters in vain struggled with shouts and cries to put him down at noon pompey sat down and clodius got possession of the rostra and in the middle of a violent tumult remained on his feet for two hours then on pompeys side the optimates sang indecent songs versus obscenissimiin reference to clodius and his sister clodia clodius rising in his anger demanded who had brought the famine pompey shouted the clodians who wanted to go to egypt demanded clodius pompey again shouted his followers after that at three oclock at a given signal they began to spit upon their opponents then there was a fight in which each party tried to drive the others out the optimates were getting the best of it when cicero thought it as well to run off lest he should be hurt in the tumult10 what hope could there be for an oligarchy when such things occurred in the senate cicero in this letter speaks complacently of resisting force by force in the city even cato the lawabiding precise cato thought it necessary to fall into the fashion and go about rome with an armed following he bought a company of gladiators and circusmen but was obliged to sell them as cicero tells his brother with glee because he could not afford to feed them11  there are seven letters also to atticusalways more interesting than any of the others there is in these the most perfect goodfeeling so that we may know that the complaints made by him in his exile had had no effect of estranging his friend and we learn from them his real innermost thoughts as they are not given even to his brotheras thoughts have surely seldom been confided by one man of action to another atticus had complained that he had not been allowed to see a certain letter which cicero had written to cæsar this he had called a greek palinôdia or recantation and it had been addressed to cæsar with the view of professing a withdrawal to some extent of his opposition to the triumvirate it had been of sufficient moment to be talked about atticus had heard of it and had complained that it had not been sent to him cicero puts forward his excuses and then bursts out with the real truth  why should i nibble round the unpalatable morsel which has to be swallowed the recantation had seemed to himself to be almost base and he had been ashamed of it but says he farewell to all true upright honest policy you could hardly believe what treachery there is in those who ought to be our leading men and who would be so if there was any truth in them12 he does not rely upon those who if they were true to their party would enable the party to stand firmly even against cæsar therefore it becomes necessary for him to truckle to cæsar not for himself but for his party unsupported he cannot stand in open hostility to cæsar he truckles he writes to cæsar singing cæsars praises it is for the party rather than for himself but yet he is ashamed of it  there is a letter to lucceius an historian of the day then much thought of of whom however our later world has heard nothing lucceius is writing chronicles of the time and cicero boldly demands to be praised ut ornes mea postulem13i ask you to praise me but he becomes much bolder than that again and again i beseech you without any beating about the bush to speak more highly of me than you perhaps think that i deserve even though in doing so you abandon all the laws of history then he uses beautiful flattery to his correspondent alexander had wished to be painted only by apelles he desires to be praised by none but lucceius lucceius we are told did as he was asked  sidenote bc 56 ætat 51  i will return to the speeches of the period to which this chapter is devoted taking that first which he made to the senate as to the report of the soothsayers respecting certain prodigies readers familiar with livy will remember how frequently in time of disaster the anger of heaven was supposed to have been shown by signs and miracles indications that the gods were displeased and that expiations were necessary14 the superstition as is the fate of all superstitions had frequently been used for most ungodlike purposes if a man had a political enemy what could do him better service than to make the populace believe that a house had been crushed by a thunderbolt or that a woman had given birth to a pig instead of a child because jupiter had been offended by that enemys devices by using such a plea the grecians got into troy together with the wooden horse many years ago the scotch worshippers of the sabbath declared the other day when the bridge over the tay was blown away that the lord had interposed to prevent travelling on sunday  cicero had not been long back from his exile when the gods began to show their anger a statue of juno twisted itself half round a wolf had been seen in the city three citizens were struck with lightning arms were heard to clang and then wide subterranean noises nothing was easier than the preparation and continuing of such portents for many years past the heavens above and the earth beneath had been put into requisition for prodigies15 the soothsayers were always well pleased to declare that there had been some neglect of the gods it is in the nature of things that the superstitious tendencies of mankind shall fall a prey to priestcraft the quarrels between cicero and clodius were as full of life as ever in this year clodius being Ædile there had come on debates as to a law passed by cæsar as consul in opposition to bibulus for the distribution of lands among the citizens there was a question as to a certain tax which was to be levied on these lands the taxgatherers were supported by cicero and denounced by clodius then clodius and his friends found out that the gods were showering their anger down upon the city because the ground on which ciceros house had once stood was being desecrated by its reerection an appeal was made to the soothsayers they reported and cicero rejoined the soothsayers had of course been mysterious and doubtful cicero first shows that the devotion of his ground to sacred purposes had been an absurdity and then he declares that the gods are angry not with him but with clodius to say that the gods were not angry at all was more than cicero dared the piece taken as a morsel of declamatory art is full of vigor is powerful in invective and carries us along in full agreement with the orator but at the conclusion we are led to wish that cicero could have employed his intellect on higher matters  there are however one or two passages which draw the reader into deep mental inquiry as to the religious feelings of the time in one which might have been written by paley cicero declares his belief in the creative power of some godor gods as he calls them16 and we see also the perverse dealings of the romans with these gods dealings which were very troublesomenot to be got over except by stratagem the gods were made use of by one party and the other for dishonest state purposes when cicero tells his hearers what the gods intended to signify by making noises in the sky and other divine voices we feel sure that he was either hoaxing them who heard him or saying what he knew they would not believe  sidenote bc 56 ætat 51  previous to the speech as to the aruspices he had defended sextiusor sestius as he is frequently calledon a charge brought against him by clodius in respect of violence we at once think of the commonplace from juvenal    quis tulerit gracchos de seditione querentes  but rome without remonstrating put up with any absurdity of that kind sextius and milo and others had been joined together in opposing the election of clodius as Ædile and had probably met violence with violence as surely as an english master of hounds has grooms and whips ready at his command milo had a band of bullies prepared for violence clodius himself had brought an action against milo who was defended by pompey in person the case against sextius was intrusted to albinovanus and hortensius undertook the defence sextius before had been one of the most forward in obtaining the return of cicero and had travelled into gaul to see cæsar and to procure cæsars assent cæsar had not then assented but not the less great had been the favor conferred by sextius on cicero cicero had been grateful but it seems that sextius had thought not sufficiently grateful hence there had grown up something of a quarrel but cicero when he heard of the proceeding against his old friend at once offered his assistance for a roman to have more than one counsel to plead for him was as common as for an englishman cicero was therefore added to hortensius and the two great advocates of the day spoke on the same side we are told that hortensius managed the evidence showing probably that clodius struck the first blow cicero then addressed the judges with the object of gaining their favor for the accused in this he was successful and sextius was acquitted as regards sextius and his quarrel with clodius the oration has but little interest for us there is not indeed much about sextius in it it is a continuation of the pæan which cicero was still singing as to his own return but it is distinguished from his former utterances by finer thought and finer language the description of public virtue as displayed by cato has perhaps in regard to melody of words and grandeur of sentiment never been beaten i give the orators words below in his own language because in no other way can any idea of the sound be conveyed17 there is too a definition made very cleverly to suit his own point of view between the conservatives and the liberals of the day optimates is the name by which the former are known the latter are called populares18  attached to this speech for sextius is a declamation against vatinius who was one of the witnesses employed by the prosecutor instead of examining this witness regularly he talked him down by a separate oration we have no other instance of such a forensic manoeuvre either in ciceros practice or in our accounts of the doings of other roman advocates this has reached us as a separate oration it is a coarse tirade of abuse against a man whom we believe to have been bad but as to whom we feel that we are not justified in supposing that we can get his true character here he was a creature of cæsars and cicero was able to say words as to vatinius which he was unwilling to speak as to cæsar and his doings it must be added here that two years later cicero pleaded for this very vatinius at the joint request of cæsar and pompey when vatinius on leaving the prætorship was accused of corruption  sidenote bc 56 ætat 51  the nature of the reward to which the aspiring oligarch of rome always turned his eyes has been sufficiently explained he looked to be the governor of a province at this period of which we are speaking there was no reticence in the matter syria or macedonia or hispania had been the prize or sicily or sardinia it was quite understood that an aspiring oligarch went through the dust and danger and expense of political life in order that at last he might fill his coffers with provincial plunder there were various laws as to which these governments were allotted to the plunderers of these we need only allude to the leges semproniæ or laws proposed bc 123 by caius sempronius gracchus for the distribution of those provinces which were to be enjoyed by proconsuls there were prætorian provinces and consular provinces though there was no law making it sure that any province should be either consular or prætorian but the senate without the interference of the people and free from the tribunes veto had the selection of provinces for the consuls whereas for those intended for the prætors the people had the right of voting and the tribunes of the people had a right of putting a veto on the propositions made now in this year there came before the senate a discussion as to the fate of three proconsulsnot as to the primary allocation of provinces to them but on the question whether they should be continued in the government which they held piso was in macedonia where he was supposed to have disgraced himself and the empire which he served gabinius was in syria where it was acknowledged that he had done good service though his own personal character stood very low cæsar was lord in the two gaulsthat is on both sides of the alps in northern italy and in that portion of modern france along the mediterranean which had been already colonizedand was also governor of illyricum he had already made it manifest to all men that the subjugation of a new empire was his object rather than provincial plunder whether we love the memory of cæsar as of a great man who showed himself fit to rule the world or turn away from him as from one who set his iron heel on the necks of men and by doing so retarded for centuries the liberties of mankind we have to admit that he rose by the light of his own genius altogether above the ambition of his contemporaries if we prefer as i do the humanity of cicero we must confess to ourselves the supremacy of cæsar and acknowledge ourselves to belong to the beaten cause victrix causa deis placuit sed victa catoni in discussing the fate of these proconsular officials we feel now the absurdity of mixing together in the same debate the name of piso and gabinius with that of cæsar yet such was the subject in dispute when cicero made his speech de provinciis consularibus as to the adjudication of the consular provinces  there was a strong opinion among many senators that cæsar should be stopped in his career i need not here investigate the motives either great or little on which this opinion was founded there was hardly a senator among them who would not have wished cæsar to be put down though there were many who did not dare declare their wishes there were reasons for peculiar jealousy on the part of the senate cisalpine gaul had been voted for him by the intervention of the people and especially by that of the tribune vatiniusto cæsar who was consularis whose reward should have been an affair solely for the senate then there had arisen a demand a most unusual demand for the other gaul also the giving of two provinces to one governor was altogether contrary to the practice of the state but so was the permanent and acknowledged continuance of a conspiracy such as the triumvirate unusual cæsar himself was very unusual then the senate feeling that the second province would certainly be obtained and anxious to preserve some shred of their prerogative themselves voted the farther gaul as it must be done let it at any rate be said that they had done it but as they had sent cæsar over the alps so they could recall him or try to recall him therefore with the question as to piso and gabinius which really meant nothing came up this also as to cæsar which meant a great deal  but cæsar had already done great things in gaul he had defeated the helvetians and driven ariovistus out of the country he had carried eight legions among the distant belgæ and had conquered the nervii in this very year he had built a huge fleet and had destroyed the veneti a seafaring people on the coast of the present brittany the more powerful he showed himself to be the more difficult it was to recall him but also the more desirable in the eyes of many in the first portion of his speech cicero handles piso and gabinius with his usual invective there was no considerable party desirous of renewing to them their governments but cicero always revelled in the pleasure of abusing them he devotes by far the longer part of his oration to the merit of cæsar19 as for recalling him it would be irrational who had counted more enemies in rome than marius but did they recall marius when he was fighting for the republic20 hitherto the republic had been forced to fear the gauls rome had always been on the defence against them now it had been brought about by cæsar that the limits of the world were the limits of the roman empire21 the conquest was not yet finished but surely it should be left to him who had begun it so well even though cæsar were to demand to return himself thinking that he had done enough for his own glory it would be for the senators to restrain himfor the senate to bid him finish the work that he had in hand22 as for himself continued cicero if cæsar had been his enemy what of that cæsar was not his enemy now he had told the senate what offers of employment cæsar had made him if he could not forget yet he would forgive former injuries23  it is important for the reading of ciceros character that we should trace the meaning of his utterances about cæsar from this time up to the day on which cæsar was killedhis utterances in public and those which are found in his letters to atticus and his brother that there was much of pretenceof falsehood if a hard word be necessary to suit the severity of those who judge the man hardlyis admitted how he praised pompey in public dispraising him in private at one and the same moment has been declared how he applied for praise whether deserved or not has been shown in excuse not in defence of this i allege that the romans of the day were habitually false after this fashion the application to lucceius proves the habitual falseness not of cicero only but of lucceius also and the private words written to atticus in opposition to the public words with which atticus was well acquainted prove the falseness also of atticus it was roman it was italian it was cosmopolitan it was human i only wish that it were possible to declare that it is no longer italian no longer cosmopolitan no longer human to this day it is very difficult even for an honorable man to tell the whole truth in the varying circumstances of public life the establishment of even a theory of truth with all the advantages which have come to us from christianity has been so difficult hitherto so imperfect that we ought i think to consider well the circumstances before we stigmatize cicero as specially false to my reading he seems to have been specially true when cæsar won his way up to power cicero was courteous to him flattered him and though never subservient yet was anxious to comply when compliance was possible nevertheless we know well that the whole scheme of cæsars political life was opposed to the scheme entertained by cicero it was ciceros desire to maintain as much as he could of the old form of oligarchical rule under which as a constitution the roman empire had been created it was cæsars intention to sweep it all away we can see that now but cicero could only see it in part to his outlook the man had some sense of order and had all the elements of greatness he was better at any rate than a verres a catiline a clodius a piso or a gabinius if he thought that by flattery he could bring cæsar somewhat round there might be conceit in his so thinking but there could be no treachery in doing so he did not abandon his political beau ideal if better times came or a better man he would use them in the mean time he could do more by managing cæsar than by opposing him he was far enough from succeeding in the management of cæsar but he did do much in keeping his party together it was in this spirit that he advocated before the senate the maintenance of cæsars authority in the two gauls the senate decreed the withdrawal of piso and gabinius but decided to leave cæsar where he was mommsen deals very hardly with cicero as to this period of his life they used him accordingly aswhat he was good foran advocate cicero himself had to thank his literary reputation for the respectful treatment which he experienced from cæsar the question we have to ask ourselves is whether he did his best to forward that scheme of politics which he thought to be good for the republic to me it seems that he did do so he certainly did nothing with the object of filling his own pockets i doubt whether as much can be said with perfect truth as to any other roman of the period unless it be cato  balbus for whom cicero also spoke in this year was a spaniard of cadiz to whom pompey had given the citizenship of rome who had become one of cæsars servants and friends and whose citizenship was now disputed cicero pleaded in favor of the claim and gained his cause there were no doubt certain laws in accordance with which balbus was or was not a citizen but cicero here says that because balbus was a good man therefore there should be no question as to his citizenship24 this could hardly be a good legal argument but we are glad to have the main principles of roman citizenship laid down for us in this oration a man cannot belong to more than one state at a time a man cannot be turned out of his state against his will a man cannot be forced to remain in his state against his will25 this balbus was acknowledged as a roman rose to be one of cæsars leading ministers and was elected consul of the empire bc 40 thirtyfour years afterward his nephew became consul nearly three centuries after that ad 237 a descendant of balbus was chosen as emperor under the name of balbinus and is spoken of by gibbon with eulogy26  i know no work on cicero written more pleasantly or inspired by a higher spirit of justice than that of gaston boissier of the french academy called cicéron et ses amis among his chapters one is devoted to ciceros remarkable intimacy with cælius which should be read by all who wish to study cicero we have now come to the speech which he made in this year in defence of cælius cælius had entered public life very early as the son of a rich citizen who was anxious that his heir should be enabled to shine as well by his fathers wealth as by his own intellect when he was still a boy according to our ideas of boyhood he was apprenticed to cicero27 as was customary in order that he might pick up the crumbs which fell from the great mans table it was thus that a young man would hear what was best worth hearing thus he would become acquainted with those who were best worth knowing thus that he would learn in public life all that was best worth learning cælius heard all and knew many and learned much but he perhaps learned too much at too early an age he became bright and clever but unruly and dissipated cicero however loved him well he always liked the society of bright young men and could forgive their morals if their wit were good clodiuseven clodius young curio cælius and afterward dolabella were companions with whom he loved to associate when he was in cilicia as proconsul this cælius became almost a second atticus to him in the writing of news from rome  but cælius had become one of clodias many lovers and seems for a time to have been the first favorite to the detriment of poor catullus the rich father had it seems quarrelled with his son and cælius was in want of money he borrowed it from clodia and then without paying his debt treated clodia as she had treated catullus the lady tried to get her money back and when she failed she accused her former lover of an attempt to poison her this she did so that cælius was tried for the offence there were no less than four accusers or advocates on her behalf of whom her brother was one cælius was defended by crassus as well as by cicero and was acquitted all these cases combined political views with criminal charges cælius was declared to have been a catilinian conspirator he was also accused of being in debt of having quarrelled with his father of having insulted women of having beaten a senator of having practised bribery of having committed various murders and of having perpetrated all social and political excesses to which his enemies could give a name it was probable that his life had been very irregular but it was not probably true that he had attempted to poison clodia  the speech is very well worth the trouble of reading it is lively bright picturesque and argumentative and it tells the reader very much of the manners of rome at the time it has been condemned for a passage which to my taste is the best in the whole piece cicero takes upon himself to palliate the pleasures of youth and we are told that a man so grave so pure so excellent in his own life should not have condescended to utter sentiments so lax in defence of so immoral a young friend i will endeavor to translate a portion of the passage and i think that any ladies who may read these pages will agree with me in liking cicero the better for what he said upon the occasion he has been speaking of the changes which the manners of the world had undergone not only in rome but in greece since pleasure had been acknowledged even by philosophers to be necessary to life they who advocate one constant course of continual labor as the road to fame are left alone in their schools deserted by their scholars nature herself has begotten for us allurements seduced by which virtue herself will occasionally become drowsy nature herself leads the young into slippery paths in which not to stumble now and again is hardly possible nature has produced for us a variety of pleasures to which not only youth but even middleage occasionally yields itself if therefore you shall find one who can avert his eyes from all that is beautifulwho is charmed by no sweet smell by no soft touch by no rich flavorwho can turn a deaf ear to coaxing wordsi indeed and perhaps a few others may think that the gods have been good to such a one but i doubt whether the world at large will not think that the gods have made him a sorry fellow there is very much more of it delightfully said and in the same spirit but i have given enough to show the nature of the excuse for cælius which has brought down on cicero the wrath of the moralists     chapter ii  cicero Ætat 52 53 54   sidenote bc 55 ætat 52  i can best continue my record of ciceros life for this and the two subsequent years by following his speeches and his letters it was at this period the main object of his political life to reconcile the existence of a cæsar with that of a republictwo poles which could not by any means be brought together outside of his political life he carried on his profession as an advocate with all his former energy with all his former bitterness with all his old friendly zeal but never i think with his former utility his life with his friends and his family was prosperous but that ambition to do some great thing for his country which might make his name more famous than that of other romans was gradually fading and as it went was leaving regrets and remorse behind which would not allow him to be a happy man but it was now when he had reached his fiftysecond year that he in truth began that career in literature which has made him second to no roman in reputation there are some early rhetorical essays which were taken from the greek of doubtful authenticity there are the few lines which are preserved of his poetry there are the speeches which he wrote as well as spoke for the rome of the day and there are his letters which up to this time had been intended only for his correspondents all that we have from his pen up to this time has been preserved for us by the light of those great works which he now commenced in this year bc 55 there appeared the dialogue de oratore and in the next the treatise de republica it was his failure as a politician which in truth drove cicero to the career of literature as i intend to add to this second volume a few chapters as to his literary productions i will only mention the dates on which these dialogues and treatises were given to the world as i go on with my work  in the year bc 55 the two of the triumvirate who had been left in rome pompey and crassus were elected consuls and provinces were decreed to each of them for five yearsto pompey the two spains and to crassus that syria which was to be so fatal to him all this had been arranged at lucca in the north of italy whither cæsar was able to come as being within the bounds of his province to meet his friends from romeor his enemies all aristocratic rome went out in crowds to lucca so that two hundred senators might be seen together in the streets of that provincial town it was nevertheless near enough to rome to permit the conqueror from gaul to look closely into the politics of the city by his permission if not at his instigation pompey and crassus had been chosen consuls and to himself was conceded the government of his own province for five further yearsthat is down to year bc 49 inclusive it must now at least have become evident to cicero that cæsar intended to rule the empire  though we already have ciceros letters arranged for us in a chronological sequence which may be held to be fairly correct for biographical purposes still there is much doubt remaining as to the exact periods at which many of them were written abeken the german biographer says that this year bc 55 produced twelve letters in the french edition of ciceros works published by panckoucke thirtyfive are allotted to it mr watson in his selected letters has not taken one from the year in question mr tyrrell who has been my mentor hitherto in regard to the correspondence has not unfortunately published the result of his labors beyond the year 53 bc at the time of my present writing some of those who have dealt with ciceros life and works and have illustrated them by his letters have added something to the existing confusion by assuming an accuracy of knowledge in this respect which has not existed we have no right to quarrel with them for having done so certainly not with middleton as in his time such accuracy was less valued by readers than it is now and we have the advantage of much light which though still imperfect is very bright in comparison with that enjoyed by him a study of the letters however in the sequence now given to them affords an accurate picture of ciceros mind during the years between the period of his return from exile bc 57 and milos trial bc 52 although the reader may occasionally be misled as to the date of this or the other letter  with the dates of his speeches at any rate with the year in which they were made we are better acquainted they are of course much fewer in number and are easily traced by the known historical circumstances of the time bc 55 he made that attack upon his old enemy the late consul piso which is perhaps the most egregious piece of abuse extant in any language even of this we do not know the precise date but we may be sure that it was spoken early in the year because cicero alludes in it to pompeys great games which were in preparation and which were exhibited when pompeys new theatre was opened in may28 plutarch tells us that they did not take place till the beginning of the following year29 piso on his return from macedonia attacked cicero in the senate in answer to all the hard things that had already been said of him and cicero as middleton says made a reply to him on the spot in an invective speech the severest perhaps that ever was spoken by any man on the person the parts the whole life and conduct of piso which as long as the roman name subsists must deliver down a most detestable character of him to all posterity  we are here asked to imagine that this attack was delivered on the spur of the moment in answer to pisos attack i cannot believe that it should have been so however great may have been the orators power over thoughts and words we have had in our own days wonderful instances of ready and indignant reply made instantaneously but none in which the angry eloquence has risen to such a power as is here displayed we cannot but suppose that had human intellect ever been perfect enough for such an exertion it would have soared high enough also to have abstained from it it may have been that cicero knew well enough beforehand what the day was about to produce so as to have prepared his reply it may well have been that he himself undertook the polishing of his speech before it was given to the public in the words which we now read we may i think take it for granted that piso did make an attack upon him and that cicero answered him at once with words which crushed him and which are not unfairly represented by those which have come down to us  the imaginative reader will lose himself in wonder as he pictures to himself the figure of the pretentious proconsul with his assumption of confidence as he was undergoing the castigation which this great master of obloquy was inflicting upon him and the figure of the tall lean orator with his long neck and keen eyes with his arms trained to assist his voice managing his purple bordered toga with a perfect grace throwing all his heart into his impassioned words as they fell into the ears of the senators around him without the loss of a syllable this lucius calpurnius piso cæsoronius had come from one of the highest families in rome and had possessed interest enough to be elected consul for the year in which cicero was sent into banishment30 he was closely connected with that piso frugi to whom ciceros daughter had been married and cicero when he was threatened by the faction of clodiusa faction which he did not then believe to be supported by the triumviratehad thought that he was made safe at any rate from cruel results by consular friendship and consular protection piso cæsoronius had failed him altogether saying in answer to ciceros appeal that the times were of such a nature that every one must look to himself the nature of ciceros rage may be easily conceived an attempt to describe it has already been made it was not till after his consulate that he was ever waked to real anger and the one object whom he most entirely hated with his whole soul was lucius piso  by the strength of ciceros eloquence this man has occupied an immortality of meanness we cannot but believe that he must have in some sort deserved it or the justice of the world would have vindicated his character it should however be told of him that three years afterward he was chosen censor together with appius claudius but it must also be told that as far as we can judge both these men were unworthy of the honor they were the last two censors elected in rome before the days of the empire it is impossible not to believe that piso was vile but impossible also to believe that he was as vile as cicero represented him cæsar was at this time his soninlaw as he was father to calphurnia with whom shakspeare has made us familiar i do not know that cæsar took in bad part the hard things that were said of his fatherinlaw  the first part of the speech is lost the first words we know because they have been quoted by quintilian oh ye gods immortal what day is this which has shone upon me at last31 we may imagine from this that cicero intended it to be understood that he exulted in the coming of his revenge the following is a fair translation of the opening passage of what remains to us beast that you are do you not see do you not perceive how odious to the men around you is that face of yours then with rapid words he heaps upon the unfortunate man accusations of personal incompetencies nobody complains says cicero that that fellow of yesterday gabinius should have been made consul we have not been deceived in him but your eyes and eyebrows your forehead that face of yours which should be the dumb index of the mind within have deceived those who have not known you few of us only have been aware of your infamous vices the sloth of your intellect your dulness your inability to speak when was your voice heard in the forum when has your counsel been put to the proof when did you do any service either in peace or war you have crept into your high place by the mistakes of men by the regard to the dirty images of your ancestors to whom you have no resemblance except in their present grimy color and shall he boast to me says the orator turning from piso to the audience around that he has gone on without a check from one step in the magistracy to another that is a boast for me to make for mehomini novoa man without ancestors on whom the roman people has showered all its honors you were made Ædile you say the roman people choose a piso for their Ædilenot this man from any regard for himself but because he is a piso the prætorship was conferred not on you but on your ancestors who were known and who were dead of you who are alive no one has known anything but me then he continues the contrast between himself and piso for the speech is as full of his own merits as of the other mans abominations  so the oration goes on to the end he asserts addressing himself to piso that if he saw him and gabinius crucified together he did not know whether he would be most delighted by the punishment inflicted on their bodies or by the ruin of their reputation he declares that he has prayed for all evil on piso and gabinius and that the gods have heard him but it has not been for death or sickness or for torment that he had prayed but for such evils as have in truth come upon them two consuls sent with large armies into two of the grandest provinces have returned with disgrace that onemeaning pisohas not dared even to send home an account of his doings and the othergabiniushas not had his words credited by the senate nor any of his requests granted he cicero had hardly dared to hope for all this but the gods had done it for him the most absurd passage is that in which he tells piso that having lost his armywhich he had donehe had brought back nothing in safety but that old impudent face of his32 altogether it is a tirade of abuse very inferior to ciceros dignity le clerc the french critic and editor speaks the truth when he says il faut avouer quil manque surtout de modération et que la gravité dun orateur consulaire y fait trop souvent place à lemportement dun ennemi it is however full of life and amusing as an expression of honest hatred the reader when reading it will of course remember that roman manners allowed a mode of expression among the upper classes which is altogether denied to those among us who hope to be regarded as gentlemen  the games in pompeys theatre to the preparation of which cicero alludes in his speech against piso are described by him with his usual vivacity and humor in a letter written immediately after them to his friend marius pompeys games with which he celebrated his second consulship seem to have been divided between the magnificent theatre which he had just builtfragments of which still remain to usand the circus maximus this letter from cicero is very interesting as showing the estimation in which these games were held or were supposed to be held by a roman man of letters and as giving us some description of what was done on the occasion marius had not come to rome to see them and cicero writes as though his friend had despised them cicero himself having been in rome had of course witnessed them to have been in rome and not to have seen them would have been quite out of the question not to come to rome from a distance was an eccentricity he congratulated marius for not having come whether it was that he was ill or that the whole thing was too despicable you in the early morning have been looking out upon your view over the bay while we have been staring at puppets half asleep most costly games but i should sayjudging of you by myselfthat they would have been quite revolting to you poor Æsopus was there acting but so unfitted by age that all his friends could not but wish that he had desisted why should i tell you of it all the very costliness of the affair took away all the pleasure six hundred mules on the stage in the acting of clytemnestra or three thousand golden goblets in the trojan horsewhat delight could they give you if your slave protogenes was reading to you somethingso that it were not one of my speechesyou were better off at any rate than we there were two marvellous slaughterings of beasts which lasted for five days nobody denies but that they were very grand but what pleasure can there be to a man of letters33 when some weak human creature is destroyed by a sturdy beast or when some lonely animal is pierced through by a huntingspear the last day was the day of elephants in which there could be no delight except to the vulgar crowd you could not but pity them feeling that the poor brutes had something in common with humanity in these combats were killed twenty elephants and two hundred lions the bad taste and systematical corruption of rome had reached its acme when this theatre was opened and these games displayed by pompey  he tells atticus34 in a letter written about this time that he is obliged to write to him by the hand of a secretary from which we gather that such had not been at any rate his practice he is every day in the forum making speeches and he had already composed the dialogues de oratore and had sent them to lentulus though he was no longer in office his time seems to have been as fully occupied as when he was prætor or consul  we have records of at least a dozen speeches made bc 55 and bc 54 between that against piso and the next that is extant which was delivered in defence of plancius he defended cispius but cispius was convicted he defended caninius gallus of whom we may presume that he was condemned and exiled because cicero found him at athens on his way to cilicia athens being the place to which exiled roman oligarchs generally betook themselves35 in this letter to his young friend cælius he speaks of the pleasure he had in meeting with caninius at athens but in the letter to marius which i have quoted he complains of the necessity which has befallen him of defending the man the heat of the summer of this year he passed in the country but on his return to the city in november he found crassus defending his old enemy gabinius gabinius had crept back from his province into the city and had been received with universal scorn and a shower of accusations cicero at first neither accused nor defended him but having been called on as a witness seems to have been unable to refrain from something of the severity with which he had treated piso there was at any rate a passage of arms in which gabinius called him a banished criminal36 the senate then rose as one body to do honor to their late exile he was however afterward driven by the expostulations of pompey to defend the man at his first trial gabinius was acquitted but was convicted and banished when cicero defended him cicero suffered very greatly in the constraint thus put upon him by pompey and refused pompey till cæsars request was added we can imagine that nothing was more bitter to him than the obligation thus forced upon him we have nothing of the speech left but can hardly believe that it was eloquent from this however there rose a reconciliation between crassus and cicero both cæsar and pompey having found it to their interest to interfere as a result of this early in the next year cicero defended crassus in the senate when an attempt was made to rob the late consul of his coveted mission to syria of what he did in this respect he boasts in a letter to crassus37 which regarded from our point of view would no doubt be looked upon as base he despised crassus and here takes credit for all the fine things he had said of him but we have no right to think that cicero could have been altogether unlike a roman he speaks also in the senate on behalf of the people of tenedos who had brought their immunities and privileges into question by some supposed want of faith all we know of this speech is that it was spoken in vain he pleaded against an asiatic king antiochus of comagene who was befriended by pompey but cicero seems to have laughed him out of some of his petty possessions38 he spoke for the inhabitants of reate on some question of waterprivilege against the interamnates interamna we now know as terne where a modern pope made a lovely waterfall and at the same time rectified the waterprivileges of the surrounding district cicero went down to its pleasant tempe as he calls it and stayed there awhile with one axius39 he returned thence to rome to undertake some case for fonteius and attended the games which milo was giving milo having been elected Ædile here we have a morsel of dramatic criticism on antiphon the actor and arbuscula the actress which reminds one of pepys then he defended messius then drusus then scaurus he mentions all these cases in the same letter but so slightly that we cannot trouble ourselves with their details we only feel that he was kept as busy as a london barrister in full practice he also defended vatiniusthat vatinius with whose iniquities he had been so indignant at the trial of sextius he defended him twice at the instigation of cæsar and he does not seem to have suffered in doing so as he had certainly done when called upon to stand up and plead for his late consular enemy gabinius valerius maximus a dull author often quoted but seldom read whose task it was to give instances of all the virtues and vices produced by mankind refers to these pleadings for gabinius and vatinius as instances of an almost divine forgiveness of injury40 i think we must seek for the good if good is to be discovered in the proceeding in the presumed strength which might be added to the republic by friendly relations between himself and cæsar  sidenote bc 54 ætat 53  in the spring of the year we find cicero writing to cæsar in apparently great intimacy he recommends to cæsar his young friend trebatius a lawyer who was going to gaul in search of his fortune and in doing so he refers to a joking promise from cæsar that he would make another friend whom he had recommended king of gaul or if not that foreman at least to lepta his head of the mechanics lepta was an officer in trust under cæsar with whose name we become familiar in ciceros correspondence though i do not remember that cæsar ever mentions him send me some one else that i may show my friendship cæsar had said knowing well that cicero was worth any price of the kind cicero declares to cæsar that on hearing this he held up his hands in grateful surprise and on this account he had sent trebatius mi cæsar he says writing with all affection and then he praises trebatius assuring cæsar that he does not recommend the young man loosely as he had some other young men who were worthlesssuch as milo for instance this results in much good done to trebatius though the young man at first does not like the service with the army he is a lawyer and finds the work in gaul very rough cicero who is anxious on his behalf laughs at him and bids him take the good things that come in his way in subsequent years trebatius was made known to the world as the legal pundit whom horace pretends to consult as to the libellous nature of his satires41  in september of this year cicero pleaded in court for his friend cn plancius against whom there was brought an accusation that in canvassing and obtaining the office of Ædile he had been guilty of bribery in all these accusations which come before us as having been either promoted or opposed by cicero there is not one in which the reader sympathizes more strongly with the person accused than in this plancius had shown cicero during his banishment the affection of a brother or almost of a son plancius had taken him in and provided for him in macedonia when to do so was illegal cicero now took great delight in returning the favor the reader of this oration cannot learn from it that plancius had in truth done anything illegal the complaint really made against him was that he filling the comparatively humble position of a knight had ventured to become the opposing candidate of such a gallant young aristocrat as m juventius laterensis who was beaten at this election and now brought this action in revenge there is no tearing of any enemy to tatters in this oration but there is much pathos and as was usual with cicero at this period of his life an inordinate amount of selfpraise there are many details as to the way in which the tribes voted at elections which the patient and curious student will find instructive but which will probably be caviare to all who are not patient and curious students there are a few passages of peculiar force addressing himself to the rival of plancius he tells laterensis that even though the people might have judged badly in selecting plancius it was not the less his duty to accept the judgment of the people42 say that the people ought not to have done so but it should have been sufficient for him that they had done so then he laughs with a beautiful irony at the pretensions of the accuser let us suppose that it was so he says43 let no one whose family has not soared above prætorian honors contest any place with one of consular family let no mere knight stand against one with prætorian relations in such a case there would be no need of the people to vote at all farther on he gives his own views as to the honors of the state in language that is very grand it has he says been my first endeavor to deserve the high rank of the state my second to have been thought to deserve it the rank itself has been but the third object of my desires44 plancius was acquittedit seems to us quite as a matter of course  in this perhaps the most difficult period of his existence when the organized conspiracy of the day had not as yet overturned the landmarks of the constitution he wrote a long letter to his friend lentulus45 him who had been prominent as consul in rescuing him from his exile and who was now proconsul in cilicia lentulus had probably taxed him after some friendly fashion with going over from the optimates or senatorial party to that of the conspirators pompey cæsar and crassus he had been called a deserter for having passed in his earlier years from the popular party to that of the senate and now the leading optimates were doubtful of himwhether he was not showing himself too well inclined to do the bidding of the democratic leaders the one accusation has been as unfair as the other in this letter he reminds lentulus that a captain in making a port cannot always sail thither in a straight line but must tack and haul and use a slant of wind as he can get it cicero was always struggling to make way against a headwind and was running hither and thither in his attempt in a manner most perplexing to those who were looking on without knowing the nature of the winds but his port was always there clearly visible to him if he could only reach it that port was the old republic with its wellworn and once successful institutions it was not to be fetched the winds had become too perverse and the entrance had become choked with sand but he did his best to fetch it and though he was driven hither and thither in his endeavors it should be remembered that to lookerson such must ever be the appearance of those who are forced to tack about in search of their port  i have before me mr forsyths elaborate and very accurate account of this letter now however says the biographer the future lay dark before him and not the most sagacious politician at rome could have divined the series of eventsblundering weakness on the one side and unscrupulous ambition on the otherwhich led to the dictatorship of cæsar and the overthrow of the constitution nothing can be more true cicero was probably the most sagacious politician in rome and he though he did understand much of the weaknessand it should be added of the greedof his own party did not foresee the point which cæsar was destined to reach and which was now probably fixed before cæsars own eyes but i cannot agree with mr forsyth in the result at which he had arrived when he quoted a passage from one of the notes affixed by melmoth to his translation of this letter it was fear alone that determined his resolution and having once already suffered in the cause of liberty he did not find himself to be disposed to be twice its martyr i should not have thought these words worthy of refutation had they not been backed by mr forsyth how did cicero show his fear had he fearedas indeed there was cause enough when it was difficult for a leading man to keep his throat uncut amid the violence of the times or a house over his headmight he not have made himself safe by accepting cæsars offers a proconsul out of rome was safe enough but he would not be a proconsul out of rome till he could avoid it no longer when the day of danger came he joined pompeys army against cæsar doubting not for his life but for his character as to what might be the best for the republic he did not fear when cæsar was dead and only antony remained when the hour came in which his throat had to be cut he did not fear when a man has shown such a power of action in the face of danger as cicero displayed at fortyfour in his consulship and again at sixtyfour in his prolonged struggle with antony it is contrary to nature that he should have been a coward at fiftyfour  and all the evidence of the period is opposed to this theory of cowardice there was nothing special for him to fear when cæsar was in gaul and crassus about to start for syria and pompey for his provinces such was the condition of rome social and political that all was uncertain and all was dangerous but men had become used to danger and were anxious only in the general scramble to get what plunder might be going unlimited plunder was at ciceros commandprovinces magistracies abnormal lieutenanciesbut he took nothing he even told his friend in joke that he would have liked to be an augur and the critics have thereupon concluded that he was ready to sell his country for a trifle but he took nothing when all others were helping themselves  the letter to lentulus is well worth studying if only as evidence of the thoughtfulness with which he weighed every point affecting his own character he did wish to stand well with the optimates of whom lentulus was one he did wish to stand well with cæsar and with pompey who at this time was cæsars jackal he did find the difficulty of running with the hare and hunting with the hounds he must have surely learned at last to hate all compromise but he had fallen on hard times and the task before him was impossible if however his hands were clean when those of others were dirty and his motives patriotic while those of others were selfish so much ought to be said for him  in the same year he defended rabirius postumus and in doing so carried on the purpose which he had been instigated to undertake by cæsar in defending gabinius this rabirius was the nephew of him whom ten years before cicero had defended when accused of having killed saturninus he was a knight and as was customary with the equites had long been engaged in the pursuit of trade making money by lending money and such like he had it seems been a successful man but in an evil time for himself had come across king ptolemy auletes when there was a question of restoring that wretched sovereign to the throne of egypt as cicero was not himself much exercised in this matter i have not referred to the king and his affairs wishing as far as possible to avoid questions which concern the history of rome rather than the life of cicero but the affairs of this banished king continually come up in the records of this time pompey had befriended auletes and gabinius when proconsul in syria had succeeded in restoring the king to his throneno doubt in obedience to pompey though not in obedience to the senate auletes when in rome had required large sums of moneysuppliant kings when in the city needed money to buy venal senatorsand rabirius had supplied him the profits to be made from suppliant kings when in want of money were generally very great but this king seems so have got hold of all the money which rabirius possessed so that the knightbanker found himself obliged to become one of the kings suite when the king went back to take possession of his kingdom in no other way could he hang on to the vast debt that was owing to him in egypt he found himself compelled to undergo various indignities he became no better than a headservant among the kings servants one of the charges brought against him was that he a roman knight had allowed himself to be clothed in the halffeminine garb of an oriental attendant upon a king it was also brought against him as part of the accusation that he had bribed or had endeavored to bribe a certain senator the crime nominally laid to the charge of rabirius was de repetundisfor extorting money in the position of a magistrate the money alluded to had been in truth extorted by gabinius from ptolemy auletes as the price paid for his restoration and had come in great part probably from out of the pocket of rabirius himself gabinius had been condemned and ordered to repay the money he had none to repay and the claim by some clause in the law to that effect was transferred to rabirius as his agent rabirius was accused as though he had extorted the moneywhich he had in fact lost but the spirit of the accusation lay in the idea that he a roman knight had basely subjected himself to an egyptian king that rabirius had been base and sordid there can be no doubt that he was ruined by his transaction with auletes is equally certain it is supposed that he was convicted he was afterward employed by cæsar who when in power may have recalled him from banishment there are many passages in the oration to which i would fain refer the reader had i space to do so i will name only one in which cicero endeavors to ingratiate himself with his audience by referring to the old established roman hatred of kings who is there among us who though he may not have tried them himself does not know the ways of kings listen to me here obey my word at once speak a word more than you are told and youll see what youll get do that a second time and you die we should read of such things and look at them from a distance not only for our pleasure but that we may know of what we have to be aware and what we ought to avoid46  there is a letter written in this year to curio another young friend such as cælius of whom i have spoken curio also was clever dissipated extravagant and unscrupulous but at this period of his life he was attached to cicero who was not indifferent to the services which might accrue to him from friends who might be violent and unscrupulous on the right side  sidenote bc 53 ætat 54  this letter was written to secure curios services for another friend not quite so young but equally attached and perhaps of all the romans of the time the most unscrupulous and the most violent this friend was milo who was about to stand for the consulship of the following year curio was on his road from asia minor where he had been quæstor and is invited by cicero in language peculiarly pressing to be the leader of milos party on the occasion47 we cannot but imagine that the winds which curio was called upon to govern were the tornadoes and squalls which were to be made to rage in the streets of rome to the great discomfiture of milos enemies during his canvass to such a state had rome come that for the first six months of this year there were no consuls an election being found to be impossible milo had been the great opponent of clodius in the city rows which had taken place previous to the exile of cicero the two men are called by mommsen the achilles and the hector of the streets48 cicero was of course on milos side as milo was an enemy to clodius in this matter his feeling was so strong that he declares to curio that he does not think that the welfare and fortunes of one man were ever so dear to another as now were those of milo to him milos success is the only object of interest he has in the world this is interesting to us now as a prelude to the great trial which was to take place in the next year when milo instead of being elected consul was convicted of murder  in the two previous years cæsar had made two invasions into britain in the latter of which quintus cicero had accompanied him cicero in various letters alludes to this undertaking but barely gives it the importance which we as britons think should have been attached to so tremendous an enterprise there might perhaps be some danger he thought in crossing the seas and encountering the rocky shores of the island but there was nothing to be got worth the getting he tells atticus that he can hardly expect any slaves skilled either in music or letters49 and he suggests to trebatius that as he will certainly find neither gold nor slaves he had better put himself into a british chariot and come back in it as soon as possible50 in this year cæsar reduced the remaining tribes of gaul and crossed the rhine a second time it was his sixth year in gaul and men had learned to know what was his nature cicero had discovered his greatness as also pompey must have done to his great dismay and he had himself discovered what he was himself but two accidents occurred in this year which were perhaps as important in roman history as the continuance of cæsars success julia cæsars daughter and pompeys wife died in childbed she seems to have been loved by all and had been idolized from the time of the marriage by her uxorious husband who was more than twentyfour years her senior she certainly had been a strong bond of union between cæsar and pompey so much so that we are surprised that such a feeling should have been so powerful among the romans of the time concordiæ pignus a pledge of friendship she is called by paterculus who tells us in the same sentence that the triumvirate had no other bond to hold it together51 whether the friendship might have remained valid had julia lived we cannot say but she died and the two friends became enemies from the moment of julias death there was no triumvirate  the other accident was equally fatal to the bond of union which had bound the three men together late in the year after his consulship bc 54 crassus had gone to his syrian government with the double intention of increasing his wealth and rivalling the military glories of cæsar and pompey in the following year he became an easy victim to eastern deceit and was destroyed by the parthians with his son and the greater part of the roman army which had been intrusted to him52 we are told that crassus at last destroyed himself i doubt however whether there was enough of patriotism alive among romans at the time to create the feeling which so great a loss and so great a shame should have occasioned as far as we can learn the destruction of crassus and his legions did not occasion so much thought in rome as the breaking up of the triumvirate  ciceros daughter tullia was now a second time without a husband she was the widow of her first husband piso had then bc 56 married crassipes and had been divorced of him we have heard nothing except that he was divorced a doubt has been thrown on the fact whether she was in truth ever married to crassipes we learn from letters both to his brother and to atticus that cicero was contented with the match when it was made and did his best to give the lady a rich dowry53  in this year cicero was elected into the college of augurs to fill the vacancy made by the death of young crassus who had been killed with his father in parthia the reader will remember that he had in a joking manner expressed a desire for the office he now obtained it without any difficulty and certainly without any sacrifice of his principle it had formerly been the privilege of the augurs to fill up the vacancies in their own college but the right had been transferred to the people it was now conferred upon cicero without serious opposition     chapter iii  milo   sidenote bc 52 ætat 55  the preceding year came to an end without any consular election it was for the election expected to have taken place that the services of curio had been so ardently bespoken by cicero on behalf of milo in order to impede the election clodius accused milo of being in debt and cicero defended him what was the nature of the accusation we do not exactly know an inquiry into milos debts such was the name given to the pleadings as found with the fragments which have come to us54 in these which are short and not specially interesting there is hardly a word as to milos debts but much abuse of clodius with some praise of cicero himself and some praise also of pompey who was so soon to take up arms against cicero not metaphorically but in grim reality of sword and buckler in this matter of his further defence of milo we cannot believe that milos debts stood in the way of his election but we know that at last he was not elected early in the year clodius was killed and then at the suggestion of bibuluswhom the reader will remember as the colleague of cæsar in the consulship when cæsar reduced his colleague to ridiculous impotence by his violencepompey was elected as sole consul an honor which befell no other roman55 the condition of rome must have been very low when such a one as bibulus thought that no order was possible except by putting absolute power into the hands of him who had so lately been the partner of cæsar in the conspiracy which had not even yet been altogether brought to an end that bibulus acted under constraint is no doubt true it would be of little matter now from what cause he acted were it not that his having taken a part in this utter disruption of the roman form of government is one proof the more that there was no longer any hope for the republic  but the story of the killing of clodius must be told at some length because it affords the bestdrawn picture that we can get of the sort of violence with which roman affairs had to be managed and also because it gave rise to one of the choicest morsels of forensic eloquence that have ever been prepared by the intellect and skill of an advocate it is well known that the speech to which i refer was not spoken and could not have been spoken in the form in which it has reached us we do not know what part of it was spoken and what was omitted but we do know that the pro milone exists for us and that it lives among the glories of language as a published oration i find on looking through the institutio oratoria of quintilian that in his estimation the pro milone was the first in favor of all our authors orationsfacile princeps if we may collect the critics ideas on the subject from the number of references made and examples taken quintilians work consists of lessons on oratory which he supports by quotations from the great orators both greek and latin with whose speeches he has made himself familiar cicero was to him the chief of orators so much so that we may almost say that quintilians institutio is rather a lecture in honor of cicero than a general lesson with the roman schoolmasters method of teaching for the benefit of the roman youth of the day we have no concern at present but we can gather from the references made by him the estimation in which various orations were held by others as well as by him in his day the pro cluentio which is twice as long as the pro milone and which has never i think been a favorite with modern readers is quoted very frequently by quintilian it is the second in the list quintilian makes eighteen references to it but the pro milone is brought to the readers notice thirtyseven times quintilian was certainly a good critic and he understood how to recommend himself to his own followers by quoting excellences which had already been acknowledged as the best which roman literature had afforded  those who have gone before me in writing the life of cicero have in telling their story as to milo very properly gone to asconius for their details as i must do so too i shall probably not diverge far from them asconius wrote as early as in the reign of claudius and had in his possession the annals of the time which have not come to us among other writings he could refer to those books of livy which have since been lost he seems to have done his work as commentator with no glow of affection and with no touch of animosity either on one side or on the other there can be no reason for doubting the impartiality of asconius as to milos trial and every reason for trusting his knowledge of the facts  sidenote bc 52 ætat 55  when the year began no consuls had been chosen and an interrex became necessaryone interrex after anotherto make the election of consuls possible in accordance with the forms of the constitution these men remained in office each for five days and it was customary that an election which had been delayed should be completed within the days of the second or third interrex there were three candidates milo hypsæus and q metellus scipio by all of whom bribery and violence were used with open and unblushing profligacy cicero was wedded to milos cause as we have seen from his letter to curio but it does not appear that he himself took any active part in the canvass the duties to be done required rather the services of a curio pompey on the other hand was nearly as warmly engaged in favor of hypsæus and scipio though in the turn which affairs took he seems to have been willing enough to accept the office himself when it came in his way milo and clodius had often fought in the streets of rome each ruffian attended by a band of armed combatants so that in audacity as asconius says they were equal  on the 20th of january milo was returning to rome from lanuvium where he had been engaged as chief magistrate of the town in nominating a friend for the municipality he was in a carriage with his wife fausta and with a friend and was followed as was his wont by a large band of armed men among whom were two noted gladiators eudamus and birria at bovillæ near the temple of the bona dea his cortege was met by clodius on horseback who had with him some friends and thirty slaves armed with swords milos attendants were nearly ten times as numerous it is not supposed by asconius that either of the two men expected the meeting which may be presumed to have been fortuitous milo and clodius passed each other without words or blowsscowling no doubt but the two gladiators who were at the end of the file of milos men began to quarrel with certain of the followers of clodius clodius interfered and was stabbed in the shoulder by birria then he was carried to a neighboring tavern while the fight was in progress milo having heard that his enemy was there concealedthinking that he would be greatly relieved in his career by the death of such a foe and that the risk should be run though the consequences might be gravecaused clodius to be dragged out from the tavern and slaughtered on what grounds asconius has attributed these probable thoughts to milo we do not know that the order was given the jury believed or at any rate affected to believe  up to this moment milo was no more guilty than clodius and neither of them probably guilty of more than their usual violence partisans on the two sides endeavored to show that each had prepared an ambush for the other but there is no evidence that it was so there is no evidence existing now as to this dragging out of clodius that he might be murdered but we know what was the general opinion of rome at the time and we may conclude that it was right the order probably was given by miloas it would have been given by clodius in similar circumstancesat the spur of the moment when milo allowed his passion to get the better of his judgment  the thirty servants of clodius were either killed or had run away and hidden themselves when a certain senator s tedius coming that way found the dead body on the road and carrying it into the city on a litter deposited it in the dead mans house before nightfall the death of clodius was known through the city and the body was surrounded by a crowd of citizens of the lower order and of slaves with them was fulvia the widow exposing the dead mans wounds and exciting the people to sympathy on the morrow there was an increased crowd among whom were senators and tribunes and the body was carried out into the forum and the people were harangued by the tribunes as to the horror of the deed that had been done from thence the body was borne into the neighboring senatehouse56 by the crowd under the leading of sextus clodius a cousin of the dead man here it was burnt with a great fire fed with the desks and benches and even with the books and archives which were stored there not only was the senatehouse destroyed by the flames but a temple also that was close to it milos house was attacked and was defended by arms we are made to understand that all rome was in a state of violence and anarchy the consuls fasces had been put away in one of the templesthat of venus libitina these the people seized and carried to the house of pompey declaring that he should be dictator and he alone consul mingling anarchy with a marvellous reverence for legal forms  but there arose in the city a feeling of great anger at the burning of the senatehouse which for a while seemed to extinguish the sympathy for clodius so that milo who was supposed to have taken himself off came back to rome and renewed his canvass distributing bribes to all the citizensmillia assuumperhaps something over ten pounds to every man both he and cælius harangued the people and declared that clodius had begun the fray but no consuls could be elected while the city was in such a state and pompey having been desired to protect the republic in the usual form collected troops from all italy preparations were made for trying milo and the friends of each party demanded that the slaves of the other party should be put to the torture and examined as witnesses but every possible impediment and legal quibble was used by the advocates on either side hortensius who was engaged for milo declared that milos slaves had all been made free men and could not be touched stories were told backward and forward of the cruelty and violence on each side milo made an offer to pompey to abandon his canvass in favor of hypsæus if pompey would accept this as a compromise pompey answered with the assumed dignity that was common to him that he was not the roman people and that it was not for him to interfere  it was then that pompey was created sole consul at the instigation of bibulus he immediately caused a new law to be passed for the management of the trial which was coming on and when he was opposed in this by cælius declared that if necessary he would carry his purpose by force of arms pretending to be afraid of milos violence he remained at home and on one occasion dismissed the senate afterward when milo entered the senate he was accused by a senator present of having come thither with arms hidden beneath his toga whereupon he lifted his toga and showed that there were none asconius tells us that upon this cicero declared that all the other charges made against the accused were equally false this is the first word of ciceros known to us in the matter  two or three men declared that because they had been present at the death of clodius they had been kidnapped and kept close prisoners by milo and the story whether true or false did milo much harm it seems that milo became again very odious to the people and that their hatred was for the time extended to cicero as milos friend and proposed advocate pompey seems to have shared the feeling and to have declared that violence was contemplated against himself but such was ciceros constancy says asconius that neither the alienation of the people nor the suspicions of pompey no fear of what might befall himself at the trial no dread of the arms which were used openly against milo could hinder him from going on with the defence although it was within his power to avoid the quarrel with the people and to renew his friendship for pompey by abstaining from it domitius Ænobarbus was chosen as president and the others elected as judges were we are told equally good men milo was accused both of violence and bribery but was able to arrange that the former case should be tried first the method of the trial is explained fiftyone judges or jurymen were at last chosen schola was the first witness examined and he exaggerated as best he could the horror of the murder when marcellus as advocate for milo began to examine schola the people were so violent that the president was forced to protect marcellus by taking him within the barrier of the judges seats milo also was obliged to demand protection within the court pompey then sitting at the treasury and frightened by the clamor declared that he himself would come down with troops on the next day after the hearing of the evidence the tribune munatius plancus harangued the people and begged them to come in great numbers on the morrow so that milo might not be allowed to escape on the following day which was the 11th of april all the taverns were shut pompey filled the forum and every approach to it with his soldiers he himself remained seated at the treasury as before surrounded by a picked body of men at the trial on this day when three of the advocates against milo had spokenappius marc antony and valerius neposcicero stood up to defend the criminal brutus had prepared an oration declaring that the killing of clodius was in itself a good deed and praiseworthy on behalf of the republic but to this speech cicero refused his consent arguing that a man could not legally be killed simply because his death was to be desired and brutuss speech was not spoken witnesses had declared that milo had lain in wait for clodius this cicero alleged to be false contending that clodius had lain in wait for milo and he endeavored to make this point and no other but it is proved says asconius that neither of the men had any design of violence on that day that they met by chance and that the killing of clodius had come from the quarrelling of the slaves it was well known that each had often threatened the death of the other milos slaves had no doubt been much more numerous than those of clodius when the meeting took place but those of clodius had been very much better prepared for fighting when cicero began to address the judges the partisans of clodius could not be induced to abstain from riot even by fear of the soldiery so that he was unable to speak with his accustomed firmness  such is the account as given by asconius who goes on to tell us that out of the fiftyone judges thirtyeight condemned milo and only thirteen were for acquitting him milo therefore was condemned and had to retire at once into exile at marseilles  it seems to have been acknowledged by the judges that clodius had not been wounded at first by any connivance on the part of milo but they thought that milo did direct that clodius should be killed during the fight which the slaves had commenced among themselves as far as we can take any interest in the matter we must suppose that it was so but we are forced to agree with brutus that the killing of clodius was in itself a good deed doneand we have to acknowledge at the same time that the killing of milo would have been as good though we may doubt as to the manner in which clodius was killed there are points in the matter as to which we may be quite assured milo was condemned not for killing clodius but because he was opposed at the moment to the line of politics which pompey thought would be most conducive to his own interests milo was condemned and the death of the wretched clodius avenged because pompey had desired hypsæus to be consul and milo had dared to stand in his way an audience was refused to cicero not from any sympathy with clodius but because it suited pompey that milo should be condemned could cicero have spoken the words which afterward were published the jury might have hesitated and the criminal might have been acquitted cæsar was absent and pompey found himself again lifted into supreme powerfor a moment though no one in rome had insulted pompey as clodius had done though no one had so fought for pompey as cicero had done still it suited pompey to avenge clodius and to punish cicero for having taken milos part in regard to the consulship milo after his condemnation for the death of clodius was condemned in three subsequent trials one following the other almost instantly for bribery for secret conspiracy and again for violence in the city he was absent but there was no difficulty in obtaining his conviction when he was gone one saufeius a friend of his who had been with him during the tumult was put upon his trial for his share in the death of clodius he at any rate was known to have been guilty in the matter he had been leader of the party who attacked the tavern had killed the tavernkeeper and had dragged out clodius to execution but saufeius was twice acquitted had there been any hope of lawabiding tranquillity in rome it might have been well that clodius should be killed and milo banished as it was neither the death of the one nor the banishment of the other could avail anything the pity of it wasthe pitythat such a one as cicero a man with such intellect such ambition such sympathies and such patriotism should have been brought to fight on such an arena  sidenote bc 52 ætat 55  we have in this story a graphic and most astounding picture of the rome of the day no consuls had been or could be elected and the system by which interreges had been enabled to superintend the election of their successors in lieu of the consuls of the expiring year had broken down pompey had been made sole consul in an informal manner and had taken upon himself all the authority of a dictator in levying troops power in rome seems at the moment to have been shared between him and bands of gladiators but he too had succeeded in arming himself and as the clodian faction was on his side he was for a while supreme for law by this time he could have but little reverence having been partner with cæsar in the socalled triumvirate for the last eight years but yet he had no aptitude for throwing the law altogether on one side and making such a coupdemain as was now and again within his power beyond pompey there was at this time no power in rome except that of the gladiators and the owners of the gladiators who were each intent on making plunder out of the empire there were certain men such as were bibulus and cato who considered themselves to be optimatesleading citizens who believed in the republic and were no doubt anxious to maintain the established order of thingsas we may imagine the dukes and earls are anxious in these days of ours but they were impotent and bad men of business and as a body were too closely wedded to their fish pondsby which cicero means their general luxuries and extravagances in the bosoms of these men there was no doubt an eager desire to perpetuate a republic which had done so much for them and a courage sufficient for the doing of some great deed if the great deed would come in their way they went to pharsalia and cato marched across the deserts of libya they slew cæsar and did some gallant fighting afterward but they were like a rope of sand and had among them no fitting leader and no high purpose  outside of these was cicero who certainly was not a fitting leader when fighting was necessary and who as to politics in general was fitted rather by noble aspirations than supported by fixed purposes we are driven to wonder that there should have been at such a period and among such a people aspirations so noble joined with so much vanity of expression among romans he stands the highest because of all romans he was the least roman he had begun with high resolves and had acted up to them among all the quæstors Ædiles prætors and consuls rome had known none had been better none honester none more patriotic there had come up suddenly in those days a man imbued with the unwonted idea that it behooved him to do his duty to the state according to the best of his lightsno cincinnatus no decius no camillus no scipio no pretentious follower of those halfmythic heroes no demigod struggling to walk across the stage of life enveloped in his toga and resolved to impose on all eyes by the assumption of a divine dignity but one who at every turn was conscious of his human duty and anxious to do it to the best of his human ability he did it and we have to acknowledge that the conceit of doing it overpowered him he mistook the feeling of people around him thinking that they too would be carried away by their admiration of his conduct up to the day on which he descended from his consuls seat duty was paramount with him then gradually there came upon him the conviction that duty though it had been paramount with him did not weigh so very much with others he had been lavish in his worship of pompey thinking that pompey whom he had believed in his youth to be the best of citizens would of all men be the truest to the republic pompey had deceived him but he could not suddenly give up his idol gradually we see that there fell upon him a dread that the great roman republic was not the perfect institution which he had fancied in his early days chrysogonus had been base and verres and oppianicus and catiline but still to his idea the body of the roman republic had been sound but when he had gone out from his consulship with resolves strung too high that he would remain at rome despising provinces and plunder and be as it were a special providence to the republic gradually he fell from his high purpose finding that there were no romans such as he had conceived them to be then he fell away and became the man who could condescend to waste his unequalled intellect in attacking piso in praising himself and in defending milo the glory of his active life was over when his consulship was donethe glory was over with the exception of that to come from his final struggle with antonybut the work by which his immortality was to be achieved was yet before him i think that after defending milo he must have acknowledged to himself that all partisan fighting in rome was mean ignoble and hollow with the senatehouse and its archives burnt as a funeral pile for clodius and the forum in which he had to plead lined with soldiers who stopped him by their clang of arms instead of protecting him in his speech it must have been acknowledged by cicero that the old republic was dead past all hope of resurrection he had said so often to atticus but men say words in the despondency of the moment which they do not wish to have accepted as their established conviction in such humor cicero had written to his friend but now it must have occurred to him that his petulant expressions were becoming only too true when instigating curio to canvass for milo and defending milo as though it had been a good thing for a roman nobleman to travel in the neighborhood of the city with an army at his heels he must have ceased to believe even in himself as a roman statesman  in the oration which we possesswhich we must teach ourselves to regard as altogether different from that which cicero had been able to pronounce among pompeys soldiers and the clodian rabblethe reader is astonished by the magnificence of the language in which a case so bad in itself could be enveloped and is made to feel that had he been on the jury and had such an address been made to him he would certainly have voted for an acquittal the guilt or innocence of milo as to the murder really turned on the point whether he did or did not direct that clodius should be dragged out of the tavern and slain but here in this oration three points are put forward in each of which it was within the scope of the orator to make the jury believe that clodius had in truth prepared an ambuscade that clodius was of all romans the worst and that milo was loyal and true and in spite of a certain fierceness of disposition a good citizen at heart we agree with milo who declared when banished that he would never have been able to enjoy the fish of marseilles had cicero spoken in the forum the speech which he afterward composed  i would not remind you he says of milos tribuneship nor of all his service to the state unless i could make plain to you as daylight the ambush which on that day was laid for him by his enemy i will not pray you to forgive a crime simply because milo has been a good citizen nor because the death of clodius has been a blessing to us all will i therefore ask you to regard it as a deed worthy of praise but if the fact of the ambush be absolutely made evident then i beseech you at any rate to grant that a man may lawfully defend himself from the arrogance and from the arms of his enemies57 from this may be seen the nature of the arguments used for the language the reader must turn to the original that it will be worth his while to do so he has the evidence of all criticsespecially that of milo when he was eating sardines in his exile and of quintilian when he was preparing his lessons on rhetoric it seems that cicero had been twitted with using something of a dominating tyranny in the senatewhich would hardly have been true as the prevailing influence of the moment was that of pompeybut he throws aside the insinuation very grandly call it tyranny if you pleaseif you think it that rather than some little authority which has grown from my services to the state or some favor among good men because of my rank call it what you will while i am able to use it for the defence of the good against the violence of the evilminded58 then he describes the fashion in which these two men travelled on the occasionthe fashion of travelling as it suited him to describe it if you did not hear the details of the story but could see simply a picture of all that occurred would it not appear which of them had planned the attack which of them was ignorant of all evil one of them was seated in his carriage clad in his cloak and with his wife beside him his garments his clients his companions all show how little prepared he was for fighting then as to the other why was he leaving his countryhouse so suddenly why should he do this so late in the evening why did he travel so slowly at this time of the year he was going he says to pompeys villa not that he might see pompey because he knew that pompey was at alsium did he want to see the villa he had been there a thousand times why all this delay and turning backward and forward because he would not leave the spot till milo had come up and now compare this ruffians mode of travelling with that of milo it has been the constant custom with clodius to have his wife with him but now she was not there he has always been in a carriage but now he was on horseback his young greek sybarites have ever been with him even when he went as far as tuscany on this occasion there were no such trifles in his company milo with whom such companions were not usual had his wifes singingboys with him and a bevy of female slaves clodius who usually never moved without a crowd of prostitutes at his heels now had no one with him but men picked for this work in hand59 what a picture we have here of the manner in which noble romans were wont to move about the city and the suburbs we may imagine that the singingboys of milos wife were quite as bad as the greek attendants in whom clodius usually rejoiced then he asks a question as to pompey full of beautiful irony if pompey could bring back clodius from the deadpompey who is so fond of him pompey who is so powerful so fortunate so capable of all things pompey who would be so glad to do it because of his love for the mando you not know that on behalf of the republic he would leave him down among the ghosts where he is60 there is a delightful touch of satire in this when we remember how odious clodius had been to pompey in days not long gone by and how insolent  the oration is ended by histrionic effects in language which would have been marvellous had they ever been spoken but which seem to be incredible to us when we know that they were arranged for publication when the affair was over o me wretched o me unhappy61 but these attempts at translation are all vain the student who wishes to understand what may be the effect of latin words thrown into this choicest form should read the milo  we have very few letters from cicero in this yearfour only i think and they are of no special moment in one of them he recommends avianus to titus titius a lieutenant then serving under pompey62 in this he is very anxious to induce titius to let avianus know all the good things that cicero had said of him in our times we sometimes send our letters of introduction open by the hands of the person introduced so that he may himself read his own praise but the romans did not scruple to ask that this favor might be done for them do me this favor titius of being kind to avianus but do me also the greater favor of letting avianus know that i have asked you what cicero did to titius other noble romans did in their communications with their friends in the provinces in another letter to marius he expresses his great joy at the condemnation of that munatius plancus who had been tribune when clodius was killed plancus had harangued the people exciting them against milo and against cicero and had led to the burning of the senatehouse and of the temple next door for this plancus could not be accused during his year of office but he had been put upon his trial when that year was over pompey had done his best to save him but in vain and cicero rejoices not only that the tribune who had opposed him should be punished but that pompey should have been beaten which he attributes altogether to the favor shown toward himself by the jury63 he is aroused to true exultation that there should have been men on the bench who having been chosen by pompey in order that they might acquit this man had dared to condemn him cicero had himself spoken against plancus on the occasion sextus clodius who had been foremost among the rioters was also condemned  sidenote bc 52 ætat 55  this was the year in which cæsar was so nearly conquered by the gauls at gergovia and in which vercingetorix having shut himself up in alesia was overcome at last by the cruel strategy of the romans the brave gaul who had done his best to defend his country and had carried himself to the last with a fine gallantry was kept by his conqueror six years in chains and then strangled amid the glories of that conquerors triumph a signal instance of the mercy which has been attributed to cæsar as his special virtue in this year too ciceros dialogues with atticus de legibus were written he seems to have disturbed his labors in the forum with no other work     chapter iv  cilicia   sidenote bc 51 ætat 56  we cannot but think that at this time the return of cæsar was greatly feared at rome by the party in the state to which cicero belonged and this party must now be understood as including pompey pompey had been nominally proconsul in spain since the year of his second consulship conjointly with crassus bc 55 but had remained in rome and had taken upon himself the management of roman affairs considering himself to be the master of the irregular powers which the triumvirate had created and of this party was also cicero with cato bibulus brutus and all those who were proud to call themselves optimates they were now presumed to be desirous to maintain the old republican form of government and were anxious with more or less sincerity according to the character of the men cato and brutus were thoroughly in earnest not seeing however that the old form might be utterly devoid of the old spirit pompey was disposed to take the same direction thinking that all must be well in rome as long as he was possessed of high office grand names and the appanages of dictatorship cicero too was anxious loyally anxious but anxious without confidence something might perhaps be saved if these optimates could be aroused to some idea of their duty by the exercise of eloquence such as his own  i will quote a few words from mr froudes cæsar if cæsar came to rome as consul the senate knew too well what it might expect and then he adds cicero had for some time seen what was coming64 as to these assertions i quite agree with mr froude but i think that he has read wrongly both the history of the time and the character of the man when he goes on to state that cicero preferred characteristically to be out of the way at the moment when he expected that the storm should break and had accepted the government of cilicia and cyprus all the known details of ciceros life up to the period of his government of cilicia during his government and after his return from that province prove that he was characteristically wedded to a life in rome this he declared by his distaste to that employment and his impatience of return while he was absent nothing i should say could be more certain than that he went to cilicia in obedience to new legal enactments which he could not avoid but which as they acted upon himself were odious to him mr froude tells us that he held the government but for two years65 the period of these provincial governments had of late much varied the acknowledged legal duration was for one year they had been stretched by the governing party to three as in the case of verres in sicily to five as with pompey for his spanish government to ten for cæsar in gaul this had been done with the view of increasing the opportunities for plunder and power but had been efficacious of good in enabling governors to carry out work for which one year would not have sufficed it may be a question whether cicero as proconsul in cilicia deserved blame for curtailing the period of his services to the empire or praise for abstaining from plunder and power but the fact is that he remained in his province not two years but exactly one66 and that he escaped from it with all the alacrity which we may presume to be expected by a prisoner when the bars of his jail have been opened for him whether we blame him or praise him we can hardly refrain from feeling that his impatience was grotesque there certainly was no desire on ciceros part either to go to cilicia or to remain there and of all his feelings that which prompted him never to be far absent from rome was the most characteristic of the man  among various laws which pompey had caused to be passed in the previous year bc 52 and which had been enacted with views personal to himself and his own political views had been one de jure magistratuumas to the way in which the magistrates of the empire should be selected among other clauses it contained one which declared that no prætor and no consul should succeed to a province till he had been five years out of office it would be useless here to point out how absolutely subversive of the old system of the republic this new law would have been had the new law and the old system attempted to live together the proprætor would have been forced to abandon his aspirations either for the province or for the consulship and no consular governor would have been eligible for a province till after his fiftieth year but at this time pompey was both consul and governor and cæsar was governor for ten years with special exemption from another clause in the war which would otherwise have forbidden him to stand again for the consulship during his absence67 the law was wanted probably only for the moment but it had the effect of forcing cicero out of rome as there would naturally come from it a dearth of candidates for the provinces it was further decreed by the senate that the exprætors and exconsuls who had not yet served as governors should now go forth and undertake the duties of government in compliance with this order and probably as a specially intended consequence of it cicero was compelled to go to cilicia mr froude has said that he preferred characteristically to be out of the way i have here given what i think to be the more probable cause of his undertaking the government of cilicia  sidenote bc 51 ætat 56  in april of this year cicero before he started wrote the first of a series of letters which he addressed to appius claudius who was his predecessor in the province this appius was the brother of the publius clodius whom we have known for the last two or three years as ciceros pest and persecutor but he addresses appius as though they were dear friends since it has come to pass in opposition to all my wishes and to my expectations that i must take in hand the government of a province i have this one consolation in my various troublesthat no better friend to yourself than i am could follow you and that i could take up the government from the hands of none more disposed to make the business pleasant to me than you will be68 and then he goes on you perceive that in accordance with the decree of the senate the province has to be occupied his next letter on the subject was written to atticus while he was still in italy but when he had started on his journey in your farewell to me he says i have seen the nature of your love to me i know well what is my own for you it must then be your peculiar care to see lest by any new arrangement this parting of ours should be prolonged beyond one year69 then he goes on to tell the story of a scene that had occurred at arcanum a house belonging to his brother quintus at which he had stopped on the road for a family farewell pomponia was there the wife of quintus and the sister to atticus there were a few words between the husband and the wife as to the giving of the invitation for the occasion in which the lady behaved with much christian perversity of temper alas says quintus to his brother you see what it is that i have to suffer every day knowing as we all do how great were the powers of the roman paterfamilias and how little womans rights had been ventilated in those days we should have thought that an exprætor might have managed his home more comfortably but ladies no doubt have had the capacity to make themselves disagreeable in all ages  i doubt whether we have any testimony whatever as to ciceros provincial government except that which comes from himself and which is confined to the letters written by him at the time70 nevertheless we have a clear record of his doings so full and satisfactory are the letters which he then wrote the truth of his account of himself has never been questioned he draws a picture of his own integrity his own humanity and his own power of administration which is the more astonishing because we cannot but compare it with the pictures which we have from the same hand of the rapacity the cruelty and the tyranny of other governors we have gone on learning from his speeches and his letters that these were habitual plunderers tyrants and malefactors till we are taught to acknowledge that in the low condition to which roman nature had fallen it was useless to expect any other conduct from a roman governor and then he gives us the account of how a man did govern when as by a miracle a governor had been found honest clearheaded sympathetic and benevolent that man was himself and he gives this account of himself as it were without a blush he tells the story of himself not as though it was remarkable that other governors should grind the bones of their subjects to make bread of them and draw the blood from their veins for drink but that cicero should not condescend to take even the normal tribute when willingly offered seems to cicero to have been only what the world had a right to expect from him a wonderful testimony is this as to the mans character but surely the universal belief in his own account of his own governorship is more wonderful the conduct of cicero in his command was meritorious says de quincey his short career as proconsul in cilicia had procured for him wellmerited honor says dean merivale71 he had managed his province well no one ever suspected cicero of being corrupt or unjust says mr froude who had however said some pages before that cicero was thinking as usual of himself first and his duty afterward72 dio cassius who is never tired of telling disagreeable stories of ciceros life says not a word of his cilician government from which we may at any rate argue that no stories detrimental to cicero as a proconsul had come in the way of dio cassius i have confirmed what i have said as to this episode in ciceros life by the corroborating testimony of writers who have not been generally favorable in their views of his character nevertheless we have no testimony but his own as to what cicero did in cilicia73  it has never occurred to any reader of ciceros letters to doubt a line in which he has spoken directly of his own conduct his letters have often been used against himself but in a different manner he has been judged to give true testimony against himself but not false testimony in his own favor his own record has been taken sometimes as meaning what it has not meantand sometimes as implying much more that the writer intended a word which has required for its elucidation an insight into the humor of the man has been read amiss or some trembling admissions to a friend of shortcoming in the purpose of the moment has been presumed to refer to a continuity of weakness he has been injured not by having his own words as to himself discredited but by having them too well credited where they have been misunderstood it is at any rate the fact that his own account of his own proconsular doings has been accepted in full and that the present reader may be encouraged to believe what extracts i may give to him by the fact that all other readers before him have believed them  from his villa at cumæ on his journey he wrote to atticus in high spirits hortensius had been to see himhis old rival his old predecessor in the glory of the forumhortensius whom he was fated never to see again his only request to hortensius had been that he should assist in taking care that he cicero should not be required to stay above one year in his province atticus is to help him also and another friend furnius who may probably be the tribune for the next year has been canvassed for the same object in a further letter from beneventum he alludes to a third marriage for his daughter tullia but seems to be aware that as he is leaving italy he cannot interfere in that matter himself he writes again from venusia saying that he purports to see pompey at tarentum before he starts and gives special instructions to atticus as to the payment of a debt which is due by him to cæsar he has borrowed money of cæsar and is specially anxious that the debt should be settled in another letter from tarentum he presses the same matter he is anxious to be relieved from the obligation74  from athens he wrote again to his friend a letter which is chiefly remarkable as telling us something of the quarrel between marcus claudius marcellus who was one of the consuls for the year and cæsar who was still absent in gaul this marcellus and others of his family who succeeded him in his office were hotly opposed to cæsar belonging to that party of the state to which cicero was attached and to which pompey was returning75 it seems to have been the desire of the consul not only to injure but to insult cæsar he had endeavored to get a decree of the senate for recalling cæsar at once but had succeeded only in having his proposition postponed for consideration in the following yearwhen cæsar would naturally return but to show how little was his regard to cæsar he caused to be flogged in rome a citizen from one of those towns of cisalpine gaul to which cæsar had assumed to give the privilege of roman citizenship the man was present as a delegate from his town novocomum76the present comoin furtherance of the colonys claims and the consul had the man flogged to show thereby that he was not a roman marcellus was punished for his insolence by banishment inflicted by cæsar when cæsar was powerful we shall learn before long how cicero made an oration in his favor but in the letter written from athens he blames marcellus much for flogging the man77 fight in my behalf he says in the course of this letter for if my government be prolonged i shall fail and become mean the idea of absence from rome is intolerable to him from athens also he wrote to his young friend cælius from whom he had requested information as to what was going on in rome but cælius has to be again instructed as to the nature of the subjects which are to be regarded as interesting whatdo you think that i have asked you to send me stories of gladiators lawcourt adjournments and the pilferings of christustrash that no one would think of mentioning to me if i were in rome78 but he does not finish his letter to cælius without begging cælius to assist in bringing about his speedy recall cælius troubles him much afterward by renewed requests for cilician panthers wanted for Ædilian shows cicero becomes very seasick on his journey and then reaches ephesus in asia minor dating his arrival there on the five hundred and sixtieth day from the battle of bovilla showing how much the contest as to milo still clung to his thoughts79 ephesus was not in his province but at ephesus all the magistrates came out to do him honor as though he had come among them as their governor now has arrived he says the time to justify all those declarations which i have made as to my own conduct but i trust i can practise the lessons which i have learned from you atticus in his full admiration of his friends character had doubtless said much to encourage and to instigate the virtue which it was ciceros purpose to employ we have none of the words ever written by atticus to cicero but we have light enough to show us that the one friend was keenly alive to the honor of the other and thoroughly appreciated its beauty do not let me be more than a year away he exclaims do not let even another month be added80 then there is a letter from cælius praying for panthers81 in passing through the province of asia to his own province he declares that the people everywhere receive him well my coming he says has cost no man a shilling82 his whole staff has now joined him except one tullius whom he speaks of as a friend of atticus but afterward tells us he had come to him from titinius then he again enjoins atticus to have that money paid to cæsar from tralles still in the province of asia he writes to appius the outgoing governor a letter full of courtesies and expressing an anxious desire for a meeting he had offered before to go by any route which might suit appius but appius as appears afterward was anxious for anything rather than to encounter the new governor within the province he was leaving83  on 31st july he reached laodicea within his own boundaries having started on his journey on 10th may and found all people glad to see him but the little details of his office harass him sadly the action of my mind which you know so well cannot find space enough all work worthy of my industry is at an end i have to preside at laodicea while some plotius is giving judgment at rome    and then am i not regretting at every moment the life of romethe forum the city itself my own house am i not always regretting you i will endeavor to bear it for a year but if it be prolonged then it will be all over with me    you ask me how i am getting on i am spending a fortune in carrying out this grand advice of yours i like it hugely but when the time comes for paying you your debts i shall have to renew the bill    to make me do such work as this is putting a saddle upon a cowcutting a block with a razor as we should sayclearly i am not made for it but i will bear it so that it be only for one year84  from laodicea a town in phrygia he went west to synnada his province known as cilicia contained the districts named on the map of asia minor as phrygia pisidia pamphylia part of cappadocia cilicia and the island of cyprus he soon found that his predecessors had ruined the people know that i have come into a province utterly and forever destroyed he says to atticus85 we hear only of taxes that cannot be paid of mens chattels sold on all sides of the groans from the cities of lamentations of horrors such as some wild beast might have produced rather than a human being there is no room for question every man is tired of his life and yet some relief is given now because of me and by my officers and by my lieutenants no expense is imposed on any one we do not take even the hay which is allowed by the julian lawnot even the wood four beds to lie on is all we accept and a roof over our heads in many places not even that for we live in our tents enormous crowds therefore come to us and return as it were to life through the justice and moderation of your cicero appius when he knew that i was come ran away to tarsus the farthest point of the province what a picture we have here of the state of a roman dependency under a normal roman governor and of the good which a man could do who was able to abstain from plunder in his next letter his pride expresses itself so loudly that we have to remember that this man after all is writing only his own secret thoughts to his bosom friend if i can get away from this quickly the honors which will accrue to me from my justice will be all the greater as happened to scævola who was governor in asia only for nine months86 then again he declares how appius had escaped into the farthest corner of the provinceto tarsuswhen he knew that cicero was coming  he writes again to appius complaining when i compare my conduct to yours he says i own that i much prefer my own87 he had taken every pains to meet appius in a manner convenient to him but had been deceived on every side appius had in a way unusual among roman governors carried on his authority in remote parts of the province although he had known of his successors arrival cicero assures him that he is quite indifferent to this if appius will relieve him of one months labor out of the twelve he will be delighted but why has appius taken away three of the fullest cohorts seeing that in the entire province the number of soldiers left has been so small but he assures appius that as he makes his journey neither good nor bad shall hear evil spoken by him of his predecessor but as for you you seem to have given to the dishonest reasons for thinking badly of me then he describes the exact course he means to take in his further journey thus giving appius full facility for avoiding him  from cybistra in cappadocia he writes official letters to caius marcellus who had been just chosen consul the brother of marcus the existing consul to an older caius marcellus who was their father a colleague of his own in the college of augurs and to marcus the existing consul with his congratulations also to Æmilius paulus who had also been elected consul for the next year he writes also a despatch to the consuls to the prætors to the tribunes and to the senate giving them a statement as to affairs in the province these are interesting rather as showing the way in which these things were done than by their own details when he reaches cilicia proper he writes them another despatch telling them that the parthians had come across the euphrates he writes as wellington may have done from torres vedras he bids them look after the safety of their eastern dominions though they are too late in doing this yet better now than never88 you know he says with what sort of an army you have supported me here and you know also that i have undertaken this duty not in blind folly but because in respect for the republic i have not liked to refuse    as for our allies here in the province because our rule here has been so severe and injurious they are either too weak to help us or so embittered against us that we dare not trust them  then there is a long letter to appius89 respecting the embassy which was to be sent from the province to rome to carry the praises of the departing governor and declare his excellence as a proconsul this was quite the usual thing to do the worse the governor the more necessary the embassy and such was the terror inspired even by a departing roman and such the servility of the allieseven of those who were about to escape from himthat these embassies were a matter of course there had been a sicilian embassy to praise verres appius had complained as though cicero had impeded this legation by restricting the amount to be allowed for its expenses he rebukes appius for bringing the charge against him  the series of letters written this year by cælius to cicero is very interesting as giving us a specimen of continued correspondence other than ciceronian we have among the eight hundred and eightyfive letters ten or twelve from brutus if those attributed to him were really written by him ten or twelve from decimus brutus and an equal number from plancus but these were written in the stirring moments of the last struggle and are official or military rather than familiar we have a few from quintus but not of special interest unless we are to consider that treatise on the duties of a candidate as a letter but these from cælius to his older friend are genuine and natural as those from cicero himself there are seventeen they are scattered over three or four years but most of them refer to the period of ciceros provincial government  the marvel to me is that cælius should have adopted a style so near akin to that of his master in literature scholars who have studied the words can probably tell us of deficiencies in language but the easy graphic tone is to my ear ciceronian tiro who was slave secretary freedman and then literary executor may have had the handling of these letters and have done something toward producing their literary excellence the subjects selected were not always good and must occasionally have produced in ciceros own mind a repetition of the reprimand which he once expressed as to the gladiatorial shows and lawcourt adjournments but cælius does communicate much of the political news from rome in one letter written in october of this year he declares what the senate has decreed as to the recall of cæsar from gaul and gives the words of the enactments made with the names subscribed to them of the promotersand also the names of the tribunes who had endeavored to oppose them90 the purport of these decrees i have mentioned before the object was to recall cæsar and the effect was to postpone any such recall till it would mean nothing but cælius specially declares that the intention of recalling cæsar was agreeable to pompey whereby we may know that the pact of the triumvirate was already at an end in another letter he speaks of the coming of the parthians and of ciceros inability to fight with them because of the inadequate number of soldiers intrusted to him had there been a real roman army then cælius would have been afraid he says for his friends life as it is he fears only for his reputation lest men should speak ill of him for not fighting when to fight was beyond his power91 the language here is so pretty that i am tempted to think that tiro must have had a hand in it at rome we must remember the tidings as to crassus were as yet uncertain we cannot however doubt that cælius was in truth attached to cicero  but cicero was forced to fight not altogether unwillinglynot with the parthians but with tribes which were revolting from roman authority because of the parthian success it has turned out as you wished it he says to cæliusa job just sufficient to give me a small coronet of laurel hearing that men had risen in the taurus range of mountains which divided his province from that of syria in which bibulus was now governor he had taken such an army as he was able to collect to the amanus a mountain belonging to that range and was now writing from his camp at pindenissum a place beyond his own province joking at his own soldiering he tells cælius that he had astonished those around him by his prowess is this he whom we used to know in the city is this our talkative senator you can understand the things they said92    when i got to the amanus i was glad enough to find our friend cassius had beaten back the real parthians from antioch but cicero claims to have done some gallant things i have harassed those men of amanus who are always troubling us many i have killed some i have taken the rest are dispersed i came suddenly upon their strongholds and have got possession of them i was called imperator at the river issus it is hardly necessary to explain yet once again that this title belonged properly to no commander till it had been accorded to him by his own soldiers on the field of battle93 he reminds cælius that it was on the issus that alexander had conquered darius then he had sat down before pindenissum with all the machinery of a siegewith the turrets covered ways and ramparts he had not as yet quite taken the town when he had done so he would send home his official account of it all but the parthians may yet come and there may be danger therefore o my rufushe was cælius rufussee that i am not left here lest as you suspect things should go badly with me there is a mixture in all this of earnestness and of drollery of boasting and of laughing at what he was doing which is inimitable in its reality his next letter is to his other young friend curio who has just been elected tribune he gives much advice to curio who certainly always needed it94 he carries on the joke when he tells atticus that the people of pindenissum have surrendered who the mischief are these pindenissians you will say i have not even heard the name before what would you have i cannot make an Ætolia out of cilicia with such an army as this do you expect me to do things like a macedonicus95    i had my camp on the issus where alexander had hisa better soldier no doubt than you or i i really have made a name for myself in syria then up comes bibulus determined to be as good as i am but he loses his whole cohort the failure made by bibulus at soldiering is quite as much to him as his own success then he goes back to laodicea leaving the army in winterquarters under the command of his brother quintus  but his heart is truly in other matters and he bursts out in the same letter with enthusiastic praise of the line of conduct which atticus has laid down for him but that which is more to me than anything is that i should live so that even that fellow cato cannot find fault with me may i die if it could be done better nor do i take praise for it as though i was doing something distasteful i never was so happy as in practising this moderation the thing itself is better to me even than the reputation of it what would you have me say it was worth my while to be enabled thus to try myself so that i might know myself as to what i could do  then there is a long letter to cato in which he repeats the story of his grand doings at pindenissum the reader will be sure that a letter to cato cannot be sincere and pleasant as are those to atticus and cælius if there be one man far removed from the vulgar love of praise it is i he says to cato96 he tells cato that they two are alike in all things they two only have succeeded in carrying the true ancient philosophy into the practice of the forum never surely were two men more unlike than the stiffnecked cato and the versatile cicero  sidenote bc 50 ætat 57  lucius Æmilius paullus and c clodius marcellus were consuls for the next year cicero writes to both of them with tenders of friendship but from both of them he asks that they should take care to have a decree of the senate passed praising his doings in cilicia97 with us too a returning governor is anxious enough for a good word from the primeminister but he does not ask for it so openly the next letter from cælius tells him that appius has been accused as to malpractices in his government and that pompey is in favor of appius curio has gone over to cæsar but the important subject is the last handled it will be mean in you if i should have no greek panthers98 the next refers to the marriages and divorces of certain ladies and ends with an anecdote told as to a gentleman with just such illnatured wit as is common in london no one could have suspected ocella of looking after his neighbors wife unless he had been detected thrice in the fact99  from laodicea he answers a querulous letter which his predecessor had written complaining among other things that cicero had failed to show him personal respect he proves that he had not done so and then rises to a strain of indignation do you think that your grand old names will affect me who even before i had become great in the service of my country knew how to distinguish between titles and the men who bore them100  the next letter to appius is full of flattery and asking for favors but it begins with a sharp reproof now at last i have received an epistle worthy of appius claudius the sight of rome has restored you to your goodhumor those i got from you in your journey were such that i could not read them without displeasure101  in february cicero wrote a letter to atticus which is i think more expressive in describing the mind of the man than any other which we have from him in it is commenced the telling of a story respecting brutusthe brutus we all know so welland one scaptius of whom no one would have heard but for this story which as it deeply affects the character of cicero must occupy a page or two in our narrative but i must first refer to his own account of his own government as again given here nothing was ever so wonderful to the inhabitants of a province as that they should not have been put to a shilling of expense since he had entered it not a penny had been taken on his own behalf or on that of the republic by any belonging to him except on one day by one tullius and by him indeed under cover of the law this dirty fellow was a follower with whom titinius had furnished him when he was passing from tarsus back into the centre of his province wondering crowds came out to him the people not understanding how it had been that no letters had been sent to them exacting money and that none of his staff had been quartered on them in former years during the winter months they had groaned under exactions municipalities with money at their command had paid large sums to save themselves from the quartering of soldiers on them the island of cyprus which on a former occasion had been made to pay nearly £50000 on this head102 had been asked for nothing by him he had refused to have any honors paid to him in return for this conduct he had prohibited the erection of statues shrines and bronze chariots in his namecompliments to roman generals which had become common the harvest that year was bad but so fully convinced were the people of his honest dealing that they who had saved up cornthe regratersbrought it freely into market at his coming as some scourge from hell must have been the presence of such governors as appius and his predecessors among a people timid but industrious like these asiatic greeks like an unknown unexpected blessing direct from heaven must have been the coming of a cicero  now i will tell the story of brutus and scaptius and their moneypremising that it has been told by mr forsyth with great accuracy and studied fairness indeed there is not a line in mr forsyths volume which is not governed by a spirit of justice he having thought that cicero had been too highly praised by middleton and too harshly handled by subsequent critics has apparently written his book with the object of setting right these exaggerations but in his comments on this matter of brutus and scaptius he seems to me not to have considered the difference in that standard of honor and honesty which governs himself and that which prevailed in the time of cicero not seeing as i think how impossible it was for a roman governor to have achieved that impartiality of justice with which a long course of fortunate training has imbued an english judge he accuses cicero of trifling with equity the marvel to me is that one man such as ciceroa man single in his purposeshould have been able to raise his own ideas of justice so high above the level prevailing with the best of those around him it had become the nature of a roman aristocrat to pillage an ally till hardly the skin should be left to cover the mans bones out of this nature cicero elevated himself completely in his own conduct he was free altogether from stain the question here arose how far he could dare to go on offending the instincts the habits the nature of other noble romans in protecting from their rapacity the poor subjects who were temporarily beneath his charge it is easy for a judge to stand indifferent between a great man and a little when the feelings of the world around him are in favor of such impartiality but it must have been hard enough to do so when such conduct seemed to the noblest romans of the day to be monstrous fanatical and pretentious  in this case brutus our old friend whom all english readers have so much admired because he dared to tell his brotherinlaw cassius that he was    much condemned to have an itching palm  appears before us in the guise of an usurious moneylender it would be hard in the history of usury to come across the wellascertained details of a more grasping griping usurer his practice had been of the kind which we may have been accustomed to hear rebuked with the scathing indignation of our just judges but yet brutus was accounted one of the noblest romans of the day only second if second to cato in general virtue and philosophy in this trade of moneylending the roman nobleman had found no more lucrative business than that of dealing with the municipalities of the allies the cities were peopled by a moneymaking commercial race but they were subjected to the grinding impositions of their governors under this affliction they were constantly driven to borrow money and found the capitalists who supplied it among the class by whom they were persecuted and pillaged a brutus lent the money which an appius exactedand did not scruple to do so at fortyeight per cent although twelve per cent per annum or one per cent per month was the rate of interest permitted by law  but a noble roman such as brutus did not carry on his business of this nature altogether in his own name brutus dealt with the municipality of salamis in the island of cyprus and there had two agents named scaptius and matinius whom he specially recommended to cicero as creditors of the city of salamis praying cicero as governor of the province to assist these men in obtaining the payment of their debts103 this was quite usual but it was only late in the transaction that cicero became aware that the man really looking for his money was the noble roman who gave the recommendation ciceros letter tells us that scaptius came to him and that he promised that for brutuss sake he would take care that the people of salamis should pay their debt104 scaptius thanked him and asked for an official position in salamis which would have given him the power of compelling the payment by force cicero refused explaining that he had determined to give no such offices in his province to persons engaged in trade he had refused such requests alreadyeven to pompey and to torquatus appius had given the same man a military command in salamisno doubt also at the instance of brutusand the people of salamis had been grievously harassed cicero had heard of this and had recalled the man from cyprus of this scaptius had complained bitterly and at last he and delegates from salamis who were willing to pay their debt if they could only do it without too great extortion went together to cicero who was then at tarsus in the most remote part of his province here he was called upon to adjudicate in the matter scaptius trusting to the influence which brutus would naturally have with his friend the governor and the men of salamis to the reputation for justice which cicero had already created for himself in cilicia the reader must also be made to understand that cicero had been entreated by atticus to oblige brutus who was specially the friend of atticus he must remember also that this narrative is sent by cicero to atticus who exhorted his correspondent even with tears in his eyes to be true to his honor in the government of his province105 he is appealing from atticus to atticus i am bound to oblige youbut how can i do so in opposition to your own lessons that is his argument to atticus  then there arises a question as to the amount of money due the principal is not in dispute but the interest the money has been manifestly lent on an understanding that four per cent per month or fortyeight per cent per annum should be charged on it but there has been a law passed that higher interest than one per cent per month or twelve per cent per annum shall not be legal there has however been a counter decree made in regard to these very salaminians and made apparently at the instigation of brutus saying that any contract with them shall be held in force notwithstanding the law but cicero again has made a decree that he will authorize no exaction above twelve per cent in his province the exact condition of the legal claim is less clear to me than to mr forsyth who has the advantage of being a lawyer be that as it may cicero decides that twelve per cent shall be exacted and orders the salaminians to pay the amount to his request they demur but at last agree to obey alleging that they are enabled to do so by ciceros own forbearance to them cicero having declined to accept the presents which had been offered to him from the island106 they will therefore pay this money in some sort as they say out of the governors own pocket  but when the sum is fixed scaptius finding that he cannot get it overreckoned after some fraudulent scheme of his own declines to receive it if with the assistance of a friendly governor he cannot do better than that for himself and his employer things must be going badly with roman noblemen but the delegates are now very anxious to pay this money and offer to deposit it scaptius begs that the affair shall go no farther at present no doubt thinking that he may drive a better bargain with some less rigid future governor the delegates request to be allowed to place their money as paid in some temple by doing which they would acquit themselves of all responsibility but cicero begs them to abstain impetravi ab salaminiis ut silerent he says i shall be grieved indeed that brutus should be angry with me he writes but much more grieved that brutus should have proved himself to be such as i shall have found him  then comes the passage in his letter on the strength of which mr forsyth has condemned cicero not without abstract truth in his condemnation they indeed have consentedthat is the salaminiansbut what will befall them if some such governor as paulus should come here and all this i have done for the sake of brutus Æmilius paulus was the consul and might probably have cilicia as a province and would no doubt give over the salaminians to brutus and his myrmidons without any compunction in strictnesswith that assurance in the power of law by means of which our judges are enabled to see that their righteous decisions shall be carried out without detriment to themselvescicero should have caused the delegates from salamis instantly to have deposited their money in the temple instead of doing so he had only declared the amount due according to his idea of justicein opposition to all romans even to atticusand had then consented to leave the matter as for some further appeal do we not know how impossible it is for a man to abide strictly by the right when the strict right is so much in advance of all around him as to appear to other eyes than his own as straitlaced unpractical fantastic and almost inhuman brutus wanted his money sorely and brutus was becoming a great political power on the same side with pompey and cato and the other optimates even atticus was interfering for brutus what other roman governor of whom we have heard would have made a question on the subject appius had lent a guard of horsesoldiers to this scaptius with which he had outraged all humanity in cyprushad caused the councillors of the city to be shut up till they would come to obedience in doing which he had starved five of them to death nothing had come of this such being the way with the romans in their provinces yet cicero who had come among these poor wretches as an unheardof blessing from heaven is held up to scorn because he trifled with equity equity with us runs glibly on all fours with appius in cilicia it was utterly unknown what are we to say of the man who by the strength of his own conscience and by the splendor of his own intellect could advance so far out of the darkness of his own age and bring himself so near to the light of ours  let us think for a moment of our own francis bacon a man more like to cicero than any other that i can remember in history they were both great lawyers both statesmen both men affecting the omne scibile and coming nearer to it than perhaps any other whom we can name both patriots true to their conceived idea of government each having risen from obscure position to great power to wealth and to rank each from his own education and his nature prone to compromise intimate with human nature not overscrupulous either as to others or as to himself they were men intellectually above those around them to a height of which neither of them was himself aware to flattery to admiration to friendship and to love each of them was peculiarly susceptible but one failed to see that it behooved him because of his greatness to abstain from taking what smaller men were grasping while the other swore to himself from his very outset that he would abstainand kept the oath which he had sworn i am one who would fain forgive bacon for doing what i believe that others did around him but if i can find a man who never robbed though all others around him didin whose heart the auri sacra fames had been absolutely quenched while the men with whom he had to live were sickening and dying with an unnatural cravingthen i seem to have recognized a hero  another complaint is made against cicero as to ariobarzanes the king of cappadocia and is founded as are all complaints against cicero on ciceros own telling of the story in question why there should have been complaint in this matter i have not been able to discover ariobarzanes was one of those eastern kings who became milch cows to the roman nobles and who in their efforts to satisfy the roman nobles could only fleece their own subjects the power of this king to raise money seems to have been limited to about £8000 a month107 out of this he offered a part to cicero as the proconsul who was immediately over him this cicero declined but pressed the king to pay the money to the extortionate brutus who was a creditor and who endeavored to get this money through cicero but pompey also was a creditor and pompeys name was more dreadful to the king than that of brutus pompey therefore got it all though we are told that it was not enough to pay him his interest but pompey getting it all was graciously pleased to be satisfied cnæus noster clementer id fert our cicero puts up with that and asks no questions about the capital says cicero ironically pompey was too wise to kill the goose that laid such golden eggs nevertheless we are told that cicero in this case abused his proconsular authority in favor of brutus cicero effected nothing for brutus but when there was a certain amount of plunder to be divided among the romans refused any share for himself pompey got it all but not by ciceros aid  there is another long letter in which cicero again for the third time tells the story of brutus and scaptius108 i mention it as he continues to describe his own mode of doing his work he has been at laodicea from february to may deciding questions that had been there brought before him from all parts of his province except cilicia proper the cities which had been ground down by debt have been enabled to free themselves and then to live under their own laws this he has done by taking nothing from them for his own expensesnot a farthing it is marvellous to see how the municipalities have sprung again into life under this treatment he has been enabled by this to carry on justice without obstruction and without severity everybody has been allowed approach to hima custom which has been unknown in the provinces there has been no backstairs influence he has walked openly in his own courts as he used to do when a candidate at home all this has been grateful to the people and much esteemed nor has it been too laborious to himself as he had learned the way of it in his former life it was thus that cicero governed cilicia  there are further letters to appius and cælius written from various parts of the province which cannot fail to displease us because we feel that cicero is endeavoring to curry favor he wishes to stand well with those who might otherwise turn against him on his reappearance in rome he is afraid lest appius should be his enemy and lest pompey should not be his friend the practice of justice and of virtue would he knew have much less effect in rome than the friendship and enmity of such men but to atticus he bursts out into honest passion against brutus brutus had recommended to him one gavius whom to oblige brutus he appointed to some office gavius was greedy and insolent when his greed was not satisfied you have made me a prefect said gavius where am i to go for my rations cicero tells him that as he has done no work he will get no pay whereupon gavius quite unaccustomed to such treatment goes off in a huff if brutus can be stirred by the anger of such a knave as this he says to atticus you may love him if you will yourself you will not find me a rival for his friendship109 brutus however became a favorite with cicero because he had devoted himself to literature in judging these two men we should not lean too heavily on brutus because he did no worse than his neighbors but then how are we to judge of cicero  in the latter months of his government there began a new trouble in which it is difficult to sympathize with him because we are unable to produce in our own minds a romans estimation of roman things with true spirit he had laughed at his own military doings at pindenissum but not the less on that account was he anxious to enjoy the glories of a triumph and to be dragged through the city on a chariot with military trophies around him as from time immemorial the roman conquerors had been dragged when they returned from their victories  for the old barbaric conquerors this had been fine enough a display of armorof helmets of shields and of swordsa concourse of chariots of trumpets and of slaves of victims kept for the tarpeian rock the spoils and rapine of battle the selfasserting glory of the big fighting hero the pride of bloodshed and the boasting over fallen cities had been fit for men who had in their hearts conceived nothing greater than military renown our sympathies go along with a camillus or a scipio steeped in the blood of romes enemies a marius a pompey and again a few years afterward a cæsar were in their places as they were dragged along the via sacra up to the capitol amid the plaudits of the city in commemoration of their achievements in arms but it could not be so with cicero concedat laurea linguæ had been the watchword of his life let the ready tongue and the fertile brain be held in higher honor than the strong right arm that had been the doctrine which he had practised successfully to him it had been given to know that the lawyers gown was raiment worthier of a man than the soldiers breastplate how then could it be that he should ask for so small a thing as a triumph in reward for so small a deed as that done at pindenissum but it had become the way with all proconsuls who of late years had been sent forth from rome into the provinces men to whose provincial government a few cohorts were attached aspired to be called imperator by their soldiers after mock battles and thought that as others had followed up their sham victories with sham triumphs it should be given to them to do the same if bibulus triumphed it would be a disgrace to cicero not to triumph we measure our expected rewards not by our own merits but by the good things which have been conceded to others to have returned from pindenissum and not to be allowed the glory of trumpets would be a disgrace in accordance with the theory then prevailing in rome on such matters therefore cicero demanded a triumph  in such a matter it was in accordance with custom that the general should send an immediate account of his victorious doings demand a supplication and have the triumph to be decreed to him or not after his return home a supplication was in form a thanksgiving to the gods for the great favor shown by them to the state but in fact took the guise of public praise bestowed upon the man by whose hands the good had been done it was usually a reward for military success but in the affair of catiline a supplication had been decreed to cicero for saving the city though the service rendered had been of a civil nature cicero now applied for a supplication and obtained it cato opposed it and wrote a letter to cicero explaining his motivesupon high republican principles cicero might have endured this more easily had not cato voted for a supplication in honor of bibulus whose military achievements had as cicero thought been less than his own one hirrus opposed it also but in silence having intended to allege that the numbers slain by cicero in his battles were not sufficient to justify a supplication we learn that according to strict rule two thousand dead men should have been left on the field ciceros victims had probably been much fewer nevertheless the supplication was granted and cicero presumed that the triumph would follow as a matter of course alas there came grievous causes to interfere with the triumph  of all that went on at rome cælius continued to send cicero accounts the triumvirate was now over cælius says that pompey will not attack cæsar openly but that he does all he can to prevent cæsar from being elected consul before he shall have given up his province and his army110 for details cælius refers him to a commentariuma word which has been translated as meaning newspaper in this passageby melmoth i think that there is no authority for this idea and that the commentary was simply the compilation of cælius as were the commentaries we so well know the compilation of cæsar the acta diurna were published by authority and formed an official gazette these no doubt reached cicero but were very different in their nature from the private record of things which he obtained from his friend  there are passages in greek in two letters111 written about this time to atticus which refer to the matter from which probably arose his quarrel with his wife and her divorce he makes no direct allusion to his wife but only to a freedman of hers philotomus when milo was convicted his goods were confiscated and sold as a part of his punishment philotomus is supposed to have been a purchaser and to have made money out of the transactiontaking advantage of his position to acquire cheap bargainsas should not have been done by any one connected with cicero who had been milos friend the cause of ciceros quarrel with his wife has never been absolutely known but it is supposed to have arisen from her want of loyalty to him in regard to money she probably employed this freedman in filling her pockets at the expense of her husbands character  sidenote bc 50 ætat 57  in his own letters he tells of preparations made for his return and allusions are made as to his expected triumph he is grateful to cælius as to what has been done as to the supplication and expresses his confidence that all the rest will follow112 he is so determined to hurry away that he will not wait for the nomination of a successor and resolves to put the government into the hands of any one of his officers who may be least unfit to hold it his brother quintus was his lieutenant but if he left quintus people would say of him that in doing so he was still keeping the emoluments in his own hands at last he determines to intrust it to a young quæstor named c cæliusno close connection of his friend cælius as cicero finds himself obliged to apologize for the selection to his friend young you will say no doubt but he had been elected quæstor and is of noble birth113 so he gives over the province to the young man having no one else fitter  cicero tells us afterward when at athens on his way home that he had considerable trouble with his own people on withholding certain plunder which was regarded by them as their perquisite he had boasted much of their conducthaving taken exception to one tullius who had demanded only a little hay and a little wood but now there came to be pickingssavings out of his own proconsular expensesto part with which at the last moment was too hard upon them how difficult is virtue he exclaims how doubly difficult to pretend to act up to it when it is not felt114 there had been a certain sum saved which he had been proud to think that he would return to the treasury but the satellites were all in arms ingemuit nostra cohors nevertheless he disregarded the cohort and paid the money into the treasury  as to the sum thus saved there has been a dispute which has given rise to some most amusing literary vituperation the care with which mss have been read now enables us to suppose that it was ten hundred thousand sestercesthus expressed hsxamounting to something over £8000 we hear elsewhere as will be mentioned again that cicero realized out of his own legitimate allowance in cilicia a profit of about £18000 and we may imagine that the cohort should think itself aggrieved in losing £8000 which they expected to have divided among them middleton has made a mistake having supposed the x to be cic or ma thousand instead of tenand quotes the sum saved as having amounted to eight hundred thousand instead of eight thousand pounds we who have had so much done for us by intervening research and are but ill entitled to those excuses for error which may fairly be put forward on middletons behalf should be slow indeed in blaming him for an occasional mistake seeing how he has relieved our labors by infinite toil on his part but de quincey who has been very rancorous against cicero has risen to a fury of wrath in his denunciation of ciceros great biographer conyers middleton he says is a name that cannot be mentioned without an expression of disgust the cause of this was that middleton a beneficed clergyman of the church of england and a cambridge man differed from other cambridge clergymen on controversial points and church questions bentley was his great opponentand as bentley was a stout fighter so was middleton middleton on the whole got the worst of it because bentley was the stronger combatant but he seems to have stood in good repute all his life and when advanced in years was appointed professor of natural history he is known to us however only as the biographer of cicero of this book monk the biographer of middletons great opponent bentley declares that for elegance purity and ease middletons style yields to none in the english language de quincey says of it that by weeding away from it whatever is colloquial you would strip it of all that is characteristicmeaning i suppose that the work altogether wants dignity of composition this charge is to my thinking so absolutely contrary to the fact that it needs only to be named to be confuted by the opinion of all who have read the work de quincey pounces upon the abovenamed error with profoundest satisfaction and tells us a pleasant little story about an old woman who thought that four million people had been once collected at caernarvon middleton had found the figure wrongly deciphered and wrongly copied for him and had translated it as he found it without much thought de quincey thinks that the error is sufficient to throw over all faith in the book it is in the light of an evidence against middletons goodsense and thoughtfulness that i regard it as capital that is de quinceys estimate of middleton as a biographer i regard him as a laborer who spared himself no trouble who was enabled by his nature to throw himself with enthusiasm into his subject who knew his work as a writer of english and who by a combination of erudition intelligence and industry has left us one of those books of which it may truly be said that no english library should be without it  the last letter written by cicero in asia was sent to atticus from ephesus the day before he startedon the last day namely of september he had been delayed by winds and by want of vessels large enough to carry him and his suite news here reached him from romenews which was not true in its details but true enough in its spirit in a letter to atticus he speaks of miros terrores cæsarianos115dreadful reports as to outrages by cæsar that he would by no means dismiss his army that he had with him the prætors elect one of the tribunes and even one of the consuls and that pompey had resolved to leave the city such were the first tidings presaging pharsalia then he adds a word about his triumph tell me what you think about this triumph which my friends desire me to seek i should not care about it if bibulus were not also asking for a triumphbibulus who never put a foot outside his own doors as long as there was an enemy in syria thus cicero had to suffer untold misery because bibulus was asking for a triumph     chapter v  the war between cÆsar and pompey   what official arrangements were made for proconsuls in regard to money when in command of a province we do not know the amounts allowed were no doubt splendid but it was not to them that the roman governor looked as the source of that fortune which he expected to amass the means of plunder were infinite but of plunder always subject to the danger of an accusation we remember how verres calculated that he could divide his spoil into three sufficient partsone for the lawyers one for the judges so as to insure his acquittal and then one for himself this plundering was commonso common as to have become almost a matter of course but it was illegal and subjected some unfortunate culprits to exile and to the disgorging of a part of what they had taken no accusation was made against cicero as to others there were constantly threats if no more than threats cicero was not even threatened but he had saved out of his legitimate expenses a sum equal to £18000 of our moneyfrom which we may learn how noble were the appanages of a roman governor the expenses of all his staff passed through his own hands and many of those of his army any saving effected would therefore be to his own personal advantage on this money he counted much when his affairs were in trouble as he was going to join pompey at pharsalia in the following year he then begged atticus to arrange his matters for him telling him that the sum was at his call in asia116 but he never saw it again pompey borrowed itor took it and when pompey had been killed the money was of course gone  his brother quintus was with him in cilicia but of his brothers doings there he says little or nothing we have no letters from him during the period to his wife or daughter the latter was married to her third husband dolabella during his absence with no opposition from cicero but not in accordance with his advice he had purposed to accept a proposition for her hand made to him by tiberius nero the young roman nobleman who afterward married that livia whom augustus took away from him even when she was pregnant in order that he might marry her himself and who thus became the father of the emperor tiberius it is worthy of remark at the same time that the emperor tiberius married the granddaughter of atticus cicero when in cilicia had wished that nero should be chosen but the family at home was taken by the fashion and manners of dolabella and gave the young widow to him as her third husband when she was yet only twentyfive this marriage like the others was unfortunate dolabella though fashionable nobly born agreeable and probably handsome was thoroughly worthless he was a roman nobleman of the type then commonheartless extravagant and greedy his country his party his politics were subservient not to ambition or love of power but simply to a desire for plunder cicero tried hard to love him partly for his daughters sake more perhaps from the necessity which he felt for supporting himself by the power and strength of the aristocratic party to which dolabella belonged  i cannot bring him back to rome and all that he suffered there without declaring that much of his correspondence during his government especially during the latter months of it and the period of his journey home is very distressing i have told the story of his own doings i think honestly and how he himself abstained and compelled those belonging to him to do so how he strove to ameliorate the condition of those under his rule how he fully appreciated the duty of doing well by others so soon to be recognized by all christians such humanity on the part of a roman at such a period is to me marvellous beautiful almost divine but in eschewing roman greed and roman cruelty he was unable to eschew roman insincerity i have sometimes thought that to have done so it must have been necessary for him altogether to leave public life why not my readers will say but in our days when a man has mixed himself for many years with all that is doing in public how hard it is for him to withdraw even though in withdrawing he fears no violence no punishment no exile no confiscation the arguments the prayers the reproaches of those around him draw him back and the arguments the reproaches from within are more powerful even than those from his friends to be added to these is the scorn perhaps the ridicule of his opponents such are the difficulties in the way of the modern politician who thinks that he has resolved to retire but the roman exconsul exprætor exgovernor had entered upon a mode of warfare in which his all his life his property his choice of country his wife his children were open to the ready attacks of his eager enemies to have deserved well would be nothing unless he could keep a party round him bound by mutual interests to declare that he had deserved well a rich man who desired to live comfortably beyond the struggle of public life had to abstain as atticus had done from increasing the sores from hurting the ambition from crushing the hopes of aspirants such a man might be safe but he could not be useful such at any rate had not been ciceros life in his earlier days till he was consul he had kept himself free from political interference in doing the work of his life but since that time he had necessarily put himself into competition with many men and had made many enemies by the courage of his opinions he had found even those he had most trusted opposed to him he had aroused the jealousy not only of the cæsars and the crassuses and the pisos but also of the pompeys and catos and brutuses whom was he not compelled to fear and yet he could not escape to his books nor in truth did he wish it he had made for himself a nature which he could not now control  he had not been long in cilicia before he knew well how cruel how dishonest how greedy how thoroughly roman had been the conduct of his predecessor appius his letters to atticus are full of the truths which he had to tell on that matter his conduct too with regard to appius was mainly right as far as in him lay he endeavored to remedy the evils which the unjust proconsul had done and to stop what further evil was still being done he did not hesitate to offend appius when it was necessary to do so by his interference but appius was a great nobleman one of the optimates a man with a strong party at his back in rome appius knew well that ciceros good word was absolutely necessary to save him from the ruin of a successful accusation cicero knew also that the support of appius would be of infinite service to him in his roman politics knowing this he wrote to appius letters full of flatteryfull of falsehood if the plain word can serve our purpose better dolabella the new soninlaw had taken upon himself for some reason as to which it can hardly be worth our while to inquire to accuse appius of malversation in his province that appius deserved condemnation there can be no doubt but in these accusations the contests generally took place not as to the proof of the guilt but as to the prestige and power of the accuser and the accused appius was tried twice on different charges and was twice acquitted but the fact that his soninlaw should be the accuser was fraught with danger to cicero he thought it necessary for the hopes which he then entertained to make appius understand that his soninlaw was not acting in concert with him and that he was desirous that appius should receive all the praise which would have been due to a good governor so great was the influence of appius at rome that he was not only acquitted but shortly afterward elected censor the office of censor was in some respects the highest in rome the censors were elected only once in four years remaining in office for eighteen months the idea was that powers so arbitrary as these should be in existence only for a year and a half out of each four years questions of morals were considered by them should a senator be held to have lived as did not befit a senator a censor could depose him as appius was elected censor immediately after his acquittal together with that piso whom cicero had so hated it may be understood that his influence was very great117 it was great enough to produce from cicero letters which were flattering and false the man who had been able to live with a humanity a moderation and an honesty befitting a christian had not risen to that appreciation of the beauty of truth which an exercise of christianity is supposed to exact  sed quid agas sic vivitur118what would you have me do it is thus we live now this he exclaims in a letter to cælius written a short time before he left the province what would you say if you read my last letter to appius you would open your eyes if you knew how i have flattered appiusthat was his meaning sic viviturit is so we live now when i read this i feel compelled to ask whether there was an opportunity for any other way of living had he seen the baseness of lying as an english christian gentleman is expected to see it and had adhered to truth at the cost of being a martyr his conduct would have been high though we might have known less of it but looking at all the circumstances of the period have we a right to think that he could have done so  from athens on his way home cicero wrote to his wife joining tullias name with hers lux nostra he calls his daughter the very apple of my eye he had already heard from various friends that civil war was expected he will have to declare himself on his arrivalthat is to take one side or the otherand the sooner he does so the better there is some money to be looked fora legacy which had been left to him he gives express directions as to the persons to be employed respecting this omitting the name of that philotomus as to whose honesty he is afraid he calls his wife suavissima et optatissima terentia but he does not write to her with the true love which was expressed by his letters when in exile from athens also where he seems to have stayed nearly two months he wrote in december he is easy he says about his triumph unless cæsar should interferebut he does not care much about his triumph now he is beginning to feel the wearisomeness of the triumph and indeed it was a time in which the utter hollowness of triumphal pretensions must have made the idea odious to him but to have withdrawn would have been to have declared his own fears his own doubts his own inferiority to the two men who were becoming declared as the rival candidates for roman power we may imagine that at such a time he would gladly have gone in quiet to his roman mansion or to one of his villas ridding himself forever of the trouble of his lictors his fasces and all the paraphernalia of imperatorial dignity but a man cannot rid himself of such appanages without showing that he has found it necessary to do so it was the theory of a triumph that the victorious imperator should come home hot as it were from the battlefield with all his martial satellites around him and have himself carried at once through rome it was barbaric and grand as i have said before but it required the martial satellites tradition had become law and the imperator intending to triumph could not dismiss his military followers till the ceremony was over in this way cicero was sadly hampered by his lictors when on his landing at brundisium he found that italy was already preparing for her great civil war  sidenote bc 50 ætat 57  early in this year it had been again proposed in the senate that cæsar should give up his command at this time the two consuls l Æmilius paulus and c claudius marcellus were opposed to cæsar as was also curio who had been one of ciceros young friends and was now tribune but two of these cæsar managed to buy by the payment of enormous bribes curio was the more important of the two and required the larger bribe the story comes to us from appian119 but the modern reader will find it efficiently told by mommsen120 the consul had fifteen hundred talents or about £500000 the sum named as that given by cæsar to curio was something greater because he was so deeply in debt bribes to the amount of above a million of money such as money is to us now bestowed upon two men for their support in the senate it was worth a mans while to be a consul or a tribune in those days but the money was well earnedplunder no doubt extracted from gaul the senate decided that both pompey and cæsar should be required to abandon their commandsor rather they adopted a proposal to that effect without any absolute decree but this sufficed for cæsar who was only anxious to be relieved from the necessity of obeying any order from the senate by the knowledge that pompey also was ordered and also was disobedient then it wasin the summer of this yearthat the two commanders were desired by the senate to surrender each of them a legion or about three thousand men under the pretence that the forces were wanted for the parthian war the historians tell us that pompey had lent a legion to cæsar thus giving us an indication of the singular terms on which legions were held by the proconsular officers who commanded them cæsar nobly sends up to rome two legions the one as having been ordered to be restored by himself and the other as belonging to pompey he felt no doubt that a show of nobleness in this respect would do him better service than the withholding of the soldiers the men were stationed at capua instead of being sent to the east and no doubt drifted back into cæsars hands the men who had served under cæsar would not willingly find themselves transferred to pompey  cæsar in the summer came across the alps into cisalpine gaul which as yet had not been legally taken from him and in the autumn sat himself down at ravenna which was still within his province it was there that he had to meditate the crossing of the rubicon and the manifestation of absolute rebellion matters were in this condition when cicero returned to italy and heard the corroboration of the news as to the civil war which had reached him at athens  in a letter written from athens earlier than the one last quoted cicero declared to atticus that it would become him better to be conquered with pompey than to conquer with cæsar121 the opinion here given may be taken as his guiding principle in politics till pompey was no more through all the doubts and vacillations which encumbered him this was the rule not only of his mind but of his heart to him there was no triumvirate the word had never been mentioned to his ears had pompey remained free from cæsar it would have been better the two men had come together and crassus had joined them it was better for him to remain with them and keep them right than to stand away angry and astray as cato had done the question how far cæsar was justified in the position which he had taken up by certain alleged injuries affected cicero less than it has done subsequent inquirers had an attempt been made to recall cæsar illegally was he subjected to wrong by having his command taken away from him before the period had passed for which the people had given it was he refused indulgences to which the greatness of his services entitled himsuch as permission to sue for the consulship while absent from romewhile that and more than that had been granted to pompey all these questions were no doubt hot in debate at the time but could hardly have affected much the judgment of cicero and did not at all affect his conduct nor i think should they influence the opinions of those who now attempt to judge the conduct of cæsar things had gone beyond the domain of law and had fallen altogether into that of potentialities decrees of the senate or votes of the people were alike used as excuses cæsar from the beginning of his career had shown his determination to sweep away as cobwebs the obligations which the law imposed upon him it is surely vain to look for excuses for a mans conduct to the practice of that injustice against him which he has long practised against others shall we forgive a housebreaker because the tools which he has himself invented are used at last upon his own door the modern lovers of cæsar and of cæsarism generally do not seek to wash their hero white after that fashion to them it is enough that the man has been able to trample upon the laws with impunity and to be a law not only to himself but to all the world around him there are some of us who think that such a man let him be ever so greatlet him be ever so just if the infirmities of human nature permit justice to dwell in the breast of such a manwill in the end do more harm than good but they who sit at the feet of the great commanders admire them as having been lawbreaking not lawabiding to say that cæsar was justified in the armed position which he took in northern italy in the autumn of this year is to rob him of his praise i do not suppose that he had meditated any special line of policy during the years of hard work in gaul but i think that he was determined not to relinquish his power and that he was ready for any violence by which he might preserve it  if such was ciceros idea of this manif such the troubled outlook which he took into the circumstances of the empirehe thought probably but little of the legality of cæsars recall what would the consuls do what would curio do what would pompey do and what cæsar it was of this that he thought had lawabiding then been possible he would have been desirous to abide by the law some nearest approach to the law would be the best cæsar had ignored all laws except so far as he could use them for his own purposes pompey in conspiring with cæsar had followed cæsars lead but was desirous of using the law against cæsar when cæsar outstripped him in lawlessness but to cicero there was still some hope of restraining pompey pompey too had been a conspirator but not so notorious a conspirator as cæsar with pompey there would be some bond to the republic with cæsar there could be none therefore it was better for him to fall with pompey than to rise with cæsar that was his conviction till pompey had altogether fallen  his journey homeward is made remarkable by letters to tiro his slave and secretary tiro was taken ill and cicero was obliged to leave him at patræ in greece whence he had come to cicero we do not know or when but he had not probably fallen under his masters peculiar notice before the days of the cilician government as we find that on his arrival at brundisium he writes to atticus respecting him as a person whom atticus had not much known122 but his affection for tiro is very warm and his little solicitudes for the man whom he leaves are charming he is to be careful as to what boat he takes and under what captain he sails he is not to hurry the doctor is to be consulted and well paid cicero himself writes various letters to various persons in order to secure that attention which tiro could not have insured unless so assisted  early in january cicero reached the city but could not enter it because of his still unsettled triumph and cæsar crossed the little river which divided his province from the roman territory the 4th of january is the date given for the former small event for the latter i have seen no precise day named i presume that it was after the 6th as on that day the senate appointed domitian as his successor in his province on this being done the two tribunes antony and cassius hurried off to cæsar and cæsar then probably crossed the stream cicero was appointed to a command in campaniathat of raising levies the duties of which were not officially repugnant to his triumph  his doings during the whole of this time were but little to his credit but who is there whose doings were to his credit at that period the effect had been to take all power out of his hand cæsar had given him up pompey could not do so but we can imagine how willing pompey would have been that he should have remained in cilicia he had been sent there out of the way but had hurried home again if he would only have remained and plundered if he would only have remained there and have been honestso that he would be out of the way but here he wasback in italy an honest upright man no one so utterly unlike the usual roman so lost amid the selfseekers of rome so unnecessarily cleanhanded could be found cato was honest foolishly honest for his time but with cato it was not so difficult to deal as with cicero we can imagine cato wrapping himself up in his robe and being savagely unreasonable cicero was all alive to what was going on in the world but still was honest in the mean time he remained in the neighborhood of naples writing to his wife and daughter writing to tiro writing to atticus and telling us all those details which we now seem to know so wellbecause he has told us in one of his letters to atticus at this time he is sadly in earnest he will die with pompey in italy but what can he do by leaving it he has his lictors with him still oh those dreadful lictors his friendship for cnæus his fear of having to join himself with the coming tyrant oh that you would assist me with your counsel123 he writes again and describes the condition of pompeyof pompey who had been magnus see how prostrate he is he has neither courage counsel men nor industry put aside those things look at his flight from the city his cowardly harangues in the towns his ignorance of his own strength and that of his enemy    cæsar in pursuit of pompey oh sad    will he kill him he exclaims then still to atticus he defends himself he will die for pompey but he does not believe that he can do any good either to pompey or to the republic by a base flight then there is another cause for staying in italy as to which he cannot write this was terentias conduct at the end of one of his letters he tells atticus that with the same lamp by which he had written would he burn that which atticus had sent to him in another he speaks of a greek tutor who has deserted him a certain dionysius and he boils over with anger his letters to atticus about the greek tutor are amusing at this distance of time because they show his eagerness i never knew anything more ungrateful and there is nothing worse than ingratitude124  he heaps his scorn upon pompey it is true indeed that i said that it was better to be conquered with him than to conquer with those others i would indeed but of what pompey was it that i so spoke was it of this one who flies he knows not what nor whom nor whither he will fly125 he writes again the same day pompey had fostered cæsar and then had feared him he had left the city he had lost picenum by his own fault he had betaken himself to apulia then he went into greece leaving us in the dark as to his plans he excuses a letter of his own to cæsar he had written to cæsar in terms which might be pleasing to the great man he had told cæsar of cæsars admirable wisdom was it not better so he was willing that his letter should be read aloud to all the people if only those of pompey might also be read aloud then follow copies of a correspondence between him and pompey in the last he declares126 that when he had written from canusium he had not dreamed that pompey was about to cross the sea he had known that pompey had intended to treat for peacefor peace even under unjust conditionsbut he had never thought that pompey was meditating a retreat out of italy he argues well and stoutly and does take us along with him pompey had been beaten back from point to point never once rallying himself against cæsar he had failed and had slipped away leaving a man here and there to stand up for the republic pompey was willing to risk nothing for rome it had come to pass at last that he was being taught cæsarism by cæsar and when he died was more imperial than his master  at this time ciceros eyes were bad mihi molestior lippitudo erat etiam quam ante fuerat and again lippitudinis meæ signum tibi sit librarii manus but we may doubt whether any great men have lived so long with so little to tease them as to their health and yet the amount of work he got through was great he must have so arranged his affairs as to have made the most he could of his hours and have carried in his memory information on all subjects when we remember the size of the books which he read their unwieldy shapes their unfitness for such work as that of ours there seems to have been a continuation of study such as we cannot endure throughout his life his hours were early but they must also have been late of his letters we have not a half of his speeches not a half of his treatises not more than a half when he was abroad during his exile or in cilicia during his government he could not have had his books with him that cæsar should have been cæsar or pompey pompey does not seem to me a matter so difficult as that cicero should have been cicero then comes that letter of which i spoke in my first chapter in which he recapitulates the getæ the armenians and the men of colchis shall i the savior of the city assist to bring down upon that city those hordes of foreign men shall i deliver it up to famine and to destruction for the sake of one man who is no more than mortal127 it was pompey as to whom he then asked the question for pompeys sake am i to let in these crowds we have been told indeed by mr froude that the man was cæsar and that cicero wrote thus anxiously with the special object of arranging his death  now if ever think what we shall do he says a roman army sits round pompey and makes him a prisoner within valley and rampartand shall we live the city stands the prætors give the law the Ædiles keep up the games good men look to their principal and their interest shall i remain sitting here shall i rush hither and thither madly and implore the credit of the towns men of substance will not follow me the revolutionists will arrest me is there any end to this misery people will point at me and say how wise he was not to go with him i was not wise of his victory i never wished to be the comradeyet now i do of his sorrow128  sidenote bc 49 ætat 58  pompey had crossed the sea from brundisium and cæsar had retreated across italy to capua as he was journeying he saw cicero and asked him to go to rome this cicero refused and cæsar passed on i must then use other counsels said cæsar thus leaving him for the last time before the coming battle cicero went on to arpinum and there heard the nightingales from that moment he resolved he had not thought it possible that when the moment came he should have been able to prevail against cæsars advice but he had done so he had feared that cæsar would overcome him but when the moment came he was strong against even cæsar he gave his boy his toga or as we should say made a man of him he was going after pompey not for the sake of pompey not for the sake of the republic but for loyalty he was going because atticus had told him to go but as he is going there came fresh ground for grief he writes to atticus about the two boys his son and nephew the one is good by nature and has not yet gone astray the other the elder and his nephew has been encouraged by this uncles indulgence and has openly adopted evil ways in other words he has become cæsarianfor a reward129 the young quintus has shown himself to be very false cicero is so bound together with his family in their public life that this falling off of one of them makes him unhappy then curio comes the way and there is a most interesting conversation it seems that curio who is fond of cicero tells him everything but cicero who doubts him lets him pass on then cælius writes to him cælius implores him for the sake of his children to bear in mind what he is doing he tells him much of cæsars anger and asks him if he cannot become cæsarian at any rate to betake himself to some retreat till the storm shall pass by and quieter days should come but cælius though it had suited cicero to know him intimately had not read the greatness of the mans mind he did not understand in the least the difficulty which pervaded cicero to cælius it was playplay in which a man might be beaten or banished or slaughtered but it was a game in which men were fighting each for himself that there should be a duty in the matter beyond that was inexplicable to cælius and his children toohis anger against young quintus and his forgiveness of marcus he thinks that quintus had been purchased by a large bribe on cæsars side and is thankful that it is no worse with him what can have been worse to a young man than to have been open to such payment antony is frequently on the scene and already disgusts us by the vain frivolity and impudence of his life and then ciceros eyes afflict him and he cannot see servius sulpicius comes to him weeping for servius who is timid and lachrymose everything has gone astray and then there is that dionysius who had plainly told him that he desired to follow some richer or some readier master at the last comes the news of his tullias childs birth she is brought to bed of a son he cannot however wait to see how the son thrives from the midst of enemies and with spies around him he starts there is one last letter written to his wife and daughter from on board the ship at caieta sending them many loves and many careful messages and then he is off  it was now the 11th of june the third day before the ides bc 49 and we hear nothing special of the events of his journey when he reached the camp which he did in safety he was not well received there he had given his all to place himself along with pompey in the republican quarters and when there the republicans were unwilling to welcome him pompey would have preferred that he should have remained away so as to be able to say hereafter that he had not come  of what occurred to cicero during the great battle which led to the solution of the roman question we know little or nothing we hear that cicero was absent sick at dyrrachium but there are none of those tirades of abuse with which such an absence might have been greeted we hear indeed from other sources very full accounts of the fightinghow cæsar was nearly conquered how pompey might have prevailed had he had the sense to take the good which came in his way how he failed to take it how he was beaten and how in the very presence of his wife he was murdered at last at the mouth of the nile by the combined energies of a roman and a greek  we can imagine how the fate of the world was decided on the pharsalus where the two armies met and the victory remained with cæsar then there were weepings and gnashings of teeth and there were the congratulations and selfapplause of the victors in all ciceros letters there is not a word of it there was terrible suffering before it began and there is the sense of injured innocence on his return but nowhere do we find any record of what took place there is no mourning for pompey no turning to cæsar as the conqueror petra has been lost and pharsalia has been won but there is no sign  sidenote bc 48 ætat 59  cicero we know spent the time at dyrrachium close to which the battle of petra was fought and went from thence to corcyra there invitation was made to him as the senior consular officer present to take the command of the beaten army but that he declined we are informed that he was nearly killed in the scuffle which took place we can imagine that it was sothat in the confusion and turmoil which followed he should have been somewhat roughly told that it behooved him to take the lead and to come forth as the new commander that there should be a time at last in which no moment should be allowed him for doubt but that he should doubt and after more or less of reticence pass on young pompey would have it so what name would be so good to bind together the opponents of cæsar as that of cicero but cicero would not be led it seems that he was petulant and out of sorts at the time that he had been led into the difficulty of the situation by his desire to be true to pompey and that he was only able to escape from it now that pompey was gone we can well imagine that there should be no man less able to fight against cæsar though there was none whose name might be so serviceable to use as that of cicero at any rate as far as we are concerned there was silence on the subject on his part he wrote not a word to any of the friends whom pompey had left behind him but returned to italy dispirited silent and unhappy he had indeed met many men since the battle of the pharsalus but to none of whom we are conversant had he expressed his thoughts regarding that great campaign  here we part from pompey who ran from the fightingground of macedonia to meet his doom in the roads of alexandria never had man risen so high in his youth to be extinguished so ingloriously in his age he was born in the same year with cicero but had come up quicker into the management of the worlds affairs so as to have received something from his equals of that which was due to age habit had given him that ease of manners which enabled him to take from those who should have been his compeers the deference which was due not to his age but to his experience when cicero was entering the world taking up the cudgels to fight against sulla pompey had already won his spurs in spite of sulla but by means of sulla men in these modern days learn as they grow old in public life to carry themselves with indifference among the backslidings of the world in reading the life of cicero we see that it was so then when defending amerinus we find the same character of man as was he who afterward took milos part there is the same readiness the same ingenuity and the same high indignation but there is not the same indifference as to results with amerinus it is as though all the world depended on it with milo he felt it to be sufficient to make the outside world believe it when pompey triumphed 70 bc and was made consul for the second time he was already old in glorywhen cicero had not as yet spoken those two orations against verres which had made the speaking of another impossible pompey we may say had never been young cicero was never old there was no moment in his life in which cicero was not able to laugh with the curios and the cæliuses behind the back of the great man there was no moment in which pompey could have done so he who has stepped from his cradle on to the worlds high places has lost the view of those things which are only to be seen by idle and luxurious young men of the day cicero did not live for many years beyond pompey but i doubt whether he did not know infinitely more of men to pompey it had been given to rule them but to cicero to live with them     chapter vi  after the battle   sidenote bc 48 ætat 59  in the autumn of this year cicero had himself landed at brundisium he remained nearly a year at brundisium and it is melancholy to think how sad and how long must have been the days with him he had no country when he reached the nearest italian port it was all cæsars and cæsar was his enemy there had been a struggle for the masterdom between two men and of the two the one had beaten with whom cicero had not ranged himself he had known how it would be all the getæ and the men of colchis and the armenians all the lovers of the fishponds and those who preferred the delicacies of baiæ to the work of the forum all who had been taught to think that there were provinces in order that they might plunder men who never dreamed of a country but to sell it all those whom cæsar was determined either to drive out of italy or keep there in obedience to himself had been brought together in vain we already know when we begin to read the story how it will be with them and with cæsar on cæsars side there is an ecstasy of hope carried to the very brink of certainty on the other is that fainting spirit of despair which no battalions can assuage we hear of no scæva and of no crastinus on pompeys side men change their nature under such leading as was that of cæsar the inferior men become heroic by contact with the hero but such heroes when they come are like great gouts of blood dabbled down upon a fair cloth who that has eyes to see can look back upon the career of such a one and not feel an agony of pain as the stern man passes on without a ruffled face after ordering the right hands of those who had fought at uxellodunum to be chopped off at the wrist in order that men might know what was the penalty of fighting for their country  there are menor have been from time to time in all ages of the worldlet loose as it were by the hand of god to stop the iniquities of the people but in truth the natural product of those iniquities they have come and done their work and have died leaving behind them the foul smell of destruction an augustus followed cæsar and him tiberius and so on to a nero it was necessary that men should suffer much before they were brought back to own their condition but they who can see a cicero struggling to avoid the evil that was comingnot for himself but for the world around himand can lend their tongues their pens their ready wits to ridicule his efforts can hardly have been touched by the supremacy of human suffering  it must have been a sorry time with him at brundisium he had to stay there waiting till cæsars pleasure had been made known to him and cæsar was thinking of other things cæsar was away in egypt and the east encountering perils at alexandria which if all be true that we have heard imply that he had lived to be past fear grant that a man has to live as cæsar did and it will be well that he should be past fear at any rate he did not think of cicero or thinking of him felt that he was one who must be left to brood in silence over the choice he had made cicero did broodnot exactly in silenceover the things that fate had done for him and for his country for himself he was living in italy and yet could not venture to betake himself to one of the eighteen villas which as middleton tells us he had studded about the country for his pastime there were those at tusculum antium astura arpinumat formiæ at cumæ at puteoli and at pompeii those who tell us of ciceros poverty are surely wandering carried away by their erroneous notions of what were a roman noblemans ideas as to money at no period of his life do we find cicero not doing what he was minded to do for want of money and at no period is there a hint that he had allowed himself in any respect to break the law it has been argued that he must have been driven to take fees and bribes and indirect payments because he says that he wanted money it was natural that he should occasionally want money and yet be in the main indifferent the incoming of a regular revenue was not understood as it is with us a man here and there might attend to his money as did atticus cicero did not and therefore when in want of it he had to apply to a friend for relief but he always applies as one who knows well that the trouble is not enduring is it credible that a man so circumstanced should have remained with those various sources of extravagance which it would have been easy for him to have avoided or lessened we are led to the conviction that at no time was it expedient to him to abandon his villas though in the hurryscurry of roman affairs it did now and again become necessary for him to apply to atticus for accommodation let us think what must have been cæsars demands for money of these we hear nothing because he was too wise to have an atticus to whom he wrote everything or too wary to write letters upon business which should be treasured for the curiosity of afterages  to be hopeful and then tremulous to be eager after success and then desponding to have believed readily every good and then as readily evil to have relied implicitly on a mans faith and then to have turned round and declared how he had been deceived to have been very angry and then to have forgiventhis seems to have been ciceros nature verres catiline clodius piso and vatinius seem to have caused his wrath but was there one of them against whom though he did not forgive him his anger did not die out then at last he was moved to an internecine fight with antony is there any one who has read the story which we are going to tell who will not agree with us that if after mutina octavius had thought fit to repudiate antony and to follow ciceros counsels antony would not have been spared  nothing angers me so much in describing cicero as the assertion that he was a coward it has sprung from a wrong idea of what constitutes cowardice he did not care to fight but are all men cowards who do not care to fight when work can be so much better done by talking he saw that fighting was the work fit for men of common clay or felt it if he did not see it when men rise to such a pitch as that which he filled and cæsar and pompey and some few others around them their greatest danger does not consist in fighting a mans tongue makes enemies more bitter than his sword but cicero when the time came never shirked his foe whether it was verres or catiline or clodius or antony he was always there ready to take that foe by the throat and ready to offer his own in return at moments such as that there was none of the fear which stands aghast at the wrath of the injured one and makes the man who is a coward quail before the eyes of him who is brave  his friendship for pompey is perhaps of all the strong feelings of his life the one most requiring excuse and the most difficult to excuse for myself i can see why it was so but i cannot do that without acknowledging in it something which derogated from his greatness had he risen above pompey he would have been great indeed for i look upon it as certain that he did see that pompey was as untrue to the republic as cæsar he saw it occasionally but it was not borne in upon him at all times that pompey was false cæsar was not false cæsar was an open foe i doubt whether pompey ever saw enough to be open he never realized to himself more than men he never rose to measuresmuch less to the reason for them when cæsar had talked him over and had induced him to form the triumvirate pompeys politics were gone cicero never blanched whether full of new hopes he attacked chrysogonus with all the energy of one to whom his injured countrymen were dear or with the settled purpose of his life he accused verres in the teeth of the coming consul hortensius whether in driving out catiline or in defending milo whether even in standing up before cæsar for marcellus or in his final onslaught upon antony his purpose was still the same as time passed on he took to himself coarser weapons and went down into the arena and fought the beasts at ephesus alas it is so with mankind who can strive to do good and not fight beasts and who can fight them but after some fashion of their own he was fighting beasts at ephesus when he was defending milo he was an oligarch but he wanted the oligarchy round him to be true and honest it was impossible these men would not be just and yet he must use them milo and cælius and curio were his friends he knew them to be bad but he could not throw off from him all that were bad men if by these means he could win his way to something that might be good he would pardon their evil as we make our way on to the end of his life we find that his character becomes tarnished and that his high feelings are blunted by the party which he takes and the men with whom he associates  he did not indeed fall away altogether the magistracy offered to him the lieutenancy offered to him the free legation offered to him the last appeal made to him that he would go to rome and speak a few wordsor that he would stay away and remain neutraldid not move him he did not turn conspirator and then fight for the prize as pompey had done but he had for so many years clung to pompey as the leader of a party had had it so dinned into his ears that all must depend on pompey had found himself so bound up with the man who when appealed to as to his banishment had sullenly told him he could only do as cæsar would have him whom he had felt to be mean enough to be stigmatized as sampsiceramus him of jerusalem the hero of arabia whom he knew to be desirous of doing with his enemies as sulla had done with histhat in spite of it all he clung to him still  i cannot but blame cicero for this but yet i can excuse it it is hard to have to change your leader after middle life and cicero could only have changed his by becoming a leader himself we can see how hopeless it was would it not have been mean had he allowed those men to go and fight in macedonia without him who would have believed in him had he seemed to be so false not cato not brutus not bibulus not scipio not marcellus such men were the leaders of the party of which he had been one would they not say that he had remained away because he was cæsars man he must follow either cæsar or pompey he knew that pompey was beaten there are things which a man knows but he cannot bring himself to say so even to himself he went out to fight on the side already conquered and when the thing was done he came home with his heart sad and lived at brundisium mourning his lot  from thence he wrote to atticus saying that he hardly saw the advantage of complying with advice which had been given to him that he should travel incognito to rome but it is the special reason given which strikes us as being so unlike the arguments which would prevail today nor have i restingplaces on the way sufficiently convenient for me to pass the entire daytime within them130 the diversorium was a place by the roadside which was always ready should the owner desire to come that way it must be understood that he travelled with attendants and carried his food with him or sent it on before we see at every turn how much money could do but we see also how little money had done for the general comfort of the people brundisium is above three hundred miles from rome and the journey is the same which horace took afterward going from the city131 much had then been done to make travelling comfortable or at any rate cheaper than it had been fourandtwenty years before but now the journey was not made he reminds atticus in the letter that if he had not written through so long an interval it was not because there had been a dearth of subjects it had been no doubt prudent for a man to be silent when so many eyes and so many ears were on the watch he writes again some days later and assures atticus that cæsar thinks well of his lictors oh those eternal lictors but what have i to do with lictors he says who am almost ordered to leave the shores of italy132 and then cæsar had sent angry messages cato and metellus had been said to have come home cæsar did not choose that this should be so and had ordered them away it was clearly manifest to every man alive now that cæsar was the actual master of italy  during the whole of this winter he is on terms with terentia but he writes to her in the coldest strain there are many letters to terentia more in number than we have ever known before but they are all of the same order i translate one here to show the nature of his correspondence if you are well i am so also the times are such that i expect to hear nothing from yourself and on my part have nothing to write nevertheless i look for your letters and i write to you when a messenger is going to start voluminia ought to have understood her duty to you and should have done what she did do better there are other things however which i care for more and grieve for more bitterlyas those have wished who have driven me from my own opinion133 again he writes to atticus deploring that he should have been bornso great are his troublesor at any rate that one should have been born after him from the same mother his brother has addressed him in angerhis brother who has desired to make his own affairs straight with cæsar and to swim down the stream pleasantly with other noble romans of the time i can imagine that with quintus cicero there was nothing much higher than the wealth which the day produced i can fancy that he was possessed of intellect and that when it was fair sailing with our consul it was all well with quintus cicero but i can see also that when cæsar prevailed it was occasionally a matter of doubt with quintus whether his brother should not be abandoned among other things which were obtrusive and vain he could not quite do it his brother compelled him into propriety and carried him along within the lines of the oligarchy then cæsar fell and quintus saw that the matter was right but cæsar though he fell did not altogether fall and therefore quintus after all turned out to be in the wrong i fancy that i can see how things went ill with quintus  sidenote bc 47 ætat 60  cæsar after the battle of the pharsalia had followed pompey but had failed to catch him when he came upon the scene in the roadstead at alexandria the murder had been effected he then disembarked and there as circumstances turned out was doomed to fight another campaign in which he nearly lost his life it is not a part of my plan to write the life of cæsar nor to meddle with it further than i am driven to do in seeking after the sources of ciceros troubles and aspiration but the story must be told in a few words cæsar went from alexandria into asia and flashing across syria beat pharnaces and then wrote his famous veni vidi vici if those words were ever written surely he could not have written them and sent them home even the subservience of the age would not have endured words so boastful nor would the glory of cæsar have so tarnished itself he hurried back to italy and quelled the mutiny of his men by a masterpiece of stageacting simply by addressing them as quirites instead of milites he appalled them into obedience on this journey into italy he came across cicero if he could be cruel without a pangto the arranging the starvation of a townful of women because they as well as the men must eathe could be magnificent in his treatment of a cicero he had hunted to the death his late colleague in the triumvirate and had felt no remorse though there seems to have been a moment when in egypt the countenance of him who had so long been his superior had touched him he had not ordered pompeys death on no occasion had he wilfully put to death a roman whose name was great enough to leave a mark behind he had followed the convictions of his countrymen who had ever spared themselves to him a thousand gauls or men of eastern origin were as nothing to a single roman nobleman whether there can be said to have been clemency in such a course it is useless now to dispute to cæsar it was at any rate policy as well if by clemency he meant that state of mind in which it is an evil to sacrifice the life of men to a spirit of revenge cæsar was clement he had moreover that feeling which induces him who wins to make common causein little thingswith those who lose we can see cæsar getting down from his chariot when cicero came to meet him and throwing his arms round his neck walking off with him in pleasant conversation and we can fancy him talking to cicero pleasantly of the greatness which in times yet to come pursuits such as his would show in comparison with those of cæsars cedant arma togæ concedat laurea linguæ we can hear cæsar say with an irony expressed in no tone of his voice but still vibrating to the core of his heart as he thought so much of his own undoubted military supremacy and absolutely nothing of his now undoubted literary excellence  sidenote bc 47 ætat 60  but to go back a little we shall find cicero still waiting at brundisium during august and september in the former of these months he reminds atticus that he cannot at present sell anything but that he can put by something so that it may be in safety when the ruin shall fall upon him134 from this may be deduced a state of things very different to that above described but not contradicting it i gather from this unintelligible letter written as he tells us for the most part in his own handwriting that he was at the present moment under some forfeiture of the law to cæsar it may well be that as one adjudged to be a rebel to his country his property should not be salable if that were so cæsar in some of these bland moments must have revoked the sentenceand at such a time all sentences were within cæsars controlbecause we know that on his return ciceros villas were again within his own power but he is in sad trouble now about his wife he has written to her to send him twelve thousand sesterces which he had as it were in a bag and she sends him ten saying that no more is left if she would deduct something from so small a sum what would she do if it were larger135 then follow two letters for his wifea mere word in eachnot a sign of affection nor of complaint in either of them in the first he tells her she shall be informed when cæsar is comingin the latter that he is coming when he has resolved whether to go and meet him or to remain where he is till cæsar shall have come upon him he will again write then there are three to atticus and two more to terentia in the first he tells him that cæsar is expected some ten or twelve days afterward he is still full of grief as to his brother quintus whose conduct has been shameful cæsar he knows is near at hand but he almost hopes that he will not come to brundisium in the third as indeed he has in various others he complains bitterly of the heat it is of such a nature that it adds to his grief shall he send word to cæsar that he will wait upon him nearer to rome136 he is evidently in a sad condition quintus it must be remembered had been in gaul with cæsar and had seen the rising sun on his return to italy he had not force enough to declare a political conviction and to go over to cæsar boldly he had indeed become lieutenant to his brother when in cilicia having left cæsar for the purpose he afterward went with his brother to the pharsalus assuring the elder cicero that they two would still be of the same party then the great catastrophe had come when cicero returned from that wretched campaign to brundisium and remained there in despair as at some penal settlement quintus followed cæsar into asia with his son and there pleaded his own cause with him at the expense of his brother of cæsar we must all admit that though indifferent to the shedding of blood arrogant without principle in money and without heart in love he was magnificent and that he injured none from vindictive motives he passed on leaving quintus cicero who as a soldier had been true to him without as we can fancy many words cicero afterward interceded for his brother who had reviled him and quintus will ever after have to bear the stain of his treachery then came the two letters for his wife with just a line in each if her messenger should arrive he will send her word back as to what she is to do after an interval of nearly a month there is the otherordering in perfectly restored goodhumor that the baths shall be ready at the tusculan villa let the baths be all ready and everything fit for the use of guests there will probably be many of them137 it is evident that cæsar has passed on in a goodhumor and has left behind him glad tidings such as should ever brighten the feet of the conqueror  it is singular that with a correspondence such as that of ciceros of which at least through the latter two or three years of his life every letter of his to his chief friend has been preserved there should have been nothing left to us from that friend himself it must have been the case as middleton suggests that atticus when cicero was dead had the handling of the entire ms and had withdrawn his own either that or else cicero and atticus mutually agreed to the destruction of their joint labors and atticus had been untrue to his agreement knowing well the value of the documents he preserved that there is no letter from a womannot even a line to cicero from his dear daughteris much to be regretted and yet there are lettersmany from cælius who is thus brought forward as almost a second and a younger atticusand from various romans of the day when we come to the latter days of his life in which he had taken upon himself the task of writing to plancus and others as to their supposed duty to the state they become numerous there are ten such from plancus and nine from decimus brutus and there is a whole mass of correspondence with marcus brutusto be taken for what it is worth with a view to history they are doubtless worth much but as throwing light on ciceros character except as to the vigor that was in the man to the last they are not of great value how is it that a correspondence which is for its main purpose so full should have fallen so short in many of its details there is no word no allusion derogatory to atticus in these letters which have come to us from cælius and others we have atticus left to us for our judgment free from the confession of his own faults and free also from the insinuations of others of whom would we wish that the familiar letters of another about ourselves should be published would those objectionable epithets as to pompey have been allowed to hold their ground had pompey lived and had they been in his possession  but in reading histories and biographies we always accept with a bias in favor of the person described the anecdotes of those who talk of them we know that the ready wit of the surrounding world has taken up these affairs of the moment and turned them into ridiculethen as they do now we discount the hierosolymarius we do not quite believe that bibulus never left the house while an enemy was to be seen but we think that a man may be expected to tell the truth of himself at any rate to tell no untruth against himself we think that cicero of all men may be left to do socicero who so well understood the use of words and could use them in his own defence so deftly i maintain that it has been that very deftness which has done him all the harm not one of those letters of the last years would have been written as it is now had cicero thought when writing it that from it would his conduct have been judged after two thousand years no will say my readers that is their value they would not have otherwise been true as they are we should not then have learned his secrets i reply it is a hard bargain to make others do not make such bargains on the same terms but be sure at any rate that you read them aright be certain that you make the necessary allowances do not accuse him of falsehood because he unsays on a tuesday the words he said on the monday bear in mind on his behalf all the temporary ill that humanity is heir to could you living at brundisium during the summer months when you were scarcely able to endure the weight of the sun138 have had all your intellects about you and have been able always to choose your words no indeed these letters if truth is to be expected from them have to be read with all the subtle distinctions necessary for understanding the frame of mind in which they were written his anger boils over here and he is hot here tenderness has mastered him and the love of old days he is weak in body just now and worn out in spirit he is hopeless almost to the brink of despair he is bright with wit he is full of irony he is purposely enigmaticall of which require an atticus who knew him and the people among whom he had lived and the times in which the events took place for their special reading who is there can read them now so as accurately to decipher every intended detail then comes some critic who will not even attempt to read themwho rushes through them by the light of some foregone conclusion and missing the point at which the writer subtly aims tells us of some purpose of which he was altogether innocent because he jokes about the augurship we are told how miserably base he was and how ready to sell his country  during the whole of the last year he must have been tortured by various turns of mind had he done well in joining himself to pompey and having done so had he done well in severing himself immediately on pompeys death from the pompeians looking at the matter as from a standpoint quite removed from it we are inclined to say that he had done well in both he could not without treachery have gone over to cæsar when cæsar had come to the gate of italy and as it were with a blast of his trumpet had demanded the consulship a triumph the use of his legions and the continuance of his military power let pompey put down his and i will put down mine he had said had pompey put down his pompey and cicero cato and brutus and bibulus would all have had to walk at the heels of cæsar when pompey declared that he would contest the point he declared for them all cicero was bound to go to pharsalia but when by pompeys incompetence cæsar was the victor when pompey had fallen at the nile and all the lovers of the fishponds and the intractable oligarchs and the cutthroats of the empire such as young pompey had become had scattered themselves far and wide some to asia some to illyricum some to spain and more to africaas a herd of deer shall be seen to do when a vast hound has appeared among them with his jaws already dripping with bloodwas cicero then to take his part with any of them i hold that he did what dignity required and courage also he went back to italy and there he waited till the conqueror should come  it must have been very bitter never to have become great has nothing in it of bitterness for a noble spirit what matters it to the unknown man whether a cæsar or a pompey is at the top of all things or if it does matteras indeed that question of his governance does matter to every man who has a soul within him to be turned this way or thatwhich way he is turned though there may be inner regrets that cæsar should become the tyrant perhaps keener regrets if the truth were all seen that pompeys hands should be untrammelled who sees them i can walk down to my club with my brow unclouded or unless i be stirred to foolish wrath by the pride of some one equally vain can enjoy myself amid the festivities of the hour it is but a little affair to me if it come in my way to do a thing i will do my best and there is an end of it the sense of responsibility is not there nor the grievous weight of having tried but failed to govern mankind but to have clung to high places to have sat in the highest seat of all with infinite honor to have been called by others and worse still to have called myself the savior of my country to have believed in myself that i was sufficient that i alone could do it that i could bring back by my own justice and integrity my erring countrymen to their former simplicityand then to have found myself fixed in a little town just in italy waiting for the great conqueror who though my friend in things social was opposed to me body and soul as to rules of lifethat i say must have been beyond the bitterness of death  during this year he had made himself acquainted with the details of that affair whatever it might be which led to his divorce soon after his return to rome he had lived about thirty years with his wife and the matter could not but have been to him the cause of great unhappiness terentia was not only the mother of his children but she had been to him also the witness of his rise in life and the companion of his fall he was one who would naturally learn to love those with whom he was conversant he seems to have projected himself out of his own time into those modes of thought which have come to us with christianity and such a separation from this woman after an intercourse of so many years must have been very grievous to him all married romans underwent divorce quite as a matter of course there were many reasons a young wife is more agreeable to the mans taste than one who is old a rich wife is more serviceable than a poor a new wife is a novelty a strange wife is an excitement a little wife is a relief to one overburdened with the flesh a buxom wife to him who has become tired of the pure spirit xanthippe asks too much while griselda is too tranquil and then as a man came up in the world causes for divorce grew without even the trouble of having to search for faults cæsar required that his wife should not be ill spoken of and therefore divorced her pompey cemented the triumvirate with a divorce we cannot but imagine that when men had so much the best of it in the affairs of life a woman had always the worst of it in these enforced separations but as the wind is tempered to the shorn lamb so were divorces made acceptable to roman ladies no woman was disgraced by a divorce and they who gave over their husbands at the caprice of a moment to other embraces would usually find consolation terentia when divorced from cicero was at least fifty and we are told she had the extreme honor of having married sallust after her break with cicero they say that she married twice again after sallusts death and that having lived nearly through the reign of augustus she died at length at the age of a hundred and three divorce at any rate did not kill her but we cannot conceive but that so sudden a disruption of all the ties of life must have been grievous to cicero we shall find him in the next chapter marrying a young ward and then too divorcing her but here we have only to deal with the torments terentia inflicted on him what those torments were we do not know and shall never learn unless by chance the lost letters of atticus should come to light but the general idea has been that the lady had in league with a freedman and steward in her service been guilty of fraud against her husband i do not know that we have much cause to lament the means of ascertaining the truth it is sad to find that the great men with whose name we are occupied have been made subject to those whips and scorns of time which we thought to be peculiar to ourselves because they have stung us terentia ciceros wife two thousand years ago sent him word that he had but £100 left in his box at home when he himself knew well that there must be something more that would have gone for nothing had there not been other things before that many other things so in spite of his ordering at her hands the baths and various matters to be got ready for his friends at his tusculum a very short time after his return there he had divorced her  during this last year he had been engaged on what has since been found to be the real work of his life he had already written much but had written as one who had been anxious to fill up vacant spaces of time as they came in his way from this time forth he wrote as does one who has reconciled himself to the fact that there are no more days to be lost if he intends before the sun be set to accomplish an appointed task he had already compiled the de oratore the de republica and the de legibus out of the many treatises which we have from ciceros hands these are they which are known as the works of his earlier years he commenced the year with an inquiry de optimo genere oratorum which he intended as a preface to the translations which he made of the great speeches of Æschines and demosthenes de corona these translations are lost though the preface remains he then translated or rather paraphrased the timæus of plato of which a large proportion has come down to us and the protagoras of which we have lost all but a sentence or two we have his oratoriæ partitiones in which in a dialogue between himself and his son he repeats the lessons on oratory which he has given to the young man it is a recapitulation in short of all that had been said on a subject which has since been made common and which owed its origin to the work of much earlier years it is but dull reading but i can imagine that even in these days it may be useful to a young lawyer there is a cynical morsel among these precepts which is worth observing cito enim arescit lachryma præsertim in alienis malis139 and another grandly simple nihil enim est aliud eloquentia nisi copiose loquens sapientia can we fancy anything more biting than the idea that the tears caused by the ills of another soon grow dry on the orators cheek or more wise than that which tells us that eloquence is no more than wisdom speaking eloquently then he wrote the six paradoxes addressed to brutusor rather he then gave them to the world for they were surely written at an earlier date they are short treatises on trite subjects put into beautiful language so as to arrest the attention of all readers by the unreasonableness of their reasoning the most remarkable is the third in which he endeavored to show that a man cannot be wise unless he be allwise a doctrine which he altogether overturns in his de amicitia written but four years afterward cicero knew well what was true and wrote his paradox in order to give a zest to the subject in the fourth and the sixth are attacks upon clodius and crassus and are here republished in what would have been the very worst taste amid the politeness of our modern times a man now may hate and say so while his foe is still alive and strong but with the romans he might continue to hate and might republish the words which he had written eight years after the death of his victim  i know nothing of ciceros which so much puts us in mind of the struggles of the modern authors to make the most of every word that has come from them as do these paradoxes they remind us of some writer of leading articles who gets together a small bundle of essays and then gives them to the world each of them has done well at its time but that has not sufficed for his ambition therefore they are dragged out into the light and put forward with a separate claim for attention as though they could stand well on their own legs but they cannot stand alone and they fall from having been put into a position other than that for which they were intended when written     chapter vii  marcellus ligarius and deiotarus   sidenote bc 46 ætat 61  the battle of thapsus in africa took place in the spring of this year and cato destroyed himself with true stoical tranquillity determined not to live under cæsars rule if we may believe the story which probably hirtius has given us in his account of the civil war in africa and which has come down to us together with cæsars commentaries cato left his last instructions to some of his officers and then took his sword into his bed with him and stabbed himself cicero who in his dream of scipio has given his readers such excellent advice in regard to suicide has understood that cato must be allowed the praise of acting up to his own principles he would die rather than behold the face of the tyrant who had enslaved him140 to cato it was nothing that he should leave to others the burden of living under cæsar but to himself the idea of a superior caused an unendurable affront the catonis nobile letum has reconciled itself to the poets of all ages men indeed have refused to see that he fled from a danger which he felt to be too much for him and that in doing so he had lacked something of the courage of a man many other romans of the time did the same thing but to none has been given all the honor which has been allowed to cato  cicero felt as others have done and allowed all his little jealousies to die away it was but a short time before that cato had voted against the decree of the senate giving cicero his supplication cicero had then been much annoyed but now cato had died fighting for the republic and was to be forgiven all personal offences cicero wrote a eulogy of cato which was known by the name of cato and was much discussed at rome at the time it has now been lost he sent it to cæsar having been bold enough to say in it whatever occurred to him should be said in catos praise we may imagine that had it not pleased him to be generoushad he not been governed by that feeling of de mortuis nil nisi bonum which is now common to us allhe might have said much that was not good cato had endeavored to live up to the austerest rules of the stoicsa mode of living altogether antagonistic to ciceros views but we know that he praised cato to the fulland we know also that cæsar nobly took the praise in good part as coming from cicero and answered it in an anticato in which he stated his reasons for differing from cicero we can understand how cæsar should have shown that the rigid stoic was not a man likely to be of service to his country  there came up at this period a question which made itself popular among the optimates of rome as to the return of marcellus the man of como whom marcellus had flogged will be rememberedthe roman citizen who had first been made a citizen by cæsar this is mentioned now not as the cause of cæsars enmity who did not care much probably for his citizen but as showing the spirit of the man he marcellus had been consul four years since bc 51 and had then endeavored to procure cæsars recall from his province he was one of the optimates an oligarch altogether opposed to cæsar a roman nobleman of fairly good repute who had never bent to cæsar but had believed thoroughly in his order and had thought till the day of pharsalia came that the consuls and the senate would rule forever the day of pharsalia did come and marcellus went into voluntary banishment in mitylene after pharsalia cæsars clemency began to make itself known there was a pardon for almost every roman who had fought against him and would accept it no spark of anger burnt in cæsars bosom except against one or two of whom marcellus was one he was too wise to be angry with men whose services he might require it was cæsars wish not to drive out the good men but to induce them to remain in rome living by the grace of his favor marcellus had many friends and it seems that a public effort was made to obtain for him permission to come back to rome we must imagine that cæsar had hitherto refused probably with the idea of making his final concession the more valuable at last the united senators determined to implore his grace and the consulares rose one after another in their places and all with one exception141 asked that marcellus might be allowed to return cicero however had remained silent to the last there must have been i think some plot to get cicero on to his legs he had gone to meet cæsar at brundisium when he came back from the east had returned to rome under his auspices and had lived in pleasant friendship with cæsars friends pardon seems to have been accorded to cicero without an effort as far as he was concerned that hostile journey to dyrrachiumfor he did not travel farther toward the campcounted for nothing with cæsar he was allowed to live in peace at rome or at his villas as he might please so long as cæsar might rule the idea seems to have been that he should gradually become absorbed among cæsars followers but hitherto he had remained silent it was now six years since his voice had been heard in rome he had spoken for miloor had intended to speakand in the same affair for munatius plancus and for saufeius bc 52 he had then been in his fiftyfifth year and it might well be that six years of silence at such a period of his life would not be broken it was manifestly his intention not to speak again at any rate in the senate though the threats made by him as to his total retirement should not be taken as meaning much such threats from statesmen depend generally on the wishes of other men but he held his place in the senate and occasionally attended the debates when this affair of marcellus came on and all the senators of consular rankexcepting only volcatius and cicerohad risen and had implored cæsar in a few words to condescend to be generous when claudius marcellus had knelt at cæsars feet to ask for his brothers liberty and cæsar himself after reminding them of the bitterness of the man had still declared that he could not refuse the prayers of the senate then cicero as though driven by the magnanimity of the conqueror rose from his place and poured forth his thanks in the speech which is still extant  that used to be the story till there came the german critic wolf who at the beginning of this century told us that cicero did not utter the words attributed to him and could not have uttered them according to wolf it would be doing cicero an egregious wrong to suppose him capable of having used such words which are not latin and which were probably written by some ignoramus in the time of tiberius such a verdict might have been taken as fatalfor wolfs scholarship and powers of criticism are acknowledgedin spite of la harpe the french scholar and critic who has named the marcellus as a thing of excellence comparing it with the eulogistic speeches of isocrates the praise of la harpe was previous to the condemnation of wolf and we might have been willing to accede to the german as being the later and probably the more accurate mr long the british editor of the orationsmr long who has so loudly condemned the four speeches supposed to have been made after ciceros return from exilegives us no certain guidance mr long at any rate has not been so disgusted by the tiberian latin as to feel himself bound to repudiate it if he can read the pro marcello so can i and so my reader might you do probably without detriment but these differences among the great philologic critics tend to make us who are so infinitely less learned better contented with our own lot i who had read the pro marcello without stumbling over its halting latinity should have felt myself crushed when i afterward came across wolfs denunciations had i not been somewhat comforted by la harpe but when i found that mr long in his introduction to the piece though he discusses wolfs doctrine still gives to the orator the advantage as it may be of his imprimatur i felt that i might go on and not be ashamed of myself142  this is the story that has now to be told of the speech pro marcello at the time the matter ended very tragically as soon as cæsar had yielded cicero wrote to marcellus giving him strong reasons for coming home marcellus answered him saying that it was impossible he thanks cicero shortly but with kindly dignity he declines with the comforts of the city i can well dispense he says143 then cicero urges him again and again using excellent arguments for his returnwhich at length prevail in the spring of the next year marcellus on his way back to rome is at athens there servius sulpicius spends a day with him but just as sulpicius is about to pass on there comes a slave to him who tells him that marcellus has been murdered his friend magius chilo had stabbed him overnight and had then destroyed himself it was said that chilo had asked marcellus to pay his debts for him and that marcellus had refused it seems to be more probable that chilo had his own reasons for not choosing that his friend should return to rome  looking back at my own notes on the speechit would make with us but a ten minutes afterdinner speechi see that it is said that it is chiefly remarkable for the beauty of the language and the abjectness of the praise of cæsar this was before i had heard of wolf as to the praise i doubt whether it should be called abject regard being had to the feelings of the moment in which it was delivered cicero had risen to thank cæsaron whose breath the recall of marcellus dependedfor his unexpected courtesy in england we should not have thanked cæsar as cicero did o cæsar there is no flood of eloquence no power of the tongue or of the pen no richness of words which may emblazon or even dimly tell the story of your great deeds144 such language is unusual with usas it would also be unusual to abuse our pisos and our vatiniuses as did cicero it was the southerner and the roman who spoke to southerners and to romans but undoubtedly there was present to the mind of cicero the idea of saying words which cæsar might receive with pleasure he was dictator emperor lord of all thingsking cicero should have remained away as marcellus had done were he not prepared to speak after this fashion he had long held aloof from speech at length the time had come when he was as it were caught in a trap and compelled to be eloquent  sidenote bc 46 ætat 61  the silence had been broken and in the course of the autumn he spoke on behalf of ligarius beseeching the conqueror to be again merciful this case was by no means similar to that of marcellus who was exiled by no direct forfeiture of his right to live in italy but who had expatriated himself in this case ligarius had been banished with others but it seems that the punishment had been inflicted on him not from the special illwill of cæsar but from the malice of certain enemies who together with ligarius had found themselves among pompeys followers when cæsar crossed the rubicon ligarius had at this time been left as acting governor in africa in the confusion of the times an unfortunate pompeian named varus had arrived in africa and to him as being superior in rank ligarius had given up the government varus had then gone leaving ligarius still acting and one tubero had come with his son and had demanded the office ligarius had refused to give it up and the two tuberos had departed leaving the province in anger and had fought at the pharsalus after the battle they made their peace with cæsar and in the scramble that ensued ligarius was banished now the case was brought into the courts in which cæsar sat as judge the younger tubero accused ligarius and cicero defended him it seems that having been enticed to open his mouth on behalf of marcellus he found himself launched again into public life but how great was the difference from his old life it is not to the judices or patres conscripti or to the quirites that he now addresses himself determined by the strength of his eloquence to overcome the opposition of stubborn minds but to cæsar whom he has to vanquish simply by praise once again he does the same thing when pleading for deiotarus the king of galatia and it is impossible to deny as we read the phrases that the orator sinks in our esteem it is not so much that we judge him to be small as that he has ceased to be great he begins his speech for ligarius by saying my kinsman tubero has brought before you o cæsar a new crime and one not heard of up to this daythat ligarius has been in africa145 the commencement would have been happy enough if it had not been addressed to cæsar for he was addressing a judge not appointed by any form but selfassumeda judge by military conquest we cannot imagine how cæsar found time to sit there with his legions round him still under arms and spain not wholly conquered but he did do so and allowed himself to be persuaded to the side of mercy ligarius came back to rome and was one of those who plunged their daggers into him but i cannot think that he should have been hindered by this trial and by cæsars mercy from taking such a step if by nothing else brutus and cassius also stabbed him the question to be decided is whether on public grounds these men were justified in killing hima question as to which i should be premature in expressing an opinion here  there are some beautiful passages in this oration who is there i ask he says who alleges ligarius to have been in fault because he was in africa he does so who himself was most anxious to be there and now complains that he was refused admittance by ligarius he who was in arms against cæsar what was your sword doing tubero in that pharsalian army whom did you seek to kill then what was the meaning of your weapon what was it that you desired so eagerly with those eyes and hands with that passion in your heart i press him too much the young man seems to be disturbed i will speak of myself then for i also was in that army146 this was in cæsars presence and no doubt told with cæsar we were all together in the same causeyou and i and ligarius why should you and i be pardoned and not ligarius the oration is for the most part simply eulogistic at any rate it was successful and became at rome for the time extremely popular he writes about it early in the following year to atticus who has urged him to put something into it before it was published to mitigate the feeling against tubero cicero says in his reply to atticus that the copies have already been given to the public and that indeed he is not anxious on tuberos behalf  early in this year he had divorced terentia and seems at once to have married publilia publilia had been his ward and is supposed to have had a fortune of her own he explains his own motives very clearly in a letter to his friend plancius in these wretched times he would have formed no new engagement unless his own affairs had been as sad for him as were those of the republic but when he found that they to whom his prosperity should have been of the greatest concern were plotting against him within his own walls he was forced to strengthen himself against the perfidy of his old inmates by placing his trust in new147 it must have been very bad with him when he had recourse to such a step as this shortly after this letter just quoted had been written he divorced publilia alsowe are told because publilia had treated tullia with disrespect we have no details on the subject but we can well understand the pride of the young woman who declined to hear the constant praise of her stepdaughter and thought herself to be quite as good as tullia at any rate she was sent away quickly from her new home having remained there only long enough to have made not the most creditable episode in ciceros life  at this time dolabella who assumed the consulship upon cæsars death and hirtius who became consul during the next year used to attend upon cicero and take lessons in elocution so at least the story has been told from a letter written in this year to his friend poetus but i should imagine that the lessons were not much in earnest why do you talk to me of your tunnyfish your pilotfish and your cheese and sardines hirtius and dolabella preside over my banquets and i teach them in return to make speeches148 from this we may learn that cæsars friends were most anxious to be also ciceros friends it may be said that dolabella was his soninlaw but dolabella was at this moment on the eve of being divorced it was in spite of his marriage that dolabella still clung to cicero all cæsars friends in rome did the same so that i am disposed to think that for this year just till tullias death he was falling not into a happy state but to the passive contentment of those who submit themselves to be ruled over by a single master he had struggled all his life and now finding that he must yield he thought that he might as well do so gracefully it was so much easier to listen to the state secrets of balbus and hear from oppius how the money was spent and then to dine with hirtius or dolabella than to sit ever scowling at home as cato would have done had cato lived but with his feelings about the republic at heart how sad it must have been cato was gone and pompey and bibulus and marcellus was either gone or just about to go old age was creeping on it was better to write philosophy in friendship with cæsars friends than to be banished again whither he could not write it at all much no doubt he did in preparation for all those treatises which the next eighteen months were to bring forth  cæsar just at the end of the year had been again called to spain bc 46 to quell the last throbbings of the pompeians and then to fight the final battle of munda it would seem odd to us that so little should have been said about such an event by cicero and that the little should depend on the education of his son were it not that if we look at our own private letters written today to our friends we find the same omission of great things to cicero the doings of his son were of more immediate moment than the doings of cæsar the boy had been anxious to enlist for the spanish war quintus his cousin had gone and young marcus was anxious to flutter his feathers beneath the eyes of royalty at his age it was nothing to him that he had been taken to pharsalia and made to bear arms on the opposite side cæsar had become cæsar since he had learned to form his opinion on politics and on cæsars side all things seemed to be bright and prosperous the lad was anxious to get away from his new stepmother and asked his father for the means to go with the army to spain it appears by ciceros letter to atticus on the subject149 that in discussing the matter with his son he did yield these roman fathers in whose hands we are told were the very lives of their sons seem to have been much like christian fathers of modern days in their indulgences the lad was now nineteen years old and does not appear to have been willing at the first parental attempt to give up his military appanages and that swagger of the young officer which is so dear to the wouldbe military mind cicero tells him that if he joined the army he would find his cousin treated with greater favor than himself young quintus was older and had been already able to do something to push himself with cæsars friends sed tamen permisinevertheless i told him he might go said cicero sadly but he did not go he was allured probably by the promise of a separate establishment at athens whither he was sent to study with cratippus we find another proof of ciceros wealth in the costliness of his sons household at athens as premeditated by the father he is to live as do the sons of other great noblemen he even names the young noblemen with whom he is to live bibulus was of the calpurnian gens acidinus of the manlian and messala of the valerian and these are the men whom cicero the novus homo from arpinum selects as those who shall not live at a greater cost than his son150 he will not however at athens want a horse why not why should not a young man so furnished want a horse at athens there are plenty here at home for the road says cicero so young cicero is furnished and sent forth to learn philosophy and greek but no one has essayed to tell us why he should not want the horse young cicero when at athens did not do well he writes home in the coming year to tiro two letters which have been preserved for us and which seem to give us but a bad account at any rate of his sincerity the errors of his youth he says have afflicted him grievously not only is his mind shocked but his ears cannot bear to hear of his own iniquity151 and now he says i will give you a double joy to compensate all the anxiety i have occasioned you know that i live with cratippus my master more like a son than a pupil i spend all my days with him and very often part of the night but he seems to have had some wit tiro has been made a freedman and has bought a farm for himself young marcusfrom whom tiro has asked for some assistance which marcus cannot give himjokes with him as to his country life telling him that he sees him saving the applepips at dessert of the subsequent facts of the life of young marcus we do not know much he did not suffer in the proscriptions of antony and augustus as did his father and uncle and his cousin he did live to be chosen as consul with augustus and had the reputation of a great drinker for this latter assertion we have only the authority of pliny the elder who tells us an absurd story among the wonders of drinking which he adduces152 middleton says a word or two on behalf of the young cicero which are as well worthy of credit as anything else that has been told one last glance at him which we can credit is given in that letter to tiro and that we admit seems to us to be hypocritical  sidenote bc 45 ætat 62  in the spring of the year cicero lost his daughter tullia we have first a letter of his to lepta a man with whom he had become intimate saying that he had been kept in rome by tullias confinement and that now he is still detained though her health is sufficiently confirmed by the expectation of obtaining from dolabellas agents the first repayment of her dowry the repayment of the divorced ladys marriage portion was a thing of everyday occurrence in rome when she was allowed to take away as much as she had brought with her cicero however failed to get back tullias dowry but he writes in good spirits he does not think that he cares to travel any more he has a house at rome better than any of his villas in the country and greater rest than in the most desert region his studies are now never interrupted he thinks it probable that lepta will have to come to him before he can be induced to go to lepta in the mean time let the young lepta take care and read his hesiod153  then he writes in the spring to atticus a letter from antium and we first hear that tullia is dead she had seemed to recover from childbirth but her strength did not suffice and she was no more154 a boy had been born and was left alive in subsequent letters we find that cicero gives instructions concerning him and speaks of providing for him in his will155 but of the child we hear nothing more and must surmise that he also died of tullias death we have no further particulars but we may well imagine that the troubles of the world had been very heavy on her the little stranger was being born at the moment of her divorce from her third husband she was about thirtytwo years of age and it seems that cicero had taken consolation in her misfortunes from the expected pleasure of her companionship she was now dead and he was left alone  she had died in february and we know nothing of the first outbreak of his sorrow it appears that he at first buried himself for a while in a villa belonging to atticus near rome and that he then retreated to his own at astura from thence and afterward from antium there are a large number of letters all dealing with the same subject he declares himself to be inconsolable but he does take consolation from two mattersfrom his books on philosophy and from an idea which occurs to him that he will perpetuate the name of tullia forever by the erection of a monument that shall be as nearly immortal as stones and bricks can make it  his letters to atticus at this time are tedious to the general reader because he reiterates so often his instructions as to the purchase of the garden near rome in which the monument is to be built but they are at the same time touching and natural nothing has been written he says for the lessening of grief which i have not read at your house but my sorrow breaks through it all156 then he tells atticus that he too has endeavored to console himself by writing a treatise on consolation whole days i write not that it does any good in that he was wrong he could find no cure for his grief but he did know that continued occupation would relieve him and therefore he occupied himself continually totos dies scribo by doing so he did contrive not to break his heart in a subsequent letter he says reading and writing do not soften it but they deaden it157  on the appian way a short distance out of rome the traveller is shown a picturesque ancient building of enormous strength called the mole of cæcilia metella it is a castle in size but is believed to have been the tomb erected to the memory of cæcilia the daughter of metellus creticus and the wife of crassus the rich history knows of her nothing more and authentic history hardly knows so much of the stupendous monument there it stands however and is supposed to be proof of what might be done for a roman lady in the way of perpetuating her memory she was at any rate older than tullia having been the wife of a man older than tullias father if it be the case that this monument be of the date named it proves to us at least that the notion of erecting such monuments was then prevalent some idea of a similar kindof a monument equally stupendous and that should last as longseems to have taken a firm hold of ciceros mind he has read all the authors he could find on the subject and they agree that it shall be done in the fashion he points out he does not he says consult atticus on that matter nor on the architecture for he has already settled on the design of one cluatius what he wants atticus to do for him now is to assist him in buying the spot on which it shall be built many gardens near rome are named if drusus makes a difficulty atticus must see damasippus then there are those which belong to sica and to silius but at last the matter dies away and even the gardens are not bought we are led to imagine that atticus has been opposed to the monument from first to last and that the immense cost of constructing such a temple as cicero had contemplated is proved to him to be injudicious there is a charming letter written to him at this time by his friend sulpicius showing the great feeling entertained for him but as i have said before i doubt whether that or any other phrases of consolation were of service to him it was necessary for him to wait and bear it and the more work that he did when he was bearing it the easier it was borne lucceius and torquatus wrote to him on the same subject and we have his answers  sidenote bc 45 ætat 62  in september cæsar returned from spain having at last conquered the republic all hope for liberty was now gone atticus had instigated cicero to write something to cæsar as to his victoriessomething that should be complimentary and at the same time friendly and familiar but cicero had replied that it was impossible when i feel he said that to draw the breath of life is in itself base how base would be my assent to what has been done158 but it is not only that there are not words in which such a letter ever can be written do you not know that aristotle when he addressed himself to alexander wrote to a youth who had been modest but then when he had once heard himself called king he became proud cruel and unrestrained how then shall i now write in terms which shall suffice for his pride to the man who has been equalled to romulus it was true cæsar had now returned inflated with such pride that brutus and cassius and casca could no longer endure him he came back and triumphed over the five lands in which he had conquered not the enemies of rome but rome itself he triumphed nominally over the gauls the egyptians the asiatics of pontus over the africans and the spaniards but his triumph was in truth over the republic there appears from suetonius to have been five separate triumphal processions each at the interval of a few days159 amid the glory of the first vercingetorix was strangled to the glory of the third was addedas suetonius tells usthese words veni vidi vici displayed on a banner this i think more likely than that he had written them on an official despatch we are told that the people of rome refused to show any pleasure and that even his own soldiers had enough in them of the roman spirit to feel resentment at his assumption of the attributes of a king cicero makes but little mention of these gala doings in his letters he did not see them but wrote back word to atticus who had described it all an absurd pomp he says alluding to the carriage of the image of cæsar together with that of the gods and he applauds the people who would not clap their hands even in approval of the goddess of victory because she had shown herself in such bad company160 there are however but three lines on the subject showing how little there is in that statement of cornelius nepos that he who had read ciceros letters carefully wanted but little more to be well informed of the history of the day  cæsar was not a man likely to be turned away from his purpose of ruling well by personal prideless likely we should say than any selfmade despot dealt with in history he did make efforts to be as he was before he endeavored to live on terms of friendship with his old friends but the spirit of pride which had taken hold of him was too much for him power had got possession of him and he could not stand against it it was sad to see the way in which it compelled him to make himself a prey to the conspirators were it not that we learn from history how impossible it is that a man should raise himself above the control of his fellowmen without suffering  sidenote bc 45 ætat 62  during these days cicero kept himself in the country giving himself up to his philosophical writings and indulging in grief for tullia efforts were repeatedly made to bring him to rome and he tells atticus in irony that if he is wanted there simply as an augur the augurs have nothing to do with the opening of temples in the same letter he speaks of an interview he has just had with his nephew quintus who had come to him in his disgrace he wants to go to the parthian war but he has not money to support him then cicero uses as he says the eloquence of atticus and holds his tongue161 we can imagine how very unpleasant the interview must have been cicero however decides that he will go up to the city so that he may have atticus with him on his birthday this letter was written toward the close of the year and ciceros birthday was the 3d of january  he then goes to rome and undertakes to plead the cause of deiotarus the king of galatia before cæsar this very old man had years ago become allied with pompey and as far as we can judge been singularly true to his idea of roman power he had seen pompey in all his glory when pompey had come to fight mithridates the tetrarchs in asia minor of whom this deiotarus was one had a hard part to play when the romans came among them they were forced to comply either with their natural tendency to resist their oppressors or else were obliged to fleece their subjects in order to satisfy the cupidity of the invaders we remember ariobarzanes who sent his subjects in gangs to rome to be sold as slaves in order to pay pompey the interest on his debt deiotarus had similarly found his best protection in being loyal to pompey and had in return been made king of armenia by a decree of the roman senate he joined pompey at the pharsalus and when the battle was over returned to his own country to look for further forces wherewith to aid the republic unfortunately for him cæsar was the conqueror and deiotarus found himself obliged to assist the conqueror with his troops cæsar seems never to have forgiven him his friendship for pompey he was not a roman and was unworthy of forgiveness cæsar took away from him the kingdom of armenia but left him still titular king of galatia but this enmity was known in the kings own court and among his own family his own daughters son one castor became desirous of ruining his grandfather and brought a charge against the king cæsar had been the kings compelled guest in his journey in quest of pharnaces and had passed quickly on now when the war was over and cæsar had returned from his five conquered nations castor came forward with his accusation deiotarus according to his grandson had endeavored to murder cæsar while cæsar was staying with him at this distance of time and place we cannot presume to know accurately what the circumstances were but it appears to have been below the dignity of cæsar to listen to such a charge he did do so however and heard more than one speech on the subject delivered in favor of the accused brutus spoke on behalf of the aged king and spoke in vain cicero did not speak in vain for cæsar decided that he would pronounce no verdict till he had himself been again in the east and had there made further inquiries he never returned to the east but the old king lived to fight once more and again on the losing side he was true to the party he had taken and ranged himself with brutus and cassius at the field of philippi  the case was tried if tried it can be called in cæsars private house in which the audience cannot have been numerous cæsar seems to have admitted cicero to say what could be said for his friend rather than as an advocate to plead for his client so that no one should accuse him cæsar of cruelty in condemning the criminal the speech must have occupied twenty minutes in the delivery and we are again at a loss to conceive how cæsar should have found the time to listen to it cicero declares that he feels the difficulty of pleading in so unusual a placewithin the domestic walls of a mans private house and without any of those accustomed supports to oratory which are to be found in a crowded law court but he says i rest in peace when i look into your eyes and behold your countenance the speech is full of flattery but it is turned so adroitly that we almost forgive it162  there is a passage in which cicero compliments the victor on his wellknown mercy in his victoriesfrom which we may see how much cæsar thought of the character he had achieved for himself in this particular of you alone o cæsar is it boasted that no one has fallen under your hands but they who have died with arms in their hands163 all who had been taken had been pardoned no man had been put to death when the absolute fighting was brought to an end cæsar had given quarter to all it is the modern generous way of fighting when our country is invaded and we drive back the invaders we do not if victorious slaughter their chief men much less when we invade a country do we kill or mutilate all those who have endeavored to protect their own homes cæsar has evidently much to boast and among the italians he has caused it to be believed it suited cicero to assert it in cæsars ears cæsar wished to be told of his own clemency among the men of his own country but because cæsar boasted and cicero was complaisant posterity is not to run away with the boast and call it true for all that is great in cæsars character i am willing to give him credit but not for mercy not for any of those divine gifts the loveliness of which was only beginning to be perceived in those days by some few who were in advance of their time it was still the maxim of rome that a supplicatio should be granted only when two thousand of the enemy should have been left on the field we have something still left of the pagan cruelty about us when we send triumphant words of the numbers slain on the field of battle we cannot but remember that cæsar had killed the whole senate of the veneti a nation dwelling on the coast of brittany and had sold all the people as slaves because they had detained the messengers he had sent to them during his wars in gaul gravius vindicandum statuit164he had thought it necessary to punish them somewhat severely therefore he had killed the entire senate and enslaved the entire people this is only one of the instances of wholesale horrible cruelty which he committed throughout his war in gaulof cruelty so frightful that we shudder as we think of the sufferings of past ages the ages have gone their way and the sufferings are lessened by increased humanity but we cannot allow ciceros compliment to pass idly by the nemo nisi armatus referred to italians and to italians we may take it of the upper rankamong whom for the sake of dramatic effect deiotarus was placed for the occasion  this was the last of ciceros casual speeches it was now near the end of the year and on the ides of march following it was fated that cæsar should die after which there was a lull in the storm for a while and then cicero broke out into that which i have called his final scream of liberty there came the philippicsand then the end this speech of which i have given record as spoken pro rege deiotaro was the last delivered by him for a private purpose fortytwo he has spoken hitherto of which something of the story has been told the philippics of which i have got to speak are fourteen in number making the total number of speeches which we possess to be fiftysix but of those spoken by him we have not a half and of those which we possess some have been declared by the great critics to be absolutely spurious the great critics have perhaps been too hard upon them they have all been polished cicero himself was so anxious for his future fame that he led the way in preparing them for the press quintilian tells us that tiro adapted them165 others again have come after him and have retouched them sometimes no doubt making them smoother and striking out morsels which would naturally become unintelligible to later readers we know what he himself did to the milo others subsequently may have received rougher usage but still from loving hands bits have been lost and other bits interpolated and in this way have come to us the speeches which we possess but we know enough of the history of the times and are sufficient judges of the language to accept them as upon the whole authentic the great critic when he comes upon a passage against which his very soul recoils on the score of its halting latinity rises up in his wrath and tears the oration to tatters till he will have none of it one set of objectionable words he encounters after another till the whole seems to him to be damnable and the oration is condemned it has been well to allude to this because in dealing with these orations it is necessary to point out that every word cannot be accepted as having been spoken as we find it printed taken collectively we may accept them as a stupendous monument of human eloquence and human perseverance  sidenote bc 45 ætat 62  late in the year on the 12th before the calends of january or the 21st of december there took place a little party at puteoli the account of which interests us cicero entertained cæsar at supper though the date is given as above and though december had originally been intended to signify as it does with us a winter month the year from want of proper knowledge had run itself out of order and the period was now that of october the amendment of the calendar which was made under cæsars auspices had not as yet been brought into use and we must understand that october the most delightful month of the year was the period in question cicero was staying at his puteolan villa not far from baiæ close upon the seashorethe corner of the world most loved by all the great romans of the day for their retreat in autumn166 puteoli we may imagine was as pleasant as baiæ but less fashionable and if all that we hear be true less immoral here cicero had one of his villas and here a few months before his death cæsar came to visit him he gives in a very few lines to atticus a graphic account of the entertainment cæsar had sent on word to say that he was coming so that cicero was prepared for him but the lord of all the world had already made himself so evidently the lord that cicero could not entertain him without certain of those inner quakings of the heart which are common to us now when some great magnate may come across our path and demand hospitality for a moment cicero jokes at his own solicitude but nevertheless we know that he has felt it when on the next morning he sent atticus an account of it his guest has been a burden to him indeed but still he does not regret it for the guest behaved himself so pleasantly we must remark that cicero did not ostensibly shake in his shoes before him cicero had been consul and has had to lead the senate when cæsar was probably anxious to escape himself as an undetected conspirator cæsar has grown since but only by degrees he has not become as augustus did facile princeps he is aware of his own power but aware also that it becomes him to ignore his own knowledge and cicero is also aware of it but conscious at the same time of a nominal equality cæsar is now dictator has been consul four times and will be consul again when the new year comes on but other romans have been dictator and consul all of which cæsar feels on the occasion and shows that he feels it cicero feels it also and endeavors not quite successfully to hide it  cæsar has come accompanied by troops cicero names two thousand menprobably at random when cicero hears that they have come into the neighborhood he is terribly put about till one barba cassius a lieutenant in cæsars employment comes and reassures him a camp is made for the men outside in the fields and a guard is put on to protect the villa on the following day about one oclock cæsar comes he is shut up at the house of one philippus and will admit no one he is supposed to be transacting accounts with balbus we can imagine how ciceros cooks were boiling and stewing at the time then the great man walked down upon the seashore rome was the only recognized nation in the world the others were provinces of rome and the rest were outlying barbaric people hardly as yet fit to be roman provinces and he was now lord of rome did he think of this as he walked on the shore of puteolior of the ceremony he was about to encounter before he ate his dinner he did not walk long for at two oclock he bathed and heard that story about mamurra without moving a muscle turn to your catullus the 57th epigram and read what cæsar had read to him on this occasion without showing by his face the slightest feeling it is short enough but i cannot quote it even in a note even in latin who told cæsar of the foul words and why were they read to him on this occasion he thought but little about them for he forgave the author and asked him afterward to supper this was at the bath we may suppose he then took his siesta and after that greek emetikên agebat how the romans went through the daily process and lived is to us a marvel i think we may say that cicero did not practise it cæsar on this occasion ate and drank plenteously and with pleasure it was all well arranged and the conversation was good of its kind witty and pleasant cæsars couch seems to have been in the midst and around him lay supping at other tables his freedmen and the rest of his suite it was all very well but still says cicero he was not such a guest as you would welcome backnot one to whom you would say come again i beg when you return this way once is enough there were no politics talkednothing of serious matters cæsar had begun to find now that no use could be made of cicero for politics he had tried that and had given it up philology was the subjectthe science of literature and languages cæsar could talk literature as well as cicero and turned the conversation in that direction cicero was apt and took the desired part and so the afternoon passed pleasantly but still with a little feeling that he was glad when his guest was gone167  cæsar declared as he went that he would spend one day at puteoli and another at baiæ dolabella had a villa down in those parts and cicero knows that cæsar as he passed by dolabellas house rode in the midst of soldiersin state as we should saybut that he had not done this anywhere else he had already promised dolabella the consulship  was cicero mean in his conduct toward cæsar up to this moment there had been nothing mean except that roman flattery which was simply roman good manners he had opposed him at pharsaliaor rather in macedonia he had gone across the waternot to fight for he was no fighting manbut to show on which side he had placed himself he had done this not believing in pompey but still convinced that it was his duty to let all men know that he was against cæsar he had resisted every attempt which cæsar had made to purchase his services neither with pompey nor with cæsar did he agree but with the formerthough he feared that a second sulla would arise should he be victoriousthere was some touch of the old republic something might have been done then to carry on the government upon the old lines cæsar had shown his intention to be lord of all and with that cicero could hold no sympathy cæsar had seen his position and had respected it he would have nothing done to drive such a man from rome under these circumstances cicero consented to live at rome or in the neighborhood and became a man of letters it must be remembered that up to the ides of march he had heard of no conspiracy the two men cæsar and cicero had agreed to differ and had talked of philology when they met there has been i think as yet nothing mean in his conduct     chapter viii  cÆsars death   sidenote bc 44 ætat 63  after the dinnerparty at puteoli described in the last chapter cicero came up to rome and was engaged in literary pursuits cæsar was now master and lord of everything in january cicero wrote to his friend curio and told him with disgust of the tomfooleries which were being carried on at the election of quæstors an empty chair had been put down and was declared to be the consuls chair then it was taken away and another chair was placed and another consul was declared it wanted then but a few hours to the end of the consular yearbut not the less was caninius the new consul appointed who would not sleep during his consulship which lasted but from midday to the evening if you saw all this you would not fail to weep says cicero168 after this he seems to have recovered from his sorrow we have a correspondence with poetus which always typifies hilarity of spirits there is a discussion of which we have but the one side on double entendre and plain speaking poetus had advocated the propriety of calling a spade a spade and cicero shows him the inexpediency then we come suddenly upon his letter to atticus written on the 7th of april three weeks after the fall of cæsar  mommsen endeavors to explain the intention of cæsar in the adoption of the names by which he chose to be called and in his acceptance of those which without his choosing were imposed upon him169 he has done it perhaps with too great precision but he leaves upon our minds a correct idea of the resolution which cæsar had made to be king emperor dictator or what not before he started for macedonia bc 49170 and the disinclination which moved him at once to proclaim himself a tyrant dictator was the title which he first assumed as being temporary roman and in a certain degree usual he was dictator for an indefinite period annually for ten years and when he died had been designated dictator for life he had already been for the last two years named imperator for life but that titlewhich i think to have had a military sound in mens ears though it may as mommsen says imply also civil rulewas not enough to convey to men all that it was necessary that they should understand till the moment of his triumph had come and that veni vidi vici had been flaunted in the eyes of rometill cæsar though he had been ashamed to call himself a king had consented to be associated with the godsbrutus cassius and those others sixty in number we are told who became the conspirators had hardly realized the fact that the republic was altogether at an end a bitter time had come upon them but it was softened by the personal urbanity of the victor but now gradually the truth was declaring itself and the conspiracy was formed i am inclined to think that shakspeare has been right in his conception of the plot i do fear the people choose cæsar for their king says brutus i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself says cassius171 it had come home to them at length that cæsar was to be king and therefore they conspired  it would be a difficult task in the present era to recommend to my readers the murderers of cæsar as honest loyal politicians who did for their country in its emergency the best that the circumstances would allow the feeling of the world in regard to murder has so changed during the last two thousand years that men hindered by their sense of what is at present odious refuse to throw themselves back into the condition of things a knowledge of which can have come to them only from books they measure events individually by the present scale and refuse to see that brutus should be judged by us now in reference to the judgment that was formed of it then in an age in which it was considered wise and fitting to destroy the nobles of a barbarous community which had defended itself and to sell all others as slaves so that the perpetrator simply recorded the act he had done as though necessary can it have been a base thing to kill a tyrant was it considered base by other romans of the day was that plea ever made even by cæsars friends or was it not acknowledged by them all that brutus was an honorable man even when they had collected themselves sufficiently to look upon him as an enemy it appears abundantly in ciceros letters that no one dreamed of regarding them as we regard assassins now or spoke of cæsars death as we look upon assassination shall we defend the deeds of him at whose death we are rejoiced he says and again he deplores the feeling of regret which was growing in rome on account of cæsars death lest it should be dangerous to those who have slain the tyrant for us172 we find that quintilian among his stock lessons in oratory constantly refers to the old established rule that a man did a good deed who had killed a tyranta lesson which he had taken from the greek teachers173 we are therefore bound to accept this murder as a thing praiseworthy according to the light of the age in which it was done and to recognize the fact that it was so regarded by the men of the day  we are told now that cicero hated cæsar there was no such hatred as the word implies and we are told of assassins with an intention to bring down on the perpetrators of the deed the odium they would have deserved had the deed been done today but the word has i think been misused a king was abominable to roman ears and was especially distasteful to men like cicero brutus and the other optimates who claimed to be peers to be primus inter pares had been ciceros ambitionto be the leading oligarch of the day cæsar had gradually mounted higher and still higher but always leaving some hopeinfinitesimally small at lastthat he might be induced to submit himself to the republic sulla had submitted personally there was no hatred but that hope had almost vanished and therefore judging as a roman when the deed was done cicero believed it to have been a glorious deed there can be no doubt on that subject the passages in which he praises it are too numerous for direct quotation but there they are interspersed through the letters and the philippics there was no doubt of his approval the assassination of cæsar if that is to be the word used was to his idea a glorious act done on behalf of humanity the allpowerful tyrant who had usurped dominion over his country had been made away with and again they might fall back upon the law he had filched the army he had run through various provinces and had enriched himself with their wealth he was above all law he was worse than a marius or a sulla who confessed themselves by their open violence to be temporary evils cæsar was creating himself king for all time no law had established him no plebiscite of the nation had endowed him with kingly power with his life in his hands he had dared to do it and was almost successful it is of no purpose to say that he was right and cicero was wrong in their views as to the government of so mean a people as the romans had become ciceros form of government under men who were not ciceros had been wrong and had led to a state of things in which a tyrant might for the time be the lesser evil but not on that account was cicero wrong to applaud the deed which removed cæsar middleton in his life vol ii p 435 gives us the opinion of suetonius on this subject and tells us that the best and wisest men in rome supposed cæsar to have been justly killed mr forsyth generously abstains from blaming the deed as to which he leaves his readers to form their own opinion abeken expresses no opinion concerning its morality nor does morabin it is the critics of ciceros works who have condemned him without thinking much perhaps of the judgment they have given  but cicero was not in the conspiracy nor had he even contemplated cæsars death assertions to the contrary have been made both lately and in former years but without foundation i have already alluded to some of these and have shown that phrases in his letters have been misinterpreted a passage was quoted by m du rozoirad att lib x 8i dont think that he can endure longer than six months he must fall even if we do nothing how often might it be said that the murder of an english minister had been intended if the utterings of such words be taken as a testimony he quotes againad att lib xiii 40what good news could brutus hear of cæsar unless that he hung himself this is to be taken as meditating cæsars death and is quoted by a french critic after two thousand years in proof of ciceros fatal illwill174 the whole tenor of ciceros letters proves that he had never entertained the idea of cæsars destruction  how long before the time the conspiracy may have been in existence we have no means of knowing but we feel that cicero was not a man likely to be taken into the plot he would have dissuaded brutus and cassius judging from what we know of his character we think that he would have distrusted its success though he rejoiced in it after it was done he would have been wretched while burdened with the secret at any rate we have the fact that he was not so burdened the sight of cæsars slaughter when he saw it must have struck him with infinite surprise but we have no knowledge of what his feelings may have been when the crowd had gathered round the doomed man cicero has left us no description of the moment in which cæsar is supposed to have gathered his toga over his face so that he might fall with dignity it certainly is the case that when you take your facts from the chance correspondence of a man you lose something of the most touching episodes of the day the writer passes these things by as having been surely handled elsewhere it is always so with cicero the trial of milo the passing of the rubicon the battle of the pharsalus and the murder of pompey are with the death of cæsar alike unnoticed i have paid him a visit as to whom we spoke this morning nothing could be more forlorn175 it is thus the next letter begins after cæsars death and the person he refers to is matius cæsars friend but in three weeks the world had become used to cæsars death the scene had passed away and the inhabitants of rome were already becoming accustomed to his absence but there can be no doubt as to ciceros presence at cæsars fall he says so clearly to atticus176 morabin throws a doubt upon it the story goes that brutus descending from the platform on which cæsar had been seated and brandishing the bloody dagger in his hand appealed to cicero morabin says that there is no proof of this and alleges that brutus did it for stage effect but he cannot have seen the letter above quoted or seeing it must have misunderstood it177  it soon became evident to the conspirators that they had scotched the snake and not killed it cassius and others had desired that antony also should be killed and with him lepidus that antony would be dangerous they were sure but marcus brutus and decimus overruled their counsels marcus had declared that the blood of the tyrant was all that the people required178 the people required nothing of the kind they were desirous only of ease and quiet and were anxious to follow either side which might be able to lead them and had something to give away but antony had been spared and though cowed at the moment by the death of cæsar and by the assumption of a certain dignified forbearance on the part of the conspirators was soon ready again to fight the battle for the cæsareans it is singular to see how completely he was cowed and how quickly he recovered himself  mommsen finishes his history with a loud pæan in praise of cæsar but does not tell us of his death his readers had they nothing else to inform them might be led to suppose that he had gone direct to heaven or at any rate had vanished from the world as soon as he had made the empire perfect he seems to have thought that had he described the work of the daggers in the senatehouse he would have acknowledged the mortality of his godlike hero we have no right to complain of his omissions for research for labor and for accuracy he has produced a work almost without parallel that he should have seen how great was cæsar because he accomplished so much and that he should have thought cicero to be small because burdened with scruples of justice he did so little is in the idiosyncrasy of the man a cæsar was wanted impervious to clemency to justice to moderationa man who could work with any tools men had forgotten what honesty was a person who refused a bribe was regarded not as an upright man but as a personal foe179 cæsar took money and gave bribes when he had the money to pay them without a scruple it would be absurd to talk about him as dishonest he was above honesty he was supra grammaticam it is well that some one should have arisen to sing the praises of such a mansome two or three in these latter days to me the character of the man is unpleasant to contemplate unimpressionable very far from divine there is none of the human softness necessary for love none of the human weakness needed for sympathy  on the 15th of march cæsar fell when the murder had been effected brutus and the others concerned in it went out among the people expecting to be greeted as saviors of their country brutus did address the populace and was well received but some bad feeling seems to have been aroused by hard expressions as to cæsars memory coming from one of the prætors for the people though they regarded cæsar as a tyrant and expressed themselves as gratified when told that the wouldbe king had been slaughtered still did not endure to hear ill spoken of him he had understood that it behooved a tyrant to be generous and appealed among them always with full handsnot having been scrupulous as to his mode of filling them then the conspirators frightened at menacing words from the crowd betook themselves to the capitol why they should have gone to the capitol as to a sanctuary i do not think that we know the capitol is that hill to a portion of which access is now had by the steps of the church of the ara coeli in front and from the forum in the rear on one side was the fall from the tarpeian rock down which malefactors were flung on the top of it was the temple to jupiter standing on the site of the present church and it was here that brutus and cassius and the other conspirators sought for safety on the evening of the day on which cæsar had been killed here they remained for the two following days till on the 18th they ventured down into the city on the 17th dolabella claimed to be consul in compliance with cæsars promise and on the same day the senate moved by antony decreed a public funeral to cæsar we may imagine that the decree was made by them with fainting hearts there were many fainting hearts in rome during those days for it became very soon apparent that the conspirators had carried their plot no farther than the death of cæsar  brutus as far as the public service was concerned was an unpractical useless man we know nothing of public work done by him to much purpose he was filled with high ideas as to his own position among the oligarchs and with especial notions as to what was due by rome to men of his name he had a fierce conception of his own rightsamong which to be prætor and consul and governor of a province were among the number but he had taken early in life to literature and philosophy and eschewed the crowd of fishponders such as were antony and dolabella men prone to indulge the luxury of their own senses his idea of liberty seems to have been much the same as cicerosthe liberty to live as one of the first men in rome but it was not accompanied as it was with cicero by an innate desire to do good to those around him to maintain the prætors consuls and governors so that each man high in position should win his way to them as he might be able to obtain the voices of the people and not to leave them to be bestowed at the call of one man who had thrust himself higher than allthat seems to have been his beau ideal of roman government it was ciceros alsowith the addition that when he had achieved his high place he should serve the people honestly brutus had killed cæsar but had spared antony thinking that all things would fall into their accustomed places when the tyrant should be no more but he found that cæsar had been tyrant long enough to create a lust for tyranny and that though he might suffice to kill a king he had no aptitude for ruling a people  it was now that those scenes took place which shakspeare has described with such accuracythe public funeral antonys oration and the rising of the people against the conspirators antony when he found that no plan had been devised for carrying on the government and that the men were struck by amazement at the deed they had themselves done collected his thoughts and did his best to put himself in cæsars place cicero had pleaded in the senate for a general amnesty and had carried it as far as the voice of the senate could do so but the amnesty only intended that men should pretend to think that all should be forgotten and forgiven there was no forgiving as there could be no forgetting then cæsars will was brought forth they could not surely dispute his will or destroy it in this way antony got hold of the dead mans papers and with the aid of the dead mans private secretary or amanuensis one fabricius began a series of most unblushing forgeries he procured or said that he procured a decree to be passed confirming by law all cæsars written purposes such a decree he could use to any extent to which he could carry with him the sympathies of the people he did use it to a great extent and seems at this period to have contemplated the assumption of dictatorial power in his own hands antony was nearly being one of the greatest rascals the world has known the desire was there and so was the intellect had it not been weighted by personal luxury and indulgence  now young octavius came upon the scene he was the greatnephew of cæsar whose sister julia had married one marcus atius their daughter atia had married caius octavius and of that marriage augustus was the child when octavius the father died atia the widow married marcius philippus who was consul bc 56 cæsar having no nearer heir took charge of the boy and had for the last years of his life treated him as his son though he had not adopted him at this period the youth had been sent to apollonia on the other side of the adriatic in macedonia to study with apollodorus a greek tutor and was there when he heard of cæsars death he was informed that cæsar had made him his heir and at once crossed over into italy with his friend agrippa on the way up to rome he met cicero at one of his southern villas and in the presence of the great orator behaved himself with becoming respect he was then not twenty years old but in the present difficulty of his position conducted himself with a caution most unlike a boy he had only come he said for what his greatuncle had left him and when he found that antony had spent the money does not appear to have expressed himself immediately in anger he went on to rome where he found that antony and dolabella and marcus brutus and decimus brutus and cassius were scrambling for the provinces and the legions some of the soldiers came to him asking him to avenge his uncles death but he was too prudent as yet to declare any purpose of revenge  not long after cæsars death cicero left rome and spent the ensuing month travelling about among his different villas on the 14th of april he writes to atticus declaring that whatever evil might befall him he would find comfort in the ides of march in the same letter he calls brutus and the others our heroes and begs his friend to send him newsor if not news then a letter without news180 in the next he again calls them his heroes but adds that he can take no pleasure in anything but in the deed that had been done men are still praising the work of cæsar and he laments that they should be so inconsistent though they laud those who had destroyed cæsar at the same time they praise his deeds181 in the same letter he tells atticus that the people in all the villages are full of joy it cannot be told how eager they arehow they run out to meet me and to hear my accounts of what was done but the senate passes no decree182 he speaks of going into greece to see his sonwhom he never lived to see againtelling him of letters from the lad from athens which he thinks however may be hypocritical though he is comforted by finding their language to be clear he has recovered his goodhumor and can be jocose one cluvius has left him a property at puteoli and the house has tumbled down but he has sent for chrysippus an architect but what are houses falling to him he can thank socrates and all his followers that they have taught him to disregard such worldly things nevertheless he has deemed it expedient to take the advice of a certain friend as to turning the tumbledown house into profitable shape183 a little later he expresses his great disgust that cæsar in the public speeches in rome should be spoken of as that great and most excellent man184 and yet he had said but a few months since in his oration for king deiotarus in the presence of cæsar that he looked only into his eyes only into his facethat he regarded only him the flattery and the indignant reprobation do in truth come very near upon each other and induce us to ask whether the fact of having to live in the presence of royalty be not injurious to the moral man could any of us have refused to speak to cæsar with adulationany of us whom circumstances compelled to speak to him power had made cæsar desirous of a mode of address hardly becoming a man to give or a man to receive does not the etiquette of today require from us certain courtesies of conversation which i would call abject were it not that etiquette requires them nevertheless making the best allowance that i can for cicero the difference of his language within a month or two is very painful in the letter above quoted octavius comes to him and we can see how willing was the young aspirant to flatter him  he sees already that in spite of the promised amnesty there must be internecine feud i shall have to go into the camp with young sextussextus pompeiusor perhaps with brutus a prospect at my years most odious then he quotes two lines of homer altering a word to you my child is not given the glory of war eloquence charming eloquence must be the weapon with which you will fight we hear of his contemplated journey into greece under the protection of a free legation he was going for the sake of his son but would not people say that he went to avoid the present danger and might it not be the case that he should be of service if he remained185 we see that the old state of doubt is again falling upon him greek aideomai trôas otherwise he could go and make himself safe in athens there is a correspondence between him and antony of which he sends copies to atticus antony writes to him begging him to allow sextus clodius to return from his banishment this sextus had been condemned because of the riot on the death of his uncle in milos affair and antony wishes to have him back cicero replies that he will certainly accede to antonys views it had always been a law with him he says not to maintain a feeling of hatred against his humbler enemies but in both these letters we see the subtilty and caution of the writers antony could have brought back sextus without cicero and cicero knew that he could do so cicero had no power over the law but it suited antony to write courteously a letter which might elicit an uncivil reply cicero however knew better and answered it civilly  he writes to tiro telling him that he has not the slightest intention of quarrelling with his old friend antony and will write to antony but not till he shall have seen him tiro showing on what terms of friendship he stands with his former slave for tiro had by this time been manumitted186 he writes to tiro quite as he might have written to a younger atticus and speaks to him of atticus with all the familiarity of confirmed friendship there must have been something very sweet in the nature of the intercourse which bound such a man as cicero to such another as tiro  atticus applies to him desiring him to use his influence respecting a certain question of importance as to buthrotum buthrotum was a town in epirus opposite to the island of corcyra in which atticus had an important interest the lands about the place were to be divided and to be distributed to roman soldiersmuch as we may suppose to the injury of atticus he has earnestly begged the interference of cicero for the protection of the buthrotians and cicero tells him that he wishes he could have seen antony on the subject but that antony is too much busied looking after the soldiers in the campagna cicero fails to have the wishes of atticus carried out and shortly the subject becomes lost in the general confusion but the discussion shows of how much importance at the present moment ciceros interference with antony is considered it shows also that up to this period a few months previous to the envenomed hatred of the second philippic antony and cicero were presumed to be on terms of intimate friendship  the worship of cæsar had been commenced in rome and an altar had been set up to him in the forum as to a god had cæsar when he perished been said to have usurped the sovereign authority his body would have been thrown out as unworthy of noble treatment such treatment the custom of the republic required it had been allowed to be buried and had been honored not disgraced now on the spot where the funeral pile had been made the altar was erected and crowds of men clamored round it worshipping that this was the work of antony we cannot doubt but dolabella ciceros repudiated soninlaw who in furtherance of a promise from cæsar had seized the consulship was jealous of antony and caused the altar to be thrown down and the worshippers to be dispersed many were killed in the strugglefor though the republic was so jealous of the lives of the citizens as not to allow a criminal to be executed without an expression of the voice of the entire people any number might fall in a street tumult and but little would be thought about it dolabella destroyed the altar and cicero was profuse in his thanks187 for though tullia had been divorced and had since died there was no cause for a quarrel divorces were so common that no family odium was necessarily created cicero was at this moment most anxious to get back from dolabella his daughters dowry it was never repaid indeed a time was quickly coming in which such payments were out of the question and dolabella soon took a side altogether opposed to the republicfor which he cared nothing he was bought by antony having been ready to be bought by any one he went to syria as governor before the end of the year and at smyrna on his road he committed one of those acts of horror on trebonius an adverse governor in which the romans of the day would revel when liberated from control cassius came to avenge his friend trebonius and dolabella finding himself worsted destroyed himself he had not progressed so far in corruption as verres because time had not permitted itbut that was the direction in which he was travelling at the present moment however no praise was too fervid to be bestowed upon him by ciceros pen that turning of cæsar into a god was opposed to every feeling of his heart both as to men and as to gods  a little farther on188 we find him complaining of the state of things very grievously that we should have feared this thing and not have feared the othermeaning cæsar and antony he declares that he must often read for his own consolation his treatise on old age then just written and addressed to atticus old age is making me bitter he says i am annoyed at everything but my life has been lived let the young look to the future we here meet the name of cærellia in a letter to his friend she had probably been sent to make up the quarrel between him and his young wife publilia nothing came of it and it is mentioned only because cærellias name has been joined so often with that of cicero by subsequent writers in the whole course of his correspondence with atticus i do not remember it to occur except in one or two letters at this period i imagine that some story respecting the lady was handed down and was published by dio cassius when the greek historian found that it served his purpose to abuse cicero  on june 22nd he sent news to atticus of his nephew young quintus had written home to his father to declare his repentance he had been in receipt of money from antony and had done antonys dirty work he had been antoni dextellaantonys right handaccording to cicero and had quarrelled absolutely with his father and his uncle he now expresses his sorrow and declares that he would come himself at once but that there might be danger to his father and there is money to be expected if he will only wait did you ever hear of a worse knave cicero adds probably not but yet he was able to convince his father and his uncle and some time afterward absolutely offered to prosecute antony for stealing the public money out of the treasury he thought as did some others that the course of things was going against antony as a consequence of this he was named in the proscriptions and killed with his father in the same letter cicero consults atticus as to the best mode of going to greece brundisium is the usual way but he has been told by tiro that there are soldiers in the town189 he is now at arpinum on his journey and receives a letter from brutus inviting him back to rome to see the games given by brutus he is annoyed to think that brutus should expect this these shows are now only honorable to him who is bound to give them he says i am not bound to see them and to be present would be dishonorable190 then comes his parting with atticus showing a demonstrative tenderness foreign to the sternness of our northern nature that you should have wept when you had parted from me has grieved me greatly had you done it in my presence i should not have gone at all191 nonis juliis192 he exclaims the name of july had already come into usethe name which has been in use ever sincethe name of the man who had now been destroyed the idea distresses him shall brutus talk of july it seems that some advertisement had been published as to his games in which the month was so called  writing from one of his villas in the south he tells atticus that his nephew has again been with him and has repented him of all his sins i think that cicero never wrote anything vainer than this he has been so changed he says by reading some of my writings which i happened to have by me and by my words and precepts that he is just such a citizen as i would have him193 could it be that he should suppose that one whom he had a few days since described as the biggest knave he knew should be so changed by a few words well written and well pronounced young quintus must in truth have been a clever knave in the same letter cicero tells us that tiro had collected about seventy of his letters with a view to publication we have at present over seven hundred written before that day  just as he is starting he gives his friend a very wide commission by your love for me do manage my matters for me i have left enough to pay everything that i owe but it will happen as it often does that they who owe me will not be punctual if anything of that kind should happen only think of my character put me right before the world by borrowing or even by selling if it be necessary194 this is not the language of a man in distress but of one anxious that none should lose a shilling by him he again thinks of starting from brundisium and promises when he has arrived there instantly to begin a new work he has sent his de gloria to atticus a treatise which we have lost we should be glad to know how he treated this most difficult subject we are astonished at his fecundity and readiness he was now nearly sixtythree and as he travels about the country he takes with him all the adjuncts necessary for the writing of treatises such as he composed at this period of his life his topica containing aristotelian instructions as to a lawyers work he put together on board ship immediately after this for the benefit of trebatius to whom it had been promised  july had come and at last he resolved to sail from pompeii and to coast round to sicily he lands for a night at velia where he finds brutus with whom he has an interview then he writes a letter to trebatius who had there a charming villa bought no doubt with gallic spoils he is reminded of his promise and going on to rhegium writes his topica which he sends to trebatius from that place thence he went across to syracuse but was afraid to stay there fearing that his motions might be watched and that antony would think that he had objects of state in his journey he had already been told that some attributed his going to a desire to be present at the olympian games but the first notion seems to have been that he had given the republic up as lost and was seeking safety elsewhere from this we are made to perceive how closely his motions were watched and how much men thought of them from syracuse he started for athenswhich place however he was doomed never to see again he was carried back to leucopetra on the continent and though he made another effort he was he says again brought back there at the villa of his friend valerius he learned tidings which induced him to change his purpose and hurry off to rome brutus and cassius had published a decree of the senate calling all the senators and especially the consulares to rome there was reason to suppose that antony was willing to relax his pretensions they had strenuously demanded his attendance and whispers were heard that he had fled from the difficulties of the times when i heard this i at once abandoned my journey with which indeed i had never been well pleased195 then he enters into a long disquisition with atticus as to the advice which had been given to him both by atticus and by brutus and he says some hard words to atticus but he leaves an impression on the readers mind that brutus had so disturbed him by what had passed between them at velia that from that moment his doubts as to going which had been always strong had overmastered him it was not the winds at leucopetra that hindered his journey but the taunting words which brutus had spoken it was suggested to him that he was deserting his country the reproach had been felt by him to be heavy for he had promised to atticus that he would return by the first of january yet he could not but feel that there was something in it of truth the very months during which he would be absent would be the months of danger indeed looking out upon the political horizon then it seemed as though the nearest months those they were then passing would be the most dangerous if antony could be got rid of be made to leave italy there might be something for an honest senator to doa man with consular authoritya something which might not jeopardize his life when men now call a politician of those days a coward for wishing to avoid the heat of the battle they hardly think what it is for an old man to leave his retreat and rush into the forum and there encounter such a one as antony and such soldiers as were his soldiers cicero who had been brave enough in the emergencies of his career and had gone about his work sometimes regardless of his life no doubt thought of all this it would be pleasant to him again to see his son and to look upon the rough doings of rome from amid the safety of athens but when his countrymen told him that he had not as yet done enoughwhen brutus with his cold bitter words rebuked him for goingthen his thoughts turned round on the quick pivot on which they were balanced and he hurried back to the fight  he travelled at once up to rome which he reached on the last of august and there received a message from antony demanding his presence in the senate on the next day he had been greeted on his journey once again by the enthusiastic welcome of his countrymen who looked to receive some especial advantage from his honesty and patriotism once again he was made proud by the clamors of a trusting people but he had not come to rome to be antonys puppet antony had some measure to bring before the senate in honor of cæsar which it would not suit cicero to support or to oppose he sent to say that he was tired after his journey and would not come upon this the critics deal hardly with him and call him a coward with an incredible pusillanimity says m du rozoir cicero excused himself alleging his health and the fatigue of his voyage he pretended that he was too tired to be present says mr long it appears to me that they who have read ciceros works with the greatest care have become so enveloped by the power of his words as to expect from them an unnatural weight if a politician of today finding that it did not suit him to appear in the house of commons on a certain evening and that it would best become him to allow a debate to pass without his presence were to make such an excuse would he be treated after the same fashion pusillanimity and pretence in regard to those philippics in which he seems to have courted death by every harsh word that he uttered the reader who has begun to think so must change his mind and be prepared as he progresses to find quite another fault with cicero impetuous selfconfident rash throwing down the gage with internecine fury striving to crush with his words the man who had the command of the legions of rome sticking at nothing which could inflict a blow forcing men by his descriptions to such contempt of antony that they should be induced to leave the stronger party lest they too should incur something of the wrath of the oratorthat they will find to be the line which cicero adopted and the demeanor he put on during the next twelve months he thundered with his philippics through rome addressing now the senate and now the people with a hardihood which you may condemn as being unbecoming one so old who should have been taught equanimity by experience but pusillanimity and pretence will not be the offences you will bring against him  antony not finding that cicero had come at his call declared in the senate that he would send his workmen to dig him out from his house cicero alludes to this on the next day without passion196 antony was not present and in this speech he expresses no bitterness of anger it should hardly have been named one of the philippics which title might well have been commenced with the second the name it should be understood has been adopted from a jocular allusion by cicero to the philippics of demosthenes made in a letter to brutus we have at least the reply of brutus if indeed the letter be genuine which is much to be doubted197 but he had no purpose of affixing his name to them for many years afterward they were called antonianæ and the first general use of the term by which we know them has probably been comparatively modern the one name does as well as another but it is odd that speeches from demosthenes should have given a name to others so well known as these made by cicero against antony plutarch however mentions the name saying that it had been given to the speeches by cicero himself  in this the first he is ironically reticent as to antonys violence and unpatriotic conduct antony was not present and cicero tells his hearers with a pleasant joke that to antony it may be allowed to be absent on the score of illhealth though the indulgence had been refused to him antony is his friend and why had antony treated him so roughly was it unusual for senators to be absent was hannibal at the gate or were they dealing for peace with pyrrhus as was the case when they brought the old blind appius down to the house then he comes to the question of the hour which was nominally the sanctioning as law those acts of cæsars which he had decreed by his own will before his death when a tyrant usurps power for a while and is then deposed no more difficult question can be debated is it not better to take the law as he leaves it even though the law has become a law illegally than encounter all the confusion of retrograde action nothing could have been more iniquitous than some of sullas laws but cicero had opposed their abrogation but here the question was one not of cæsars laws but of decrees subsequently made by antony and palmed off upon the people as having been found among cæsars papers soon after cæsars death a decision had been obtained by antony in favor of cæsars laws or acts and hence had come these impudent forgeries under the guise of which antony could cause what writings he chose to be made public i think that cæsars acts should be maintained says cicero not as being in themselves good for that no one can assert i wish that antony were present here without his usual friends he adds alluding to his armed satellites he would tell us after what manner he would maintain those acts of cæsars are they to be found in notes and scraps and small documents brought forward by one witness or not brought forward at all but only told to us and shall those which he engraved in bronze and which he wished to be known as the will of the people and as perpetual lawsshall they go for nothing198 here was the point in dispute the decree had been voted soon after cæsars death giving the sanction of the senate to his laws for peace this had been done as the best way out of the difficulty which oppressed the state but it was intolerable that under this sanction antony should have the power of bringing forth new edicts day after day while the very laws which cæsar had passed were not maintained what better law was there or more often demanded in the best days of the republic than that law passed by cæsar under which the provinces were to be held by the prætors only for one year and by the consuls for not more than two but this law is abolished so it is thus that cæsars acts are to be maintained199 antony no doubt and his friends having an eye to the fruition of the provinces had found among cæsars papersor said they had foundsome writing to suit their purpose all things to be desired were to be found among cæsars papers the banished are brought back from banishment the right of citizenship is given not only to individuals but to whole nations and provinces exceptions from taxations are granted by the dead mans voice200 antony had begun probably with some one or two more modest forgeries and had gone on strengthened in impudence by his own success till cæsar dead was like to be worse to them than cæsar living the whole speech is dignified patriotic and bold asserting with truth that which he believed to be right but never carried into invective or dealing with expressions of anger it is very short but i know no speech of his more closely to its purpose i can see him now with his toga round him as he utters the final words i have lived perhaps long enoughboth as to length of years and the glory i have won what little may be added shall be not for myself but for you and for the republic the words thus spoken became absolutely true     chapter ix  the philippics   sidenote bc 44 ætat 63  cicero was soon driven by the violence of antonys conduct to relinquish the idea of moderate language and was ready enough to pick up the gauntlet thrown down for him from this moment to the last scene of his life it was all the fury of battle and the shout of victory and then the scream of despair antony when he read ciceros speech the first philippic the language of which was no doubt instantly sent to him seems to have understood at once that he must either vanquish cicero or be vanquished by him he appreciated to the letter the ironically cautious language in which his conduct was exposed he had not chosen to listen to cicero but was most anxious to get cicero to listen to him those advocates of whom cicero had spoken would be around him and at a nod or perhaps without a nod would do to cicero as brutus and cassius had done to cæsar the last meeting of the senate had been on the 2d of september when it was over antony we are told went down to his villa at tivoli and there devoted himself for above a fortnight to the getting up of a speech by which he might silence or at any rate answer cicero nor did he leave himself to his own devices but took to himself a master of eloquence who might teach him when to make use of his arms where to stamp his feet and in what way to throw his toga about with a graceful passion he was about forty at this time201 and in the full flower of his manhood yet for such a purpose he did not suppose himself to know all that lessons would teach him in the art of invective there he remained mouthing out his phrases in the presence of his preceptor till he had learned by heart all that the preceptor knew then he summoned cicero to meet him in the senate on the 19th this cicero was desirous of doing but was prevented by his friends who were afraid of the advocates there is extant a letter from cicero to cassius in which he states it to be well known in rome that antony had declared that he cicero had been the author of cæsars death in order that cæsars old soldiers might slay him202 there were other senators he says who did not dare to show themselves in the senatehousepiso and servilius and cotta antony came down and made his practised oration against cicero the words of his speech have not been preserved but cicero has told us the manner of it and some of the phrases which he used the authority is not very good but we may imagine from the results that his story is not far from the truth from first to last it was one violent tirade of abuse which he seemed to vomit forth from his jaws rather than to speak after the manner of a roman consular such is ciceros description  it has been said of antony that we hear of him only from his enemies he left behind him no friend to speak for him and we have heard of him certainly from one enemy but the tidings are of a nature to force upon us belief in the evil which cicero spoke of him had he been a man of decent habits of life and of an honest purpose would cicero have dared to say to the romans respecting him the words which he produced not only in the second philippic which was unspoken but also in the twelve which followed the record of him as far as it goes is altogether bad plutarch tells us that he was handsome and a good soldier but altogether vicious plutarch is not a biographer whose word is to be taken as to details but he is generally correct in his estimate of character tacitus tells us but little about him as direct history but mentions him ever in the same tone tacitus knew the feeling of rome regarding him paterculus speaks specially of his fraud and breaks out into strong repudiation of the murder of cicero203 valerius maximus in his anecdotes mentions him slightingly as an evil man is spoken of who has forced himself into notice virgil has stamped his name with everlasting ignominy sequiturque nefas egyptia conjux i can think of no roman writer who has named him with honor he was a roman of the daywhat rome had made himbrave greedy treacherous and unpatriotic  cicero again was absent from the senate but was in rome when antony attacked him we learn from a letter to cornificius that antony left the city shortly afterward and went down to brundisium to look after the legions which had come across from macedonia with which cicero asserts that he intends to tyrannize over them all in rome204 he then tells his correspondent that young octavius has just been discovered in an attempt to have antony murdered but that antony having found the murderer in his house had not dared to complain he seems to think that octavius had been right the state of things was such that men were used to murder but this story was probably not true he passes on to declare in the next sentence that he receives such consolation from philosophy as to be able to bear all the ills of fortune he himself goes to puteoli and there he writes the second philippic it is supposed to be the most violent piece of invective ever produced by human ingenuity and human anger the readers of it must however remember that it was not made to be spokenwas not even written as far as we are aware to be shown to antony or to be published to the world we do not even know that antony ever saw it there has been an idea prevalent that antonys anger was caused by it and that cicero owed to it his death but the surmise is based on probabilitynot at all on evidence cicero when he heard what antony had said of him appears to have written all the evil he could say of his enemy in order that he might send it to atticus it contained rather what he could have published than what he did intend to publish he does indeed suggest in the letter which accompanied the treatise when sent to atticus in some only halfintelligible words that he hopes the time may come when the speech shall find its way freely even into sicas house205 but we gather even from that his intention that it should have no absolutely public circulation he had struggled to be as severe as he knew how but had done it as it were with a halter round his neck and for antonys angerthe anger which afterward produced the proscriptionthere came to be cause enough beyond this before that day he had endeavored to stir up the whole empire against antony and had all but succeeded  it has been alleged that cicero again shows his cowardice by writing and not speaking his oration and also by writing it only for private distribution if he were a coward why did he write it at all if he were a coward why did he hurry into this contest with antony if he be blamed because his philippic was anonymous how do the anonymous writers of today escape if because he wrote it and did not speak it what shall be said of the party writers of today he was a coward say his accusers because he avoided a danger have they thought of the danger which he did run when they bring those charges against him of what was the nature of the fight do they remember how many romans in public life had been murdered during the last dozen years we are well aware how far custom goes and that men became used to the fear of violent death cicero was now habituated to that fear and was willing to face it but not on that account are we to imagine that with his eyes open he was to be supposed always ready to rush into immediate destruction to write a scurrilous attack such as the second philippic is a bad exercise for the ingenuity of a great man but so is any anonymous satire it is so in regard to our own times which have received the benefit of all antecedent civilization cicero being in the midst of those heartless romans is expected to have the polished manners and high feelings of a modern politician i have hardly a right to be angry with his critics because by his life he went so near to justify the expectation  he begins by asking his supposed hearers how it has come to pass that during the last twenty years the republic had had no enemy who was not also his enemy and you antony whom i have never injured by a word why is it that more brazenfaced than catiline more fierce than clodius you should attack me with your maledictions will your enmity against me be a recommendation for you to every evil citizen in rome    why does not antony come down among us today he says as though he were in the senate and antony were away he gives a birthday fête in his garden to whom i wonder i will name no one to phormio perhaps or gnatho or ballion oh incredible baseness lust and impudence not to be borne these were the vile knaves of the roman comedythe nyms pistols and bobadils your consulship no doubt will be salutary but mine did only evil you talk of my verses he saysantony having twitted him with the cedant arma togæ i will only say that you do not understand them or any other clodius was killed by my counselswas he what would men have said had they seen him running from you through the forumyou with your drawn sword and him escaping up the stairs of the booksellers shop206    it was by my advice that cæsar was killed i fear o conscript fathers lest i should seem to have employed some false witness to flatter me with praises which do not belong to me who has ever heard me mentioned as having been conversant with that glorious affair among those who did do the deed whose name has been hiddenor indeed is not most widely known some had been inclined to boast that they were there though they were absent but not one who was present has ever endeavored to conceal his name  you deny that i have had legacies i wish it were true for then my friends might still be living but where have you learned that seeing that i have inherited twenty million sesterces207 i am happier in this than you no one but a friend has made me his heir lucius rubrius cassinas whom you never even saw has named you he here refers to a man over whose property antony was supposed to have obtained control fraudulently did he know of you whether you were a white man or a negro    would you mind telling me what height turselius stood here he names another of whose property antony is supposed to have obtained possession illegally i believe all you know of him is what farms he had    do you bear in mind he says that you were a bankrupt as soon as you had become a man do you remember your early friendship with curio and the injuries you did his father here it is impossible to translate literally but after speaking as he had done very openly he goes on but i must omit the iniquities of your private life there are things i cannot repeat here you are safe because the deeds you have done are too bad to be mentioned but let us look at the affairs of your public life i will just go through them which he does laying bare as he well knew how to do every past act when you had been made quæstor you flew at once to cæsar you knew that he was the only refuge for poverty debt wickedness and vice then when you had gorged upon his generosity and your plunderingswhich indeed you spent faster than you got ityou betook yourself instantly to the tribunate    it is you antony you who supplied cæsar with an excuse for invading his country cæsar had declared at the rubicon that the tribunate had been violated in the person of antony i will say nothing here against cæsar though nothing can excuse a man for taking up arms against his country but of you it has to be confessed that you were the cause    he has been a very helen to us trojans    he has brought back many a wretched exile but has forgotten altogether his own uncleciceros colleague in the consulship who had been banished for plundering his province we have seen this tribune of the people carried through the town on a british warchariot his lictors with their laurels went before him in the midst on an open litter was carried an actress when you come back from thessaly with your legions to brundisium you did not kill me oh what a kindness    you with those jaws of yours with that huge chest with that body like a gladiator drank so much wine at hippeas marriage that in the sight of all rome you were forced to vomit   when he had seized pompeys property he rejoiced like some stageactor who in a play is as poor as poverty and then suddenly becomes rich all his wine the great weight of silver the costly furniture and rich dresses in a few days where were they all a charybdis do i call him he swallowed them all like an entire ocean then he accuses him of cowardice and cruelty in the pharsalian wars and compares him most injuriously with dolabella do you remember how dolabella fought for you in spain when you were getting drunk at narbo and how did you get back from narbo he has asked as to my return to the city i have explained to you o conscript fathers how i had intended to be here in january so as to be of some service to the republic you inquire how i got back in daylightnot in the dark as you did with roman shoes on and a roman toganot in barbaric boots and an old cloak   when cæsar returned from spain you again pushed yourself into his intimacynot a brave man we should say but still strong enough for his purposes cæsar did always thisthat if there were a man ruined steeped in debt up to his ears in povertya base needy bold manthat was the man whom he could receive into his friendship this as to cæsar was undoubtedly true recommended in this way you were told to declare yourself consul then he describes the way in which he endeavored to prevent the nomination of dolabella to the same office cæsar had said that dolabella should be consul but when cæsar was dead this did not suit antony when the tribes had been called in their centuries to vote antony not understanding what form of words he ought to have used as augur to stop the ceremony had blundered would you not call him a very lælius says cicero lælius had made for himself a name among augurs for excellence  miserable that you are you throw yourself at cæsars feet asking only permission to be his slave you sought for yourself that state of slavery which it has ever been easy for you to endure had you any command from the roman people to ask the same for them oh that eloquence of yours when naked you stood up to harangue the people who ever saw a fouler deed than that or one more worthy scourges has tarquin suffered for this have spurius cassius melius and marcus manlius suffered that after many ages a king should be set up in rome by marc antony with abuse of a similar kind he goes on to the end of his declamation when he again professes himself ready to die at his post in defence of the republic that he now made up his mind so to die should it become necessary we may take for granted but we cannot bring ourselves to approve of the storm of abuse under which he attempted to drown the memory and name of his antagonist so virulent a torrent of words all seeming as we read them to have been poured out in rapid utterances by the keen energy of the moment astonish us when we reflect that it was the work of his quiet moments that he should have prepared such a task in the seclusion of his closet is marvellous it has about it the very ring of sudden passion but it must be acknowledged that it is not palatable it is more roman and less english than anything we have from ciceroexcept his abuse of piso with whom he was again now half reconciled  but it was solely on behalf of his country that he did it he had grieved when cæsar had usurped the functions of the government but in his grief he had respected cæsar and had felt that he might best carry on the contest by submission but when cæsar was dead and antony was playing tyrant his very soul rebelled then he sat down to prepare his first instalment of keen personal abuse adding word to word and phrase to phrase till he had built up this unsavory monument of vituperation it is by this that antony is now known to the world plutarch makes no special mention of the second philippic in his life of antony he does not allude to these orations at all but in that of cicero he tells us how antony had ordered that right hand to be brought to him with which cicero had written his philippics  the young octavius of shakespeare had now taken the name of octavianuscaius julius cæsar octavianusand had quarrelled to the knife with antony he had assumed that he had been adopted by cæsar and now demanded all the treasures his uncle had collected as his own antony who had already stolen them declared that they belonged to the state at any rate there was cause enough for quarrelling among them and they were enemies each seems to have brought charges of murder against the other and each was anxious to obtain possession of the soldiery seen as we see now the period in rome of which we are writingevery safeguard of the republic gone all law trampled under foot consuls prætors and tribunes not elected but forced upon the state all things in disorder the provinces becoming the open prey of the greediest plundererit is apparent enough that there could be no longer any hope for a cicero the marvel is that the everyday affairs of life should have been carried on with any reference to the law when we are told that antony stole cæsars treasures and paid his debts with them we are inclined to ask why he had paid his debts at all but cicero did hope in his whole life there is nothing more remarkable than the final vitality with which he endeavored to withstand the coming deluge of military despotism nor in all history is there anything more wonderful than the capacity of power to reestablish itself as is shown by the orderly empire of augustus growing out of the disorder left by cæsar one is reminded by it of the impotency of a reckless heir to bring to absolute ruin the princely property of a great nobleman brought together by the skill of many careful progenitors a thing will grow to be so big as to be all but indestructible it is like that tower of cæcilia metella against which the storms of twenty centuries have beaten in vain looking at the state of the roman empire when cicero died who would not declare its doom but it did retrick its beams not so much by the hand of one man augustus as by the force of the concrete power collected within itquod non imber edax non aquilo impotens possit diruere208 cicero with patriotic gallantry thought that even yet there might be a chance for the old republicthought that by his eloquence by his vehemence of words he could turn men from fraud to truth and from the lust of plundering a province to a desire to preserve their country of antony now he despaired but he still hoped that his words might act upon this young cæsars heart the youth was as callous as though he had already ruled a province for three years no roman was ever more cautious more wise more heartless more able to pick his way through blood to a throne than the young augustus cicero fears octavianas we must now call himand knows that he can only be restrained by the keeping of power out of his hands writing to atticus from arpinum he says i agree altogether with you if octavian gets power into his hands he will insist upon the tyrants decrees much more thoroughly than he did when the senate sat in the temple of tellus everything then will be done in opposition to brutus but if he be conquered then see how intolerable would be the dominion of antony209 in the same letter he speaks of the de officiis which he has just written in his next and last epistle to his old friend he congratulates himself on having been able at last to quarrel with dolabella dolabella had turned upon him in the end bought by antonys money he then returns to the subject of octavian and his doubts as to his loyalty he has been asked to pledge himself to octavian but has declined till he shall see how the young man will behave when casea becomes candidate for the tribunate if he show himself to be caseas enemy casea having been one of the conspirators cicero will know that he is not to be trusted then he falls into a despairing mood and declares that there is no hope even hippocrates was unwilling to bestow medicine on those to whom it could avail nothing but he will go to rome into the very jaws of the danger it is less base for such as i am to fall publicly than privately with these words almost the last written by him to atticus this correspondence is brought to an end the most affectionate the most trusting and the most open ever published to the world as having come from one man to another no letters more useful to the elucidation of character were ever written but when read for that purpose they should be read with care and should hardly be quoted till they have been understood  sidenote bc 44 ætat 63  the struggles for the provinces were open and acknowledged under cæsar decimus brutus had been nominated for cisalpine gaul marcus brutus for macedonia and cassius for syria it will be observed that these three men were the most prominent among the conspirators since that time antony and dolabella had obtained votes of the people to alter the arrangement antony was to go to macedonia and dolabella to syria this was again changed when antony found that decimus had left rome to take up his command he sent his brother caius to macedonia and himself claimed to be governor of cisalpine gaul hence there were two roman governors for each province and in each case each governor was determined to fight for the possession antony hurried out of rome before the end of the year with the purpose of hindering decimus from the occupation of the north of italy and cicero went up to rome determined to take a part in the struggle which was imminent the senate had been summoned for the 19th of december and attended in great numbers then it was that he spoke the third philippic and in the evening of the same day he spoke the fourth to the people it should be understood that none of these speeches were heard by antony cicero had at this time become the acknowledged chief of the republican party having drifted into the position which pompey had so long filled many of cæsars friends frightened by his death or rather cowed by the absence of his genius had found it safer to retreat from the cæsarean party of which the antonys with dolabella the cutthroats and gladiators of the empire had the command hirtius and pansa with balbus and oppius were among them they at this moment were powerful in rome the legions were dividedsome with antony some with octavian and some with decimus brutus the greater number were with antony whom they hated for his cruelty but were with him because the mantle of cæsars power had fallen on to his shoulders it was felt by cicero that if he could induce octavian to act with him the republic might be again established he would surely have influence enough to keep the lad from hankering after his great uncles pernicious power he was aware that the dominion did in fact belong to the owner of the soldiers but he thought that he could control this boyofficer and thus have his legions at the command of the republic  the senate had been called together nominally for the purpose of desiring the consuls of the year to provide a guard for its own safety cicero makes it an occasion for perpetuating the feeling against antony which had already become strong in rome he breaks out into praise of octavian whom he calls this young cæsaralmost a boy tells them what divine things the boy had already done and how he had drawn away from the rebels those two indomitable legions the martia and the fourth then he proceeds to abuse antony tarquinius the man whose name was most odious to romans had been unendurable as a tyrant though himself not a bad man but antonys only object is to sell the empire and to spend the price antony had convoked the senate for november threatening the senators with awful punishments should they absent themselves but when the day came antony the consul had himself fled he not only pours out the vials of his wrath but of his ridicule upon antonys head and quotes his bungling words he gives instances of his imprudence and his impotence and of his greed then he again praises the young cæsar and the two consuls for the next year and the two legions and decimus brutus who is about to fight the battle of the republic for them in the north of italy and votes that the necessary guard be supplied in the same evening he addresses the people in his fourth philippic he again praises the lad and the two legions and again abuses antony no one can say after this day that he hid his anger or was silent from fear he congratulates the romans on their patriotismvain congratulationsand encourages them to make new efforts he bids them rejoice that they have a hero such as decimus brutus to protect their liberties and almost that they have such an enemy as antony to conquer it seems that his words few as they wereperhaps because they were so fewtook hold of the peoples imaginations so that they shouted to him that he had on that day a second time saved his country as he reminds them afterward210  from this time forward we are without those intimate and friendly letters which we have had with us as our guide through the last twentyone years of ciceros life for though we have a large body of correspondence written during the last year of his life which are genuine they are written in altogether a different style from those which have gone before they are for the most part urgent appeals to those of his political friends to whom he can look for support in his viewsoften to those to whom he looked in vain they are passionate prayers for the performance of a public duty and as such are altogether to the writers credit his letters to plancus are beautiful in their patriotism as are also those to decimus brutus when we think of his age of his zeal of his earnestness and of the dangers which he ran we hardly know how sufficiently to admire the public spirit with which at such a crisis he had taken on himself to lead the party but our guide to his inner feelings is gone there are no further letters to tell us of every doubt at his heart we think of him as of some stalwart commander left at home to arrange the affairs of the war while the less experienced men were sent to the van  there is also a book of letters published as having passed between cicero and junius brutus the critics have generally united in condemning them as spurious they are at any rate if genuine cold and formal in their language  sidenote bc 43 ætat 64  antony had proceeded into cisalpine gaul to drive out of the province the consul named by the people to govern it the nomination of decimus had in truth been cæsars nomination but the right of decimus to rule was at any rate better than that of any other claimant he had been appointed in accordance with the power then in existence and his appointment had been confirmed by the decree of the senate sanctioning all cæsars acts it was after all a question of simple power for cæsar had overridden every legal form it became necessary however that they who were in power in rome should decide the consuls hirtius and pansa had been cæsars friends and had also been the friends of antony they had not the trust in antony which cæsar had inspired but they were anxious to befriend himor rather not to break with him when the senate met they called on one fufius calenuswho was antonys friend and pansas fatherinlawfirst to offer his opinion he had been one of cæsars consuls appointed for a month or two and was now chosen for the honorable part of first spokesman as being a consular senator he was for making terms with antony and suggested that a deputation of three senators should be sent to him with a message calling upon him to retire the object probably was to give antony time or rather to give octavian time to join with antony if it suited him others spoke in the same sense and then cicero was desired to give his opinion this was the fifth philippic he is all for war with antonyor rather he will not call it war but a public breach of the peace which antony has made he begins mildly enough but warms with his subject as he goes on should they send ambassadors to a traitor to his country    let him return from mutina i keep the old latin name which is preserved for us in that of modena let him cease to contend with decimus let him depart out of gaul it is not fit that we should send to implore him to do so we should by force compel him    we are not sending messengers to hannibal who if hannibal would not obey might be desired to go on to carthage whither shall the men go if antony refuses to obey them but it is of no use with eloquent words he praises octavian and the two legions and decimus he praises even the coward lepidus who was in command of legions and was now governor of gaul beyond the alps and of northern spain and proposes that the people should put up to him a gilt statue on horsebackso important was it to obtain if possible his services alas it was impossible that such a man should be moved by patriotic motives lepidus was soon to go with the winning side and became one of the second triumvirate with antony and octavian  ciceros eloquence was on this occasion futile at this sitting the senate came to no decision but on the third day afterward they decreed that the senators servius sulpicius lucius piso and lucius philippus should be sent to antony the honors which he had demanded for lepidus and the others were granted but he was outvoted in regard to the ambassadors on the 4th of january cicero again addressed the people in the forum his task was very difficult he wished to give no offence to the senate and yet was anxious to stir the citizens and to excite them to a desire for immediate war the senate he told them had not behaved disgracefully but hadtemporized the war unfortunately must be delayed for those twenty days necessary for the going and coming of the ambassadors the ambassadors could do nothing but still they must wait in the mean time he will not be idle for them the roman people he will work and watch with all his experience with diligence almost above his strength to repay them for their faith in him when cæsar was with them they had had no choice but obedienceso much the times were out of joint if they submit themselves to be slaves now it will be their own fault then in general language he pronounces an opinionwhich was the general roman feeling of the day it is not permitted to the roman people to become slavesthat people whom the immortal gods have willed to rule all nations of the earth211 so he ended the sixth philippic which like the fourth was addressed to the people all the others were spoken in the senate  he writes to decimus at mutina about this time a letter full of hopeof hope which we can see to be genuine recruits are being raised in all italyif that can be called recruiting which is in truth a spontaneous rushing into arms of the entire population212 he expects letters telling him what our hirtius is doing and what my young cæsar hirtius and pansa the consuls of the year though they had been cæsars party and made consuls by cæsar were forced to fight for the republic they had been on friendly terms with cicero and they doubted antony hirtius had now followed the army and pansa was about to do so they both fell in the battle that was fought at mutina and no one can now accuse them of want of loyalty but my cæsar on whose behalf cicero made so many sweet speeches for whose glory he was so careful whose early republican principles he was so anxious to direct made his terms with antony on the first occasion at that time cicero wrote to plancus consul elect for the next year and places before his eyes a picture of all that he can do for the republic lay yourself outyes i pray you by the immortal godsfor that which will bring you to the height of glory and renown213  at the end of january or beginning of february he again addressed the senate on the subject of the embassya matter altogether foreign from that which it had been convoked to discuss to ciceros mind there was no other subject at the present moment fit to occupy the thoughts of a roman senator we have met together to settle something about the appian way and something about the coinage the mind revolts from such little cares torn by greater matters the ambassadors are expected backtwo of them at least for sulpicius had died on his road he cautions the senate against receiving with quiet composure such an answer as antony will probably send them why do ii who am a man of peacerefuse peace because it is base because it is full of dangerbecause peace is impossible then he proceeds to explain that it is so what a disgrace would it be that antony after so many robberies after bringing back banished comrades after selling the taxes of the state putting up kingdoms to auction shall rise up on the consular bench and address a free senate    can you have an assured peace while there is an antony in the stateor many antonys or how can you be at peace with one who hates you as does he or how can he be at peace with those who hate him as do you    you have such an opportunity he says at last as never fell to the lot of any you are able with all senatorial dignity with all the zeal of the knights with all the favor of the roman people now to make the republic free from fear and danger once and forever then he thus ends his speech about those things which have been brought before us i agree with servilius that is the seventh philippic  in february the ambassadors returned but returned laden with bad tidings servius sulpicius who was to have been their chief spokesman died just as they reached antony the other two immediately began to treat with him so as to become the bearers back to rome of conditions proposed by him this was exactly what they had been told not to do they had carried the orders of the senate to their rebellious officer and then admitted the authority of that rebel by bringing back his propositions they were not even allowed to go into mutina so as to see decimus but they were in truth only too well in accord with the majority of the senate whose hearts were with antony anything to those lovers of their fishponds was more desirable than a return to the loyalty of the republic the deputies were received by the senate who discussed their embassy and on the next day they met again when cicero pronounced his eighth philippic why he did not speak on the previous day i do not know middleton is somewhat confused in his account morabin says that cicero was not able to obtain a hearing when the deputies were received the senate did on that occasion come to a decision against which act of pusillanimity cicero on the following day expressed himself very vehemently they had decided that this was not to be called a war but rather a tumult and seem to have hesitated in denouncing antony as a public enemy the senate was convoked on the next day to decide the terms of the amnesty to be accorded to the soldiers who had followed antony when cicero again throwing aside the minor matter burst upon them in his wrath he had hitherto inveighed against antony now his anger is addressed to the senate lucius cæsar he said has told us that he is antonys uncle and must vote as such are you all uncles to antony then he goes on to show that war is the only name by which this rebellion can be described has not hirtius who has gone away sick as he is called it a war has not young cæsar young as he is prompted to it by no one undertaken it as a war he repeats the words of a letter from hirtius which could only have been used in war i have taken claterna their cavalry has been put to flight a battle has been fought so many men have been killed this is what you call peace then he speaks of other civil wars which he says have grown from difference of opinionexcept that last between pompey and cæsar as to which i will not speak i have been ignorant of its cause and have hated its ending but in this war all men are of one opinion who are worthy of the name of romans we are fighting for the temples of our gods for our walls our homes for the abode of the roman people for their penates their altars their hearths for the graves of ancestorsand we are fighting only against antony    fufius calenus tells us of peaceas though i of all men did not know that peace was a blessing but tell me calenus is slavery peace he is very angry with calenus although he has called him his friend he was in great wrath against him i am fighting for decimus and you for antony i wish to preserve a roman city you wish to see it battered to the ground can you deny this you who are creating all means of delays by which decimus may be weakened and antony made strong  i had consoled myself with this he says that when these ambassadors had been sent and had returned despised and had told the senate that not only had antony refused to leave gaul but was besieging mutina and would not let them even see decimusthat then in our passion and our rage we should have gone forth with our arms and our horses and our men and at once have rescued our general but wesince we have seen the audacity the insolence and the pride of antonywe have become only more cowardly than before then he gives his opinion about the amnesty let any of those who are now with antony but shall leave him before the ides of march and pass to the armies of the consuls or of decimus or of young cæsar be held to be free from reproach if one should quit their ranks through their own will let them be rewarded and honored as hirtius and pansa our consuls may think proper this was the eighth philippic and is perhaps the finest of them all it does not contain the bitter invective of the second but there is in it a true feeling of patriotic earnestness the ninth also is very eloquent though it is rather a pæan sung on behalf of his friend sulpicius who in bad health had encountered the danger of the journey and had died in the effort than one of these philippics which are supposed to have been written and spoken with the view of demolishing antony it is a specimen of those funereal orations delivered on behalf of a citizen who had died in the service of his country which used to be common among the romans  the tenth is in praise of marcus junius brutus were i to attempt to explain the situation of brutus in macedonia and to say how he had come to fill it i should be carried away from my purpose as to ciceros life and should be endeavoring to write the history of the time my object is simply to illustrate the life of cicero by such facts as we know in the confusion which existed at the time brutus had obtained some advantages in macedonia and had recovered for himself the legions of which caius antonius had been in possession and who was now a prisoner in his hands at this time young marcus cicero was his lieutenant and it is told us how one of those legions had put themselves under his command brutus had at any rate written home letters to the senate early in march and pansa had called the senate together to receive them  again he attacks fufius calenus pansas fatherinlaw who was the only man in the senate bold enough to stand up against him though there were doubtless many of those foot senatorsmen who traversed the house backward and forward to give their voteswho were anxious to oppose him he thanks pansa for calling them so quickly seeing that when they had parted yesterday they had not expected to be again so soon convoked we may gather from this the existence of a practice of sending messengers round to the senators houses to call them together he praises brutus for his courage and his patience it is his object to convince his hearers and through them the romans of the day that the cause of antony is hopeless let us rise up and crush him let us all rise and we shall certainly crush him there is nothing so likely to attain success as a belief that the success has been already attained from all sides men are running together to put out the flames which he has lighted our veterans following the example of young cæsar have repudiated antony and his attempts the legio martia has blunted the edge of his rage and the legio quarta has attacked him deserted by his own troops he has broken through into gaul which he has found to be hostile to him with its arms and opposed to him in spirit the armies of hirtius and of young cæsar are upon his trail and now pansas levies have raised the heart of the city and of all italy he alone is our enemy although he has along with him his brother lucius whom we all regret so dearly whose loss we have hardly been able to endure what wild beast do you know more abominable than that or more monstrouswho seems to have been created lest marc antony himself should be of all things the most vile he concludes by proposing the thanks of the senate to brutus and a resolution that quintus hortensius who had held the province of macedonia against caius antonius should be left there in command the two propositions were carried  as we read this all appears to be prospering on behalf of the republic but if we turn to the suspected correspondence between brutus and cicero we find a different state of things and these letters though we altogether doubt their authenticityfor their language is cold formal and unciceronianstill were probably written by one who had access to those which cicero had himself penned as to what you write about wanting men and money it is very difficult to give you advice i do not see how you are to raise any except by borrowing it from the municipalitiesin macedoniaaccording to the decree of the senate as to men i do not know what to propose pansa is so far from sparing men from his army that he begrudges those who go to you as volunteers some think that he wishes you to be less strong than you arewhich however i do not suspect myself214 a letter might fall into the hands of persons not intended to read it and cicero was forced to be on his guard in communicating his suspicionscicero or the pseudocicero in the next brutus is rebuked for having left antony live when cæsar was slain had not some god inspired octavian he says we should have been altogether in the power of antony that base and abominable man and you see how terrible is our contest with him and he tries to awaken him to the necessity of severity i see how much you delight in clemency that is very well but there is another place another time for clemency the question for us is whether we shall any longer exist or be put out of the world these which are intended to represent his private fears deal with the affairs of the day in a tone altogether different from that of his public speeches doubt anxiety occasionally almost despair are expressed in them but not the less does he thunder on in the senate aware that to attain success he must appear to have obtained it  the eleventh philippic was occasioned by the news which had arrived in rome of the death of trebonius trebonius had been surprised in smyrna by a stratagem as to which alone no disgrace would have fallen on dolabella had he not followed up his success by killing trebonius how far the bloody cruelty of which we have the account in ciceros words was in truth executed it is now impossible to say the greek historian appian gives us none of these horrors but simply intimates that trebonius having been taken in the snare had his head cut off215 that cicero believed the story is probable it is told against his soninlaw of whom he had hitherto spoken favorably he would not have spoken against the man except on conviction dolabella was immediately declared an enemy to the republic cicero inveighs against him with all his force and says that such as dolabella is he had been made by the cruelty of antony but he goes on to philosophize and declare how much more miserable than trebonius was dolabella himself who is so base that from his childhood those things had been a delight to him which have been held as disgraceful by other children then he turns to the question which is in dispute whether brutus should be left in command of macedonia and cassius of syriacassius was now on his way to avenge the death of treboniusor whether other noble romans publius servilius for instance or that hirtius and pansa the two consuls when they can be spared from italy shall be sent there it is necessary here to read between the lines the going of the consuls would mean the withdrawing of the troops from italy and would leave rome open to the cæsarean faction at present decimus and cicero and whoever else there might be loyal to the republic had to fight by the assistance of other forces than their own hirtius and pansa were constrained to take the part of the republic by ciceros eloquence and by the action of those senators who felt themselves compelled to obey cicero but they did not object to send the consuls away and the consular legions under the plea of saving the provinces this they were willing enough to dowith the real object of delivering italy over to those who were ciceros enemies but were not theirs all this cicero understood and in conducting the contest had to be on his guard not only against the soldiers of antony but against the senators also who were supposed to be his own friends but whose hearts were intent on having back some cæsar to preserve for them their privileges  cicero in this matter talked some nonsense by what right by what law he asks shall cassius go to syria by that law which jupiter sanctioned when he ordained that all things good for the republic should be just and legal for neither had brutus a right to establish himself in macedonia as proconsul nor cassius in syria this reference to jupiter was a begging of the question with a vengeance but it was perhaps necessary in a time of such confusion to assume some pretext of legality let it be ever so poor nothing could now be done in true obedience to the laws the triumvirate with cæsar at its head had finally trodden down all law and yet every one was clamoring for legal rights then he sings the praises of cassius but declares that he does not dare to give him credit in that place for the greatest deed he had done he means of course the murder of cæsar  paterculus tells us that all these things were decreed by the senate216 but he is wrong the decree of the senate went against cicero and on the next day amid much tumult he addressed himself to the people on the subject this he did in opposition to pansa who endeavored to hinder him from speaking in the forum and to servilia the motherinlaw of cassius who was afraid lest her soninlaw should encounter the anger of the consuls he went so far as to tell the people that cassius would not obey the senate but would take upon himself on such an emergency to act as best he could for the republic217 there was no moment in this stirring year none i think during ciceros life in which he behaved with greater courage than now in appealing from the senate to the people and in the hardihood with which he declared that the senates decree should be held as going for nothing before the time came in which it could be carried out both hirtius and pansa were dead they had fallen in relieving decimus at mutina his address on this occasion to the people was not made public and has not been preserved  then there came up the question of a second embassy to which cicero at first acceded he was induced to do so as he says by news which had arrived of altered circumstances on antonys part calenus and piso had given the senate to understand that antony was desirous of peace cicero had therefore assented and had agreed to be one of the deputation the twelfth philippic was spoken with the object of showing that no such embassy should be sent ciceros condition at this period was most peculiar and most perilous the senate would not altogether oppose his efforts but they hated them they feared that if antony should succeed they who had opposed antony would be ruined those among them who were the boldest openly reproached cicero with the danger which they were made to incur in fighting his battles218 to be rid of cicero was their desire and their difficulty he had agreed to go on this embassywho can say for what motives to him it would be a mission of especial peril it was one from which he could hardly hope ever to come back alive it may be that he had agreed to go with his life in his hand and to let them know that he at any rate had been willing to die for the republic it may be that he had heard of some altered circumstances but he changed his mind and resolved that he would not go unless driven forth by the senate there seems to have been a manifest attempt to get him out of rome and send him where he might have his throat cut but he declined and this is the speech in which he did so it is impossible says the french critic speaking of the twelfth philippic to surround the word i fear with more imposing oratorical arguments it has not occurred to him that cicero may have thought that he might even yet do something better with the lees and dregs of his life than throw them away by thus falling into a trap nothing is so common to men as to fear to dieand nothing more necessary or men would soon cease to live to fear death more than ignominy is the disgracea truth which the french critic does not seem to have recognized when he twits the memory of cicero with his scornful sneer jai peur did it occur to the french critic to ask himself for what purpose should cicero go to antonys camp where he would probably be murdered and by so doing favor the views of his own enemies in rome the deputation was not sent but in lieu of the deputation pansa the remaining consul led his legions out of rome at the beginning of april  sidenote bc 43 ætat 64  lepidus who was proconsul in gaul and northern spain wrote a letter at this time to the senate recommending them to make peace with antony cicero in his thirteenth philippic shows how futile such a peace would be that lepidus was a vain inconstant man looking simply to his own advantage in the side which he might choose is now understood but when this letter was received he was supposed to have much weight in rome he had however given some offence to the senate not having acknowledged all the honors which had been paid to him the advice had been rejected and cicero shows how unfit the man was to give it this however he still does with complimentary phrases though from a letter written by him to lepidus about this time the nature of his feeling toward the man is declared you would have done better in my judgment if you had left alone this attempt at making peace which approves itself neither to the senate nor to the people not to any good man219 when we remember the ordinary terms of roman letterwriting we must acknowledge that this was a plain and not very civil attempt to silence lepidus he then goes on in the philippic to read a letter which antony had sent to hirtius and to young cæsar and which they had sent on to the senate the letter is sufficiently bold and abusivethrowing it in their teeth that they would rather punish the murderer of trebonius than those of cæsar cicero does this with some wit but we feel compelled to observe that as much is to be said on the one side as on the other brutus cassius with trebonius and others had killed cæsar dolabella perhaps with circumstances of great cruelty had killed trebonius cicero had again and again expressed his sorrow that antony had been spared when cæsar was killed we have to go back before the first slaughter to resolve who was right and who was wrong and even afterward can only take the doings of each in that direction as part of the internecine feud experience has since explained to us the results of introducing bloodshed into such quarrels the laws which recognize war are and were acknowledged but when a kills b because he thinks b to have done evil a can no longer complain of murder and ciceros criticism is somewhat puerile and thou boy antony had said in addressing octavianet te puer you shall find him to be a man byandby says cicero antonys latin is not ciceronian utrum sit elegantius he asks putting some further question about cæsar and trebonius as if there could be anything elegant in this war demands cicero he goes through the letter in the same way turning antony into ridicule in a manner which must have riveted in the heart of fulvia antonys wife who was in rome her desire to have that bitterspeaking tongue torn out of his mouth such was the thirteenth philippic  on the 21st of april was spoken the fourteenth and the last pansa early in the month had left rome and marched toward mutina with the intention of relieving decimus antony who was then besieging mutina after such a fashion as to prevent all egress or ingress and had all but brought decimus to starvation finding himself about to be besieged put his troops into motion and attacked those who were attacking him then was fought the battle in which antony was beaten and pansa one of the consuls so wounded that he perished soon afterward antony retreated to his camp but was again attacked by hirtius and octavian and by decimus who sallied out of the town he was routed and fled but hirtius was killed in the battle suetonius tells us that in his time a rumor was abroad that augustus then octavian had himself killed hirtius with his own hands in the fighthirtius having been his fellowgeneral and fighting on the same side and that he had paid glyco pansas doctor to poison him while dressing his wounds220 tacitus had already made the story known221 it is worth repeating here only as showing the sort of conduct which a grave historian and a worthy biographer were not ashamed to attribute to the favorite emperor of rome  it was on the receipt of the news in rome of the first battle but before the second had been fought that the last philippic was spoken pansa was not known to have been mortally wounded nor hirtius killed nor was it known that decimus had been relieved but it was understood that antony had received a check servilius had proposed a supplication and had suggested that they should put away their saga and go back to their usual attire the sagum was a common military cloak which the early romans wore instead of the toga when they went out to war in later days when the definition between a soldier and a civilian became more complete they who were left at home wore the sagum in token of their military feelings when the republic was fighting its battles near rome i do not suppose that when crassus was in parthia or cæsar in gaul the sagum was worn it was not exactly known when the distant battles were being fought but cicero had taken care that the sagum should be properly worn and had even put it on himselfto do which as a consular was not required of him servilius now proposed that they should leave off their cloaks having obtained a victory but cicero would not permit it decimus he says has not been relieved and they had taken to their cloaks as showing their determination to succor their general in his distress and he is discontented with the language used you have not even yet called antony a public enemy then he again lashes out against the horror of antonys proceedings he is waging war a war too dreadful to be spoken of against four roman consulshe means hirtius and pansa who were already consuls and in truth already dead and decimus and plancus who were designated as consuls for the next year plancus however joined his legions afterward with those of antony and insisted in establishing the second triumvirate rushing from one scene of slaughter to another he causes wherever he goes misery desolation bloodshed and agony the language is so fine that it is worth our while to see the words222 is he not responsible for the horrors of dolabella what he would do in rome were it not for the protection of jupiter may be seen from the miseries which his brother has inflicted on those poor men of parmathat lucius whom all men hate and the gods too would hate if they hated as they ought in what city was hannibal as cruel as antony at parma and shall we not call him an enemy servilius had asked for a supplication but had only asked for one of moderate length and servilius had not called the generals imperatores who should be so called but they who have been valiant and lucky and successful cicero forgets the meaning of the title and that even bibulus had been called imperator in syria here he runs off from his subject and at some length praises himself it seems that rome was in a tumult at the time and that antonys enemies did all they could to support him and also to turn his head he had been carried into the senatehouse in triumph and had been thanked by the whole city after lauding the different generals and calling them all imperatores he desires the senate to decree them a supplication for fifty days fifty days are to be devoted to thanksgiving to the gods though it had already been declared how very little they have done for which to be thankful as decimus had not yet been liberated  fifty days are granted for the battle of mutina which as yet was supposed to have been but half fought when we hear the term supplicatio first mentioned in livy one day was granted it had grown to twenty when the gods were thanked for the victory over vercingetorix now for this halffinished affair fifty was hardly enough when the time was over antony and lepidus had joined their forces triumphantly pansa and hirtius were dead and decimus brutus had fled and had probably been murdered nothing increases so out of proportion to the occasion as the granting of honors stars when they fall in showers pale their brilliancy and turn at last to no more than a cloud of dust honors are soon robbed of all their honor when once the first step downward has been taken the decree was passed and cicero finished his last speech on so poor an occasion but though the thing itself then done be small and trivial to us now it was completed in magnificent language223 the passage of which i give the first words below is very fine in the original though it does not well bear translation thus he ended his fourteenth philippic and the silver tongue which had charmed rome so often was silent forever  we at least have no record of any further speech nor as i think did he again take the labor of putting into words which should thrill through all who heard them not the thoughts but the passionate feelings of the moment  i will venture to quote from a contemporary his praise of the philippics mr forsyth says nothing can exceed the beauty of the language the rhythmical flow of the periods and the harmony of the style the structure of the latin language which enables the speaker or writer to collocate his words not as in english merely according to the order of thought but in the manner best calculated to produce effect too often baffles the powers of the translator who seeks to give the force of the passage without altering the arrangement often again as is the case with all attempts to present the thoughts of the ancient in a modern dress a periphrasis must be used to explain the meaning of an idea which was instantly caught by the greek or roman ear many allusions which flashed like lightning upon the minds of the senators must be explained in a parenthesis and many a homethrust and caustic sarcasm are now deprived of their sting which pierced sharply at the moment of their utterance some twenty centuries ago  but with all such disadvantages i hope that even the english reader will be able to recognize in these speeches something of the grandeur of the old roman eloquence the noble passages in which cicero strove to force his countrymen for very shame to emulate the heroic virtues of their forefathers and urged them to brave every danger and welcome death rather than slavery in the last struggle for freedom are radiant with a glory which not even a translation can destroy and it is impossible not to admire the genius of the orator whose words did more than armies toward recovering the lost liberty of rome  his words did more than armies but neither could do anything lasting for the republic what was one honest man among so many we remember mommsens verdict on the roman oligarchy of this period no judgment can be passed save one of inexorable and remorseless condemnation the farther we see into the facts of roman history in our endeavors to read the life of cicero the more apparent becomes its truth but cicero though he saw far toward it never altogether acknowledged it in this consists the charm of his character though at the same time the weakness of his political aspirations his weaknessbecause he was vain enough to imagine that he could talk men back from their fishponds its charmbecause he was able through it all to believe in honesty the more hopeless became the cause the sweeter the more impassioned the more divine became his language he tuned his notes to still higher pitches of melody and thought that thus he could bring back public virtue often in these philippics the matter is small enough the men he has to praise are so little and antony does not loom large enough in history to have merited from cicero so great a meed of vituperation nor is the abuse all true in attributing to him motives so low but cicero was true through it all anxious all on fire with anxiety to induce those who heard him to send men to fight the battles to which he knew them in their hearts to be opposed  the courage the persistency and the skill shown in the attempt were marvellous they could not have succeeded but they seem almost to have done so i have said that he was one honest man among many brutus was honest in his patriotism and cassius and all the conspirators i do not doubt that cæsar was killed from a true desire to restore the roman republic they desired to restore a thing that was in itself evilthe evils of which had induced cæsar to see that he might make himself its master but cicero had conceived a republic in his own mindnot utopian altogether human and rationala republic which he believed to have been that of scipio of marcellus and lælius a republic which should do nothing for him but require his assistance in which the people should vote and the oligarchs rule in accordance with the established laws peace and ease prosperity and protection it would be for the rome of his dream to bestow upon the provinces law and order education and intelligence it would be for her rulers to bestow upon rome in desiring this he was the one honest man among many in accordance with that theory he had lived and i claim for him that he had never departed from it in his latter days when the final struggle came when there had arisen for him the chance of cæsars death when antony was his chief enemy when he found himself in rome with authority sufficient to control legions when the young cæsar had not shownprobably had not madehis plans when lepidus and plancus and pollio might still prove themselves at last true men he was once again alive with his dream there might yet be again a scipio or a cicero as good as scipio in the republic one who might have lived as gloriously and dienot amid the jealousies but with the love of his countrymen  it was not to be looking back at it now we wonder that he should have dared to hope for it but it is to the presence within gallant bosoms of hope still springing though almost forlorn of hope which has in its existence been marvellous that the world is indebted for the most beneficial enterprises it was not given to cicero to stem the tide and to prevent the evil coming of the cæsars but still the nature of the life he had led the dreams of a pure republic those aspirations after liberty have not altogether perished we have at any rate the record of the great endeavors which he made  nothing can have been worse managed than the victory at mutina the two consuls were both killed but that it may be said was the chance of war antony with all his cavalry was allowed to escape eastward toward the cottian alps decimus brutus seems to have shown himself deficient in all the qualities of a general except that power of endurance which can hold a town with little or no provision he wrote to cicero saying that he would follow antony he makes a promise that antony shall not be allowed to remain in italy he beseeches cicero to write to that windy fellow lepidus to prevent him from joining the enemy lepidus will never do what is right unless made to do so by cicero as to plancus decimus has his doubts but he thinks that plancus will be true to the republic now that antony is beaten224 in his next letter he speaks of the great confusion which has come among them from the death of the two consuls he declares also how great has been antonys energy in already recruiting his army he has opened all the prisons and workhouses and taken the men he found there ventidius has joined him with his army and he still fears lepidus and young cæsar who is supposed to be on their side will obey no one and can make none obey him he decimus cannot feed his men he has spent all his own money and his friends how is he to support seven legions225 on the next day he writes again and is still afraid of plancus and of lepidus and of pollio and he bids cicero look after his good name stop the evil tongues of men if you can226 a few days afterward cicero writes him a letter which he can hardly have liked to receive what business had brutus to think the senate cowardly227 who can be afraid of antony conquered who did not fear him in his strength how should lepidus doubt now when victory had declared for the republic though antony may have collected together the scrapings of the jails decimus is not to forget that he decimus has the whole roman people at his back  cicero was probably right to encourage the general and to endeavor to fill him with hope to make a man victorious you should teach him to believe in victory but decimus knew the nature of the troops around him and was aware that every soldier was so imbued with an idea of the power of cæsar that though cæsar was dead they could fight with only half a heart against soldiers who had been in his armies the name and authority and high office of the two consuls had done something with them and young cæsar had been with the consuls but both the consuls had been killedwhich was in itself ominousand antony was still full of hope and young cæsar was not there and decimus was unpopular with the men it was of no use that cicero should write with lofty ideas and speak of the spirit of the senate antony had received a severe check but the feeling of military rule which cæsar had engendered was still there and soldiers who would obey their officers were not going to submit themselves to votes of the people cicero in the mean time had his letters passing daily between himself and the camps thinking to make up by the energy of his pen for the weakness of his party lepidus sends him an account of his movements on the rhone declaring how he was anxious to surround antony lepidus was already meditating his surrender i ask from you my cicero that if you have seen with what zeal i have in former times served the republic you should look for conduct equal to it or surpassing it for the future and that you should think me the more worthy of your protection the higher are my deserts228 he was already when writing that letter in treaty with antony plancus writes to him at the same time apologizing for his conduct in joining lepidus it was a service of great danger for him plancus but it was necessary for lepidus that this should be done we are inclined to doubt them all knowing whither they were tending lepidus was false from the beginning plancus doubled for a while and then yielded himself  the reader i think will have had no hope for cicero and the republic since the two consuls were killed but as he comes upon the letters which passed between cicero and the armies he will have been altogether disheartened     chapter x  ciceros death   sidenote bc 43 ætat 64  what other letters from cicero we possess were written almost exclusively with the view of keeping the army together and continuing the contest against antony there are among them a few introductory letters of little or no interest and these military despatches though of importance as showing the eager nature of the man seem as we read them to be foreign to his nature he does not understand war and devotes himself to instigating men to defend the republic of whom we suspect that they were not in the least affected by the words they received from him the correspondence as to this period of his life consists of his letters to the generals and of theirs to him there are nearly as many of the one as of the other and the reader is often inclined to doubt whether cicero be writing to plancus or plancus to cicero he remained at rome and we can only imagine him as busy among the official workshops of the state writing letters scraping together money for the troops struggling in vain to raise levies amid a crowd of hopeless doubting disheartened senators whom he still kept together by his eloquence as republicans though each was eager to escape  but who can be made consuls in the place of pansa and hirtius octavian who had not left italy after the battle of mutina was determined to be one but the senate probably under the guidance of cicero for a time would not have him there was a rumor that cicero had been electedor is said to have been such a rumor our authority for it comes from that correspondence with marcus brutus on the authenticity of which we do not trust and the date of which we do not know229 when i had already written my letter i heard that you had been made consul when that is done i shall believe that we shall have a true republic and one supported by its own strength but probably neither was the rumor true nor the fact that there was such a rumor it was not thus that octavian meant to play his part he had been passed over by cicero when a general against antony was needed decimus had been used and hirtius and pansa had been employed as though they had been themselves strong as were the consuls of old so they were to ciceroin whose ears the very name of consul had in it a resonance of the magnificence of rome octavian thought that pansa and hirtius were but cæsars creatures who at cæsars death had turned against him but even they had been preferred to him in those days he was very quick to learn he had been with the army and with cæsars soldiers and was soon instructed in the steps which it was wise that he should take he put aside as with a sweep of his hand all the legal impediments to his holding the consulship talk to him of age he had already heard that word boy too often he would show them what a boy would do he would let them understand that there need be no necessity for him to canvass to sue for the consulship cap in hand to have morning levees and to know mens namesas had been done by cicero his uncle had not gone through those forms when he had wanted the consulship octavian sent a military order by a band of officers who marching into the senate demanded the office when the old men hesitated one cornelius a centurion showed them his sword and declared that by means of that should his general be elected consul the greek biographers and historians plutarch dio and appian say that he was minded to make cicero his fellowconsul promising to be guided by him in everything but it could hardly have been so with the feelings which were then hot against cicero in octavians bosom dio cassius is worthy of little credit as to this period and appian less so unless when supported by latin authority and we find that plutarch inserts stories with that freedom which writers use who do not suppose that others coming after them will have wider sources of information than their own octavian marched into rome with his legions and had himself chosen consul in conjunction with quintius pedius who had also been one of the coheirs to cæsars will this happened in september previous to this cicero had sent to africa for troops but the troops when they came all took part with the young cæsar  a story is told which appears to have been true and to have assisted in creating that enmity which at last induced octavian to assent to ciceros death he was told that cicero had said that the young man was to be praised and rewarded and elevated230 the last word tollendum has a double meaning might be elevated to the skiesor to the gallows in english if meaning the latter we should say that such a man must be put out of the way decimus brutus told this to cicero as having been repeated by sigulius and cicero answers him heaping all maledictions upon sigulius but he does not deny the words or their intentionand though he is angry he is angry half in joke he had probably allowed himself to use the witticism meaning little or nothingchoosing the phrase without a moments thought because it contained a double meaning no one can conceive that he meant to imply that young cæsar should be murdered let us reward him but for the moment let us be rid of him and then too he had in the same sentence called him a boy as far as evidence goes we know that the words were spoken we can trust the letter from decimus to cicero and the answer from cicero to decimus and we know that a short time afterward octavian sitting in the island near bologna with antony consented that ciceros name should be inserted in the fatal list as one of those doomed to be murdered  in the mean time lepidus had taken his troops over to antony and pollio joined them soon afterward with his from spain after that it was hardly to be expected that plancus should hesitate there has always been a doubt whether plancus should or should not be regarded as a traitor he held out longer than the others and is supposed to have been true in those assurances which he made to cicero of republican fervor why was he bound to obey cicero who was then at rome sending out his orders without official authority while the consuls had been alive he could obey the consuls and at the consuls death he could for a while follow the spirit of their instructions but as that spirit died away he found himself without orders other than ciceros in this condition was it not better for him to go with the other generals of the empire rather than to perish with a falling party in addition to this it will happen at such a time that the soldiers themselves have a will of their own with them the name of cæsar was still powerful and to their thinking antony was fighting on dead cæsars side when we read the history of this year the fact becomes clear that out of rome cæsars name was more powerful than ciceros eloquence governed by such circumstances driven by events which he could not control plancus has the merit of having been the last among the doubtful generals to desert the cause which cicero had at heart cassius and brutus in the east were still collecting legions for the battle of philippi with that we shall have no trouble here in the west plancus found himself bound to follow the others and to join antony and lepidus in spite of the protestations he had made to those who read ciceros letters of this year the question must often arise whether plancus was a true man i have made his excuse to the reader with all that i can say in his favor the memory of the man is however unpleasant to me  decimus when he found himself thus alone endeavored to force his way with his army along the northern shore of the adriatic so as to join marcus brutus in macedonia to him as one of those who had slain cæsar no power was left of deserting he was doomed unless he was victorious he was deserted by his soldiers who left him in batches and at last was taken alive when wandering through the country and sent dead to antony marcus brutus and cassius seem to have turned a deaf ear to all ciceros entreaties that they should come to his rescue cicero in his last known letterwhich however was written as far back as in julyis very eager with cassius only attempts are heard of your army very great in themselves but we expect to hear of deeds    nothing can be grander or more noble than yourself and therefore it is that we are longing for you here in rome    believe me that everything depends on you and brutusthat we are waiting for both of you for brutus we are waiting constantly231 this was after lepidus had gone but while plancus was supposed to be as yet trueor rather not yet false he did no doubt write letters to brutus urging him in the same way alas alas it was his final effort made for the republic  in september octavian marched into rome as a conqueror at the head of those troops from africa which had been sent as a last resource to help the republicans then we may imagine that cicero recognized the fact that there was left nothing further for which to struggle the republic was done his dream was over and he could only die brutus and cassius might still carry on the contest but rome had now fallen a second time in spite of his efforts and all hope must have fled from him when cæsar had conquered at pharsalia and on his return from the east had graciously met him at brundisium and had generously accorded to him permission to live under the shadow of his throne the time for him must have been full of bitterness but he had not then quite realized the meaning of a tyrants throne he had not seen how willingly the people would submit themselves how little they cared about their liberty nor had he as yet learned the nature of military despotism rome had lived through sullas time and the republic had been again established it might live through cæsars period of command when cæsar had come to him and supped with him as a prince with one of his subjects his misery had been great still there was a hope though he knew not from whence those other younger men had felt as he had feltand cæsar had fallen to his eyes it was as though some god had interfered to restore to him a roman his ancient form of government cæsar was now dead and all would be rightonly that antony was left alive there was need for another struggle before consuls prætors and Ædiles could be elected in due order and when he found that the struggle was to be made under his auspices he girded up his loins and was again happy no man can be unhappy who is pouring out his indignation in torrents and is drinking in the applause of his audience every hard word hurled at antony and every note of praise heard in return was evidence to him of his own power he did believe while the philippics were going on that he was stirring up a mighty power to arouse itself and claim its proper dominion over the world there were moments between in which he may have been faintheartedin which he may have doubted as to young cæsarin which he feared that pansa might escape from him or that decimus would fall before relief could reach him but action lent a pleasantness and a grace to it all it is sweet to fight with the hope of victory but now when young cæsar had marched into rome with his legions and was doubtless prepared to join himself to antony there was no longer anything for cicero to do in this world  it is said but not as i think on good authority that cicero went out to meet cæsarand if to meet him then also to congratulate him appian tells us that in the senate cicero hastened to congratulate cæsar assuring him how anxious he had been to secure the consulship for him and how active cæsar smiled and said that cicero had perhaps been a little late in his friendship232 dio cassius only remarks that cæsar was created consul by the people in the regular way two consuls having been chosen and adds that the matter was one of great glory to cæsar seeing that he had obtained the consulship at an unusually early age233 but as i have said above their testimony for many reasons is to be doubted each wrote in the interest of the cæsars and in dealing with the period before the empire seems only to have been anxious to make out some connected story which should suit the emperors views young cæsar left rome still with the avowed purpose of proceeding against antony as against one declared by the senate to be an enemy but the purpose was only avowed messengers followed him on the road informing him that the ban had been removed and he was then at liberty to meet his friend on friendly terms antony had sent word to him that it was not so much his duty as young cæsars to avenge the death of his uncle and that unless he would assist him he antony would take his legions and join brutus and cassius234 i prefer to believe with mr forsyth that cicero had retired with his brother quintus to one of his villas plutarch tells us that he went to his tusculan retreat and that on receiving news of the proscriptions he determined to remove to astura on the seaside in order that he might be ready to escape into macedonia octavian in the mean time having caused a law to be passed by pedius condemning all the conspirators to death went northward to meet antony and lepidus at bononia the bologna of today here it was necessary that the terms of the compact should be settled by which the spoils of the world should be divided among them and here they met these three men on a small river island remote from the worldwhere as it is supposed each might think himself secure from the other antony and lepidus were men old in craftantony in middle life and lepidus somewhat older cæsar was just twentyone but from all that we have been able to gather as to that meeting he was fully able to hold his own with his elders what each claimed as his share in the empire is not so much matter of history as the blood which each demanded paterculus says that the deathwarrants which were then signed were all arranged in opposition to cæsar235 but paterculus wrote as the servant of tiberius and had been the servant of augustus it was his object to tell the story as much in favor of augustus as it could be told it is said that debating among themselves the murders which each desired for his own security young cæsar on the third day only gave up cicero to the vengeance of antony it may have been so it is impossible that we should have a record of what took place from day to day on that island but we do know that there ciceros death was pronounced and to that doom young cæsar assented it did not occur to them as it would have done to julius cæsar at such a time that it would be better that they should show their mercy than their hatred this proscription was made by hatred and not by fear it was not brutus and cassius against whom it was directedthe common enemies of the three triumviri sulla had attempted to stamp out a whole faction and so far succeeded as to strike dumb with awe the remainder but here the bargain of death was made by each against the others friends your brother shall go said antony to lepidus if so your uncle also said lepidus to antony so the one gave up his brother and the other his uncle to indulge the private spleen of his partner and cicero must go to appease both as it happened though ciceros fate was spoken the two others escaped their doom nothing so bad was done in those days says paterculus that cæsar should have been compelled to doom any one to death or that such a one as cicero should have been doomed by any236 middleton thinks and perhaps with fair reason that cæsars objection was feigned and that his delay was made for show a slight change in quoting the above passage unintentionally made favors his view or that cicero should have been proscribed by him he says turning ullo into illo the meaning of the passage seems to be that it was sad that cæsar should have been forced to yield or that any one should have been there to force him as far as cæsar is concerned it is palliative rather than condemnatory suetonius indeed declares that though augustus for a time resisted the proscription having once taken it in hand he pursued it more bloodily than the others237 it is said that the list when completed contained the names of three hundred senators and two thousand knights but their fate was for a time postponed and most of them ultimately escaped we have no word of their deaths as would have been the case had they all fallen seventeen were named for instant execution and against these their doom went forth we can understand that ciceros name should have been the first on the list  we are told that when the news reached rome the whole city was struck with horror during the speaking of the philippics the republican party had been strong and cicero had been held in favor the soldiers had still clung to the memory of cæsar but the men of mark in the city those who were indolent and rich and luxurious the fishponders generally had thought that now cæsar was dead and especially as antony had left rome their safest course would be to join the republic they had done so and had found their mistake young cæsar had first come to rome and they had been willing enough to receive him but now he had met antony and lepidus and the bloody days of sulla were to come back upon them all rome was in such a tumult of horror and dismay that pedius the new consul was frightened out of his life by the clamor the story goes that he ran about the town trying to give comfort assuring one and another that he had not been included in the lists till as the result of it all he himself when the morning came died from the exertion and excitement  there is extant a letter addressed to octaviansupposed to have been written by cicero and sometimes printed among his workswhich if written by him must have been composed about this time it no doubt was a forgery and probably of a much later date but it serves to show what were the feelings presumed to have been in ciceros bosom at the time it is full of abuse of antony and of young cæsar i can well imagine that such might have been ciceros thoughts as he remembered the praise with which he had laden the young mans name how he had decreed to him most unusual honors and voted statues for him it had all been done in order that the republic might be preserved but had all been done in vain it must have distressed him sorely at this time as he reflected how much eulogy he had wasted to be sneered at by the boy when he came back to rome to assume the consulship and to be told with a laugh that he had been a little late in his welcome and to hear that the boy had decreed his death in conjunction with antony and lepidus this was all that rome could do for him at the endfor him who had so loved her suffered so much for her and been so valiant on her behalf are you not a little late to welcome me as one of my friends the boy had said when cicero had bowed and smiled to him then the next tidings that reached him contained news that he was condemned was this the youth of whom he had declared since the year began that he knew well all the boys sentiments that nothing was dearer to the lad than the republic nothing more reverent than the dignity of the senate was it for this that he had bade the senate fear nothing as to young octavian but always still look for better and greater things was it for this that he had pledged his faith for him with such confident wordsi promise for him i become his surety i engage myself conscript fathers that caius cæsar will always be such a citizen as he has shown himself today238 and thus the young man had redeemed his tutors pledges on his behalf a little late to welcome me eh his pupil had said to him and had agreed that he should be murdered but as i have said the story of that speech rests on doubtful authority  had not cicero too rejoiced at the uncles murder and having done so was he not bound to endure the enmity he had provoked he had not indeed killed cæsar or been aware that he was to be killed but still it must be said of him that having expressed his satisfaction at what had been done he had identified himself with those who had killed him and must share their fate the slaying of a tyrant was almost by law enjoined upon romanswas at any rate regarded as a virtue rather than a crime there of course arises the question who is to decide whether a man be a tyrant and the idea being radically wrong becomes enveloped in difficulty out of which there is no escape but there remains as a fact the existence of the feeling which was at the time held to have justified brutusand also cicero a man has to inquire of his own heart with what amount of criminality he can accuse the cicero of the day or the young augustus can any one say that cicero was base to have rejoiced that cæsar had been killed can any one not regard with horror the young consul as he sat there in the privacy of the island with antony on one side and lepidus on the other and then in the first days of his youth with the down just coming on his cheeks sending forth his edict for slaughtering the old friend of the republic  sidenote bc 43 ætat 64  it is supposed that cicero left rome in company with his brother quintus and that at first they went to tusculum there was no bar to their escaping from italy had they so chosen and probably such was their intention as soon as tidings reached them of the proscription it is pleasant to think that they should again have become friends before they died in truth marcus the elder was responsible for his brothers fate quintus had foreseen the sun rising in the political horizon and had made his adorations accordingly he with others of his class had shown himself ready to bow down before cæsar with his brothers assent he had become cæsars lieutenant in gaul such employment being in conformity with the practice of the republic when cæsar had returned and the question as to power arose at once between cæsar and pompey quintus who had then been with his brother in cilicia was restrained by the influence of marcus but after pharsalia the influence of marcus was on the wane we remember how young quintus had broken away and had joined cæsars party he had sunk so low that he had become antonys right hand in that direction lay money luxury and all those good things which the government of the day had to offer cicero was so much in cæsars eyes that cæsar despised the elder and the younger quintus for deserting their great relative and would hardly have them the influence of the brother and the uncle sat heavily on them the shame of being cæsarean while he was pompeian the shame of siding with antony while he sided with the republic had been too great for them while he was speaking his philippics they could not but be enthusiastic on the same side and now when he was proscribed they were both proscribed with him as the story goes quintus returned from tusculum to rome to seek provision for their journey to macedonia there met his son and they both died gallantly antonys hirelings came upon the two together or nearly together and finding the son first put him to the torture so to learn from him the place of his fathers concealment then the father hearing his sons screams rushed out to his aid and the two perished together but this story also comes to us from greek sources and must be taken for what it is worth  marcus alone in his litter travelled through the country to his seaside villa at astura then he went on to formiæ sick with doubt not knowing whether to stay and die or encounter the winter sea in such boat as was provided for him should he seek the uncomfortable refuge of brutuss army we can remember his bitter exclamations as to the miseries of camp life he did go on board but was brought back by the winds and his servants could not persuade him to make another attempt plutarch tells us that he was minded to go to rome to force his way into young cæsars house and there to stab himself but that he was deterred from this melodramatic death by the fear of torture the story only shows how great had been the attention given to every detail of his last moments and what the people in rome had learned to say of them the same remark applies to plutarchs tale as to the presuming crows who pecked at the cordage of his sails when his boat was turned to go back to the land and afterward with their beaks strove to drag the bedclothes from off him when he lay waiting his fate the night before the murderers came to him  he was being carried down from his villa at formiæ to the seaside when antonys emissaries came upon him in his litter there seem to have been two of themboth soldiers and officers in the pay of antonypopilius lænas and herennius they overtook him in the wood through which paths ran from the villa down to the seashore on arriving at the house they had not found cicero but were put upon his track by a freedman who had belonged to quintus named philologus he could hardly have done a kinder act than to show the men the way how they might quickly release cicero from his agony they went down to the end of the wood and there met the slaves bearing the litter the men were willing to fight for their master but cicero bidding them put down the chair stretched out his neck and received his deathblow antony had given special orders to his servants they were to bring ciceros head and his handsthe hands which had written the philippics and the tongue which had spoken themand his order was obeyed to the letter cicero was nearly sixtyfour when he died his birthday being on the 3d of january following it would be hardly worth our while to delay ourselves for a moment with the horrors of antonys conduct and those of his wife fulviafulvia the widow of clodius and the wife of antonywere it not that we may see what were the manners to which a great roman lady had descended in those days in which the republic was brought to an end on the rostra was stuck up the head and the hands as a spectacle to the people while fulvia specially avenged herself by piercing the tongue with her bodkin that is the story of ciceros death as it has been generally told  we are told also that rome heard the news and saw the sight with illsuppressed lamentation we can easily believe that it should have been so i have endeavored as i have gone on with my work to compare him to an englishman of the present day but there is no comparing english eloquence to his or the ravished ears of a roman audience to the pleasure taken in listening to our great orators the world has become too impatient for oratory and then our northern senses cannot appreciate the melody of sounds as did the finer organs of the roman people we require truth and justice and commonsense from those who address us and get much more out of our public speeches than did the old italians we have taught ourselves to speak so that we may be believedor have come near to it a roman audience did not much care i fancy whether the words spoken were true but it was indispensable that they should be sweetand sweet they always were sweet words were spoken to them with their cadences all measured with their rhythm all perfect but no words had ever been so sweet as those of cicero i even with my obtuse ears can find myself sometimes lifted by them into a world of melody little as i know of their pronunciation and their tone and with the upper classesthose who readhis literature had become almost as divine as his speech he had come to be the one man who could express himself in perfect language as in the next age the eclogues of virgil and the odes of horace became dear to all the educated classes because of the charm of their expression so in their time i fancy had become the language of cicero it is not surprising that men should have wept when they saw that ghastly face staring at them from the rostra and the protruding tongue and the outstretched hands the marvel is that seeing it they should still have borne with antony  that which cicero has produced in literature is as a rule admitted to be excellent but his character as a man has been held to be tarnished by three faultsdishonesty cowardice and insincerity as to the first i have denied it altogether and my denial is now submitted to the reader for his judgment it seems to have been brought against him not in order to make him appear guilty but because it has appeared to be impossible that when others were so deeply in fault he should have been innocent that he should have asked for nothing that he should have taken no illicit rewards that he should not have submitted to be feed but that he should have kept his hands clean while all around him were grasping at everythingtaking money selling their aid for stipulated payments grinding miserable creditorshas been too much for men to believe i will not take my readers back over the cases brought against him but will ask them to ask themselves whether there is one supported by evidence fit to go before a jury the accusations have been made by men cleanhanded themselves but to them it has appeared unreasonable to believe that a roman oligarch of those days should be an honest gentleman  as to his cowardice i feel more doubt as to my power of carrying my readers with me though no doubt as to ciceros courage cowardice in a man is abominable but what is cowardice and what courage it is a matter in which so many errors are made tinsel is so apt to shine like gold and dazzle the sight in one of the earlier chapters of this book when speaking of catiline i have referred to the remarks of a contemporary writer the world has generally a generous word for the memory of a brave man dying for his cause all wounded in front is quoted by this author from sallust not a man taken alive catiline himself gasping out his life ringed around with corpses of his friends that is given as a picture of a brave man dying for his cause who should excite our admiration even though his cause were bad in the previous lines we have an intended portrait of cicero who thinking no doubt that he had done a good days work for his patrons declined to run himself into more danger here is one story told of courage and another of fear let us pause for a moment and regard the facts catiline when hunted to the last gasp faced his enemy and died fighting like a manor a bull who is there cannot do so much as that for a shilling or eighteenpence a day we can get an army of brave men who will face an enemyand die if death should come it is not a great thing nor a rare for a man in battle not to run away with regard to cicero the allegation is that he would not be allowed to be bribed to accuse cæsar and thus incur danger the accusation which is thus brought against him is borrowed from sallust and is no doubt false but i take it in the spirit in which it is made cicero feared to accuse cæsar lest he should find himself enveloped through cæsars means in fresh danger grant that he did so was he wrong at such a moment to save his life for the republicand for himself his object was to banish catiline and not to catch in his net every existing conspirator he could stop the conspiracy by securing a few and might drive many into arms by endeavoring to encircle all was this cowardice during all those days he had to live with his life in his hands passing about among conspirators who he knew were sworn to kill him and in the midst of his danger he could walk and talk and think like a man it was the same when he went down into the court to plead for milo with the gladiators of clodius and the soldiery of pompey equally adverse to him it was the same when he uttered philippic after philippic in the presence of antonys friends true courage to my thinking consists not in facing an unavoidable danger any man worthy of the name can do that the felon that will be hung tomorrow shall walk up to the scaffold and seem ready to surrender the life he cannot save but he who with the blood running hot through his veins with a full desire of life at his heart with high aspirations as to the future with everything around him to make him happylove and friendship and pleasant workwhen he can willingly imperil all because duty requires it he is brave of such a nature was ciceros courage  as to the third chargethat of insincerityi would ask of my readers to bethink themselves how few men are sincere now how near have we approached to the beauty of truth with all christs teaching to guide us not by any means close though we are nearer to it than the romans were in ciceros days at any rate we have learned to love it dearly though we may not practise it entirely he also had learned to love it but not yet to practise it quite so well as we do when it shall be said of men truly that they are thoroughly sincere then the millennium will have come we flatter and love to be flattered cicero flattered men and loved it better we are fond of praise and all but ask for it cicero was fond of it and did ask for it but when truth was demanded from him truth was there  was cicero sincere to his party was he sincere to his friends was he sincere to his family was he sincere to his dependents did he offer to help and not help did he ever desert his ship when he had engaged himself to serve i think not he would ask one man to praise him to anotherand that is not sincere he would apply for eulogy to the historian of his dayand that is not sincere he would speak ill or well of a man before the judge according as he was his client or his adversaryand that perhaps is not sincere but i know few in history on whose positive sincerity in a cause his adherents could rest with greater security look at his whole life with pompeyas to which we see his little insincerities of the moment because we have his letters to atticus but he was true to his political idea of a pompey long after that pompey had faded from his dreams for twenty years we have every thought of his heart and because the feelings of one moment vary from those of another we call him insincere what if we had pompeys thoughts and cæsars would they be less so could cæsar have told us all his feelings cicero was insincere i cannot say otherwise but he was so much more sincere than other romans as to make me feel that when writing his life i have been dealing with the character of one who might have been a modern gentleman     chapter xi  ciceros rhetoric   it is well known that ciceros works are divided into four main parts there are the rhetoric the orations the epistles and the philosophy there is a fifth part indeedthe poetry but of that there is not much and of the little we have but little is esteemed there are not many i fear who think that cicero has deserved well of his country by his poetry his prose works have been divided as i have stated them of these two portions have been dealt with alreadyas far as i am able to deal with them of the orations and epistles i have spoken as i have gone on with my task because the matter there treated has been available for the purposes of biography the other two the rhetoric and the philosophy have been distinct from the authors life239 they might have been good or bad and his life would have been still the same therefore it is necessary to divide them from his life and to speak of them separately they are the work of his silent chamber as the others were the enthusiastic outpourings of his daily spirit or the elaborated arguments of his public career who has left behind him so widely spread a breadth of literature who has made so many efforts and has so well succeeded in them all i do not know that it has ever been given to any one man to run up and down the strings of knowledge and touch them all as though each had been his peculiar study as cicero has done  his rhetoric has been always made to come first because upon the whole it was first written it may be as well here to give a list of his main works with their datespremising however that we by no means in that way get over the difficulty as to time even in cases as to which we are sure of our facts a treatise may have been commenced and then put by or may have been written some time previously to publication or it may be as were those which are called the academica that it was remodelled and altered in its shape and form the academica were written at the instance of atticus we now have the altered edition of a fragment of the first book and the original of the second book in this manner there have come discrepancies which nearly break the heart of him who would fain make his list clear but here on the whole is presented to the reader with fair accuracy a list of the works of cicero independent of that continual but everchanging current of his thought which came welling out from him daily in his speeches and his letters again however we must remember that here are omitted all those which are either wholly lost or have come to us only in fragments too abruptly broken for the purposes of continuous study of these i will not even attempt to give the names though when we remember some of the subjectsthe de gloria the de re militarihe could not go into the army for a month or two without writing a book about itthe de auguriis the de philosophia the de suis temporibus the de suis consiliis the de jure civili and the de universo we may well ask ourselves what were the subjects on which he did not write in addition to these much that has come to us has been extracted as it were unwillingly from palimpsests and is from that and from other causes fragmentary we have indeed only fragments of the essays de republica de legibus de natura deorum de divinatione and de fato in addition to the academica  the list of the works of which it is my purpose to give some shortest possible account in the following chapters is as follows

comparing honesty and expediency          it is to be observed from this list that for thirty years of his life cicero was silent in regard to literaturefor those thirty years in which the best fruits of a mans exertion are expected from him indeed we may say that for the first fiftytwo years of his life he wrote nothing but letters and speeches of the two treatises with which the list is headed the first in all probability did not come from his pen and the second is no more than a lads translation from a greek author as to the work of translation it must be understood that the greek and latin languages did not stand in reference to each other as they do now to modern readers we translate in order that the pearls hidden under a foreign language may be conveyed to those who do not read it and admit when we are so concerned that none can truly drink the fresh water from a fountain so handled the romans in translating from the greek thinking nothing of literary excellence felt that they were bringing greek thought into a form of language in which it could be thus made useful there was no value for the words but only for the thing to be found in it thence it has come that no acknowledgment is made we moderns confess that we are translating and hardly assume for ourselves a thirdrate literary place when on the other hand we find the unexpressed thought floating about the world we take it and we make it our own when we put it into a book the originality is regarded as being in the language not in the thought but to the roman when he found the thought floating about the world in the greek character it was free for him to adopt it and to make it his own cicero had he done in these days with this treatise as i have suggested would have been guilty of gross plagiarism but there was nothing of the kind known then this must be continually remembered in reading his essays you will find large portions of them taken from the greek without acknowledgment often it shall be so because it suits him to contradict an assertion or to show that it has been allowed to lead to false conclusions this general liberty of translation has been so frequently taken by the latin poetsby virgil and horace let us say as being those best knownthat they have been regarded by some as no more than translations to them to have been translators of homer or of pindar and stesichorus and to have put into latin language ideas which were noble was a work as worthy of praise as that of inventing and it must be added that the forms they have used have been perfect in their kind there has been no need to them for close translation they have found the idea and their object has been to present it to their readers in the best possible language he who has worked amid the bonds of modern translation well knows how different it has been with him there is not much in the treatise de inventione to arrest us we should say from reading it that the matter it contains is too good for the production of a youth of twentyone but that the language in which it is written is not peculiarly fine the writer intended to continue itor wrote as though he didand therefore we may imagine that it has come to us from some larger source it is full of standing cases or examples of the law courts which are brought up to show the way in which these things are handled we can imagine that a roman youth should be practised in such matters but we cannot imagine that the same youth should have thought of them all and remembered them all and should have been able to describe them  the following is an example a certain man on his journey encountered a traveller going to make a purchase having with him a sum of money they chatted along the road together and as happens on such occasions they became intimate they went to the same inn where they supped and said that they would sleep together having supped they went to bed when the landlordfor this was told after it had all been found out and he had been taken for another offencehaving perceived that one man had money in the middle of the night knowing how sound they would sleep from fatigue crept up to them and having taken out of its scabbard the sword of him that was without the money as it lay by his side he killed the other man put back the sword and then went to his bed but he whose sword had been used rose long before daylight and called loudly to his companion finding that the man slumbered too heavily to be stirred he took himself and his sword and the other things he had brought away with him and started alone but the landlord soon raised the hueandcry a man has been killed and with some of the guests followed him who had gone off they took the man on the road and dragged his sword out of its sheath which they found all bloody they carried him back to the city and he was accused in this cause there is the declaration of the crime alleged you killed the man there is the defence i did not kill him thence arises the issue the question to be judged is one of conjecture did he kill him241 we may judge from the story that the case was not one which had occurred in life but had been made up the truculent landlord creeping in and finding that everything was as he wished it and the moneyless man going off in the dark leaving his dead bedfellow behind himas the landlord had intended that he shouldform all the incidents of a stock piece for rehearsal rather than the occurrence of a true murder the same may be said of other examples adduced here as afterward by quintilian they are wellknown cases and had probably been handed down from one student to another they tell us more of the manners of the people than of the rudiments of their law  from this may be seen the nature of the work from thence we skip over thirty years and come at once to bc 55 the days of the triumvirate had come and the quarrel with clodiusof ciceros exile and his return together with the speeches which he had made in the agony of his anger against his enemies and all this had taken place since those halcyon days in which he had risen on the voices of his countrymen to be quæstor Ædile prætor and consul he had first succeeded as a public man and then having been found too honest he had failed there can be no doubt that he had failed because he had been too honest i must have told the story of his political life badly if i have not shown that cæsar had retired from the assault because cicero was consul but had retired only as a man does who steps back in order that his next spring forward may be made with more avail he chose well the time for his next attack and cicero was driven to decide between three thingshe must be cæsarean or must be quiet or he must go he would not be cæsarean he certainly could not be quiet and he went the immediate effect of his banishment was on him so great that he could not employ himself but he returned to rome and with too evident a reliance on a shortlived popularity he endeavored to replace himself in mens eyes but it must have been clear to him that he had struggled in vain then he looked back upon his art his oratory and told himself that as the life of a man of action was no longer open to him he could make for himself a greater career as a man of letters he could do so he has done so but i doubt whether he had ever a confirmed purpose as to the future had some grand consular career been open to himhad it been given to him to do by means of the law what cæsar did by ignoring the lawthis life of him would not have been written there would at any rate have been no need of these last chapters to show how indomitable was the energy and how excellent the skill of him who could write such books becausehe had nothing else to do  the de oratore is a work in three divisions addressed to his brother quintus in which it has undoubtedly been ciceros object to convince the world that an orators employment is the highest of all those given to a man to follow and this he does by showing that in all the matters which an orator is called upon to touch there is nothing which he cannot adorn by the possession of some virtue or some knowledge to us in these days he seems to put the cart before the horse and to fail from the very beginning by reason of the fact that the orator in his eloquence need never tell the truth it is in the power of man so to praiseconstancy let us sayas to make it appear of all things the best but he who sings the praise of it may be the most inconstant of mankind and may know that he is deceiving his hearers as to his own opinionsat any rate as to his own practice the virtue should come first and then the speech respecting it cicero seems to imply that if the speech be there the virtue may be assumed  but it has to be acknowledged in this and in all his discourses as to the perfect orator that it is here as it has been in all the inquirers after the greek to kalon242 we must recognize the fact that the romans have adopted a form of inquiry from the greeks and having described a more than human perfection have instigated men to work up toward it by letting it be known how high will be the excellence should it ever be attained it is so in the de oratore as to which we must begin by believing that the speechmaker wanted is a man not to be found in any house of commons no conservative and no liberal need fear that he will be put out of court by the coming of this perfectly eloquent man but this cicero of whom we are speaking has been he who has been most often quoted for his perfections243 the running after an impossible hero throws a damp over the whole search when no one can expect to find the thing sought for who can seek diligently by degrees the ambitious student becomes aware that it is impossible and is then carried on by a desire to see how he is to win a second or a third place if so much may be accorded to him in his inquiries he will find that the cicero if he look to quintilian or tacitusor the crassus if he look to cicerois so set before him as the true model and with that he may be content  the de oratore is by far the longest of his works on rhetoric and as i think the pleasantest to read it was followed after ten years by the brutus or de claris oratoribus and then by the orator but in all of them he charms us rather by his example than instructs us by his precepts he will never make us believe for instance that a man who talks well will on that account be better than a man who thinks well but he does make us believe that a man who talks as cicero knew how to do must have been well worth hearing and also that to read his words when listening to them is no longer possible is a great delight having done that he has no doubt carried his object he was too much a man of the world to have an impracticable theory on which to expend himself oratory had come uppermost with him and had indeed made itself with the romans the only pursuit to be held in rivalry with that of fighting literature had not as yet assumed its place it needed cicero himself to do that for her it required the writing of such an essay as this to show by the fact of its existence that cicero the writer stood quite as high as cicero the orator and then the written words remain when the sounds have died away we believe that cicero spoke divinely we can form for ourselves some idea of the rhythm of his periods of the words in which cicero spoke of himself as a speaker we have the entire charm  boccaccio when he takes his queen into a grassy meadow and seats her in the midst of her ladies and makes her and them and their admirers tell their stories seems to have given rise to the ideas which cicero has used when introducing his roman orators lying under a planetree in the garden of tusculum and there discussing rhetoric so much nearer to us appear the times of cicero with all the light that has been thrown upon them by their own importance than does the middle of the fourteenth century in the same country but the practice in this as in all matters of social life was borrowed from the greeks or perhaps rather the pretence of the practice we can hardly believe that romans of an advanced age would so have arranged themselves for the sake of conversation it was a manner of bringing men together which had its attraction for the minds eye and cicero whose keen imagination represented to him the pleasantness of the picture has used the form of narrative with great effect he causes crassus and antony to meet in the garden of crassus at tusculum and thither he brings on the first day old mucius scævola the augur and sulpicius and cotta two rising orators of the period on the second day scævola is supposed to be too fatigued to renew the intellectual contest and he retires but one cæsar comes in with quintus lutatius catulus and the conversation is renewed crassus and antony carry it on in chief but crassus has the leading voice cæsar who must have been the wag among barristers of his day undertakes to give examples of that attic salt by which the profundity of the law courts is supposed to have been relieved the third conversation takes place on the afternoon of the second day when they had refreshed themselves with sleep though crassus we are specially told had given himself up to the charms of no midday siesta his mind had been full of the greatness of the task before him but he will show neither fatigue nor anxiety the art the apparent ease with which it is all done the grace without languor the energy without exertion are admirable it is as though they were sitting by running water or listening to the music of some grand organ they remove themselves to a wood a little farther from the house and there they listen to the eloquence of crassus cotta and sulpicius only hear and assent or imply a modified dissent in doubting words  it is crassus who insists that the orator shall be omniscient and antony who is supposed to contest the point with him but they differ in the sweetest language and each though he holds his own does it with a deference that is more convincing than any assertion it may be as well perhaps to let it be understood that crassus and cæsar are only related by distant family tiesor perhaps only by ties of adoptionto the two of the first triumvirate whose names they bear whereas antony was the grandfather of that cleopatras lover against whom the philippics were hurled  no one as i have said before will read these conversations for the sake of the argument they contain but they are and will be studied as containing in the most appropriate language a thousand sayings respecting the art of speech no power of speaking well can belong to any but to him who knows the subjects on which he has to speak244 a fact which seems so clear that no one need be troubled with stating it were it not that men sin against it every day how great the undertaking to put yourself forward among a crowd of men as being the fittest of all there to be heard on some great subject245 though all men shall gnash their teeth i will declare that the little book of the twelve tables surpasses in authority and usefulness all the treatises of all the philosophers246 here speaks the cicero of the forum and not that cicero who amused himself among the philosophers let him keep his books of philosophy for some tusculum idleness such as is this of ours lest when he shall have to speak of justice he must go to plato and borrow from him who when he had to express him in these things created in his books some new utopia247 for in truth though cicero deals much as we shall see byandby with the philosophers and has written whole treatises for the sake of bringing greek modes of thought among the romans he loved the affairs of the world too well to trust them to philosophy there has been some talk of old age and antony before the evening has come declares his view so far do i differ from you he says that not only do i not think that any relief in age is to be found in the crowd of them who may come to me for advice but i look to its solitude as a harbor you indeed may fear it but to me it will be most welcome248  then cicero begins the second book with a renewal of the assertion as to oratory generally not putting the words into the mouth of any of his party but declaring it as his own belief this is the purpose of this present treatise and of the present time to declare that no one has been able to excel in eloquence not merely without capacity for speaking but also without acquired knowledge of all kinds249 but antony professes himself of another opinion how can that be when crassus and i often plead opposite causes and when one of us can only say the truth or how can it be possible when each of us must take the cause as it comes to him250 then again he bursts into praise of the historian as though in opposition to crassus how worthy of an orators eulogy is the writing of history whether greatest in the flood of its narrative or in its variety i do not know that we have ever treated it separately but it is there always before our eyes for who does not know that the first law of the historian is that he must not dare to say what is false the next that he must not dare to suppress what is true251 we wonder when cicero was writing this whether he remembered his request to lucceius made now two years ago he gives a piece of advice to young advocates apologizing indeed for thinking it necessary but he has found it to be necessary and he gives it let me teach this to them all when they intend to plead let them first study their causes252 it is not only here that we find that the advice which is useful now was wanted then read your cases the admonition was wanted in rome as it has been since in london  but the great mistake of the whole doctrine creeps out at every page as we go on and disproves the idea on which the de oratore is founded all ciceros treatises on the subject and quintilians and those of the pseudotacitus and of the first greek from which they have come fall to the ground as soon as we are told that it must be the purport of the orator to turn the mind of those who hear him either to the right or to the left in accordance with the drift of the cause253 the mind rejects the idea that it can be the part of a perfect man to make another believe that which he believes to be false if it be necessary that an orator should do so then must the orator be imperfect we have the same lesson taught throughout it is the great gift of the orator says antony to turn the judges mind so that he shall hate or love shall fear or hope shall rejoice or grieve or desire to pity or desire to punish254 no doubt it is a great power all that is said as to eloquence is true it may be necessary that to obtain the use of it you shall educate yourself with more precision than for any other purpose but there will be the danger that they who have fitted the dagger to the hand will use it it cannot be right to make another man believe that which you think to be false  in the use of raillery in eloquence the roman seems to have been very backward so much so that it is only by the examples given of it by themselves as examples that we learn that it existed they can appall us by the cruelty which they denounce they can melt us by their appeals to our pity they can terrify they can horrify they can fill us with fear or hope with anger with despair or with rage but they cannot cause us to laugh their attempts at a joke amuse us because we recognize the attempt here cæsar is put forward to give us the benefit of his wit we are lost in surprise when we find how miserable are his jokes and take a pride in finding that in one line we are the masters of the romans i will give an instance and i pick it out as the best among those selected by cicero nasica goes to call upon ennius and is informed by the maidservant that her master is not at home ennius returns the visit and nasica halloos out from the window that he is not within not within says ennius dont i know your voice upon which nasica replies you are an impudent fellow i had the grace to believe your maid and now you will not believe me myself255 how this got into a lawcase we do not know it is told however just as i have told it but there are enough of them here to make a small joe miller and yet in the midst of language that is almost divine in its expressions they are given as having been worthy of all attention  the third book is commenced by the finest passage in the whole treatise cicero remembers that crassus is dead and then tells the story of his death and antony is dead and the cæsars the last three had fallen in the marian massacres there is but little now in the circumstances of their death to excite our tears who knows aught of that crassus or of that antony or of those cæsars but cicero so tells it in his pretended narrative as almost to make us weep the day was coming when a greater than either of them was to die the same death as antony by the order of another antonyto have his tongue pierced and his bloody head thrust aloft upon the rostra but no roman has dared to tell us of it as cicero has told the story of those others augustus had done his work too well and it was much during his reign that romans who could make themselves heard should dare to hold their tongues  it would be useless in me here to attempt to give any notion of the laws as to speech which cicero lays down for myself i do not take them as laws feeling that the interval of time has been too great to permit laws to remain as such no orator could i feel sure form himself on ciceros ideas but the sweetness of the language is so great as to convince us that he at any rate knew how to use language as no one has done since but there is a building up of words and a turning of them round and a nice rendering there is the opposing and the loosening there is the avoiding the holding back the sudden exclamation and the dropping of the voice and the taking an argument from the case at large and bringing it to bear on a single point and the proof and the propositions together and there is the leave given and then a doubting and an expression of surprise there is the counting up the setting right the utter destruction the continuation the breaking off the pretence the answer made to ones self the change of names the disjoining and rejoining of thingsthe relation the retreat and the curtailing256 who can translate all these things when quintilian himself has been fain to acknowledge that he has attempted and has failed to handle them in fitting language  and then at last there comes that most lovely end to these most charming discourses his autem de rebus sol me ille admonuit ut brevior essem qui ipse jam præcipitans me quoque hac præcipitem pæne evolvere coegit257 these words are so charming in their rhythm that i will not rob them of their beauty by a translation the setting sun requires me also to go to rest that is their simple meaning at the end of the book he introduces a compliment to hortensius who during his life had been his great rival and who was still living when the de oratore was written  sidenote bc 52 ætat 55  the next on the list is the de optimo genere oratoruma preliminary treatise written as a preface to a translation made by himself on the speeches of Æschines and demosthenes against ctesiphon in the matter of the golden crown we have not the translations but we have his reasons for translating themnamely that he might enable readers only of latin to judge how far Æschines and demosthenes had deserved either of them the title of optimus orator for they had spoken against each other with the most bitter abuse and each spokesman was struggling for the suppression of the other each was speaking with the knowledge that if vanquished he would have to pay heavily in his person and his pocket he gives the palm to neither but he tells his readers that the attic mode of speaking is goneof which indeed the glory is known but the nature unknown but he explains that he has not translated the two pieces verbatim as an interpreter but in the spirit as an orator using the same figures the same forms the same strength of ideas we have to acknowledge that we do not see how in this way he can have done aught toward answering the question de optimo genere oratorum but he may perhaps have done something to prove that he himself in his oratory had preserved the best known grecian forms  the de partitione oratoria dialogus follows of which we have already spoken written when he was an old man and was in the sixtyfirst year of his life it was the year in which he had divorced terentia and had been made thoroughly wretched in private and in public affairs but he was not on that account disabled from preparing for his son these instructions in the form of questions and answers on the art of speaking  we next come to the brutus or de claris oratoribus a dialogue supposed to have been held between brutus atticus and cicero himself it is a continuation of the three books de oratore he there describes what is essential to the character of the optimus orator he here looks after the special man going back over the results of past ages and bringing before the readers eyes all greek and roman orators till he comes down to cicero i cannot but say that the feeling is left with the reader that the orator optimus has been reached at last in ciceros mind  we must remark in the first place that he has chosen for his friend to whom to address his piece one whom he has only known late in life it was when he went to cilicia as governor when he was fiftysix years old that he was thrown by atticus into close relations with brutus now he has next to atticus become his most chosen friend his three next treatises the orator the tusculan disquisitions and the de natura deorum have all been graced or intended to be graced by the name of brutus and yet from what we know we can hardly imagine two men less likely to be brought together by their political ambition the one compromising putting up with the bad rather than with a worse knowing that things were evil and contented to accept those that were the least so the other strict uncompromising and one who had learned lessons which had taught him that there was no choice among things that were bad and brutus too had told cicero that his lessons in oratory were not to his taste there was a something about cicero which enabled him to endure such rebukes while there was aught worthy of praise in the man who rebuked him and it was to this something that his devotion was paid we know that brutus was rapacious after money with all the greed of a roman nobleman and we know also that cicero was not cicero could keep his hands clean with thousands around him and with thousands going into the pockets of other men he could see the vice of brutus but he did not hate it he must have borne too with something from atticus of the same kind the truth seems to me that to cicero there was no horror as to greediness except to greed in himself he could hate it for himself and yet tolerate it in others as a man may cardplaying or rackets or the turf but he must have known that brutus had made himself the owner of all good gifts in learning and took him to his heart in consequence in no other way can i explain to myself the feeling of subservience to brutus which cicero so generally expresses it exists in none other of his relations of life political subservience there is to pompey but he can laugh at pompey and did not dedicate to him his treatises de republica or de legibus to appius claudius he was very courteous he thought badly of appius but hardly worse than he ought to have done of brutus of cælius he was fond of curio of trebatius to pætus he was attached to sulpicius and marcellus but to none of them did he ever show that deference which he did to brutus i could have understood this feeling as evinced in the political letters at the end of his life and have explained it to myself by saying that the ipsissima verba have not probably come to us but i cannot say that the name of brutus does not stand there written in imperishable letters on the titlepages of his most chosen pieces if this be so brutus has owed more to his learning than the respect of cicero all ages since have felt it and shakespeare has told us that brutus is an honorable man  there is a dispute as to the period of the authorship of this treatise cicero in it tells us of cato and of marcellus and therefore we must suppose that it was written when they were alive indeed he so compares cæsar and marcellus as he could not have done had they not both been alive but cato and marcellus died bc 46 and how then could the treatise have been written in bc 45 it should however be remembered that a written paper may be altered and rewritten and that the date of authorship and that of publication cannot be exactly the same but the time is of but little matter to those who can take delight in the discourse he begins by telling us how he had grieved when on his return from cilicia he had heard that hortensius was dead hortensius had brought him into the college of augurs and had there stood to him in the place of a parent and he had lamented hortensius also on behalf of rome hortensius had gone then he goes on to say that as he was thinking of these things while walking in his portico brutus had come to him and pomponius atticus he says how pleasantly they greeted each other and then gradually they go on till atticus asks him to renew the story he had before been telling in truth pomponius he says i remember it right well for then it was that i heard deiotarus that truest and best of kings defended by our brutus here deiotarus was that eastern king whose defence by cicero himself i have mentioned when speaking of his pleadings before cæsar then he rushes off into his subject and discusses at length his favorite idea it must still be remembered that neither here are to be traced any positive line of lessons in oratory there is no beginning no middle and no end to this treatise cicero runs on charming us rather by his language than by his lessons he says of eloquence that she is the companion of peace and the associate of ease258 he tells us of cato that he had read a hundred and fifty of his speeches and had found them all replete with bright words and with great matter    and yet no one in his days read catos speeches259 this of course was cato the elder then we hear how demosthenes said that in oratory action was everything it was the first thing the second and the third for there is nothing like it to penetrate into the minds of the audienceto teach them to turn them and to form them till the orator shall be made to appear exactly that which he wishes to be thought260    the man who listens to one who is an orator believes what he hears he thinks everything to be true he approves of all261 no doubt in his power of describing the orator and his work cicero is perfect but he does not describe the man doing that which he is bound to do by his duty  he tells us that nothing is worse than half a dozen advocateswhich certainly is true262 further on he comes to cæsar and praises him very highly but here brutus is made to speak and tells us how he has read the commentaries and found them to be bare in their beauty perfect in symmetry but unadorned and deprived of all outside garniture263 they are all that he has told us nor could they have been described in truer words then he names hortensius and speaks of him in language which is graceful and graphic but he reserves his greatest strength for himself and at last declaring that he will say nothing in his own praise bursts out into a string of eulogy which he is able to conceal beneath dubious phrases so as to show that he himself has acquired such a mastery over his art as to have made himself in truth the best orator of them all264  perhaps the chief charm of this essay is to be found in the lightness of the touch it is never heavy never severe rarely melancholic if read without reference to other works it would leave on the readers mind the impression that though now and again there had come upon him the memory of a friend who had gone and some remembrance of changes in the state to which as an old man he could not give his assent nevertheless it was written by a happy man by one who was contented among his books and was pleased to be reminded that things had gone well with him he writes throughout as one who had no great sorrow at his heart no one would have thought that in this very year he was perplexed in his private affairs even to the putting away of his wife that cæsar had made good his ground and having been dictator last year had for the third time become consul that he knew himself to be living as a favor by cæsars pleasure cicero seems to have written his brutus as one might write who was well at ease let a man have taught himself aught and have acquired the love of letters it is easy for him then we might say to carry on his work what is it to him that politicians are cutting each others throats around him he has not gone into that arena and fought and bled there nor need he do so though things may have gone contrary to his views he has no cause for anger none for personal disappointment none for personal shame but with cicero on every morning as he rose he must have remembered pompey and have thought of cæsar and though cæsar was courteous to him the courtesy of a ruler is hard to be borne by him who himself has ruled cæsar was consul and cicero who remembered how majestically he had walked when a few years since he was consul by the real votes of the people how he had been applauded for doing his duty to the people how he had been punished for stretching the laws on the peoples behalf how he had refused everything for the people must have had bitter feelings in his heart when he sat down to write this conversation with brutus and with atticus yet it has all the cheerfulness which might have been expected from a happy mind but we must remark that at its closein its very final wordshe does allude with sad melancholy to the state of affairs and that then it breaks off abruptly even in the middle of a sentence it is brought to a close and the reader is left to imagine that something has been lost or that more might have been added  the last of these works is the orator we have passed in review the de oratore and the brutus or de claris oratoribus we have now to consider that which is commonly believed to be the most finished piece of the three such seems to have become the general idea of those scholars who have spoken and written on the subject he himself says that there are in all five books there are the three de oratore the fourth is called the brutus and the fifth the orator265 in some mss this work has a second title de optimo genere dicendias though the five books should run on in a sequence the first three being on oratory in general the fourth as to famous orators while the last concluding work is on the best mode of oratory readers who may wish to carry these in their minds must exclude for the moment from their memory the few pages which he wrote as a preface to the translations from Æschines and demosthenes the purport is to show how that hitherto unknown hero of romance may be producedthe perfect orator  here as elsewhere we shall find the greatest interest lies in a certain discursive treatment of his subject which enables him to run hither and thither while he always pleases us whatever attitude he may assume whatever he may say and in whatever guise he may speak to us but here in the last book there does seem to be some kind of method in his discourse he distinguishes three styles of eloquencethe simple the moderate and the sublime and explains that the orator has three duties to perform he must learn what on any subject he has to say he must place his arguments in order and he must know how to express them he explains what action should achieve for the orator and teaches that eloquence depends wholly on elocution he tells us that the philosophers the historians and the poets have never risen to his ideas of eloquence but that he alone does so who can amid the heat and work of the forum turn mens minds as he wishes then he teaches us how each of the three styles should be treatedthe simple the moderate and the sublimeand shows us how to vary them he informs us what laws we should preserve in each what ornaments what form and what metaphors he then considers the words we should use and makes us understand how necessary it is to attend to the minutest variety of sound in this matter we have to acknowledge that he as a roman had to deal with instruments for listening infinitely finer than are our british ears and i am not sure that we can follow him with rapture into all the mysteries of the poeon the dochmius and the dichoreus what he says of rhythm we are willing to take to be true and we wonder at the elaborate study given to it but i doubt whether we here do not read of it as a thing beyond us by descending into which we should be removing ourselves farther from the more wholesome pursuits of our lives  there are again delightful morsels here he tells us for instance that he who has created a beautiful thing must have beauty in his soul266a charming idea as to which we do not stop to inquire whether it be true or not he gives us a most excellent caution against storing up good sayings and using them from the storehouse of our memory let him avoid these studied things not made of the moment but brought from the closet267 then he rises into a grand description of the perfect orator but that third man is he rich abundant dignified and instructed in whom there is a divine strength this is he whose fulness and culture of speech the nations have admired and whose eloquence has been allowed to prevail over the people268    then will the orator make himself felt more abundantly then will he rule their minds and turn their hearts then will he do with them as he would wish269  but in the teeth of all this it did not please brutus himself when i wrote to him he said to atticus in obedience to his wishes de optimo genere dicendi he sent word both to you and me that that which pleased me did not satisfy him270 let every man kiss his own wife says cicero in his letter in the next words to those we have quoted and we cannot but love the man for being able to joke when he is telling of the rebuff he has received it must have been an additional pang to him that he for whom he had written his book should receive it with stern rebuke  at last we come to the topica the last instructions which cicero gives on the subject of oratory the romans seem to have esteemed much the lessons which are here conveyed but for us it has but little attraction he himself declares it to have been a translation from aristotle but declares also that the translation has been made from memory he has been at sea he says in the first chapter and has there performed his task and has sent it as soon as it has been done there is something in this which is unintelligible to us he has translated a treatise of aristotle from memorythat is without having the original before himand has done this at sea on his intended journey to greece271 i do not believe that cicero has been false in so writing the work has been done for his young friend trebatius who had often asked it and was much too clever when he had received it not to recognize its worth but cicero has in accordance with his memory reduced to his own form aristotles idea as to invention in logic aristotles work is i am informed in eight books here is a bagatelle in twentyfive pages there is an audacity in the performanceespecially in the doing it on board ship but we must remember that he had spent his life in achieving a knowledge of these things and was able to write down with all the rapidity of a practised professor the doctrines on the matter which he wished to teach trebatius  this later essay is a recapitulation of the different sources to which an orator whether as lawyer advocate philosopher or statesman may look for his arguments that they should have been of any great use to trebatius in the course of his long life as attorneygeneral about the court of augustus i cannot believe i do not know that he rose to special mark as an orator though he was well known as a counsellor nor do i think that oratory or the powers of persuasion can be so brought to book as to be made to submit itself to formal rules and here they are given to us in the form of a catalogue it is for modern readers perhaps the least interesting of all ciceros works  there is left upon us after reading these treatises a general idea of the immense amount of attention which in the roman educated world was paid to the science of speaking to bring his arguments to bear at the proper momentto catch the ideas that are likely to be rising in the minds of mento know when the sympathies may be expected and when demanded when the feelings may be trusted and when they have been too blunted to be of serviceto perceive from an instinctive outlook into those before him when he may be soft when hard when obdurate and when meltingthis was the business of a roman orator and this was to be achieved only by a careful study of the characters of men it depended in no wise on virtue on morals or on truth though very much on education how he might please the multitudethis was everything to him it was all in all to him to do just that which here in our prosaic world in london we have been told that men ought not to attempt they do attempt it but they failthrough the innate honesty which there is in the hearts of men in italy in ciceros time they attempted it and did not fail but we can see what were the results  the attention which roman orators paid to their voices was as serious and demanded the same restraint as the occupations of the present athlete we are inclined to doubt whether too much of life is not devoted to the purpose it could not be done but by a people so greedy of admiration as to feel that all other things should be abandoned by those who desire to excel the actor of today will do it but it is his business to act and if he so applies himself to his profession as to succeed he has achieved his object but oratory in the law court as in parliament or in addressing the public is only the means of imbuing the minds of others with the ideas which the speaker wishes to implant there to have those ideas and to have the desire to teach them to others is more to him than the power of well expressing them to know the law is better than to talk of knowing it but with the romans so great was the desire to shine that the reality was lost in its appearance and so prone were the people to indulge in the delight of their senses that they would sacrifice a thing for a sound and preferred lies in perfect language to truth in halting syllables this feeling had sunk deep into ciceros heart when he was a youth and has given to his character the only stain which it has he would be patriotic to love his country was the first duty of a roman he would be honest so much was indispensable to his personal dignity but he must so charm his countrymen with his voice as to make them feel while they listened to him that some god addressed them in this way he became permeated by the love of praise till it was death to him not to be before the lamps  the perfect orator is we may say a person neither desired nor desirable we who are the multitude of the world and have been born to hold our tongues and use our brains would not put up with him were he to show himself but it was not so in ciceros time and this was the way he took to sing the praises of his own profession and to magnify his own glory he speaks of that profession in language so excellent as to make us who read his words believe that there was more in it than it did in truth hold but there was much in it and the more so as the performers reacted upon their audience the delicacy of the powers of expression had become so great that the powers of listening and distinguishing had become great also as the instruments became fine so did the ears which were to receive their music cicero and quintilian after him tell us this the latter in speaking of the nature of the voice gives us a string of epithets which it would be hopeless to attempt to translate nam est et candida et fusca et plena et exilis et levis et aspera et contracta et fusa et dura et flexibilis et clara et obtusa spiritus etiam longior breviorque272 and the remarkable thing was that every roman who listened would understand what the orator intended and would know too and would tell him of it if by error he had fallen into some cadence which was not exactly right to the modes of raising the voice which are usually divided into threethe high or treble the low or bass and that which is between the two the contralto and tenormany others are added there are the eager and the soft the higher and the lower notes the quicker and the slower it seems little to us who know that we can speak or whisper hammer our words together or drawl them out but then every listener was critically alive to the fact whether the speaker before him did or did not perform his task as it should be done no wonder that cicero demanded who was the optimus orator then the strength of body had to be matured lest the voice should fall to a sick womanly weakness like that of an eunuch this must be provided by exercise by anointing by continence by the easy digestion of the foodwhich means moderation and the jaws must be free so that the words must not strike each other and as to the action of the orator cicero tells us that it should speak as loudly and as plainly as do the words themselves in all this we find that quintilian only follows his master too closely the hands the shoulders the sides the stamping of the foot the single step or many stepsevery motion of the body agreeing with the words from his mouth are all described273 he attributes this to antonybut only because as he thinks of it some movement of antonys has recurred to his memory  to make the men who heard him believe in him was the one gift which cicero valued not to make them know him to be true but to believe him to be so this it was in ciceros time to be the optimus orator  since ciceros time there has been some progress in the general conduct of men they are less greedy less cruel less selfishgreedy cruel and selfish though they still are the progress which the best among us have made cicero in fact achieved but he had not acquired that theoretic aversion to a lie which is the first feeling in the bosom of a modern gentleman therefore it was that he still busied himself with finding the optimus orator     chapter xii  ciceros philosophy   it will have been observed that in the list given in the previous chapter the works commonly published as ciceros philosophy have been divided some are called his philosophy and some his moral essays it seems to be absurd to put forward to the world his tusculan inquiries written with the declared object of showing that death and pain were not evils together with a moral essay such as that de officiis in which he tells us what it may become a man of the world to do it is as though we bound up lord chesterfields letters in a volume with humes essays and called them the philosophy of the eighteenth century it might be true but it would certainly be absurd there might be those who regard the letters as philosophical and those who would so speak of the essays but their meaning would be diametrically opposite it is so with cicero whose treatises have been lumped together under this name with the view of bringing them under one appellation it had been found necessary to divide his works and to describe them the happy man who first thought to put the de natura deorum and the de amicitia into boards together and to present them to the world under the name of his philosophy perhaps found the only title that could unite the two but he has done very much to mislead the world and to teach readers to believe that cicero was in truth one who endeavored to live in accordance with the doctrine of any special school of philosophy  he was too honest too wise too civilized too modern for that he knew no one better that the pleasure of the world was pleasant and that the ills are the reverse when his wife betrayed him he grieved when his daughter died he sorrowed when his foe was strong against him he hated him he avoided pain when it came near him and did his best to have everything comfortable around him he was so far an epicurean as we all are he did not despise death or pain or grief he was a modernminded manif i make myself understoodof robust tendencies moral healthy and enduring but he was anything but a philosopher in his life let us remember the way in which he laughs at the idea of bringing philosophy into real life in the de oratore he is speaking of the manner in which the lawyers would have had to behave themselves in the law courts if philosophy had been allowed to prevail no man could have grieved aloud no patron would have wept no one would have sorrowed there would have been no calling of the republic to witness not a man would have dared to stamp his foot lest it should have been told to the stoics274 you should keep the books of the philosophers for your tusculan ease he had said in the preceding chapter and he speaks in the same page of platos fabulous state  then why it may be asked did he write so many essays on philosophyenough to have consumed the energies of many laborious years there can be no doubt that he did write the philosophy though we have ample reason to know that it was not his philosophy all those treatises beginning with the academicawritten when he was sixtytwo two years only before his death and carried on during twelve months with indomitable energythe de finibus the tusculan disputations the de natura deorum the de divinatione and the de fatowere composed during the time named to those who have regarded cicero as a philosopheras one who has devoted his life to the pursuits of philosophydoes it not appear odd that he should have deferred his writing on the subject and postponed his convictions till now at this special period of his life why should he have rushed into them at once and should so have done it as to be able to leave them aside at another period why has all this been done within less than two years let any man look to the last year of his life when the philippics were coming hot from his brain and eager from his mouth and ask himself how much of greek philosophy he finds in them out of all the sixtyfour years of his life he devoted one to this philosophy and that not the last but the penultimate and so lived during all these years even including that one as to show how little hold philosophy had upon his conduct greek aideomai trôas was that greek philosophy or the eager exclamation of a human spirit in its weakness and in its strength fearing the breath of his fellowmen and yet knowing that the truth would ultimately be expressed by it  nor is the reason for this far to seek though the character which could avail itself of such a reason requires a deep insight to him literature had been everything we have seen with what attention he had studied oratoryrhetoric ratherso as to have at his fingersends the names of those who had ever shone in it and the doctrines they had taught we know how well read he was in homer and the greek tragedians how he knew by heart his ennius his nævius his pacuvius and the others who had written in his own tongue as he was acquainted with the poets and rhetoricians so also was he acquainted with those writers who have handled philosophy his incredible versatility was never at fault he knew them all from the beginning and could interest himself in their doctrines he had been in the schools at athens and had learned it all in one sense he believed in it there was a great battle of words carried on and in regard to that battle he put his faith in this set or in the other but had he ever been asked by what philosophical process he would rule the world he would have smiled then he would have declared himself not to be an academician but a republican  it was with him a game of play ornamented with all the learning of past ages he had found the schools full of it at athens and had taken his part in their teaching it had been pleasant to him to call himself a disciple of plato and to hold himself aloof from the straitness of the stoics and from the mundane theories of the followers of epicurus it had been well for him also to take an interest in that play but to suppose that cicero the modern cicero the cicero of the worldcicero the polished gentleman cicero the soft hearted cicero the hater cicero the lover cicero the humanwas a believer in greek philosophythat he had taken to himself and fed upon those shreds and tatters and dry sticksthat he had ever satisfied himself with such a mode of living as they could promise to himis indeed to mistake the man his soul was quiveringly alive to all those instincts which now govern us go among our politicians and you shall find this man and the other who in afterdinner talk shall call himself an epicurean or shall think himself to be an academician he has carried away something of the learning of his college days and remembers enough of his school exercises for that but when he has to make a speech for or against protection then you will find out where lies his philosophy  and so it was with cicero during this the penultimate year of his life he poured forth during this period such an amount of learning on the subject that when men took it up after the lapse of centuries they labelled it all as his philosophy when he could no longer talk politics nor act themwhen the forum was no longer open to him nor the meetings of the people or of the senatewhen he could no longer make himself heard on behalf of the statethen he took to discussions on carneades and his discussions are wonderful how could he lay his mind to work when his daughter was dead and write in beautiful language four such treatises as came from his pen while he was thinking of the temple which was to be built to her memory it is a marvel that at such a period at such an age he should have been equal to the labor but it was thus that he amused himself consoled himself distracted himself it is hard to believe that in the sad evening of his life such a power should have remained with him but easier i think than to imagine that in that year of his life he had suddenly become philosophical  in describing the academica the first of these works in point of time it is necessary to explain that by reason of an alteration in his plan of publishing made by cicero after he had sent the first copy to atticus and by the accident that the second part has been preserved of the former copy and the first part of the second a confusion has arisen cicero had felt that he might have done better by his friends than to bring hortensius catulus and lucullus discussing greek philosophy before the public they were none of them men who when alive had interested themselves in the matter he therefore rewrote the essays or altered them and again sent them forth to his friend varro time has been so far kind to them as to have preserved portions of the first book as altered and the second of the four which constituted the first edition it is that which has been called lucullus the catulus had come first but has been lost hortensius and cicero were the last two we may perceive therefore into what a length of development he carried his purpose it must be of course understood that he dictated these exercises and assisted himself by the use of all mechanical means at his disposal the men who worked for him were slaves and these slaves were always willing to keep in their own hands the good things which came to them by the exercise of their own intelligence and adroitness he could not multiply his own hands or brain but he could multiply all that might assist them he begins by telling varro that he has long since desired to illustrate in latin letters the philosophy which socrates had commended and he asks varro why he who was so much given to writing had not as yet written about any of these things as varro boasted afterward that he was the author of four hundred and ninety books there seems to be a touch of irony in this be that as it may varro is made to take up the gauntlet and to rush away at once amid the philosophers but here on the threshold as it were of his inquiries we have ciceros own reasons given in plain language but now hit hard by the heavy blow of fortune and freed as i am from looking after the state i seek from philosophy relief from my pain he thinks that he may in this way perhaps best serve the public or even if it be not so what else is there that he may find to do275 as he goes on however we find that what he writes is about the philosophers rather than philosophy  then we come to the lucullus it seems odd that the man whose name has come down to us as a byword for luxury and who is laden with the reproach of overeating should be thus brought forward as a philosopher it was perhaps the subsequent feeling on ciceros part that such might be the opinion of men which induced him to alter his formin vain as far as we are concerned but lucullus had lived with antiochus a greek philosopher who had certain views of his own and he is made to defend them through this book  here as elsewhere it is not the subject which delights us so much as the manner in which he handles certain points almost outside the subject how many things do those exercised in music know which escape us ah there is antiope they say that is andromache276 what can be truer or less likely we may suppose to meet us in a treatise on philosophy and therefore more welcome he is speaking of evidence it is necessary that the mind shall yield to what is clear whether it wish it or no as the dish in a balance must give way when a weight is put upon it277    you may snore if you will as well as sleep says carneades what good will it do you278 and then he gives the guesses of some of the old philosophers as to the infinite thales has said that water is the source of everything anaximander would not agree to this for he thought that all had come from space anaximenes had affirmed that it was air anaxagoras had remarked that matter was infinite xenophanes had declared that everything was one whole and that it was a god everlasting eternal never born and never dying but round in his shape parmenides thought that it was fire that moved the earth leucippus believed it to be plenum et inane what full and empty may mean i cannot tell but democritus could for he believed in itthough in other matters he went a little farther empedocles sticks to the old four elements heraclitus is all for fire melissus imagines that whatever exists is infinite and immutable and ever has been and ever will be plato thinks that the world has always existed while the pythagoreans attribute everything to mathematics279 your wise man continues cicero will know one whom to choose out of all these let the others who have been repudiated retire  they are all concealed these thingshidden in thick darkness so that no human eye can have power enough to look up into the heavens or down on to the earth we do not know our own bodies or the nature or strength of their component parts the doctors themselves who have opened them and looked at them are ignorant the empirics declare that they know nothing because as soon as looked at they may change    hicetas the syracusan as theophrastus tells us thinks that the heavens and the sun and the moon and the stars all stand still and that nothing in all the world moves but the earth now what do you followers of epicurus say to this280 i need not carry the conversation on any farther to show that cicero is ridiculing the whole thing this hicetas the syracusan seems to have been nearer the mark than the others according to the existing lights which had not shone out as yet in ciceros days but what was the meaning of it all who knows anything about it how is a man to live by listening to such trash as this it is thus that cicero means to be understood i will agree that cicero does not often speak out so clearly as he does here turning the whole thing into ridicule he does generally find it well to say something in praise of these philosophers he does not quite declare the fact that nothing is to be made of them or rather there is existing in it all an under feeling that were he to do so he would destroy his character and rob himself of his amusement but we remember always his character of a philosopher as attributed to cato in his speech during his consulship for murena i have told the story when giving an account of the speech he who cuts the throat of an old cock when there is no need has sinned as deeply as the parricide when breaking his fathers neck281 says cicero laughing at the stoics there he speaks out the feelings of his heartthere and often elsewhere in his orations here in his academica he is eloquent on the same side we cannot but rejoice at the plainness of his words but it has to be acknowledged that we do not often find him so loudly betraying himself when dealing with the old discussions of the greek philosophers  very quickly after his academica in bc 45 came the five books de finibus bonorum et malorum written as though with the object of settling the whole controversy and declaring whether the truth lay with the epicureans the stoics or the academics what at last is the good thing and what the evil thing and how shall we gain the one and avoid the other if he will tell us this he will have proved himself to be a philosopher to some purpose but he does nothing of the kind at the end of the fifth book we find atticus who was an epicurean declaring to quintus cicero that he held his own opinion just as firmly as ever although he had been delighted to hear how well the academician piso had talked in latin he had hitherto considered that these were things which would not sound well unless in the greek language  it is again in the form of a dialogue and like all his writings at this time is addressed to brutus it is in five books the first two are supposed to have been held at cumæ between cicero torquatus and triarius here after a prelude in favor of philosophy and latin together torquatus is allowed to make the best excuse he can for epicurus the prelude contains much good sense for whether he be right or not in what he says it is good for every man to hold his own language in respect i have always thought and said that the latin language is not poor as it is supposed to be but even richer than the greek282 let us learn says torquatus who has happened to call upon him at cumæ with triarius a grave and learned youth as we are told since we have found you at your house why it is that you do not approve of epicurushe who alive seems to have freed the minds of men from error and to have taught them everything which could tend to make them happy283 then torquatus goes to work and delivers a most amusing discourse on the wisdom of democritus and his great disciple the words fly about with delightful power so as to leave upon our minds an idea that torquatus is persuading his audience for it is ciceros peculiar gift in whosesoever mouth he puts his words to make him argue as though he were the victor we feel sure that had he in his hand held a theory contrary to that of torquatus had he in truth cared about it he could not have made torquatus speak so well but the speaker comes to an end and assures his hearers that his only object had been to hearas he had never heard beforewhat ciceros own opinion might be on the matter  the second book is a continuation of the same meeting the word is taken up by cicero and he refutes torquatus it seems to us however that poor epicurus is but badly treatedas has been generally the case in the prose works which have come down to us we have indeed the poem of lucretius and it is admitted that it contains fine passages but i was always told when young that the writing of it had led him to commit suicidea deed on his part which seems to have been painted in black colors though cato and brutus the stoics did the same thing very gloriously the epicureans are held to be sensualists because they have used the word pleasure instead of happiness and cicero is hard upon them he tells a story of the dying moments of epicurus quoting a letter written on his deathbed while i am writing he says i am living my last hour and the happiest i have so bad a pain in my stomach that nothing can be worse but i am compensated for it all by the joy i feel as i think of my philosophical discourses284 cicero then goes on to declare that though the saying is very noble it is unnecessary he should not in truth have required compensation but whenever an opinion is enunciated the reader feels it to be unnecessary he does not want opinion he is satisfied with the language in which cicero writes about the opinions of others and with the amusing manner in which he deals with things of themselves heavy and severe  in the third book he some time afterward discusses the stoic doctrine with cato at the tusculan villa of lucullus near to his own he had walked over and finding cato there by chance had immediately gone to work to demolish catos philosophical doctrines he tells us what a glutton cato was over his books taking them even into the senate with him cicero asks for certain volumes of aristotle and cato answers him that he would fain put into his hand those of zenos school  we can see how easily cato falls into the trap he takes up his parable and preaches his sermon but he does it with a marvellous enthusiasm so that we cannot understand that the man who wrote it intended to demolish it all in the next few pages i will translate his last words of catos appeal to the world at large i have been carried farther than my intention but in truth the admirable order of the system and the incredible symmetry of it has led him on by the gods do you not wonder at it in nature there is nothing so close packed nor in art so well fitted the latter always agrees with the formerthat which follows with that which has gone before not a stone in it all can be moved from its place if you touch but one letter it falls to the ground how severe how magnificent how dignified stands out the person of the wise man who when his reason shall have taught him that virtue is the only good of a necessity must be happy he shall be more justly called king than tarquin who could rule neither himself nor others more rightly dictator than sulla the owner of the three vices luxury avarice and cruelty more rightly rich than crassus who had he not in truth been poor would never have crossed the euphrates in quest of war all things are justly his who knows how to use them justly you may call him beautiful whose soul is more lovely than his body he is free who is slave to no desire he is unconquered for whose mind you can forge no chains you need not wait with him for the last day to pronounce him happy if this be so then the good man is also the happy man what can be better worth our study than philosophy or what more heavenly than virtue285 all of this was written by cicero in most elaborate language with a finish of words polished down to the last syllable because he had nothing else wherewith to satisfy the cravings of his intellect  the fourth book is a continuation of the argument which when he had said he made an endbut i began286 with no other introduction cicero goes to work and demolishes every word that cato had said he is very courteous so that cato cannot but admit that he is answered becomingly but to use a common phrase he does not leave him a leg to stand upon although during the previous book cato has talked so well that the reader will think that there must be something in it he soon is made to perceive that the stoic budge is altogether shoddy  the fifth and last book de finibus is supposed to recount a dialogue held at athens or rather gives the circumstances of a discourse pretended to have been delivered there by pupius piso to the two ciceros and to their cousin lucius on the merits of the old academy and the aristotelian peripatetics for platos philosophy had got itself split into two there was the old and the new and we may perhaps doubt to which cicero devoted himself he certainly was not an epicurean and he certainly was not a stoic he delighted to speak of himself as a lover of plato but in some matters he seems to have followed aristotle who had diverged from plato and he seems also to have clung to carneades who had become master of the new academy but in truth to ascertain the special doctrine of such a man on such a subject is vain as we read these works we lose ourselves in admiration of his memory we are astonished at the industry which he exhibits we are delighted by his perspicuity and feel ourselves relieved amid the crowd of names and theories by flashes of his wit but there comes home to us as a result the singular fact of a man playing with these theories as the most interesting sport the world had produced but not believing the least in any of them it was not that he disbelieved and perhaps among them all the tenets of the new academy were those which reconciled themselves the best to his commonsense but they were all nothing to him but an amusement  in this book there are some exquisite bits he says speaking of athens that go where you will through the city you place your footsteps on the vestiges of history287 he says of a certain demetrius whom he describes as writing books without readers in egypt that this culture of his mind was to him as it were the food by which his humanity was kept alive288 and then he falls into the praise of our love for our neighbors and introduces us to that true philosophy which was the real guide of his life among things which are honest he says there is nothing which shines so brightly and so widely as that brotherhood between men that agreement as to what may be useful to all and that general love for the human race it comes from our original condition in which children are loved by their parents and then binding together the family it spreads itself abroad among relations connections friends and neighbors then it includes citizens and those who are our allies at last it takes in the whole human race and that feeling of the soul arises which giving every man his own and defending by equal laws the rights of each is called justice289 it matters little how may have been introduced this great secret which christ afterward taught and for which we look in vain through the writings of all the philosophers it comes here simply from cicero himself in the midst of his remarks on the new academy but it gives the lesson which had governed his life i will do unto others as i would they should do unto me in this is contained the rudiments of that religion which has served to soften the hearts of us all it is of you i must think and not of myself hitherto the schools had taught how a man should make himself happy whether by pleasure whether by virtue or whether by something between the two it seems that it had never as yet occurred to a man to think of another except as a part of the world around him then there had come a teacher who while fumbling among the old greek lessons which had professed to tell mankind what each should do for himself brings forth this as it were in preparation for the true doctrine that was to come ipsa caritas generis humanithat love of the human race i trust i may be able to show before i have finished my work that this was ciceros true philosophy all the rest is merely with him a play of words  our next work contains the five books of the tusculan disputations addressed to brutus tusculanarum disputationum ad m brutum libri i ii iii iv and v that is the name that has at last been decided by the critics and annotators as having been probably given to them by cicero they are supposed to have been written to console himself in his grief for the death of tullia i have great doubt whether consolation in sorrow is to be found in philosophy but i have none as to the finding it in writing philosophy here i may add that the poor generally suffer less in their sorrow than the rich because they are called upon to work for their bread the man who must make his pair of shoes between sunrise and the moment at which he can find relief from his weary stool has not time to think that his wife has left him and that he is desolate in the world pulling those weary threads getting that leather into its proper shape seeing that his stitches be all taut so that he do not lose his place among the shoemakers so fills his time that he has not a moment for a tear and it is the same if you go from the lowest occupation to the highest writing greek philosophy does as well as the making of shoes the nature of the occupation depends on the mind but its utility on the disposition it was ciceros nature to write will any one believe that he might not as well have consoled himself with one of his treatises on oratory but philosophy was then to his hands it seems to have cropped up in his latter years after he had become intimate with brutus when life was again one turmoil of political fever it was dropped  in the five of the books of the tusculan disputations still addressed to brutus he contends 1 that death is no evil 2 that pain is none 3 that sorrow may be abolished 4 that the passions may be conquered 5 that virtue will suffice to make a man happy these are the doctrines of the stoics but cicero does not in these books defend any school especially he leans heavily on epicurus and gives all praise to socrates and to plato but he is comparatively free nullius adductus jurare in verba magistri290 as horace afterward said probably ridiculing cicero i live for the day whatever strikes my mind as probable that i say in this way i alone am free291  let us take his dogmas and go through them one by one comparing each with his own life this it may be said is a crucial test to which but few philosophers would be willing to accede but if it shall be found that he never even dreamed of squaring his conduct with his professions then we may admit that he employed his time in writing these things because it did not suit him to make his pair of shoes  was there ever a man who lived with a greater fear of death before his eyesnot with the fear of a coward but with the assurance that it would withdraw him from his utility and banish him from the scenes of a world in sympathy with which every pulse of his heart was beating even after tullia was dead the republic had come again for him and something might be done to stir up these fainéant nobles what could a dead man do for his country look back at ciceros life and see how seldom he has put forward the plea of old age to save him from his share of the work of attack was this the man to console himself with the idea that death was no evil and did he despise pain or make any attempt at showing his disregard of it you can hardly answer this question by looking for a mans indifference when undergoing it it would be to require too much from philosophy to suppose that it could console itself in agony by reasoning it would not be fair to insist on arguing with cato in the gout the clemency of human nature refuses to deal with philosophy in the hard straits to which it may be brought by the malevolence of evil but when you find a man peculiarly on the alert to avoid the recurrence of pain when you find a man with a strong premeditated antipathy to a condition as to which he pretends an indifference then you may fairly assert that his indifference is only a matter of argument and this was always ciceros condition he knew that he must at any rate lose the time passed by him under physical annoyance his health was good and by continued care remained so to the end but he was always endeavoring to avoid seasickness he was careful as to his baths careful as to his eyes very careful as to his diet was there ever a man of whom it might be said with less truth that he was indifferent as to pain  the third position is that sorrow may be abolished read his letters to atticus about his daughter tullia written at the very moment he was proving this he was a heartbroken sorrowstricken man it will not help us now to consider whether in this he showed strength or weakness there will be doubt about it whether he gained or lost more by that deep devotion to another creature which made his life a misery to him because that other one had gone whether too he might not have better hidden his sorrow than have shown it even to his friend but with him at any rate it was there he can talk over it weep over it almost laugh over it but if there be a thing that he cannot do it is to treat it after the manner of a stoic  his passions should be conquered look back at every period of his life and see whether he has ever attempted it he has always been indignant or triumphant or miserable or rejoicing remember the incidents of his life before and after his consulshipthe day of his election and the day of his banishmentand ask the philosophers why he had not controlled his passion i shall be told perhaps that here was a man over whom in spite of his philosophy his passion had the masterhood but what attempt did he ever make has he shown himself to us to be a man with a leaning toward such attempts has he not revelled in his passions feeling them to be just righteous honest and becoming a man has he regretted them did they occasion him remorse will any one tell me that such a one has lived with the conviction that he might conquer the evils of the world by controlling his passions that virtue will make men happy he might probably have granted if asked but he would have conceded the point with a subterfuge the commonest christian of the day will say as much but he will say it in a different meaning from that intended by the philosophers who had declared as a rule of life that virtue would suffice to make them happy to be good to your neighbors will make you happy in the manner described by cicero in the fifth book de finibus love those who come near you be good to your fellowcreatures think when dealing with each of them what his feelings may be melt to a woman in her sorrow lend a man the assistance of your shoulder be patient with age be tender with children let others drink of your cup and eat of your loaf where the wind cuts there lend your cloak that virtue will make you happy but that is not the virtue of which he spoke when he laid down his doctrine that was not the virtue with which brutus was strong when he was skinning those poor wretches of salamis such was the virtue with which the heart of cicero glowed when he saw the tradesmen of the cilician town come out into the marketplace with their corn  cicero begins the second book of the tusculans by telling us that neoptolemus liked to do a little philosophy now and then but never too much at a time with himself the matter was different in what else is there that i can do better then he takes the bit between his teeth and rushes away with it the reader feels that he would not stop him if he could he does little indeed for philosophy but so much for literature that he would be a bold man who would want to have him otherwise employed  he wrote three treatises de natura deorum had he declared that he would write three treatises to show the ideas which different men had taken up about the gods he would be nearer to the truth we have an idea of what was ciceros real notion of that dominans in nobis deus292that god which reigns within usand which he declares in scipios dream to have forbidden us to commit suicide nothing can be farther removed from that idea than the gods of which he tells us either in the first book in which the gods of epicurus are set forth in the second in which the stoics are defended or the third in which the gods in accordance with the academy are maintained not but that either for the one or for the other the man who speaks up for that sect does not say the best that is to be said velleius is eloquent for the epicureans balbus for the stoics and cotta for the academy and in that which each says there is to be found a germ of truththough indeed cicero makes his epicurean as absurd as he well can do but he does not leave a trace behind of that belief in another mans belief which an energetic preacher is sure to create the language is excellent the stories are charming the arguments as used against each other are courteous clever and such that on the spur of the moment a man cannot very well reply to them but they leave on the mind of the reader a sad feeling of the lack of reality  in the beginning he again repeats his reasons for writing on such subjects so late in life being sick with ease and having found the condition of the republic to be such that it has to be ruled by one man i have thought it good for the sake of the republic to write about philosophy in a language that shall be understood by all our citizens believing it to be a matter of great import to the glory of the state that things of such weight should be set forth in the latin tongue293 not that the philosophy should be set forth but what the different teachers said about it his definition of eternityor rather the want of definitionis singular there has been from all time an eternity which no measurement of time can describe its duration cannot be understoodthat there should have been a time before time existed294 then there comes an idea of the godhead escaping from him in the midst of his philosophy modern human and truly ciceronian lo it comes to pass that this god of whom we are sure in our minds and of whom we hold the very footprints on our souls can never appear to us295  byandby we come to a passage in which we cannot but imagine that cicero does express something of the feeling of his heart as for a moment he seems to lose his courtesy in abusing the epicureans therefore do not waste your salt of which your people are much in want in laughing at us indeed if you will listen to me you will not try to do so it does not become you it is not given to you you have not the power i do not say this to you he says addressing velleius for your manners have been polished and you possess the courtesy of our people but i am thinking of you all as a body and chiefly of him who is the father of your rulesa man without science without lettersone who insults all without critical ability without weight without wit296 cicero i think must have felt some genuine dislike for epicurus when he spoke of him in such terms as these  then alas there is commenced a passage in which are inserted many translated verses of the greek poet aratus cicero when a lad had taken in hand the phænomena of aratus and here he finds a place in which can be introduced some of his lines aratus had devoted himself to the singing of the stars and has produced for us many of the names with which we are still familiar the twins the bull the great bear cassiopeia the waterman the scorpion these and many others are made to come forward in hexametersand by cicero in latin as by aratus in their greek guise we may suppose that the poem as translated had fallen deadbut here it is brought to life and is introduced into what is intended as at least a rationalistic account of the gods and their nature nothing less effective can be imagined than the repetition of uninteresting verses in such a place for the reader who has had epicurus just handled for him is driven to remember that their images are at any rate as false as the scheme of epicurus and is made to conclude that balbus does not believe in his own argument it has been sometimes said of cicero that he is too long the lines have probably been placed here as a joke though they are inserted at such a length as to carry the reader away altogether into another world  farther on he devotes himself to anatomical research which for that age shows an accurate knowledge but what has it to do with the nature of the gods when the belly which is placed under the stomach becomes the receptacle of meat and drink the lungs and the heart draw in the air for the stomach the stomach which is wonderfully arranged consists chiefly of nerves    the lungs are light and porous and like a spongejust fit for drawing in the breath they blow themselves out and draw themselves in so that thus may be easily received that sustenance most necessary to animal life297  the third book is but a fragment but it begins well with pleasant raillery against epicurus cotta declares that he had felt no difficulty with epicurus epicurus and his allies had found little to say as to the immortal gods his gods had possessed arms and legs but had not been able to move them but from balbus the stoic they had heard much which though not true was nevertheless truthlike in all these discourses it seems that the poor epicureans are treated with but a moderate amount of mercy but cotta continues and tells many stories of the gods he is interrupted in his tale for the sad hand of destruction has fallen upon the ms and his arguments have come to us unfinished it is better he says not to give wine to the sick at all because you may injure them by the application in the same way i do not know whether it would not be better to refuse that gift of reason that sharpness and quickness of thought to men in general than to bestow it upon them so often to their own destruction298 it is thus that is discussed the nature of the gods in this work of cicero which is indeed a discussion on the different schools of philosophy each in the position which it had reached in his time  the de natura deorum is followed by two books de divinatione and by the fragment of one de fato divination is the science of predicting events by fatum cicero means destiny or that which has been fixed beforehand the three books together may be taken as religious discourses and his purport seems to have been to show that it might be the duty of the state to foster observances and even to punish their nonobservancefor the benefit of the wholeeven though they might not be in themselves true he is here together with his brother or with those whom like his brother he may suppose to have emancipated themselves from superstitionand tells him or them that though they do not believe they should feign belief if the augurs declare by the flight of birds that such a thing should be done let it be done although he who has to act in the matter has no belief in the birds if they declare that a matter has been fixed by fate let it be as though it were fixed whether fixed or no he repudiates the belief as unreasonable or childish but recommends that men should live as though they believed in such a theory as this put thus before the reader there will seem to be dissimulation i cannot deny that it is so though most anxious to assert the honesty of cicero i can only say that such dissimulation did prevail then and that it does prevail now if any be great enough to condemn the hierarchs of all the churches he may do so and may include cicero with the archbishop of canterbury i am not it seems necessary to make allowance for the advancing intelligence of men and unwise to place yourself so far ahead as to shut yourself out from that common pale of mankind i distrust the selfconfidence of him who thinks that he can deduce from one acknowledged error a whole scheme of falsehood i will take our protestant church of england religion and will ask some thoughtful man his belief as to its changing doctrines and will endeavor to do so without shocking the feelings of any when did sabbatarian observances begin to be required by the word of god and when again did they cease to be so if it were worth the while of those who have thought about the subject to answer my question the replies would be various it has never begun it has never wavered and there would be the intermediate replies of those who acknowledge that the feeling of the country is altering and has altered in the midst of this how many a father of a family is there who goes to church for the sake of example does not the church admit prayers for change of weather ask the clergyman on his way from church what he is doing with his own haystack and his answer will let you know whether he believes in his own prayers he has lent all the sanctity of his voice to the expression of words which had been written when the ignorance of men as to the works of nature was greater or written yesterday because the ignorance of man has demanded it or they who have demanded it have not perhaps been ignorant themselves but have thought it well to subserve the superstition of the multitude i am not saying this as against the religious observances of today but as showing that such is still the condition of men as to require the defence which cicero also required when he wrote as follows former ages erred in much which we know to have been changed by practice by doctrine or by time but the custom the religion the discipline the laws of the augurs and the authority of the college are retained in obedience to the opinion of the people and to the great good of the state our consuls claudius and junius were worthy of all punishment when they put to sea in opposition to the auspices for men must obey religion nor can the customs of our country be set aside so easily299 no stronger motive for adhering to religious observances can be put forward than the opinion of the people and the good of the state there will be they who aver that truth is great and should be allowed to prevail though broken worlds should fall in disorder round their heads they would stand firm amid the ruins but they who are likely to be made responsible will not cause worlds to be broken  such i think was the reasoning within ciceros mind when he wrote these treatises in the first he encounters his brother quintus at his tusculan villa and there listens to him discoursing in favor of religion quintus is altogether on the side of the gods and the auspices he is as we may say a gentleman of the old school and is thoroughly conservative in this way he has an opportunity given him of showing the antiquity of his belief stare super vias antiquas is the motto of quintus cicero then he proceeds to show the two kinds of divination which have been in use there is the one which he calls ars and which we perhaps may call experience the soothsayer predicts in accordance with his knowledge of what has gone before he is asked to say for instance whether a ship shall put to sea on a friday he knowsor thinks that he knows or in his ignorance declares that he thinks that he knowsthat ships that have put to sea on friday have generally gone to the bottom he therefore predicts against the going to sea although the ship should put forth on the intended day and should make a prosperous voyage the prophet has not been proved to be false that can only be done by showing that ships that have gone to sea on friday have generally been subject to no greater danger than othersa process which requires the close observations of science to make good that is art then there is the prediction which comes from a mind disturbedone who dreams let us say or prophesies when in a fitas the sibyl or epimenides of crete who lived one hundred and fiftyseven years but slept during sixtyfour of them quintus explains as to these that the god does not desire mankind to understand them but only to use them300  he tells us many amusing details as to prophetic dreams and the doings of soothsayers and wise men the book so becomes chatty and full of anecdotes and interspersed with many pieces of poetrysome by others and some by cicero here are given those lines as to the battle of the eagle and the dragon which i have ventured to call the best amid the nine versions brought forward301  we cannot but sympathize with him in the reason which he prefixes to the second book of this treatise i often ask myself and turn in my mind how best i may serve the largest number of my fellowcitizens lest there should come a time in which i should seem to have ceased to be anxious for the state and nothing better has occurred to me than that i should make known the way of studying the best artswhich indeed i think i have now done in various books302 then he recapitulates them there is the opening work on philosophy which he had dedicated to hortensius now lost then in the four books of the academics he had put forward his ideas as to that school which he believed to be the least arrogant and the truestmeaning the new academy after that as he had felt all philosophy to be based on the search after good and evil he had examined that matter the tusculan inquiries had followed in which he had set forth in five books the five great rules of living well having finished this he had written his three books on the nature of the gods and was now in the act of completing it and would complete it by his present inquiries we cannot but sympathize with him because we know that though he was not quite in earnest in all this he was as near it as a man can be who teaches that which he does not quite believe himself brutus believed it and cato and that velleius and that balbus and that cotta or if perchance any of them did not they lived and talked and read and were as erudite about it as though they did the example was good and the precepts were the best to be had amid it all he chose the best doctrine and he was undoubtedly doing good to his countrymen in thus representing to them in their native language the learning by which they might best be softened    græcia capta ferum victorem cepit et artes    intulit agresti latio303  here too he explains his own conduct in a beautiful passage my fellowcitizens says he will pardon me or perhaps will rather thank me for that when the republic fell into the power of one man i neither hid myself nor did i desert them nor did i idly weep or carry myself as though angry with the man or with the times nor yet forsooth so flattering the good fortune of another that i should have to be ashamed of what i had done myself for i had learned this lesson from the philosophy of platothat there are certain changes in public affairs they will be governed now by the leaders of the state then by the people sometimes by a single man304 this is very wise but he goes to work and altogether destroys his brothers argument he knows that he is preaching only to a fewin such a manner as to make his preaching safe his language is very pleasing always civil always courteous but not the less does he turn the arguments of his brother into ridicule and we feel that he is not so much laughing at his brother as at the gods themselvesthey are so clearly wooden godsthough he is aware how necessary it is for the good of the state that they shall be received he declares that in accordance with the theory of his brothermeaning thereby the stoicsit is necessary that they the gods should spy into every cottage along the road so that they may look after the affairs of men305 it is playful argumentative and satirical at last he proposes to leave the subject socrates would also do so never asking for the adhesion of any one but leaving the full purport of his words to sink into the minds of his audience quintus says that he quite agrees to this and so the discourse de divinatione is brought to an end  of his book on fate we have only a fragment or the middle part of it it is the desire of cicero to show that in the sequence of affairs which men call life it matters little whether there be a destiny or not things will run on and will be changed or apparently be changed by the action of men what is it to us whether this or that event has been decreed while we live and while each follows his own devices all this however is a little tedious taken at the end of so long a course of philosophy and we rise at last from the perusal with a feeling of thankfulness that all these books of chrysippus of which he tells us are not still existent to be investigated  such is the end of those works which i admit to have been philosophical and of which it seems he understood that they were the work of about eighteen months they were all written after cæsars triumphwhen it was no longer in the power of any roman to declare his opinion either in the senate or in the forum cæsar had put down all opposition and was made supreme over everythingtill his death the de fato was written indeed after he had fallen but before things had so far shaped themselves as to make it necessary that cicero should return to public life so indeed were the three last moral essays which i shall notice in the next chapter but in truth he had them always in his heart it was only necessary that he should send them forth to scribes leaving either to himself or to some faithful tiro the subsequent duty of rearrangement but what a head there was there to contain it all     chapter xiii  ciceros moral essays   we have now to deal with the moral essays of this almost inexhaustible contributor to the worlds literature and we shall then have named perhaps a quarter of all that he wrote i have seen somewhere a calculation that only a tenth of his works remain to us dug out as it were from the buried ruins of literature by the care of sedulous and eager scholars i make a more modest estimate of his powers judging from what we know to have been lost and from the absence of any effort to keep the greater portion of his letters i think that i do not exaggerate his writing who can say but that as time goes on some future petrarch or some future mai may discover writings hitherto unknown concealed in convent boxes or more mysteriously hidden beneath the labors of middleage monks it was but in 1822 that the de republica was brought to lightso much of it at least as we still possess and for more than thirty years afterward cardinal mai continued to reproduce from time to time collections of greek and latin writings hitherto unheard of by classical readers let us hope however that the zeal of the learned may stop short of that displayed by simon du bos or we may have whole treatises of cicero of which he himself was guiltless306  i can hardly content myself with classifying the de republica and the de legibus under the same name with these essays of cicero which are undoubtedly moral in their nature but it may pass perhaps without that distinct contradiction which had to be made as to the enveloping the de officiis in the garb of philosophy it has been the combining of the true and false in one set and handing them down to the world as ciceros philosophy which has done the mischief the works reviewed in the last chapter contained disputations on the greek philosophy which cicero thought might be well handled in the latin language for the benefit of his countrymen it would be well for them to know what epicurus taught or zeno and how they differed from socrates and plato and this he told them now in these moral essays he gives them his own philosophyif that may be called philosophy which is intended to teach men how to live well there are six books on government called the de republica and three on law and there are the three treatises on old age and friendship each in one book and that on the duty of man to man in three  there is a common error in the world as to the meaning of the word republic it has come to have a sweet savor in the nostrils of men or a most evil scent according to their politics but there is in truth the republic of russia as there is that of the united states and that of england cicero in using it as the name of his work simply means the government and the treatise under that head contains an account of the roman empire and is historical rather than argumentative and scientific he himself was an oligarch and had been brought up amid a condition of things in which that most deleterious form of government recommended itself to him as containing all that had been good and magnificent in the roman empire the great men of rome whom the empire had demanded for its construction had come up each for the work of a year and when succeeding had perhaps been elected for a second by the expulsion of their kings the class from whom these men had been chosen showed their personal desire for honor and the marvel is that through so many centuries those oligarchs should have flourished the reader unless he be strongly impregnated with democratic feelings when he begins to read roman history finds himself wedded to the cause of these oligarchs they have done the big deeds and the opposition comes to them from vulgar hands let me ask any man who remembers the reading of his livy whether it was not so with him but it was in truth the democratic element opposed to these leaders and the battles they won from time to time within the walls of the city which produced the safety of rome and enabled the government to go on then by degrees the people became enervated and the leaders became corrupt and by masterhood over foreign people and external subjects slaves were multiplied and the work appertaining to every man could be done by another mans hand then the evils of oligarchy began plunder rapine and luxury took the place of duty performed a verres ruled where a marcellus had conquered cicero who saw the difference plainly enough in regard to the individuals did not perceive that this evil had grown according to its nature that state of affairs was produced which mommsen has described to us as having been without remedy but cicero did not see it he had his eyes on the greatness of the pastand on himselfand would not awake to the fact that the glory was gone from rome he was in this state of mind when he wrote his de republica nine years before the time in which he commenced his philosophical discussions then he still hoped cæsar was away in gaul and pompey maintained at rome the ghost of the old republic he could still open his mouth and talk boldly of freedom he had not been as yet driven to find consolation amid that play of words which constitutes the greek philosophy  i must remind the readers again that the de republica is a fragment the first part is wanting we find him telling us the story of the elder cato in order that we may understand how good it is that we should not relax in our public work as long as our health will sustain us then he gives instances to show that the truly good citizen will not be deterred by the example of men who have suffered for their country and among the number he names himself but he soon introduces the form of dialogue which he afterward continues and brings especially the younger scipio and lælius upon the scene the lessons which are given to us are supposed to come from the virtue of the titular grandson of the greater scipio who outmanoeuvred hannibal he continues to tell story after story out of the roman chronicles and at last assures us that that form of government is the best in which the monarchical element is tempered by the authority of the leading citizens and kept alive by the voices of the people is it only because i am an englishman that he seems to me to describe that form of government which was to come in england  the second book also begins with the praises of cato scipio then commences with romulus and tells the history of romes kings tarquin is banished and the consulate established he tells us by no means with approbation how the tribunate was established and then alas there comes a break in the ms  in the third we have as a beginning a fragment handed down to us by augustine in which cicero complains of the injustice of nature in having sent man into the world as might a stepmother naked weak infirm with soul anxious timid and without force but still having within it something of divine fire not wholly destroyed then after a while through many lacunæ scipio lælius and one philus fall into a discourse as to justice there is a remarkable passage from which we learn that the romans practised protection with a rigor exceeding that of modern nations they would not even permit their transalpine allies to plant their olives and vineyards lest their produce should make their way across italywhereby they raised the prices against themselves terribly of oil and wine307 there is a kind of slavery which is unjust says one when those men have to serve others who might properly belong to themselves but when they only are made to be slaves who we may perceive that the speaker went on to say that they who were born slaves might properly be kept in that position but it is evidently intended to be understood that there exists a class who are slaves by right carneades the later master of the new academy has now joined them and teaches a doctrine which would not make him popular in this country if you should know he says that an adder lay hid just where one were about to sit down whose death would be a benefit to you you would do wrong unless you were to tell him of it but you would do it with impunity as no one could prove that you knew it from this may be seen the nature of the discourses on justice  the next two books are but broken fragments treating of morals and manners in the sixth we come to that dream of scipio which has become so famous in the world of literature that i do not know whether i can do better than translate it and add it on as an appendix to the end of my volume it is in itself so beautiful in parts that i think that all readers will thank me see appendix to this chapter at the same time it has to be admitted that it is in parts fantastic and might almost be called childish were it not that we remember when reading it at what distance of time it was written and with what difficulty cicero strove to master subjects which science has made familiar to us the music of the spheres must have been heard in his imagination before he could have told us of it as he has done in language which seems to be poetic now as it was thenand because poetic therefore not absurd the length of the years period is an extravagance you may call your space of time by what name you will it is long or short in proportion to mans life he tells us that we may not hope that our fame shall be heard of on the other side of the ganges or that our voices shall come down through many years i myself read this dream of scipio in a volume found in australia and read it two thousand years after it was written he could judge of this worlds future only by the past but when he tells us of the souls immortality and of the heaven to be won by a life of virtue of the duty upon us to remain here where god has placed us and of the insufficiency of fame to fill the cravings of the human heart then we have to own that we have come very near to that divine teaching which he was not permitted to hear  two years afterward about the time that milo was killing clodius he wrote his treatise in three books de legibus it is we are told a copy from plato as is the topica a copy from aristotle written on board ship from memory so may this be called a copy the idea was given to him and many of the thoughts which he has worked up in his own manner it is a dialogue between him and atticus and his brother quintus and treats rather of the nature and origin of law and how law should be made to prevail than of laws as they had been as yet constructed for the governance of man all that is said in the first book may be found scattered through his philosophic treatises there are some pretty morsels as when atticus tells us that he will for the nonce allow ciceros arguments to pass because the music of the birds and the waters will prevent his fellowepicureans from hearing and being led away by mistaken doctrine308 now and again he enunciates a great doctrine as when he declares that there is nothing better than that men should understand that they are born to be just and that justice is not a matter of opinion but is inherent in nature309 he constantly opposes the idea of pleasure recurring to the doctrine of his greek philosophy it was not by them however that he had learned to feel that a mans final duty here on earth is his duty to other men  in the second book he inculcates the observance of religious ceremonies in direct opposition to that which he afterward tells us in his treatise de divinatione but in this de legibus we may presume that he intends to give instructions for the guidance of the public whereas in the other he is communicating to a few chosen friends those esoteric doctrines which it would be dangerous to give to the world at large there is a charming passage in which we are told not to devote the rich things of the earth to the gods gold and silver will create impure desire ivory taken from the body of an animal is a gift not simple enough for a god metals such as iron are for war rather than for worship an image if it is to be used let it be made of one bit of wood or one block of stone if cloth is given let it not be more than a woman can make in a month let there be no bright colors white is best for the gods and so on310 here we have the wisdom of plato or of those from whom plato had borrowed it teaching us a lesson against which subsequent ages have rebelled it is not only that a god cannot want our gold and silver but that a man does want them that rule as to the womans morsel of cloth was given in some old assembly lest her husband or her brother should lose the advantage of her labor it was seen what superstition would do in collecting the wealth of the world round the shrines of the gods how many a man has since learned to regret the lost labor of his household and yet what god has been the better there may be a question of æsthetics indeed with which cicero does not meddle  in the third book he descends to practical and at the same time political questions there had been no matter contested so vehemently among romans as that of the establishment and maintenance of the tribunate cicero defends its utility giving with considerable wit the task of attacking it to his brother quintus quintus indeed is very violent in his onslaught what can be more pestiferous or more prone to sedition then cicero puts him down o quintus he says you see clearly the vices of the tribunate but can there be anything more unjust than in discussing a matter to remember all its evils and to forget all its merits you might say the same of the consuls for the very possession of power is an evil in itself but without that evil you cannot have the good which the institution contains the power of the tribunes is too great you say who denies it but the violence of the people always cruel and immodest is less so under their own leader than if no leader had been given them the leader will measure his danger but the people itself know no such measurement311 he afterward takes up the question of the ballot and is against it on principle let the people vote as they will he says but let their votes be known to their betters312 it is alas useless now to discuss the matter here in england we have been so impetuous in our wish to avoid the evil of briberywhich was quickly goingthat we have rushed into that of dissimulation which can only be made to go by revolutionary changes when men vote by tens of thousands the ballot will be safe but no man will then care for the ballot it is however strange to see how familiar men were under the roman empire with matters which are perplexing us today  we now come to the three purely moral essays the last written of his works except the philippics and certain of his letters and the topica indeed when you reach the last year or two of his life it becomes difficult to assign their exact places to each he mentions one as written and then another but at last this latter appears before the former they were all composed in the same year the year before his deaththe most active year of his life as far as his written works are concernedand i shall here treat de senectute first then de amicitia and the de officiis last believing them to have been published in that order  the de senectute is an essay written in defence of old age generally called cato major it is supposed to have been spoken by the old censor 149 bc and to have been listened to by scipio and lælius this was the same scipio who had the dreamwho in truth was not a scipio at all but a son of paulus Æmilius whom we remember in history as the younger africanus cato rushes at once into his subject and proves to us his point by insisting on all those commonplace arguments which were probably as well known before his time as they have been since all men wish for old age but none rejoice when it has come the answer is that no man really wishes for old age but simply wishes for a long life of which old age is the necessary ending it creeps on us so quickly but in truth it does not creep quicker on youth than does youth on infancy but the years seem to fly fast because not marked by distinct changes it is the part of a wise man to see that each portion of his fiveact poem shall be well performed cato goes on with his lesson and tells us perhaps all that could be said on behalf of old age at that period of the worlds history it was written by an old man to an old man for it is addressed to atticus who was now sixtyseven and of course deals much in commonplaces but it is full of noble thoughts and is pleasant and told in the easiest language and it leaves upon the reader a sweet savor of the dignity of age let the old man feel that it is not for him to attempt the pranks of youth and he will already have saved himself from much of the evil which time can do to him i am ready for you and you cannot hurt me let not the old man assume the strength of the young as a young man does not that of the bull or the elephant    but still there is something to be regretted by an orator for to talk well requires not only intellect but all the powers of the body the melodious voice however remains whichand you see my yearsi have not yet lost the voice of an old man should always be tranquil and contained313 he tells a story of massinissa who was then supposed to be ninety he was stiff in his joints and therefore when he went a journey had himself put upon a horse and never left it or started on foot and never mounted314 we must resist old age my lælius we must compensate our shortness by our diligence my scipio as we fight against disease so let us contend with old age315    why age should be avaricious i could never tell can there be anything more absurd than to demand so great a preparation for so small a journey316 he tells them that he knew their fathers and that he believes they are still alivethat though they have gone from this earth they are still leading that life which can only be considered worthy of the name317  the de amicitia is called lælius it is put into the mouth of lælius and is supposed to be a discourse on friendship held by him in the presence of his two sonsinlaw caius fannius and mucius scævola a few days after the death of scipio his friend not damon and pythias were more renowned for their friendship than scipio and lælius he discusses what is friendship and why it is contracted among whom friendship should exist what should be its laws and duties and lastly by what means it should be preserved  cicero begins by telling the story of his own youth how he had been placed under the charge of scævola the augur and how having changed his toga he never left the old mans side till he died and he recalls how once sitting with him in a circle with friends scævola fell into that mode of conversation which was usual with him and told him how once lælius had discoursed to them on friendship it is from first to last fresh and green and cooling as is the freshness of the early summer grass to men who live in cities the reader feels as he goes on with it that he who had such thoughts and aspirations could never have been altogether unhappy coming at the end of his life in the telling the stories of which we have had to depend so much on his letters to atticus it reminds me of the love that existed between them he has sometimes been querulous with his atticus he has complained of bad advice of deficient care of halting friendshipin reading which accusations we have all of us declared him to be wrong but atticus understood him he knew that the privileges and the burden must go together and told himself how much more than sufficient were the privileges to compensate the burden when we make our histories on the bases of such loving letters we should surely open them with careful hands and deal with them in sympathy with their spirit in writing this treatise de amicitia especially for the eyes of atticus how constantly the heart must have gone back to all that had passed between themhow confident he must have been of the truth of his friend he who after nearly half a century of friendship could thus write to his friend on friendship cannot have been an unhappy man  should a new friendship spring up he tells us let it not be repressed you shall still gather fruit from young trees but do not let it take the place of the old age and custom will have given the old fruit a flavor of its own who is there that would ride a new horse in preference to one triedone who knows your hand318  i regard the de officiis as one of the most perfect treatises on morals which the world possesses whether for the truth of the lessons given for their universality or for the beauty and lightness of the language it is on a subject generally heavy but is treated with so much art and grace as to make it a delight to have read it and an important part of education to know it it is addressed to his son and is as good now as when it was written there is not a precept taught in it which is not modern as well as ancient and which is not fit alike for christians and pagans a system of morality we might have said should be one which would suit all men alike we are bound to acknowledge that this will suit only gentlemen because he who shall live in accordance with it must be worthy of that name the honestum means much more in latin than it does in english neither honor nor honesty will give the renderingnot that honor or that honesty which we know modern honor flies so high that it leaves honesty sometimes too nearly out of sight while honesty though a sterling virtue ignores those sentiments on which honor is based honestum includes it all and cicero has raised his lessons to such a standard as to comprise it all but he so teaches that listeners delight to hear he never preaches he does not fulminate his doctrine at you bidding you beware of backslidings and of punishments but he leads you with him along the grassy path till you seem to have found out for yourself what is goodyou and he together and together to have learned that which is manly graceful honest and decorous  in ciceros essays is to be found always a perfect withdrawal of himself from the circumstances of the world around him so that the reader shall be made to suppose that in the evening of his life having reached at last by means of work done for the state a time of blessed rest he gives forth the wisdom of his age surrounded by all that a tranquil world can bestow upon him look back through the treatises written during the last two years and each shall appear to have been prepared in some quiet and undisturbed period of his life but we know that the last polish given by his own hands to these three books de officiis was added amid the heat and turmoils of the philippics it is so singular this power of adapting his mind to whatever pursuit he will that we are taught almost to think that there must have been two ciceros and that the one was eager in personal conflict with antony while the other was seated in the garden of some italian villa meditating words by obeying which all men might be ennobled  in the dialectical disputations of the greek philosophers he had picked up a mode of dividing his subject into numbers which is hardly fitted for a discourse so free and open as is this we are therefore somewhat offended when we are told that virtue is generally divided into three headings319 if it be so and if it be necessary that we should know it it should i think be conveyed to us without this attempt at logical completeness it is impossible to call this a fault accuracy must indeed be in all writers a virtue but feeling myself to be occasionally wounded by this numbering i mention it in the de officiis he divides the entire matter into three parts and to each part he devotes a book in the first he considers whether a thing is fit to be done or left undonethat is whether it be honestum or turpe in the second whether it be expedient that is utile or the reverse and in the third he compares the honestum and the utile and tells us what to choose and what to avoid  the duty due by a citizen to his country takes with him a place somewhat higher than we accord to it parents are dear children are dear to us so are relations and friends but our country embraces it all for what good man would not die so that he might serve it how detestable then is the barbarity of those who wound their country at every turn and have been and are occupied in its destruction320 he gives us some excellent advice as to our games which might be read with advantage perhaps by those who row in our university races but at the end of it he tells us that the huntingfield affords an honest and fitting recreation321 i have said that he was modern in his viewsbut not altogether modern he defends the suicide of cato to them he says speaking of catos companions in africa it might not have been forgiven their life was softer and their manners easier but to cato nature had given an invincible gravity of manners which he had strengthened with all the severity of his will he had always remained steadfast in the purpose that he would never stand face to face with the tyrant of his country322 there was something terribly grand in catos character which loses nothing in coming to us from the lips of cicero so much cicero allows to the stern nature of the mans character let us look back and we shall find that we make the same allowance this is not in truth a lesson which he gives us but an apology which he makes  read his advice given in the following line for the outward demeanor of a gentleman there are two kinds of beauty the one is loveliness which is a womans gift but dignity belongs to the man let all ornament be removed from the person not worthy of a man to wearand all fault in gesture and in motion which is like to it the manners of the wrestlingground and of the stage are sometimes odious but let us see the actor or the wrestler walking simple and upright and we praise him let him use a befitting neatness not verging toward the effeminate but just avoiding a rustic harshness the same measure is to be taken with your clothes as with other matters in which a middle course is best323  then he tells his son what pursuits are to be regarded as sordid those sources of gain are to be regarded as mean in the pursuit of which men are apt to be offended as are the business of taxgathers and usurers all those are to be regarded as illiberal to which men bring their work but not their art as for instance the painter of a picture shall be held to follow a liberal occupationbut not so the picture dealer they are sordid who buy from merchants that they may sell again they have to lie like the mischief or they cannot make their living all mere workmen are engaged in ignoble employment what of grandeur can the mere workshop produce least of all can those trades be said to be good which administer only to our pleasuressuch as fishmongers butchers cooks and poulterers324 he adds at the end of his list that of all employment none is better than agriculture or more worthy of the care of a freeman in all of this it is necessary that we should receive what he says with some little allowance for the difference in time but there is nothing if we look closely into it in which we cannot see the source of noble ideas and the reason for many notions which are now departing from uswhether for good or evil who shall say  in the beginning of the second book he apologizes for his love of philosophy as he calls it saying that he knew how it had been misliked among those round him but when the republic he says had ceased to bethat republic which had been all my caremy employment ceased both in the forum and the senate but when my mind absolutely refused to be inactive i thought that i might best live down the misery of the time if i devoted myself to philosophy325 from this we may see how his mind had worked when the old occupation of his life was gone nihil agere autem quum animus non posset how piteous was his position and yet how proud there was nothing for him to dobut there was nothing because hitherto there had been so much that he had always done  he tells his son plainly how an honest man must live to be ashamed of nothing he must do nothing of which he will be ashamed but for him there is this difficulty if any one on his entrance into the world has had laid upon him the greatness of a name won by his father let us sayas my cicero has perhaps happened to youthe eyes of all men will be cast upon him and inquiry will be made as to his mode of life he will be so placed under the meridian sun that no word spoken or deed done by him shall be hidden326    he must live up to the glory to which he has been born he gives to his son much advice about the bar but the greatest praise he says comes from defending a man accused and especially so when you shall assist one who is surrounded and illtreated by the power of some great man this happened to me more than once in my youth when for instance i defended roscius amerinus against sullas power the speech is with us extant still327 he tells us much as to the possession of money and the means of insuring it in a wellgoverned state take care that you allow no debts to the injury of the republic you must guard against this at all hazardsbut never by taking from the rich and giving it to the poor nothing is so requisite to the state as public creditwhich cannot exist unless debtors be made to pay what they owe there was nothing to which i looked more carefully than this when i was consul horse and foot they tried their best but i opposed them and freed the republic from the threatened evil never were debts more easily or more quickly collected when men knew that they could not ignore their creditors then they paid but he who was then the conquered is the conqueror now he has effected what he contemplatedeven though it be not now necessary for him328 from this passage it seems that these books must have been first written before cæsars death cæsar at the time of catilines conspiracy had endeavored to annul all debtsthat is to establish new tables according to the roman idiombut had failed by ciceros efforts he had since affected it although he might have held his power without seeking for the assistance of such debtors who could that be but cæsar in the beginning of the third book there is another passage declaring the same thing i have not strength enough for silent solitude and therefore give myself up to my pen in the short time since the republic has been overturned i have written more than in all my former years329 that again he could not have written after cæsar had fallen we are left indeed to judge from the whole nature of the discourse that it was written at the period in which the wrongs done by cæsar to romewrongs at any rate as they appeared to cicerowere just culminating in that regal pride of action which led to his slaughter it was written then but was published a few months afterward     chapter xiv  ciceros religion   i should hardly have thought it necessary to devote a chapter of my book to the religion of a pagan had i not while studying ciceros life found that i was not dealing with a pagans mind the mind of the roman who so lived as to cause his life to be written in aftertimes was at this period in most instances nearly a blank as to any ideas of a god horace is one who in his writing speaks much of himself ovid does so still more constantly they are both full of allusions to the gods they are both aware that it is a good thing to speak with respect of the national worship and that the orders of the emperor will be best obeyed by believers dis te minorem quod geris imperas says horace when in obedience probably to augustus he tells his fellowcitizens that they are forgetting their duties in their unwillingness to pay for the repairs of the temples superi quorum sumus omnia says ovid thinking it well to show in one of his writings which he sent home from his banishment that he still entertained the fashionable creed but they did not believe it was at that time the fashion to pretend a light belief in order that those below might live as though they believed and might induce an absolute belief in the women and the children it was not well that the temple of the gods should fall into ruins it was not well that the augurs who were gentlemen of high family should go for nothing cæsar himself was the highpriest and thought much of the position but he certainly was bound by no priestcraft a religious belief was not expected from a gentleman religious ceremonies had gradually sunk so low in the worlds esteem that the roman nobility had come to think of their gods as things to swear by or things to amuse them or things from which if times were bad with them some doubtful assistance might perchance come in dealing with ordinary pagans of those days religion may be laid altogether on one side i remember no passage in livy or tacitus indicating a religious belief  but with cicero my mind is full of such and they are of a nature to make me feel that had he lived a hundred years later i should have suspected him of some hidden knowledge of christs teachings m renan has reminded us of ciceros dislike to the jews he could not learn from the jewsthough the jew indeed had much that he could teach him the religion which he required was far from the selfishness of either jew or roman he believed in eternity in the immortality of the soul in virtue for the sake of its reward hereafter in the omnipotence of god the performance of his duty to his neighbors in conscience and in honesty certum esse in cælo definitum locum ubi beati ævo sempiterno fruantur330 there is certainly a place in heaven where the blessed shall enjoy eternal life can st paul have expressed with more clearness his belief as to a heaven earlier in his career he expresses in language less definite but still sufficiently clear his ideas as to another world an vero tam parvi animi videamur esse omnes qui in republica atque in his vitæ periculis laboribusque versamur ut quum usque ad extremum spatium nullum tranquillum atque otiosum spiritum duxerimus vobiscum simul moritura omnia arbitremur331 are we all of us so poor in spirit as to think that after toiling for our country and ourselvesthough we have not had one moment of ease here upon earthwhen we die all things shall die with us and when he did go it should be to that glory for which virtue shall have trained him neque te sermonibus vulgi dederis nec in præmis humanis spem posueris rerum tuarum suis te oportet illecebris ipsa virtus trahat ad verum decus332 you shall put your hope neither in mans opinion nor in human rewards but virtue itself by her own charms shall lead you the way to true glory he thus tells us his idea of gods omnipotence quam vim animum esse dicunt mundi eamdemque esse mentem sapientiamque perfectam quem deum appellant333 this force they call the soul of the world and looking on it as perfect in intelligence and wisdom they name it their god and again he says speaking of gods care quis enim potestquam existimet a deo se curarinon et dies et noctes divinum numen horrere334 who is there when he thinks that a god is taking care of him shall not live day and night in awe of his divine majesty as to mans duty to his neighbor a subject as to which pagans before and even after the time of cicero seem to have had but vague ideas the treatise de officiis is full of it as indeed is the whole course of his life omne officium quod ad conjunctionem hominum et ad societatem tuendam valet anteponendum est illi officio quod cognitione et scientia continetur335 all duty which tends to protect the society of man with men is to be preferred to that of which science is the simple object his belief in a conscience is shown in the law he lays down against suicide vetat enim dominans ille in nobis deus injussu hinc nos suo demigrare336 that god within us forbids us to depart hence without his permission as to justice i need give no quotation from his works as proof of that virtue which all his works have been written to uphold  this pagan had his ideas of gods governance of men and of mans required obedience to his god so specially implanted in his heart that he who undertakes to write his life should not pass it by unnoticed to us our religion has come as a thing to believe though taking too often the form of a stern duty we have had it from our fathers and our mothers and though it has been given to us by perhaps indifferent hands still it has been given it has been there with all its written laws a thing to live byif we choose rich and poor the majority of us know at any rate the lords prayer and most of us have repeated it regularly during our lives there are not many of us who have not learned that they are deterred by something beyond the law from stealing from murder from committing adultery all rome and all romans knew nothing of any such obligation unless it might be that some few like cicero found it out from the recesses of their own souls he found it out certainly suis te oportet illecebris ipsa virtus trahat ad verum decus virtue itself by its own charms shall lead you the way to true glory the words to us seem to be quite commonplace there is not a curate who might not put them into a sermon but in ciceros time they were new and hitherto untaught there was the old greek philosophers idea that the greek to kalonthe thing of beautywas to be found in virtue and that it would make a man altogether happy if he got a hold of it but there was no god connected with it no future life no prospect sufficient to redeem a man from the fear of death it was leather and prunella that from first to last the man had to die and go melancholy across the styx but cicero was the first to tell his brother romans of an intelligible heaven certum esse in cælo definitum locum ubi beati ævo sempiterno fruantur there is certainly a place in heaven where the blessed shall enjoy eternal life and then how nearly he had realized that doctrine which tells us that we should do unto others as we would they should do unto usthe very pith and marrow and inside meaning of christs teaching by adapting which we have become human by neglecting which we revert to paganism when we look back upon the world without this law we see nothing good in it in spite of individual greatness and national honor but cicero had found itthat brotherhood between men that agreement as to what may be useful to all and that general love for the human race337 it is all contained in these few words but if anything be wanted to explain at length our duty to our neighbors it will be found there on reference to this passage how different has been the world before that law was given to us and since even the existence of that law though it be not obeyed has softened the hearts of men  if as some think it be the purport of christs religion to teach men to live after a godlike fashion rather than to worship god after a peculiar form then may we be allowed to say that cicero was almost a christian even before the coming of christ if as some think an eternity of improved existence for all is to be looked for by the disciples of christ rather than a heaven of glory for the few and for the many a hell that never shall be mitigated then had cicero anticipated much of christs doctrine that he should have approached the mystical portion of our religion it would of course be absurd to suppose but a belief in that mystical part is not essential for forming the conduct of men the divine birth and the doctrine of the trinity and the lords supper are not necessary to teach a man to live with his brother men on terms of forbearance and brotherly love you shall live with a man from years end to years end and shall not know his creed unless he tell you or that you see him performing the acts of his worship but you cannot live with him and not know whether he live in accordance with christs teaching and so it was with cicero read his works through from the beginning to the end and you shall feel that you are living with a man whom you might accompany across the village green to church should he be kind enough to stay with you over the sunday the urbanity the softness the humanity the sweetness are all there but you shall not find it to be so with cæsar or lucretius or with virgil when you read his philosophical treatises it is as though you were discussing with some latterday scholar the theories of plato or of epicurus he does not talk of them as though he believed in them for his souls guidance nor do you expect it all the interest that you have in the conversation would be lost were you to find such faith as that you would avoid the man as a pagan the stoic doctrine would so shock you when brought out for real wear as to make you feel yourself in the company of some mad atheistwith a man for whose welfare early or late in life church bells had never been rung but with a man who has his plato simply by heart you can spend the long summer day in sweet conversation so it is with cicero you lie down with him looking out upon the sea at comæ or sit with him beneath the planetree of crassus and listen while he tells you of this doctrine and the other so arcesilas may be supposed to have said and so carneades laid down the law it was that and no more but when he tells you of the place assigned to you in heaven and how you are to win it then he is in earnest  we care in general but little for any teacher of religion who has not struggled to live up to his own teaching cicero has told us of his ideas of the godhead and has given us his theory as to those deeds by which a man may hope to achieve the heaven in which that god will reward with everlasting life those who have deserved such bliss love of country comes first with him it behooves at any rate a man to be true to his country from first to last and honesty and honor come nextthat honestum which carries him to something beyond the mere integrity of the wellconducted tradesmen then family affection then friendship and then that constant love for our fellowcreatures which teaches us to do unto others as we would they should do unto us running through these there are a dozen smaller virtues but each so mingled with the other as to have failed in obtaining a separate placedignity manliness truth mercy longsuffering forgiveness and humanity  try him by these all round and see how he will come out of the fire he so loved his country that we may say that he lived for it entirely that from the first moment in which he began to study as a boy in rome the great profession of an advocate to the last in which he gave his throat to his murderers there was not a moment in which his heart did not throb for it  in the defence of amerinus and in the prosecution of verres his object was to stop the proscriptions to shame the bench and to punish the plunderers of the provinces in driving out catiline the same strong feeling governed him it was the same in cilicia the same patriotism drove him to follow pompey to the seat of war the same filled him with almost youthful energy when the final battle for the republic came it has been said of him that he began life as a liberal in attacking sulla and that afterward he became a conservative when he gained the consulship that he opposed cæsar and then flattered him and then rejoiced at his death i think that they who have so accused him have hardly striven to read his character amidst the changes of the time a conservative he was always but he wished to see that the things around him were worth conserving he was always opposed to cæsar whose genius and whose spirit were opposed to his own but in order that something of the republic might be preserved it became necessary to bear with cæsar for himself he would take nothing from cæsar except permission to breathe italian air he flattered him as was the roman custom he had to do that or his presence would have been impossibleand he could always do something by his presence as far as love of country went which among virtues stood the first with him he was pure and great there was not a moment in his career in which the feeling was not in his heartmixed indeed with personal ambition as must be necessary for how shall a man show his love for his country except by his desire to stand high in its counsels to be called pater patriæ by cato was to his ears the sweetest music he had ever heard  let us compare his honesty with that of the times in which he lived all the high rewards of the state were at his command and he might so have taken them as to have been safer firmer more powerful by taking them but he took nothing no gorgeous wealth from a roman province stuck to his hands we think of our cavendishes our howards and our stanleys and feel that there is nothing in such honesty as this but the cavendishes the howards and the stanleys of those days robbed with unblushing pertinacity cæsar robbed so much that he put himself above all question of honesty where did he who had been so greatly in debt before he went to spain get the million with which he bribed his adherents cicero neither bought nor sold twenty little stories have been told of him not one with a grain of enduring truth to justify one of them he borrowed and he always paid he lent but was not always repaid with such a voice to sell as his a voice which carried with it the verdict of either guilt or innocence what payments would it not have been worth the while of a roman nobleman to make to him no such payments as far as we can tell were ever made he took a present of books from his friend poetus and asked another friend what cincius would say to it men struggling to find him out and not understanding his little joke have said lo he has been paid for his work he defended poetus and poetus gave him books did he defend poetus you ask we surmise so because he gave him books they reply i say that at any rate the fault should be brought home against him before it is implied from chance passages in his own letters  ciceros affection for his family gives us an entirely unfamiliar insight into roman manners there is a softness a tenderness an eagerness about it such as would give a grace to the life of some english nobleman who had his heart garnered up for him at home though his spirit was at work for his country but we do not expect this from the pompeys and cæsars and catos of rome perhaps because we do not know them as we know cicero it is odd however that we should have no word of love for his boys as to pompey no word of love for his daughter as to cæsar but ciceros love for his wife his brother his son his nephew especially for his daughter was unbounded all offences on their part he could forgive till there came his wifes supposed dishonesty which was not to be forgiven the ribaldry of dio cassius has polluted the story of his regard for tullia but in truth we know nothing sweeter in the records of great men nothing which touches us more than the profundity of his grief his readiness to forgive his brother and to forgive his nephew his anxiety to take them back to his affections his inability to live without them tell of his tenderness  his friendship for atticus was of the same calibre it was of that nature that it could not only bear hard words but could occasionally give them without fear of a breach can any man read the records of this long affection without wishing that he might be blessed with such a friendship as to that love of our fellowcreatures which comes not from personal liking for them but from that kindness of heart toward all mankind which has been the fruit to us of christs teaching that desire to do unto others as they should do unto us his whole life is an example when quæstor in sicily his chief duty was to send home corn he did send it home but so that he hurt none of those in sicily by whom it was supplied in his letter to his brother as to his government of asia minor the lessons which he teaches are to the same effect when he was in cilicia it was the same from first to last he would not take a penny from the poor provincialsnot even what he might have taken by law non modo non fænum sed ne ligna quidem where did he get the idea that it was a good thing not to torment the poor wretches that were subjected to his power why was it that he took such an unroman pleasure in making the people happy  cicero no doubt was a pagan and in accordance with the rules prevailing in such matters it would be necessary to describe him of that religion if his religion be brought under discussion but he has not written as pagans wrote nor did he act as they acted the educated intelligence of the roman world had come to repudiate their gods and to create for itself a beliefin nothing it was easier for a thoughtful man and pleasanter for a thoughtless to believe in nothing than in jupiter and juno in venus and in mars but when there came a man of intellect so excellent as to find when rejecting the gods of his country that there existed for him the necessity of a real god and to recognize it as a fact that the intercourse of man with man demanded it we must not in recording the facts of his life pass over his religion as though it were simple chance christ came to us and we do not need another teacher christ came to us so perfected in manhood as to be free from blemish cicero did not come at all as a teacher he never recognized the possibility of teaching men a religion or probably the necessity but he did see the way to so much of the truth as to perceive that there was a heaven that the way to it must be found in good deeds here on earth and that the good deeds required of him would be kindness to others therefore i have written this final chapter on his religion     appendix to volume ii  appendix  see page 308 vol ii  scipios dream   scipio the younger had gone when in africa to meet massinissa and had there discussed with the african king the character of his nominal grandfather for he was in fact the son of paulus Æmilius and had been adopted by the son of the great conqueror at zama he had then retired to rest and had dreamed a dream and is thus made to tell it africanus the elder had shown himself to him greater than life and had spoken to him in the following words approach said the ghost approach in spirit and cease to fear and write down on the tablets of your memory this that i shall tell you  look down upon that city i compelled it to obey rome it now seeks to renew its former strife and you but yet new to arms have come to conquer it then from his starry heights he points to the once illustrious carthage in twice twelve months that city you shall conquer and shall have earned for yourself that name which by descent has become yours destroyer of carthage triumphant censor ambassador from rome to egypt syria asia and greece you shall be chosen consul a second time though absent and having besieged numantia shall bring a great war to an end then will the whole state turn to you and to your name the senate the citizens the allies will expect you in one word it will be to you as dictator that the republic will look to be saved from the crimes of your relatives  but that you may be always alive to protect the republic know this there is in heaven a special place of bliss for those who have served their country to that god who looks down upon the earth there is nothing dearer than men bound to each other by reverence for the laws  then frightened i asked him whether he were still living and my father paulus and others whom we believed to have departed in truth he said they live who have escaped from the bondage of the flesh this which you call life is death but behold paulus your father beholding him i poured forth a world of tears but he embracing me forbade me to weep  since this of yours is life as my grandsire tells me i said as soon as my tears allowed me to speak why o father most revered do i delay here on earth rather than haste to meet you it cannot be so he answered unless that god whose temple is around you everywhere shall have liberated you from the chains of the body you cannot come to us men are begotten subject to his law and inhabit the globe which is called the earth and to them is given a soul from among the stars perfect in their form and alive with heavenly instincts which complete with wondrous speed their rapid courses wherefore my son by you and by all just men that soul must be retained within its bodys confines nor can it be allowed to flit without command of him by whom it has been given to you you may not escape the duty which god has trusted to you live my scipio and shine with piety and justice as your grandfather did and i have done it is your duty to your parents and to your relatives but especially your duty to your country there lies the road to heaven by following that course shall you find your way to those who crowd with disembodied spirits the realm beneath your eyes  then did i behold that splendid circle of fire which you after the greeks call the milkyway and looking out from thence could see that all things were beautiful and all wonderful there were stars which we cannot see from hence and others of tremendous unsuspected size and then those smaller ones nearest to us which shine with a reflected light but every star among them all loomed larger than our earth that seemed so mean that i was sorry to belong to so small an empire                                        as i gazed a sound struck my ears what music is that said i swelling so loudly and yet so sweet  it is that harmony of the stars he said which the world creates by its own movement low and loud base and treble they clang together with unequal intervals but each in time and tune they could not work in silence and nature demands that from one end of heaven to the other they shall be sonorous with a deep diapason the far off give a loud treble twang those nearest to the moon sound low and base the earth the ninth in order immovable upon its lowest seat occupies the centre of the system from the eight there come seven sounds distinct among themselves venus and mercury joining in one effort in that number is the secret of all human affairs learned men have made their way to heaven by imitating this music as have others also by the excellence of their studies filled with this sound the sense of hearing has failed among men what sense is duller it is as when the nile falls down to her cataracts and the nations around astonished by the tumult become deaf                                       then said africanus look and see how small are the habitations of men how grand are those of the angels of light what fame can you expect from men or what glory you see how they live in mean placesin small spots lonely amid vast solitudes and that they who inhabit them dwell so isolated that nothing can pass between them can you expect glory from them  you behold this earth surrounded by zones you see two of them frozen from their poles have been made solid with everlasting ice and how the centre realm between them has been scorched by the suns rays two however are fit for life they who inhabit the southern whose footsteps are opposed to ours are a race of whom we know nothing but see how small a part of this little earth is inhabited by us who are turned toward the north for all the earth which you inhabit wide and narrow is but a small island surrounded by that sea which you call the great atlantic oceanwhich however large as you deem it how small it is has your name or has mine been able over this small morsel of the earths surface to ascend mount caucasus or to cross the ganges who in the regions of the rising or setting sun has heard of our fame cut off these regions distant but a hands breadth and see within what narrow borders will your reputation be spread they who speak of youfor how short a time will their voices be heard  grant that man unenvious shall wish to hand down your fame to future ages still there will come those storms of nature the earth will be immersed in water and scorched with fire a doom which in the course of ages must happen and will deny to you any lasting glory will you be content that they who are to come only shall hear of you when to those crowds of better men who have passed away your name shall be as nothing  and remember too that no mans renown shall reach the duration of a year men call that space a year which they measure by the return of a single star to its old place but when all the stars shall have come back and shall have made their course across the heavens then then shall that truly be called a year in this year how many are there of our ages contained for as when romulus died and made his way here to these temples of the gods the sun was seen by man to fade away so will the sun again depart from the heavens when the stars having accomplished their spaces shall have returned to their old abodes of this the true year not a twentieth part has been as yet consumed if then you despair of reaching this abode which all of true excellence strive to approach what glory is there to be gained when gained it will not last the space of one year look then aloft my son and fix your eyes upon this eternal home despise all vulgar fame nor place your hopes on human rewards let virtue by her own charms lead you on to true glory let men talk of youfor talk they will mans talk of man is small in its space and shortlived in its time it dies with a generation and is forgotten by posterity  when he had spoken i thus answered him africanus i said i indeed have hitherto endeavored to find a road to heaven following your example and my fathers but now for so great a reward will i struggle on more bravely struggle on he replied and know thisnot that thou art mortal but only this thy body this frail form is not thyself it is the mind invisible and not a shape at which a man may point with his fingers know thyself to be a god to be strong in purpose and in mind to remember to provide and to rule to restrain and to move the body it is placed over as the great god does the worldthat is to be a god and as the god who moves this mortal world is eternal so does an eternal soul govern this frail body    footnotes    1 as i shall explain a few pages farther on four of these   speeches are supposed by late critics to be spurious    2 see mr longs introduction to these orations all this

optimates cicero in his definition no doubt begs the   question but to do so was his object    19 mommsen lib v chap viii in one of his notes   says that this oration as to the provinces was the very   palinodia respecting which cicero wrote to atticus the   subject discussed was no doubt the same what authority the   historian has found for his statement i do not know but no   writer is generally

refer to mommsens account of this   transaction book v chap viii golden fetters were also   laid upon him cicero amid the serious embarrassments of   his finances the loans of cæsar free of interest    were in   a high degree welcome to him and many an immortal oration   for the senate was nipped in the bud by the thought that the   agent of cæsar might present a bill to him after the close   of the sitting there are many assertions here for which i   have looked in vain for the authority i do not know that   ciceros finances were seriously embarrassed at the time   the evidence goes rather to show that they were not so had   he ever taken more than one loan from cæsar i find nothing   as to any question of interest but i imagine that cæsar   treated cicero as cicero afterward treated pompey when he   lent him money we do not know whether even crassus charged   cæsar interest we may presume that a loan is always made   welcome or the money would not be borrowed but the high   degree of welcome as applied to this especial loan ought   to have some special justification as to ciceros anxiety   in borrowing the money i know nothing but he was very   anxious to pay it the borrowing and the lending of money   between roman noblemen was very common no one had ever   borrowed so freely as cæsar had done cicero was a lender   and a borrower but i think that he was never seriously   embarrassed what oration was nipped in the bud by fear of   his creditor he had lately spoken twice for saufeius once   against s clodius and against plancusin each case   opposing the view of cæsar as far as cæsar had views on the   matter the sum borrowed on this occasion was 800000   sestercesbetween £6000 and £7000 a small additional sum   of £100 is mentioned in one of the letters to atticus lib   v 5 which is however spoken of by cicero as forming   one whole with the other i can hardly think that mommsen   had this in view when he spoke of loans in the plural   number

not   to be reminded by this passage of lord chesterfields   letters to his son written with the same object but we can   see at once that the roman desired in his son a much higher   type of bearing than the englishman the following is the   advice given by the englishman a thousand little things   not separately to be defined conspire to form these   gracesthis je ne sais quoi that always pleases a pretty   person genteel motions a proper degree of dress an   harmonious voice something open and cheerful in the   countenance but without laughing a distinct and properly   raised manner of speakingall these things and many others   are necessary ingredients in the composition of the pleasing   je ne sais quoi which everybody feels though nobody can   describe observe carefully then what displeases or   pleases you in others and be persuaded that in general   the same thing will please or displease them in you having   mentioned laughing i must particularly warn you against it   and i could wish that you may often be seen to smile but   never heard to laugh while you live i feel sure that   cicero would laugh and was heard to laugh and yet that he   was always true to the
