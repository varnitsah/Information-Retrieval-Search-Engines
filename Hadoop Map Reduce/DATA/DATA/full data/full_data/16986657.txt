long     illustration the changeling     the changeling   mr george henshaw let himself in at the front door and stood for some time wiping his boots on the mat the little house was ominously still and a faint feeling only partially due to the lapse of time since breakfast manifested itself behind his waistcoat he cougheda matter offact coughand with an attempt to hum a tune hung his hat on the peg and entered the kitchen  mrs henshaw had just finished dinner the neatly cleaned bone of a chop was on a plate by her side a small dish which had contained a rice pudding was empty and the only food left on the table was a small rind of cheese and a piece of stale bread mr henshaws face fell but he drew his chair up to the table and waited  his wife regarded him with a fixed and offensive stare her face was red and her eyes were blazing it was hard to ignore her gaze harder still to meet it mr henshaw steering a middle course allowed his eyes to wander round the room and to dwell for the fraction of a second on her angry face  youve had dinner early he said at last in a trembling voice  have i was the reply  mr henshaw sought for a comforting explanation clocks fast he said rising and adjusting it  his wife rose almost at the same moment and with slow deliberate movements began to clear the table  whatwhat about dinner said mr henshaw still trying to control his fears  dinner repeated mrs henshaw in a terrible voice you go and tell that creature you were on the bus with to get your dinner  mr henshaw made a gesture of despair i tell you he said emphatically it wasnt me i told you so last night you get an idea in your head and  thatll do said his wife sharply i saw you george henshaw as plain as i see you now you were tickling her ear with a bit o straw and that goodfornothing friend of yours ted stokes was sitting behind with another beauty nice way o going on and me at ome all alone by myself slaving and slaving to keep things respectable  it wasnt me reiterated the unfortunate  when i called out to you pursued the unheeding mrs henshaw you started and pulled your hat over your eyes and turned away i should have caught you if it hadnt been for all them carts in the way and falling down i cant understand now how it was i wasnt killed i was a mask of mud from head to foot  despite his utmost efforts to prevent it a faint smile flitted across the pallid features of mr henshaw  yes you may laugh stormed his wife and ive no doubt them two beauties laughed too ill take care you dont have much more to laugh at my man  she flung out of the room and began to wash up the crockery mr henshaw after standing irresolute for some time with his hands in his pockets put on his hat again and left the house  he dined badly at a small eatinghouse and returned home at six oclock that evening to find his wife out and the cupboard empty he went back to the same restaurant for tea and after a gloomy meal went round to discuss the situation with ted stokes that gentlemans suggestion of a double alibi he thrust aside with disdain and a stern appeal to talk sense  mind if my wife speaks to you about it he said warningly it wasnt me but somebody like me you might say he ad been mistook for me before  mr stokes grinned and meeting a freezing glance from his friend at once became serious again  why not say it was you he said stoutly theres no harm in going for a busride with a friend and a couple o ladies  o course there aint said the other hotly else i shouldnt ha done it but you know what my wife is  mr stokes who was by no means a favorite of the lady in question nodded you were a bit larky too he said thoughtfully you ad quite a little slapping game after you pretended to steal her brooch  i spose when a gentlemans with a lady he as got to make imself pleasant said mr henshaw with dignity now if my missis speaks to you about it you say that it wasnt me but a friend of yours up from the country who is as like me as two peas see  name o dodd said mr stokes with a knowing nod tommy dodd  im not playing the giddy goat said the other bitterly and id thank you not to  all right said mr stokes somewhat taken aback any name you like i dont mind  mr henshaw pondered any sensible namell do he said stiffly  bell suggested mr stokes alfred bell i did know a man o that name once he tried to borrow a bob off of me  thatll do said his friend after some consideration but mind you stick to the same name and youd better make up something about him where he lives and all that sort of thingso that you can stand being questioned without looking more like a silly fool than you can help  ill do what i can for you said mr stokes but i dont spose your missisll come to me at all she saw you plain enough  they walked on in silence and still deep in thought over the matter turned into a neighboring tavern for refreshment mr henshaw drank his with the air of a man performing a duty to his constitution but mr stokes smacking his lips waxed eloquent over the brew  i hardly know what im drinking said his friend forlornly i suppose its fourhalf because thats what i asked for  mr stokes gazed at him in deep sympathy it cant be so bad as that he said with concern  you wait till youre married said mr henshaw brusquely youd no business to ask me to go with you and i was a goodnatured fool to do it  you stick to your tale and itll be all right said the other tell her that you spoke to me about it and that his name is alfred bellb e double land that he lives inin ireland here i say  well said mr henshaw shaking off the hand which the other had laid on his arm  youyou be alfred bell said mr stokes breathlessly  mr henshaw started and eyed him nervously his friends eyes were bright and he fancied a bit wild  be alfred bell repeated mr stokes dont you see pretend to be alfred bell and go with me to your missis ill lend you a suit o clothes and a fresh necktie and there you are  what roared the astounded mr henshaw  its as easy as easy declared the other tomorrow evening in a new rigout i walks you up to your house and asks for you to show you to yourself of course im sorry you aint in and perhaps we walks in to wait for you  show me to myself gasped mr henshaw  mr stokes winked on account o the surprising likeness he said smiling it is surprising aint it fancy the two of us sitting there and talking to her and waiting for you to come in and wondering whats making you so late  mr henshaw regarded him steadfastly for some seconds and then taking a firm hold of his mug slowly drained the contents  and what about my voice he demanded with something approaching a sneer  thats right said mr stokes hotly it wouldnt be you if you didnt try to make difficulties  but what about it said mr henshaw obstinately  you can alter it cant you said the other  they were alone in the bar and mr henshaw after some persuasion was induced to try a few experiments he ranged from bass which hurt his throat to a falsetto which put mr stokess teeth on edge but in vain the rehearsal was stopped at last by the landlord who having twice come into the bar under the impression that fresh customers had entered spoke his mind at some length seem to think youre in a blessed monkeyhouse he concluded severely  we thought we was said mr stokes with a long appraising sniff as he opened the door its a mistake anybody might make  he pushed mr henshaw into the street as the landlord placed a hand on the flap of the bar and followed him out  youll have to ave a bad cold and talk in usky whispers he said slowly as they walked along you caught a cold travelling in the train from ireland day before yesterday and you made it worse going for a ride on the outside of a bus with me and a couple o ladies see try usky whispers now  mr henshaw tried and his friend observing that he was taking but a languid interest in the scheme was loud in his praises i should never ave known you he declared why its wonderful why didnt you tell me you could act like that  mr henshaw remarked modestly that he had not been aware of it himself and taking a more hopeful view of the situation whispered himself into such a state of hoarseness that another visit for refreshment became absolutely necessary  keep your art up and practise said mr stokes as he shook hands with him some time later and if you can manage it get off at four oclock tomorrow and well go round to see her while she thinks youre still at work  illustration and what about my voice he demanded  mr henshaw complimented him upon his artfulness and with some confidence in a man of such resource walked home in a more cheerful frame of mind his heart sank as he reached the house but to his relief the lights were out and his wife was in bed  he was up early next morning but his wife showed no signs of rising the cupboard was still empty and for some time he moved about hungry and undecided finally he mounted the stairs again and with a view to arranging matters for the evening remonstrated with her upon her behavior and loudly announced his intention of not coming home until she was in a better frame of mind from a disciplinary point of view the effect of the remonstrance was somewhat lost by being shouted through the closed door and he also broke off too abruptly when mrs henshaw opened it suddenly and confronted him fragments of the peroration reached her through the front door  despite the fact that he left two hours earlier the day passed but slowly and he was in a very despondent state of mind by the time he reached mr stokess lodging the latter however had cheerfulness enough for both and after helping his visitor to change into fresh clothes and part his hair in the middle instead of at the side surveyed him with grinning satisfaction under his directions mr henshaw also darkened his eyebrows and beard with a little burnt cork until mr stokes declared that his own mother wouldnt know him  now be careful said mr stokes as they set off be bright and cheerful be a sort o ladies man to her same as she saw you with the one on the bus be as unlike yourself as you can and dont forget yourself and call her by er pet name  pet name said mr henshaw indignantly pet name youll alter your ideas of married life when youre caught my lad i can tell you  he walked on in scornful silence lagging farther and farther behind as they neared his house when mr stokes knocked at the door he stood modestly aside with his back against the wall of the next house  is george in inquired mr stokes carelessly as mrs henshaw opened the door  no was the reply  mr stokes affected to ponder mr henshaw instinctively edged away  he aint in said mrs henshaw preparing to close the door  i wanted to see im partikler said mr stokes slowly i brought a friend o mine name o alfred bell up here on purpose to see im  mrs henshaw following the direction of his eyes put her head round the door  george she exclaimed sharply  mr stokes smiled that aint george he said gleefully thats my friend mr alfred bell aint it a extraordinary likeness aint it wonderful thats why i brought im up i wanted george to see im  mrs henshaw looked from one to the other in wrathful bewilderment  his living image aint he said mr stokes this is my pal georges missis he added turning to mr bell  good afternoon to you said that gentleman huskily  he got a bad cold coming from ireland explained mr stokes and foolishlike he went outside a bus with me the other night and made it worse  ohh said mrs henshaw slowly indeed really  hes quite curious to see george said mr stokes in fact he was going back to ireland tonight if it adnt been for that hes waiting till tomorrow just to see george  mr bell in a voice huskier than ever said that he had altered his mind again  illustration george she exclaimed sharply  nonsense said mr stokes sternly besides george would like to see you i spose he wont be long he added turning to mrs henshaw who was regarding mr bell much as a hungry cat regards a plump sparrow  i dont suppose so she said slowly  i dare say if we wait a little while began mr stokes ignoring a frantic glance from mr henshaw  come in said mrs henshaw suddenly  mr stokes entered and finding that his friend hung back went out again and half led half pushed him indoors mr bells shyness he attributed to his having lived so long in ireland  he is quite the ladies man though he said artfully as they followed their hostess into the front room you should ha seen im the other night on the bus we had a couple o lady friends o mine with us and even the conductor was surprised at his goings on  mr bell by no means easy as to the results of the experiment scowled at him despairingly  carrying on was he said mrs henshaw regarding the culprit steadily  carrying on like one oclock said the imaginative mr stokes called one of em his little wife and asked her where er weddingring was  i didnt said mr bell in a suffocating voice i didnt  theres nothing to be ashamed of said mr stokes virtuously only as i said to you at the time alfred i says its all right for you as a single man but you might be the twinbrother of a pal o mine george henshaw by nameand if some people was to see you they might think it was im didnt i say that  you did said mr bell helplessly  and he wouldnt believe me said mr stokes turning to mrs henshaw thats why i brought him round to see george  i should like to see the two of em together myself said mrs henshaw quietly i should have taken him for my husband anywhere  you wouldnt if youd seen im last night said mr stokes shaking his head and smiling  carrying on again was he inquired mrs henshaw quickly  no said mr bell in a stentorian whisper  his glance was so fierce that mr stokes almost quailed i wont tell tales out of school he said nodding  not if i ask you to said mrs henshaw with a winning smile  ask im said mr stokes  last night said the whisperer hastily i went for a quiet walk round victoria park all by myself then i met mr stokes and we had one halfpint together at a publichouse thats all  mrs henshaw looked at mr stokes mr stokes winked at her  its as true as my name isalfred bell said that gentleman with slight but natural hesitation  have it your own way said mr stokes somewhat perturbed at mr bells refusal to live up to the character he had arranged for him  i wish my husband spent his evenings in the same quiet way said mrs henshaw shaking her head  dont he said mr stokes why he always seems quiet enough to me too quiet i should say why i never knew a quieter man i chaff im about it sometimes  thats his artfulness said mrs henshaw  always in a hurry to get ome pursued the benevolent mr stokes  he may say so to you to get away from you said mrs henshaw thoughtfully he does say youre hard to shake off sometimes  mr stokes sat stiffly upright and threw a fierce glance in the direction of mr henshaw  pity he didnt tell me he said bitterly i aint one to force my company where it aint wanted  ive said to him sometimes continued mrs henshaw why dont you tell ted stokes plain that you dont like his company but he wont that aint his way hed sooner talk of you behind your back  what does he say inquired mr stokes coldly ignoring a frantic headshake on the part of his friend  promise me you wont tell him if i tell you said mrs henshaw  mr stokes promised  i dont know that i ought to tell you said mrs henshaw reluctantly but i get so sick and tired of him coming home and grumbling about you  go on said the waiting stokes  mrs henshaw stole a glance at him he says you act as if you thought yourself everybody she said softly and your everlasting clack clack clack worries him to death  go on said the listener grimly  and he says its so much trouble to get you to pay for your share of the drinks that hed sooner pay himself and have done with it  mr stokes sprang from his chair and with clenched fists stood angrily regarding the horrified mr bell he composed himself by an effort and resumed his seat  anything else he inquired  heaps and heaps of things said mrs henshaw but i dont want to make bad blood between you  dont mind me said mr stokes glancing balefully over at his agitated friend praps ill tell you some things about him some day  it would be only fair said mrs henshaw quickly tell me now i dont mind mr bell hearing not a bit  mr bell spoke up for himself i dont want to hear family secrets he whispered with an imploring glance at the vindictive mr stokes it wouldnt be right  well i dont want to say things behind a mans back said the latter recovering himself lets wait till george comes in and ill say em before his face  mrs henshaw biting her lip with annoyance argued with him but in vain mr stokes was firm and with a glance at the clock said that george would be in soon and he would wait till he came  conversation flagged despite the efforts of mrs henshaw to draw mr bell out on the subject of ireland at an early stage of the catechism he lost his voice entirely and thereafter sat silent while mrs henshaw discussed the most intimate affairs of her husbands family with mr stokes she was in the middle of an anecdote about her motherinlaw when mr bell rose and with some difficulty intimated his desire to depart  what without seeing george said mrs henshaw he cant be long now and i should like to see you together  praps we shall meet him said mr stokes who was getting rather tired of the affair good night  he led the way to the door and followed by the eager mr bell passed out into the street the knowledge that mrs henshaw was watching him from the door kept him silent until they had turned the corner and then turning fiercely on mr henshaw he demanded to know what he meant by it  ive done with you he said waving aside the others denials ive got you out of this mess and now ive done with you its no good talking because i dont want to hear it  goodby then said mr henshaw with unexpected hauteur as he came to a standstill  ill ave my trousers first though said mr stokes coldly and then you can go and welcome  its my opinion she recognized me and said all that just to try us said the other gloomily  mr stokes scorned to reply and reaching his lodging stood by in silence while the other changed his clothes he refused mr henshaws hand with a gesture he had once seen on the stage and showing him downstairs closed the door behind him with a bang  left to himself the small remnants of mr henshaws courage disappeared he wandered forlornly up and down the streets until past ten oclock and then cold and dispirited set off in the direction of home at the corner of the street he pulled himself together by a great effort and walking rapidly to his house put the key in the lock and turned it  the door was fast and the lights were out he knocked at first lightly but gradually increasing in loudness at the fourth knock a light appeared in the room above the window was raised and mrs henshaw leaned out  mr bell she said in tones of severe surprise  bell said her husband in a more surprised voice still its me polly  go away at once sir said mrs henshaw indignantly how dare you call me by my christian name im surprised at you  its me i tell yougeorge said her husband desperately what do you mean by calling me bell  illustration he struck a match and holding it before his face looked up at the window  if youre mr bell as i suppose you know well enough said mrs henshaw leaning out and regarding him fixedly and if youre george you dont  im george said mr henshaw hastily  im sure i dont know what to make of it said mrs henshaw with a bewildered air ted stokes brought round a man named bell this afternoon so like you that i cant tell the difference i dont know what to do but i do know thisi dont let you in until i have seen you both together so that i can tell which is which  both together exclaimed the startled mr henshaw herelook here  he struck a match and holding it before his face looked up at the window mrs henshaw scrutinized him gravely  its no good she said despairingly i cant tell i must see you both together  mr henshaw ground his teeth but where is he he inquired  he went off with ted stokes said his wife if youre george youd better go and ask him  she prepared to close the window but mr henshaws voice arrested her  and suppose he is not there he said  mrs henshaw reflected if he is not there bring ted stokes back with you she said at last and if he says youre george ill let you in the window closed and the light disappeared mr henshaw waited for some time but in vain and with a very clear idea of the reception he would meet with at the hands of mr stokes set off to his lodging  if anything he had underestimated his friends powers mr stokes rudely disturbed just as he had got into bed was the incarnation of wrath he was violent bitter and insulting in a breath but mr henshaw was desperate and mr stokes after vowing over and over again that nothing should induce him to accompany him back to his house was at last so moved by his entreaties that he went upstairs and equipped himself for the journey  and mind after this i never want to see your face again he said as they walked swiftly back  mr henshaw made no reply the events of the day had almost exhausted him and silence was maintained until they reached the house much to his relief he heard somebody moving about upstairs after the first knock and in a very short time the window was gently raised and mrs henshaw looked out  what youve come back she said in a low intense voice well of all the impudence how dare you carry on like this  its me said her husband  yes i see it is was the reply  its him right enough its your husband said mr stokes alfred bell has gone  how dare you stand there and tell me them falsehoods exclaimed mrs henshaw i wonder the ground dont open and swallow you up its mr bell and if he dont go away ill call the police  messrs henshaw and stokes amazed at their reception stood blinking up at her then they conferred in whispers  if you cant tell em apart how do you know this is mr bell inquired mr stokes turning to the window again  how do i know repeated mrs henshaw how do i know why because my husband came home almost directly mr bell had gone i wonder he didnt meet him  came home cried mr henshaw shrilly came home  yes and dont make so much noise said mrs henshaw tartly hes asleep  the two gentlemen turned and gazed at each other in stupefaction mr stokes was the first to recover and taking his dazed friend by the arm led him gently away at the end of the street he took a deep breath and after a slight pause to collect his scattered energies summed up the situation  illustration mr stokes taking his dazed friend by the arm led him gently away  shes twigged it all along he said with conviction youll have to come home with me tonight and tomorrow the best thing you can do is to make a clean breast of it it was a silly game and if you remember i was against it from the first     illustration mixed relations     mixed relations   the brig elizabeth barstow came up the river as though in a hurry to taste again the joys of the metropolis the skipper leaning on the wheel was in the midst of a hot discussion with the mate who was placing before him the hygienic economical and moral advantages of total abstinence in language of great strength but little variety  teetotallers eat more said the skipper finally  the mate choked and his eye sought the galley eat more he spluttered yesterday the meat was like brickbats today it tasted like a bit o dirty sponge ive lived on biscuits this trip and the only tater i ate im going to see a doctor about direckly i get ashore its a sin and a shame to spoil good food the way e does  the moment i can ship another cook he goes said the skipper he seems busy judging by the noise  im making him clean up everything ready for the next explained the mate grimly and he ad the cheek to tell me hes improving improving  hell go as soon as i get another repeated the skipper stooping and peering ahead i dont like being poisoned any more than you do he told me he could cook when i shipped him said his sister had taught him  the mate grunted and walking away relieved his mind by putting his head in at the galley and bidding the cook hold up each separate utensil for his inspection a hole in the fryingpan the cook modestly attributed to elbowgrease  the river narrowed and the brig picking her way daintily through the traffic sought her old berth at bullers wharf it was occupied by a deaf sailingbarge which moved at last by selfinterest not unconnected with its paint took up a less desirable position and consoled itself with adjectives  the men on the wharf had gone for the day and the crew of the elizabeth barstow after making fast went below to prepare themselves for an evening ashore standing before the largest saucepan lid in the galley the cook was putting the finishing touches to his toilet  a light quick step on the wharf attracted the attention of the skipper as he leaned against the side smoking it stopped just behind him and turning round he found himself gazing into the soft brown eyes of the prettiest girl he had ever seen  is mr jewell on board please she asked with a smile  jewell repeated the skipper jewell dont know the name  he was on board said the girl somewhat taken aback this is the elizabeth barstow isnt it  whats his christian name inquired the skipper thoughtfully  albert replied the girl bert she added as the other shook his head  oh the cook said the skipper i didnt know his name was jewell yes hes in the galley  he stood eyeing her and wondering in a dazed fashion what she could see in a small whitefaced slabsided  the girl broke in upon his meditations how does he cook she inquired smiling  he was about to tell her when he suddenly remembered the cooks statement as to his instructor  hes getting on he said slowly hes getting on are you his sister  the girl smiled and nodded yees she said slowly will you tell him i am waiting for him please  the skipper started and drew himself up then he walked forward and put his head in at the galley  bert he said in a friendly voice your sister wants to see you  who inquired mr jewell in the accents of amazement he put his head out at the door and nodded and then somewhat red in the face with the exercise drew on his jacket and walked towards her the skipper followed  thank you said the girl with a pleasant smile  youre quite welcome said the skipper  mr jewell stepped ashore and after a moment of indecision shook hands with his visitor  if youre down this way again said the skipper as they turned away perhaps youd like to see the cabin were in rather a pickle just now but if you should happen to come down for bert tomorrow night  the girls eyes grew mirthful and her lips trembled thank you she said  some people like looking over cabins murmured the skipper  he raised his hand to his cap and turned away the mate who had just come on deck stared after the retreating couple and gave vent to a low whistle  what a fine gal to pick up with slushy he remarked  its his sister said the skipper somewhat sharply  the one that taught him to cook said the other hastily here id like five minutes alone with her id give er a piece o my mind that ud do her good id learn er id tell her wot i thought of her  thatll do said the skipper thatll do hes not so bad for a beginner ive known worse  not so bad repeated the mate not so bad whyhis voice trembled aint you going to give im the chuck then  i shall try him for another vyge george said the skipper its hard lines on a youngster if he dont have a chance i was never one to be severe live and let live thats my motto do as youd be done by  youre turning softarted in your old age grumbled the mate  old age said the other in a startled voice old age im not thirtyseven yet  youre getting on said the mate besides you look old  the skipper investigated the charge in the cabin lookingglass ten minutes later he twisted his beard in his hand and tried to imagine how he would look without it as a compromise he went out and had it cut short and trimmed to a point the glass smiled approval on his return the mate smiled too and being caught in the act said it made him look like his own grandson  it was late when the cook returned but the skipper was on deck and stopping him for a match entered into a little conversation mr jewell surprised at first soon became at his ease and the talk drifting in some unknown fashion to miss jewell discussed her with brotherly frankness  you spent the evening together i spose said the skipper carelessly  mr jewell glanced at him from the corner of his eye cooking he said and put his hand over his mouth with some suddenness  by the time they parted the skipper had his hand in a friendly fashion on the cooks shoulder and was displaying an interest in his welfare as unusual as it was gratifying so unaccustomed was mr jewell to such consideration that he was fain to pause for a moment or two to regain control of his features before plunging into the lamplit focsle  illustration the mate smiled too  the mate made but a poor breakfast next morning but his superior who saw the hand of miss jewell in the muddy coffee and the cremated bacon ate his with relish he was looking forward to the evening the cook having assured him that his sister had accepted his invitation to inspect the cabin and indeed had talked of little else the boy was set to work housecleaning and having gleaned a few particulars cursed the sex with painstaking thoroughness  it seemed to the skipper a favorable omen that miss jewell descended the companionladder as though to the manner born and her exclamations of delight at the cabin completed his satisfaction the cook who had followed them below with some trepidation became reassured and seating himself on a locker joined modestly in the conversation  its like a dollshouse declared the girl as she finished by examining the spacesaving devices in the stateroom well i mustnt take up any more of your time  ive got nothing to do said the skipper hastily ii was thinking of going for a walk but its lonely walking about by yourself  miss jewell agreed she lowered her eyes and looked under the lashes at the skipper  i never had a sister continued the latter in melancholy accents  i dont suppose you would want to take her out if you had said the girl  the skipper protested bert takes you out he said  he isnt like most brothers said miss jewell shifting along the locker and placing her hand affectionately on the cooks shoulder  if i had a sister continued the skipper in a somewhat uneven voice i should take her out this evening for instance i should take her to a theatre  miss jewell turned upon him the innocent face of a child it would be nice to be your sister she said calmly  the skipper attempted to speak but his voice failed him well pretend you are my sister he said at last and well go to one  pretend said miss jewell as she turned and eyed the cook bert wouldnt like that she said decidedly  nno said the cook nervously avoiding the skippers eye  it wouldnt be proper said miss jewell sitting upright and looking very proper indeed  ii meant bert to come too said the skipper of course he added  the severity of miss jewells expression relaxed she stole an amused glance at the cook and reading her instructions in his eye began to temporize ten minutes later the crew of the elizabeth barstow in various attitudes of astonishment beheld their commander going ashore with his cook the mate so far forgot himself as to whistle but with great presence of mind cuffed the boys ear as the skipper turned  for some little distance the three walked along in silence the skipper was building castles in the air the cook was not quite at his ease and the girl gazing steadily in front of her appeared slightly embarrassed  by the time they reached aldgate and stood waiting for an omnibus miss jewell found herself assailed by doubts she remembered that she did not want to go to a theatre and warmly pressed the two men to go together and leave her to go home the skipper remonstrated in vain but the cook came to the rescue and miss jewell still protesting was pushed on to a bus and propelled upstairs she took a vacant seat in front and the skipper and mr jewell shared one behind  the three hours at the theatre passed all too soon although the girl was so interested in the performance that she paid but slight attention to her companions during the waits she became interested in her surroundings and several times called the skippers attention to smart looking men in the stalls and boxes at one man she stared so persistently that an operaglass was at last levelled in return  how rude of him she said smiling sweetly at the skipper  she shook her head in disapproval but the next moment he saw her gazing steadily at the operaglasses again  if you dont look hell soon get tired of it he said between his teeth  yes perhaps he will said miss jewell without lowering her eyes in the least  the skipper sat in torment until the lights were lowered and the curtain went up again when it fell he began to discuss the play but miss jewell returned such vague replies that it was evident her thoughts were far away  i wonder who he is she whispered gazing meditatingly at the box  a waiter i should think snapped the skipper  the girl shook her head no he is much too distinguishedlooking she said seriously well i suppose hell know me again  the skipper felt that he wanted to get up and smash things beginning with the man in the box it was his first love episode for nearly ten years and he had forgotten the pains and penalties which attach to the condition when the performance was over he darted a threatening glance at the box and keeping close to miss jewell looked carefully about him to make sure that they were not followed  it was ripping said the cook as they emerged into the fresh air  lovely said the girl in a voice of gentle melancholy i shall come and see it again perhaps when you are at sea  not alone said the skipper in a startled voice  i dont mind being alone said miss jewell gently im used to it  the others reply was lost in the rush for the bus and for the second time that evening the skipper had to find fault with the seating arrangements and when a vacancy by the side of miss jewell did occur he was promptly forestalled by a young man in a check suit smoking a large cigar  they got off at aldgate and the girl thanked him for a pleasant evening a hesitating offer to see her home was at once negatived and the skipper watching her and the cook until they disappeared in the traffic walked slowly and thoughtfully to his ship  the brig sailed the next evening at eight oclock and it was not until six that the cook remarked in the most casual manner that his sister was coming down to see him off she arrived half an hour late and so far from wanting to see the cabin again discovered an inconvenient love of fresh air she came down at last at the instance of the cook and once below her mood changed and she treated the skipper with a soft graciousness which raised him to the seventh heaven youll be good to bert wont you she inquired with a smile at that young man  ill treat him like my own brother said the skipper fervently no better than that ill treat him like your brother  the cook sat erect and the skipper being occupied with miss jewell winked solemnly at the skylight  i know you will said the girl very softly but i dont think the men  the menll do as i wish said the skipper sternly im the master on this shipshes half mine tooand anybody who interferes with him interferes with me if theres anything you dont like bert you tell me  mr jewell his small black eyes sparkling promised and then muttering something about his work exchanged glances with the girl and went up on deck  it is a nice cabin said miss jewell shifting an inch and a half nearer to the skipper i suppose poor bert has to have his meals in that stuffy little place at the other end of the ship doesnt he  the focsle said the skipper struggling between love and discipline yes  the girl sighed and the mate who was listening at the skylight above held his breath with anxiety miss jewell sighed again and in an absent minded fashion increased the distance between herself and companion by six inches  its usual faltered the skipper  yes of course said the girl coldly  but if bert likes to feed here hes welcome said the skipper desperately and he can sleep aft too the mate can say what he likes  the mate rose and walking forward raised his clenched fists to heaven and availed himself of the permission to the fullest extent of a somewhat extensive vocabulary  do you know what i think you are inquired miss jewell bending towards him with a radiant face  no said the other trembling what  the girl paused it wouldnt do to tell you she said in a low voice it might make you vain  do you know what i think you are inquired the skipper in his turn  miss jewell eyed him composedly albeit the corners of her mouth trembled yes she said unexpectedly  steps sounded above and came heavily down the companionladder tides amost on the turn said the mate gruffly from the door  the skipper hesitated but the mate stood aside for the girl to pass and he followed her up on deck and assisted her to the jetty for hours afterwards he debated with himself whether she really had allowed her hand to stay in his a second or two longer than necessary or whether unconscious muscular action on his part was responsible for the phenomenon  he became despondent as they left london behind but the necessity of interfering between a goggleeyed and obtuse mate and a pallid but no less obstinate cook helped to relieve him  he says he is going to sleep aft choked the mate pointing to the cooks bedding  quite right said the skipper i told him to hes going to take his meals here too anything to say against it  the mate sat down on a locker and fought for breath the cook still pale felt his small black mustache and eyed him with triumphant malice i told im they was your orders he remarked  and i told him i didnt believe him said the mate nobody would whoever eard of a cook living aft why theyd laugh at the idea  he laughed himself but in a strangely mirthless fashion and afraid to trust himself went up on deck and brooded savagely apart nor did he come down to breakfast until the skipper and cook had finished  mr jewell bore his new honors badly and the inability to express their dissatisfaction by means of violence had a bad effect on the tempers of the crew sarcasm they did try but at that the cook could more than hold his own and although the men doubted his ability at first he was able to prove to them by actual experiment that he could cook worse than they supposed  the brig reached her destinationcreekhavenon the fifth day and mr jewell found himself an honored guest at the skippers cottage it was a comfortable place but as the cook pointed out too large for one he also referred incidentally to his sisters love of a country life and finding himself on a subject of which the other never tired gave full reins to a somewhat picturesque imagination  they were back at london within the fortnight and the skipper learned to his dismay that miss jewell was absent on a visit in these circumstances he would have clung to the cook but that gentleman pleading engagements managed to elude him for two nights out of the three  on the third day miss jewell returned to london and making her way to the wharf was just in time to wave farewells as the brig parted from the wharf  illustration sarcasm they did try but at that the cook could more than hold his own  from the fact that the cook was not visible at the moment the skipper took the salutation to himself it cheered him for the time but the next day he was so despondent that the cook by this time thoroughly in his confidence offered to write when they got to creekhaven and fix up an evening  and theres really no need for you to come bert said the skipper cheering up  mr jewell shook his head she wouldnt go without me he said gravely youve no idea ow particular she is always was from a child  well we might lose you said the skipper reflecting how would that be  we might try it said the cook without enthusiasm  to his dismay the skipper before they reached london again had invented at least a score of ways by which he might enjoy miss jewells company without the presence of a third person some of them so ingenious that the cook despite his utmost efforts could see no way of opposing them  the skipper put his ideas into practice as soon as they reached london between wapping and charing cross he lost the cook three times miss jewell found him twice and the third time she was so difficult that the skipper had to join in the treasurehunt himself the cook listened unmoved to a highlycolored picture of his carelessness from the lips of miss jewell and bestowed a sympathetic glance upon the skipper as she paused for breath  its as bad as taking a child out said the latter with wellaffected indignation  worse said the girl tightening her lips  with a perseverance worthy of a better cause the skipper nudged the cooks arm and tried again this time he was successful beyond his wildest dreams and after ten minutes frantic search found that he had lost them both he wandered up and down for hours and it was past eleven when he returned to the ship and found the cook waiting for him  we thought something ad happened to you said the cook kate has been in a fine way about it five minutes after you lost me she found me and weve been hunting igh and low ever since  miss jewell expressed her relief the next evening and stealing a glance at the face of the skipper experienced a twinge of something which she took to be remorse ignoring the cooks hints as to theatres she elected to go for a long bus ride and sitting in front with the skipper left mr jewell to keep a chaperons eye on them from three seats behind  conversation was for some time disjointed then the brightness and crowded state of the streets led the skipper to sound his companion as to her avowed taste for a country life  i should love it said miss jewell with a sigh but theres no chance of it ive got my living to earn  you mightmight marry somebody living in the country said the skipper in trembling tones  miss jewell shuddered marry she said scornfully  most people do said the other  sensible people dont said the girl you havent she added with a smile  im very thankful i havent retorted the skipper with great meaning  there you are said the girl triumphantly  i never saw anybody i liked said the skipper bebefore  if ever i did marry said miss jewell with remarkable composure if ever i was foolish enough to do such a thing i think i would marry a man a few years younger than myself  younger said the dismayed skipper  miss jewell nodded they make the best husbands she said gravely  the skipper began to argue the point and mr jewell at that moment taking a seat behind joined in with some heat a more ardent supporter could not have been found although his repetition of the phrase may and december revealed a want of tact of which the skipper had not thought him capable what had promised to be a redletter day in his existence was spoiled and he went to bed that night with the full conviction that he had better abandon a project so hopeless  with a fine morning his courage revived but as voyage succeeded voyage he became more and more perplexed the devotion of the cook was patent to all men but miss jewell was as changeable as a weatherglass the skipper would leave her one night convinced that he had better forget her as soon as possible and the next her manner would be so kind and her glances so soft that only the presence of the everwatchful cook prevented him from proposing on the spot the end came one evening in october the skipper had hurried back from the city laden with stores miss jewell having after many refusals consented to grace the tea table that afternoon the table set by the boy groaned beneath the weight of unusual luxuries but the girl had not arrived the cook was also missing and the only occupant of the cabin was the mate who sitting at one corner was eating with great relish  aint you going to get your tea he inquired  no hurry said the skipper somewhat incensed at his haste it wouldnt have hurt you to have waited a bit  waited said the other what for  for my visitors was the reply  the mate bit a piece off a crust and stirred his tea no use waiting for them he said with a grin they aint coming  what do you mean demanded the skipper  i mean said the mate continuing to stir his tea with great enjoymenti mean that all that kindartedness of yours was clean chucked away on that cook hes got a berth ashore and hes gone for good he left you is love he left it with bill hemp  berth ashore said the skipper staring  ah said the mate taking a large and noisy sip from his cup hes been fooling you all along for what he could get out of you sleeping aft and feeding aft nobody to speak a word to im and going out and being treated by the skipper bill said he laughed so much when he was telling im that the tears was running down is face like rain he said hed never been treated so much in his life  thatll do said the skipper quickly  you ought to hear bill tell it said the mate regretfully i cant do it anything like as well as what he can made us all roar he did what amused em most was you thinking that that gal was cookies sister  the skipper with a sharp exclamation leaned forward staring at him  theyre going to be married at christmas said the mate choking in his cup  the skipper sat upright again and tried manfully to compose his features many things he had not understood before were suddenly made clear and he remembered now the odd way in which the girl had regarded him as she bade him goodnight on the previous evening the mate eyed him with interest and was about to supply him with further details when his attention was attracted by footsteps descending the companion ladder then he put down his cup with great care and stared in stolid amazement at the figure of miss jewell in the doorway  im a bit late she said flushing slightly  she crossed over and shook hands with the skipper and in the most natural fashion in the world took a seat and began to remove her gloves the mate swung round and regarded her openmouthed the skipper whose ideas were in a whirl sat regarding her in silence the mate was the first to move he left the cabin rubbing his shin and casting furious glances at the skipper  you didnt expect to see me said the girl reddening again  no was the reply  the girl looked at the tablecloth i came to beg your pardon she said in a low voice  theres nothing to beg my pardon for said the skipper clearing his throat by rights i ought to beg yours you did quite right to make fun of me i can see it now  when you asked me whether i was berts sister i didnt like to say no continued the girl and at first i let you come out with me for the fun of the thing and then bert said it would be good for him and thenthen  yes said the skipper after a long pause  the girl broke a biscuit into small pieces and arranged them on the cloth then i didnt mind your coming so much she said in a low voice  the skipper caught his breath and tried to gaze at the averted face  the girl swept the crumbs aside and met his gaze squarely not quite so much she explained  ive been a fool said the skipper ive been a fool ive made myself a laughingstock all round but if i could have it all over again i would  that can never be said the girl shaking her head bert wouldnt come  illustration goodby he said slowly and i wish you both every happiness  no of course not asserted the other  the girl bit her lip the skipper thought that he had never seen her eyes so large and shining there was a long silence  goodby said the girl at last rising  the skipper rose to follow goodby he said slowly and i wish you both every happiness  happiness echoed the girl in a surprised voice why  when you are married  i am not going to be married said the girl i told bert so this afternoon goodby  the skipper actually let her get nearly to the top of the ladder before he regained his presence of mind then in obedience to a powerful tug at the hem of her skirt she came down again and accompanied him meekly back to the cabin     illustration his lordship     his lordship   farmer rose sat in his porch smoking an evening pipe by his side in a comfortable windsor chair sat his friend the miller also smoking and gazing with halfclosed eyes at the landscape as he listened for the thousandth time to his hosts complaints about his daughter  the long and the short of it is cray said the farmer with an air of mournful pride shes far too goodlooking  mr cray grunted  truth is truth though shes my daughter continued mr rose vaguely shes too goodlooking sometimes when ive taken her up to market ive seen the folks fair turn their backs on the cattle and stare at her instead  mr cray sniffed louder perhaps than he had intended beautiful that rosebush smells he remarked as his friend turned and eyed him  what is the consequence demanded the farmer relaxing his gaze she looks in the glass and sees herself and then she gets miserable and uppish because there aint nobody in these parts good enough for her to marry  its a extraordinary thing to me where she gets them good looks from said the miller deliberately  ah said mr rose and sat trying to think of a means of enlightening his friend without undue loss of modesty  she aint a bit like her poor mother mused mr cray  no she dont get her looks from her assented the other  its one o them things you cant account for said mr cray who was very tired of the subject its just like seeing a beautiful flower blooming on an old cabbagestump  the farmer knocked his pipe out noisily and began to refill it people have said that she takes after me a trifle he remarked shortly  you werent fool enough to believe that i know said the miller why shes no more like you than youre like a warmingpannot so much  mr rose regarded his friend fixedly you aint got a very nice way o putting things cray he said mournfully  im no flatterer said the miller never was and you cant please everybody if i said your daughter took after you i dont spose shed ever speak to me again  the worst of it is said the farmer disregarding his remark she wont settle down theres young walter lomas after her now and she wont look at him hes a decent young fellow is walter and shes been and named one o the pigs after him and the way she mixes them up together is disgraceful  if she was my girl she should marry young walter said the miller firmly whats wrong with him  she looks higher replied the other mysteriously shes always reading them romantic books full o love tales and shes never tired o talking of a girl her mother used to know that went on the stage and married a baronet she goes and sits in the best parlor every afternoon now and calls it the drawingroom shell sit there till shes past the marrying age and then shell turn round and blame me  she wants a lesson said mr cray firmly she wants to be taught her position in life not to go about turning up her nose at young men and naming pigs after them  mr rose sighed  what she wants to understand is that the upper classes wouldnt look at her pursued the miller  it would be easier to make her understand that if they didnt said the farmer  i mean said mr cray sternly with a view to marriage what you ought to do is to get somebody staying down here with you pretending to be a lord or a nobleman and ordering her about and not noticing her good looks at all then while shes upset about that in comes walter lomas to comfort her and be a contrast to the other  mr rose withdrew his pipe and regarded him openmouthed  yes but how he began  and it seems to me interrupted mr cray that i know just the young fellow to do itnephew of my wifes he was coming to stay a fortnight with us but you can have him with pleasureme and him dont get on over and above well  perhaps he wouldnt do it objected the farmer  hed do it like a shot said mr cray positively it would be fun for us and it ud be a lesson for her if you like ill tell him to write to you for lodgings as he wants to come for a fortnights fresh air after the fatiguing gayeties of town  fatiguing gayeties of town repeated the admiring farmer fatiguing  he sat back in his chair and laughed and mr cray delighted at the prospect of getting rid so easily of a tiresome guest laughed too overhead at the open window a third person laughed but in so quiet and wellbred a fashion that neither of them heard her  the farmer received a letter a day or two afterwards and negotiations between jane rose on the one side and lord fairmount on the other were soon in progress the farmers own composition being deemed somewhat crude for such a correspondence  i wish he didnt want it kept so secret said miss rose pondering over the final letter i should like to let the grays and one or two more people know he is staying with us however i suppose he must have his own way  you must do as he wishes said her father using his handkerchief violently  jane sighed hell be a little company for me at any rate she remarked what is the matter father  bit of a cold said the farmer indistinctly as he made for the door still holding his handkerchief to his face been coming on some time  he put on his hat and went out and miss rose watching him from the window was not without fears that the joke might prove too much for a man of his habit she regarded him thoughtfully and when he returned at one oclock to dinner and encountered instead a violent duststorm which was raging in the house she noted with pleasure that his sense of humor was more under control  dinner she said as he strove to squeeze past the furniture which was piled in the hall weve got no time to think of dinner and if we had theres no place for you to eat it youd better go in the larder and cut yourself a crust of bread and cheese  her father hesitated and glared at the servant who with her head bound up in a duster passed at the double with a broom then he walked slowly into the kitchen  miss rose called out something after him  eh said her father coming back hopefully  how is your cold dear  the farmer made no reply and his daughter smiled contentedly as she heard him stamping about in the larder he made but a poor meal and then refusing pointblank to assist annie in moving the piano went and smoked a very reflective pipe in the garden  illustration shes got your eyes said his lordship  lord fairmount arrived the following day on foot from the station and after acknowledging the farmers salute with a distant nod requested him to send a cart for his luggage he was a tall goodlooking young man and as he stood in the hall languidly twisting his mustache miss rose deliberately decided upon his destruction  these your daughters he inquired carelessly as he followed his host into the parlor  one of em is my lord the other is my servant replied the farmer  shes got your eyes said his lordship tapping the astonished annie under the chin your nose too i think  thats my servant said the farmer knitting his brows at him  oh indeed said his lordship airily  he turned round and regarded jane but although she tried to meet him halfway by elevating her chin a little his audacity failed him and the words died away on his tongue a long silence followed broken only by the illsuppressed giggles of annie who had retired to the kitchen  i trust that we shall make your lordship comfortable said miss rose  i hope so my good girl was the reply and now will you show me my room  miss rose led the way upstairs and threw open the door lord fairmount pausing on the threshold gazed at it disparagingly  is this the best room you have he inquired stiffly  oh no said miss rose smiling fathers room is much better than this look here  she threw open another door and ignoring a gesticulating figure which stood in the hall below regarded him anxiously if you would prefer fathers room he would be delighted for you to have it delighted  yes i will have this one said lord fairmount entering bring me up some hot water please and clear these boots and leggings out  miss rose tripped downstairs and bestowing a witching smile upon her sire waved away his request for an explanation and hastened into the kitchen whence annie shortly afterwards emerged with the water  it was with something of a shock that the farmer discovered that he had to wait for his dinner while his lordship had luncheon that meal under his daughters management took a long time and the joint when it reached him was more than half cold it was moreover quite clear that the aristocracy had not even mastered the rudiments of carving but preferred instead to box the compass for titbits  he ate his meal in silence and when it was over sought out his guest to administer a few muchneeded stagedirections owing however to the ubiquity of jane he wasted nearly the whole of the afternoon before he obtained an opportunity even then the interview was short the farmer having to compress into ten seconds instructions for lord fairmount to express a desire to take his meals with the family and his dinner at the respectable hour of 1 pm instructions as to a change of bedroom were frustrated by the reappearance of jane  his lordship went for a walk after that and coming back with a bored air stood on the hearthrug in the livingroom and watched miss rose sewing  very dull place he said at last in a dissatisfied voice  yes my lord said miss rose demurely  fearfully dull complained his lordship stifling a yawn what im to do to amuse myself for a fortnight im sure i dont know  miss rose raised her fine eyes and regarded him intently many a lesser man would have looked no farther for amusement  im afraid there is not much to do about here my lord she said quietly we are very plain folk in these parts  yes assented the other an obvious compliment rose of itself to his lips but he restrained himself though with difficulty miss rose bent her head over her work and stitched industriously his lordship took up a book and remembering his mission read for a couple of hours without taking the slightest notice of her miss rose glanced over in his direction once or twice and then with a somewhat vixenish expression on her delicate features resumed her sewing  wonderful eyes shes got said the gentleman as he sat on the edge of his bed that night and thought over the events of the day its pretty to see them flash  he saw them flash several times during the next few days and mr rose himself was more than satisfied with the hauteur with which his guest treated the household  but i dont like the way you have with me he complained  its all in the part urged his lordship  well you can leave that part out rejoined mr rose with some acerbity i object to being spoke to as you speak to me before that girl annie be as proud and unpleasant as you like to my daughter but leave me alone mind that  his lordship promised and in pursuance of his hosts instructions strove manfully to subdue feelings towards miss rose by no means in accordance with them the best of us are liable to absentmindedness and he sometimes so far forgot himself as to address her in tones as humble as any in her somewhat large experience  i hope that we are making you comfortable here my lord she said as they sat together one afternoon  i have never been more comfortable in my life was the gracious reply  miss rose shook her head oh my lord she said in protest think of your mansion  his lordship thought of it for two or three days he had been thinking of houses and furniture and other things of that nature  i have never seen an old country seat continued miss rose clasping her hands and gazing at him wistfully i should be so grateful if your lordship would describe yours to me  his lordship shifted uneasily and then in face of the girls persistence stood for some time divided between the contending claims of hampton court palace and the tower of london he finally decided upon the former after first refurnishing it at maples  how happy you must be said the breathless jane when he had finished  he shook his head gravely my possessions have never given me any happiness he remarked i would much rather be in a humble rank of life live where i like andand marry whom i like  there was no mistaking the meaning fall in his voice miss rose sighed gently and lowered her eyesher lashes had often excited comment then in a soft voice she asked him the sort of life he would prefer  in reply his lordship with an eloquence which surprised himself portrayed the joys of life in a sevenroomed house in town with a greenhouse six feet by three and a garden large enough to contain it he really spoke well and when he had finished his listener gazed at him with eyes suffused with timid admiration  oh my lord she said prettily now i know what youve been doing youve been slumming  slumming gasped his lordship  you couldnt have described a place like that unless you had been said miss rose nodding i hope you took the poor people some nice hot soup  his lordship tried to explain but without success miss rose persisted in regarding him as a missionary of food and warmth and spoke feelingly of the people who had to live in such places she also warned him against the risk of infection  you dont understand he repeated impatiently these are nice housesnice enough for anybody to live in if you took soup to people like that why theyd throw it at you  wretches murmured the indignant jane who was enjoying herself amazingly  his lordship eyed her with sudden suspicion but her face was quite grave and bore traces of strong feeling he explained again but without avail  you never ought to go near such places my lord she concluded solemnly as she rose to quit the room even a girl of my station would draw the line at that  she bowed deeply and withdrew his lordship sank into a chair and thrusting his hands into his pockets gazed gloomily at the dried grasses in the grate  during the next day or two his appetite failed and other wellknown symptoms set in miss rose diagnosing them all prescribed by stealth some bitter remedies the farmer regarded his change of manner with disapproval and concluding that it was due to his own complaints sought to reassure him he also pointed out that his daughters opinion of the aristocracy was hardly likely to increase if the only member she knew went about the house as though he had just lost his grandmother  you are longing for the gayeties of town my lord he remarked one morning at breakfast  his lordship shook his head the gayeties comprised amongst other things a stool and a desk  i dont like town he said with a glance at jane if i had my choice i would live here always i would sooner live here in this charming spot with this charming society than anywhere  mr rose coughed and having caught his eye shook his head at him and glanced significantly over at the unconscious jane the young man ignored his action and having got an opening gave utterance in the course of the next ten minutes to radical heresies of so violent a type that the farmer could hardly keep his seat social distinctions were condemned utterly and the house of lords referred to as a human dust bin the farmer gazed openmouthed at this snake he had nourished  your lordship will alter your mind when you get to town said jane demurely  never declared the other impressively  the girl sighed and gazing first with much interest at her parent who seemed to be doing his best to ward off a fit turned her lustrous eyes upon the guest  we shall all miss you she said softly youve been a lesson to all of us  lesson he repeated flushing  it has improved our behavior so having a lord in the house said miss rose with painful humility im sure father hasnt been like the same man since youve been here  what dye mean miss demanded the farmer hotly  dont speak like that before his lordship father said his daughter hastily im not blaming you youre no worse than the other men about here you havent had an opportunity of learning before thats all it isnt your fault  learning bellowed the farmer turning an inflamed visage upon his apprehensive guest have you noticed anything wrong about my behavior  certainly not said his lordship hastily  all i know is continued miss rose positively i wish you were going to stay here another six months for fathers sake  look here began mr rose smiting the table  and annies said jane raising her voice above the din i dont know which has improved the most im sure the way they both drink their tea now  mr rose pushed his chair back loudly and got up from the table for a moment he stood struggling for words then he turned suddenly with a growl and quitted the room banging the door after him in a fashion which clearly indicated that he still had some lessons to learn  youve made your father angry said his lordship  its for his own good said miss rose are you really sorry to leave us  sorry repeated the other sorry is no word for it  you will miss father said the girl  he sighed gently  and annie she continued  he sighed again and jane took a slight glance at him cornerwise  and me too i hope she said in a low voice  miss you repeated his lordship in a suffocating voice i should miss the sun less  i am so glad said jane clasping her hands it is so nice to feel that one is not quite forgotten of course i can never forget you you are the only nobleman i have ever met  i hope that it is not only because of that he said forlornly  miss rose pondered when she pondered her eyes increased in size and revealed unsuspected depths  noo she said at length in a hesitating voice  suppose that i were not what i am represented to be he said slowly suppose that instead of being lord fairmount i were merely a clerk  a clerk repeated miss rose with a very wellmanaged shudder how can i suppose such an absurd thing as that  but if i were urged his lordship feverishly  its no use supposing such a thing as that said miss rose briskly your high birth is stamped on you  his lordship shook his head i would sooner be a laborer on this farm than a king anywhere else he said with feeling  miss rose drew a pattern on the floor with the toe of her shoe  the poorest laborer on the farm can have the pleasure of looking at you every day continued his lordship passionately every day of his life he can see you and feel a better man for it  miss rose looked at him sharply only the day before the poorest laborer had seen herwhen he wasnt expecting the honorand received an epitome of his character which had nearly stunned him but his lordships face was quite grave  i go tomorrow he said  yes said jane in a hushed voice  he crossed the room gently and took a seat by her side miss rose still gazing at the floor wondered indignantly why it was she was not blushing his lordships conversation had come to a sudden stop and the silence was most awkward  ive been a fool miss rose he said at last rising and standing over her and ive been taking a great liberty ive been deceiving you for nearly a fortnight  nonsense responded miss rose briskly  i have been deceiving you he repeated i have made you believe that i am a person of title  nonsense said miss rose again  the other started and eyed her uneasily  nobody would mistake you for a lord said miss rose cruelly why i shouldnt think that you had ever seen one you didnt do it at all properly why your uncle cray would have done it better mr crays nephew fell back in consternation and eyed her dumbly as she laughed all mirth is not contagious and he was easily able to refrain from joining in this  i cant understand said miss rose as she wiped a teardimmed eyei cant understand how you could have thought i should be so stupid  ive been a fool said the other bitterly as he retreated to the door goodby  goodby said jane she looked him full in the face and the blushes for which she had been waiting came in force you neednt go unless you want to she said softly i like fools better than lords  illustration i like fools better than lords     illustration alfs dream     alfs dream   ive just been drinking a mans health said the night watchman coming slowly on to the wharf and wiping his mouth with the back of his hand hes come in for a matter of three undred and twenty pounds and he stood me arf a pintarf a pint  he dragged a small empty towards him and after planing the surface with his hand sat down and gazed scornfully across the river  four ale he said with a hard laugh and when i asked imjust for the look of the thing and to give im a hintwhether hed ave another he said yes  the night watchman rose and paced restlessly up and down the jetty  money he said at last resuming his wonted calm and lowering himself carefully to the box againmoney always gets left to the wrong people some of the kindestarted men ive ever known ave never had a hapenny left em while teetotaler arter teetotaler wot ive heard of ave come in for fortins  its ard lines though sometimes waiting for other peoples money i knew o one chap that waited over forty years for is grandmother to die and leave im her money and she died of catching cold at is funeral another chap i knew arter waiting years and years for is rich aunt to die was hung because she committed suicide  its always risky work waiting for other people to die and leave you money sometimes they dont die sometimes they marry agin and sometimes they leave it to other people instead  talking of marrying agin reminds me o something that appened to a young fellow i knew named alf simms being an orphan e was brought up by his uncle george hatchard a widowed man of about sixty alf used to go to sea off and on but more off than on his uncle aving quite a tidy bit of ouse property and it being understood that alf was to have it arter he ad gone his uncle used to like to ave him at ome and alf didnt like work so it suited both parties  i used to give alf a bit of advice sometimes sixty being a dangerous age for a man especially when he as been a widower for so long he as had time to forget wot being marrieds like but i must do alf the credit to say it wasnt wanted he ad got a very old ead on his shoulders and always picked the housekeeper imself to save the old man the trouble i saw two of em and i dare say i could ave seen more only i didnt want to  cleverness is a good thing in its way but theres such a thing as being too clever and the last ousekeeper young alf picked died of old age a week arter he ad gone to sea she passed away while she was drawing george hatchards supper beer and he lost ten gallons o the best bitter ale and his ousekeeper at the same time  it was four months arter that afore alf came ome and the fust sight of the new ousekeeper wot opened the door to im upset im terrible she was the right side o sixty to begin with and only ordinary plain then she was as clean as a new pin and dressed up as though she was going out to tea  oh youre alfred i spose she ses looking at im  mr simms is my name ses young alf starting and drawing hisself up  i know you by your portrait ses the ousekeeper come in ave you ad a pleasant vyge wipe your boots  alfred wiped is boots afore he thought of wot he was doing then he drew hisself up stiff agin and marched into the parlor  sit down ses the ousekeeper in a kind voice  alfred sat down afore he thought wot e was doing agin  i always like to see people comfortable ses the ousekeeper its my way its warm weather for the time o year aint it george is upstairs but hell be down in a minute  who ses alf hardly able to believe his ears  george ses the ousekeeper  george george who ses alfred very severe  why your uncle of course ses the ousekeeper do you think ive got a houseful of georges  young alf sat staring at her and couldnt say a word he noticed that the room ad been altered and that there was a big photygraph of her stuck up on the mantelpiece he sat there fidgeting with is feetuntil the ousekeeper looked at themand then e got up and walked upstairs  his uncle wot was sitting on his bed when e went into the room

when we was all sitting down at supper joe morgan and is missis being here and said as ow mrs pearces fust husband was alive and well  thats a very odd dream ses his uncle but wot was joe morgan and his missis in it for  witnesses ses alf  george hatchard fell over a footstool with surprise go on he ses rubbing his leg its a queer thing but i was going to ask the morgans ere to spend the evening next wednesday  or was it tuesday ses alf considering  i said tuesday ses his uncle looking over alfs ead so that he neednt see im wink agin wot was the end of your dream alf  the end of it was ses alf that you and mrs pearce was both very much upset as o course you couldnt marry while er fust was alive and the last thing i see afore i woke up was her boxes standing at the front door waiting for a cab  george hatchard was going to ask im more about it but just then mrs pearce came in with a pair of alfs socks that he ad been untidy enough to leave in the middle of the floor instead of chucking em under the bed she was so unpleasant about it that if it hadnt ha been for the thought of wot was going to appen on tuesday alf couldnt ha stood it  for the next day or two george hatchard was in such a state of nervousness and excitement that alf was afraid that the ousekeeper would notice it on tuesday morning he was trembling so much that she said hed got a chill and she told im to go to bed and shed make im a nice hot mustard poultice george was afraid to say no but while she was in the kitchen making the poultice he slipped out for a walk and cured is trembling with three whiskies alf nearly got the poultice instead she was so angry  she was unpleasant all dinnertime but she got better in the arternoon and when the morgans came in the evening and she found that mrs morgan ad got a nasty sort o red swelling on her nose she got quite good tempered she talked about it nearly all suppertime telling er what she ought to do to it and about a friend of hers that ad one and ad to turn teetotaler on account of it  my nose is good enough for me ses mrs morgan at last  it dont affect er appetite ses george hatchard trying to make things pleasant and thats the main thing  mrs morgan got up to go but arter george hatchard ad explained wot he didnt mean she sat down agin and began to talk to mrs pearce about er dress and ow beautifully it was made and she asked mrs pearce to give er the pattern of it because she should ave one like it herself when she was old enough i do like to see people dressed suitable she ses with a smile  i think you ought to ave a much deeper color than this ses mrs pearce considering  not when im faded ses mrs morgan  mrs pearce wot was filling er glass at the time spilt a lot of beer all over the tablecloth and she was so cross about it that she sat like a stone statue for pretty near ten minutes by the time supper was finished people was passing things to each other in whispers and when a bit o cheese went the wrong way with joe morgan he nearly suffocated imself for fear of making a noise  they ad a game o cards arter supper counting twenty nuts as a penny and everybody got more cheerful they was all laughing and talking and joe morgan was pretending to steal mrs pearces nuts when george hatchard held up his and  somebody at the street door i think he ses  young alf got up to open it and they eard a mans voice in the passage asking whether mrs pearce lived there and the next moment alf came into the room followed by bill flurry  heres a gentleman o the name o smith asking arter you he ses looking at mrs pearce  wot dyou want ses mrs pearce rather sharp  it is er ses bill stroking his long white beard and casting is eyes up at the ceiling you dont remember me mrs pearce but i used to see you years ago when you and poor charlie pearce was living down poplar way  well wot about it ses mrs pearce  im coming to it ses bill flurry ive been two months trying to find you so theres no need to be in a hurry for a minute or two besides what ive got to say ought to be broke gently in case you faint away with joy  rubbish ses mrs pearce i aint the fainting sort  i ope its nothing unpleasant ses george hatchard pouring im out a glass of whisky  quite the opposite ses bill its the best news shes eard for fifteen years  are you going to tell me wot you want or aint you ses mrs pearce  im coming to it ses bill six months ago i was in melbourne and one day i was strolling about looking in at the shopwinders when all at once i thought i see a face i knew it was a good bit older than when i see it

or else its charlie  go on ses george hatchard as was sitting with is fists clinched on the table and is eyes wide open staring at im  pearce ses bill flurry  you might ave heard a pin drop they all sat staring at im and then george hatchard took out is handkerchief and eld it up to is face  but he was drownded in the evening star ses joe morgan  bill flurry didnt answer im he poured out pretty near a tumbler of whisky and offered it to mrs pearce but she pushed it away and arter looking round in a elpless sort of way and shaking his ead once or twice he finished it up imself  it couldnt ave been im ses george hatchard speaking through is handkerchief i cant believe it its too cruel  i tell you it was im ses bill he floated off on a spar when the ship went down and was picked up two days arterwards by a bark and taken to new zealand he told me all about it and he told me if ever i saw is wife to give her is kind regards  kind regards ses joe morgan starting up why didnt he let is wife know e was alive  thats wot i said to im ses bill flurry but he said he ad is reasons  ah to be sure ses mrs morgan nodding why you and her cant be married now she ses turning to george hatchard  married ses bill flurry with a start as george hatchard gave a groan that surprised imself good gracious what a good job i found er  i spose you dont know where he is to be found now ses mrs pearce in a low voice turning to bill  i do not maam ses bill but i think youd find im somewhere in australia he keeps changing is name and shifting about but i dare say youd ave as good a chance of finding im as anybody  its a terrible blow to me ses george hatchard dabbing his eyes  i know it is ses mrs pearce but there you men are all alike i dare say if this hadnt turned up youd ha found something else  oh ow can you talk like that ses george hatchard very reproachful its the only thing in the world that could ave prevented our getting married im surprised at you  well thats all right then ses mrs pearce and well get married after all  but you cant ses alf  its bigamy ses joe morgan  youd get six months ses his wife  dont you worry dear ses mrs pearce nodding at george hatchard that mans made a mistake  mistake ses bill flurry why i tell you i talked to im it was charlie pearce right enough scar on is forehead and a wart on is left ear and all  its wonderful ses mrs pearce i cant think where you got it all from  got it all from ses bill staring at her why from im  oh of course ses mrs pearce i didnt think of that but that only makes it the more wonderful doesnt itbecause you see he didnt go on the evening star  wot ses george hatchard why you told me yourself  i know i did ses mrs pearce but that was only just to spare your feelings charlie was going to sea in her but he was prevented  prevented ses two or three of em  yes ses mrs pearce the night afore he was to ave sailed there was some silly mistake over a diamond ring and he got five years he gave a different name at the policestation and naturally everybody thought e went down with the ship and when he died in prison i didnt undeceive em  she took out her andkerchief and while she was busy with it bill flurry got up and went out on tiptoe young alf got up a second or two arterwards to see where hed gone and the last joe morgan and his missis see of the happy couple they was sitting on one chair and george hatchard was making desprit and artrending attempts to smile     illustration a distant relative     a distant relative   mr potter had just taken ethel spriggs into the kitchen to say good by in the small front room mr spriggs with his fingers already fumbling at the linen collar of ceremony waited impatiently  they get longer and longer over their goodbys he complained  its only natural said mrs spriggs looking up from a piece of fine sewing dont you remember  no i dont said her husband doggedly i know that your pore father never ad to put on a collar for me and mind you i wont wear one after theyre married not if you all went on your bended knees and asked me to  he composed his face as the door opened and nodded goodnight to the rather overdressed young man who came through the room with his daughter  the latter opened the frontdoor and passing out with mr potter held it slightly open a penetrating draught played upon the exasperated mr spriggs he coughed loudly  your fathers got a cold said mr potter in a concerned voice  no its only too much smoking said the girl hes smoking all day long  the indignant mr spriggs coughed again but the young people had found a new subject of conversation it ended some minutes later in a playful scuffle during which the door acted the part of a ventilating fan  its only for another fortnight said mrs spriggs hastily as her husband rose  after theyre spliced said the vindictive mr spriggs resuming his seat ill go round and ill play about with their frontdoor till  he broke off abruptly as his daughter darting into the room closed the door with a bang that nearly extinguished the lamp and turned the key before her flushed and laughing face mr spriggs held his peace  whats the matter she asked eying him what are you looking like that for  too much draughtfor your mother said mr spriggs feebly im afraid of her asthma agin  he fell to work on the collar once more and escaping at last from the clutches of that enemy laid it on the table and unlaced his boots an attempt to remove his coat was promptly frustrated by his daughter  youll get doing it when you come round to see us she explained  mr spriggs sighed and lighting a short clay pipeforbidden in the presence of his future soninlawfell to watching mother and daughter as they gloated over dress materials and discussed doublewidths  anybody who cant be appy with her he said half an hour later as his daughter slapped his head by way of bidding him goodnight and retired dont deserve to be appy  i wish it was over whispered his wife shell break her heart if anything happens andand gussie will be out now in a day or two  a gal cant elp what her uncle does said mr spriggs fiercely if alfred throws her over for that hes no man  pride is his great fault said his wife mournfully  its no good taking up troubles afore they come observed mr spriggs praps gussie wont come ere  hell come straight here said his wife with conviction hell come straight here and try and make a fuss of me same as he used to do when we was children and id got a hapenny i know him  cheer up old gal said mr spriggs if he does we must try and get rid of im and if he wont go we must tell alfred that hes been to australia same as we did ethel  his wife smiled faintly  thats the ticket continued mr spriggs for one thing i bleeve hell be ashamed to show his face here but if he does hes come back from australia see itll make it nicer for im too you dont suppose he wants to boast of where hes been  and suppose he comes while alfred is here said his wife  then i say how ave you left em all in australia and wink at him said the ready mr spriggs  and spose youre not here objected his wife  then you say it and wink at him was the reply no i know you cant he added hastily as mrs spriggs raised another objection youve been too well brought up still you can try  it was a slight comfort to mrs spriggs that mr augustus price did after all choose a convenient time for his reappearance a faint knock sounded on the door two days afterwards as she sat at tea with her husband and an anxious face with somewhat furtive eyes was thrust into the room  emma said a mournful voice as the upper part of the intruders body followed the face  gussie said mrs spriggs rising in disorder  mr price drew his legs into the room and closing the door with extraordinary care passed the cuff of his coat across his eyes and surveyed them tenderly  ive come home to die he said slowly and tottering across the room embraced his sister with much unction  what are you going to die of inquired mr spriggs reluctantly accepting the extended hand  broken art george replied his brotherinlaw sinking into a chair  mr spriggs grunted and moving his chair a little farther away watched the intruder as his wife handed him a plate a troubled glance from his wife reminded him of their arrangements for the occasion and he cleared his throat several times in vain attempts to begin  im sorry that we cant ask you to stay with us gussie specially as youre so ill he said at last but praps youll be better after picking a bit  mr price who was about to take a slice of bread and butter refrained and closing his eyes uttered a faint moan i shant last the night he muttered  thats just it said mr spriggs eagerly you see ethel is going to be married in a fortnight and if you died here that would put it off  i might last longer if i was took care of said the other opening his eyes  and besides ethel dont know where youve been continued mr spriggs we told er that you had gone to australia shes going to marry a very partikler young chapa grocerand if he found it out it might be awkard  mr price closed his eyes again but the lids quivered  it took im some time to get over me being a bricklayer pursued mr spriggs what hed say to you  tell im ive come back from australia if you like said mr price faintly i dont mind  mr spriggs cleared his throat again but you see we told ethel as you was doing well out there he said with an embarrassed laugh and girllike and alfred talking a good deal about his relations she shes made the most of it  it dont matter said the complaisant mr price you say what you like i shant interfere with you  but you see you dont look as though youve been making money said his sister impatiently look at your clothes  mr price held up his hand thats easy got over he remarked while im having a bit of tea george can go out and buy me some new ones you get what you think i should look richest in georgea black tailcoat would be best i should think but i leave it to you a bit of a fancy waistcoat praps lightish trousers and a pair o nice boots easy sevens  he sat upright in his chair and ignoring the look of consternation that passed between husband and wife poured himself out a cup of tea and took a slice of cake  have you got any money said mr spriggs after a long pause  i left it behind mein australia said mr price with illtimed facetiousness  getting better aint you said his brotherinlaw sharply hows that broken art getting on  itll go all right under a fancy waistcoat was the reply and while youre about it george youd better get me a scarfpin and if you could run to a gold watch and chain  he was interrupted by a frenzied outburst from mr spriggs a somewhat incoherent summary of mr prices past coupled with unlawful and heathenish hopes for his future  youre wasting time said mr price calmly as he paused for breath dont get em if you dont want to im trying to help you thats all i dont mind anybody knowing where ive been i was innercent if you will give way to sinful pride you must pay for it  mr spriggs by a great effort regained his selfcontrol will you go away if i give you a quid he asked quietly  no said mr price with a placid smile ive got a better idea of the value of money than that besides i want to see my dear niece and see whether that young mans good enough for her  two quid suggested his brotherinlaw  mr price shook his head i couldnt do it he said calmly in justice to myself i couldnt do it youll be feeling lonely when you lose ethel and ill stay and keep you company  the bricklayer nearly broke out again but obeying a glance from his wife closed his lips and followed her obediently upstairs mr price filling his pipe from a paper of tobacco on the mantelpiece winked at himself encouragingly in the glass and smiled gently as he heard the chinking of coins upstairs  be careful about the size he said as mr spriggs came down and took his hat from a nail about a couple of inches shorter than yourself and not near so much round the waist  mr spriggs regarded him sternly for a few seconds and then closing the door with a bang went off down the street left alone mr price strolled about the room investigating and then drawing an easychair up to the fire put his feet on the fender and relapsed into thought  two hours later he sat in the same place a changed and resplendent being his thin legs were hidden in light check trousers and the companion waistcoat to josephs coat graced the upper part of his body a large chrysanthemum in the buttonhole of his frockcoat completed the picture of an australian millionaire as understood by mr spriggs  a nice watch and chain and a little money in my pockets and i shall be all right murmured mr price  you wont get any more out o me said mr spriggs fiercely ive spent every farthing ive got  except whats in the bank said his brotherinlaw itll take you a day or two to get at it i know spose we say saturday for the watch and chain  mr spriggs looked helplessly at his wife but she avoided his gaze he turned and gazed in a fascinated fashion at mr price and received a cheerful nod in return  ill come with you and help choose it said the latter itll save you trouble if it dont save your pocket  he thrust his hands in his trouserpockets and spreading his legs wide apart tilted his head back and blew smoke to the ceiling he was in the same easy position when ethel arrived home accompanied by mr potter  itsits your uncle gussie said mrs spriggs as the girl stood eying the visitor  from australia said her husband thickly  mr price smiled and his niece noticing that he removed his pipe and wiped his lips with the back of his hand crossed over and kissed his eyebrow mr potter was then introduced and received a gracious reception mr price commenting on the extraordinary likeness he bore to a young friend of his who had just come in for forty thousand a year  thats nearly as much as youre worth uncle isnt it inquired miss spriggs daringly  mr price shook his head at her and pondered rather more he said at last rather more  illustration mr potter was then introduced and received a gracious reception  mr potter caught his breath sharply mr spriggs who was stooping to get a light for his pipe nearly fell into the fire there was an impressive silence  money isnt everything said mr price looking round and shaking his head its not much good except to give away  his eye roved round the room and came to rest finally upon mr potter the young man noticed with a thrill that it beamed with benevolence  fancy coming over without saying a word to anybody and taking us all by surprise like this said ethel  i felt i must see you all once more before i died said her uncle simply just a flying visit i meant it to be but your father and mother wont hear of my going back just yet  of course not said ethel who was helping the silent mrs spriggs to lay supper  when i talked of going your father eld me down in my chair continued the veracious mr price  quite right too said the girl now draw your chair up and have some supper and tell us all about australia  mr price drew his chair up but as to talking about australia he said ungratefully that he was sick of the name of the place and preferred instead to discuss the past and future of mr potter he learned among other things that that gentleman was of a careful and thrifty disposition and that his savings augmented by a lucky legacy amounted to a hundred and ten pounds  alfred is going to stay with palmer and mays for another year and then we shall take a business of our own said ethel  quite right said mr price i like to see young people make their own way he added meaningly its good for em  it was plain to all that he had taken a great fancy to mr potter he discussed the grocery trade with the air of a rich man seeking a good investment and threw out dark hints about returning to england after a final visit to australia and settling down in the bosom of his family he accepted a cigar from mr potter after supper and when the young man leftat an unusually late hourwalked home with him  it was the first of several pleasant evenings and mr price who had bought a book dealing with australia from a secondhand bookstall no longer denied them an account of his adventures there a gold watch and chain which had made a serious hole in his brotherinlaws savings bank account lent an air of substance to his waistcoat and a pin of excellent paste sparkled in his necktie under the influence of good food and home comforts he improved every day and the unfortunate mr spriggs was at his wits end to resist further encroachments from the second day of their acquaintance he called mr potter alf and the young people listened with great attention to his discourse on money how to make it and how to keep it  his own dealings with mr spriggs afforded an example which he did not quote beginning with shillings he led up to halfcrowns and encouraged by success one afternoon boldly demanded a halfsovereign to buy a weddingpresent with mrs spriggs drew her overwrought husband into the kitchen and argued with him in whispers  give him what he wants till theyre married she entreated after that alfred cant help himself and itll be as much to his interest to keep quiet as anybody else  mr spriggs who had been a careful man all his life found the half sovereign and a few new names which he bestowed upon mr price at the same time the latter listened unmoved in fact a bright eye and a pleasant smile seemed to indicate that he regarded them rather in the nature of compliments than otherwise  i telegraphed over to australia this morning he said as they all sat at supper that evening  illustration a gold watch and chain lent an air of substance to his waistcoat  about my money said mr potter eagerly  mr price frowned at him swiftly no telling my head clerk to send over a weddingpresent for you he said his face softening under the eye of mr spriggs ive got just the thing for you there i cant see anything good enough over here  the young couple were warm in their thanks  what did you mean about your money inquired mr spriggs turning to his future soninlaw  nothing said the young man evasively  its a secret said mr price  what about persisted mr spriggs raising his voice  its a little private business between me and uncle gussie said mr potter somewhat stiffly  youyou havent been lending him money stammered the bricklayer  dont be silly father said miss spriggs sharply what good would alfreds little bit o money be to uncle gussie if you must know alfred is drawing it out for uncle to invest it for him  the eyes of mr and mrs spriggs and mr price engaged in a triangular duel the latter spoke first  im putting it into my business for him he said with a threatening glance in australia  and he didnt want his generosity known added mr potter  the bewildered mr spriggs looked helplessly round the table his wifes foot pressed his and like a mechanical toy his lips snapped together  i didnt know you had got your money handy said mrs spriggs in trembling tones  i made special application and im to have it on friday said mr potter with a smile you dont get a chance like that every day  he filled uncle gussies glass for him and that gentleman at once raised it and proposed the health of the young couple if anything was to appen to break it off now he said with a swift glance at his sister theyd be miserable for life i can see that  miserable for ever assented mr potter in a sepulchral voice as he squeezed the hand of miss spriggs under the table  its the only thing worth avinglove continued mr price watching his brotherinlaw out of the corner of his eye money is nothing  mr spriggs emptied his glass and knitting his brows drew patterns on the cloth with the back of his knife his wifes foot was still pressing on his and he waited for instructions  for once however mrs spriggs had none to give even when mr potter had gone and ethel had retired upstairs she was still voiceless she sat for some time looking at the fire and stealing an occasional glance at uncle gussie as he smoked a cigar then she arose and bent over her husband  do what you think best she said in a weary voice goodnight  what about that money of young alfreds demanded mr spriggs as the door closed behind her  im going to put it in my business said uncle gussie blandly my business in australia  ho youve got to talk to me about that first said the other  his brotherinlaw leaned back and smoked with placid enjoyment you do what you like he said easily of course if you tell alfred i shant get the money and ethel wont get im besides that hell find out what lies youve been telling  i wonder you can look me in the face said the raging bricklayer  and i should give him to understand that you were going shares in the hundred and ten pounds and then thought better of it said the unmoved mr price hes the sort o young chap asll believe anything bless im  mr spriggs bounced up from his chair and stood over him with his fists clinched mr price glared defiance  if youre so partikler you can make it up to him he said slowly youve been a saving man i know and emma ad a bit left her that i ought to have ad when youve done playacting ill go to bed so long  he got up yawning and walked to the door and mr spriggs after a momentary idea of breaking him in pieces and throwing him out into the street blew out the lamp and went upstairs to discuss the matter with his wife until morning  mr spriggs left for his work next day with the question still undecided but a pretty strong conviction that mr price would have to have his way the wedding was only five days off and the house was in a bustle of preparation a certain gloom which he could not shake off he attributed to a raging toothache turning a deaf ear to the various remedies suggested by uncle gussie and the name of an excellent dentist who had broken a tooth of mr potters three times before extracting it  uncle gussie he treated with bare civility in public and to blood curdling threats in private mr price ascribing the latter to the toothache also varied his treatment to his company prescribing whisky held in the mouth and other agreeable remedies when there were listeners and recommending him to fill his mouth with cold water and sit on the fire till it boiled when they were alone  he was at his worst on thursday morning on thursday afternoon he came home a bright and contented man he hung his cap on the nail with a flourish kissed his wife and in full view of the disapproving mr price executed a few clumsy steps on the hearthrug  come in for a fortune inquired the latter eying him sourly  no ive saved one replied mr spriggs gayly i wonder i didnt think of it myself  think of what inquired mr price  youll soon know said mr spriggs and youve only got yourself to thank for it  uncle gussie sniffed suspiciously mrs spriggs pressed for particulars  ive got out of the difficulty said her husband drawing his chair to the teatable nobodyll suffer but gussie  ho said that gentleman sharply  i took the day off said mr spriggs smiling contentedly at his wife and went to see a friend of mine bill white the policeman and told him about gussie  mr price stiffened in his chair  actingunderhisadvice said mr spriggs sipping his tea i wrote to scotland yard and told em that augustus price ticketofleave man was trying to obtain a hundred and ten pounds by false pretences  mr price white and breathless rose and confronted him  the beauty o that is as bill says continued mr spriggs with much enjoyment that gussiell ave to set out on his travels again hell have to go into hiding because if they catch him hell ave to finish his time and bill says if he writes letters to any of us itll only make it easier to find him youd better take the first train to australia gussie  whatwhat time did you postthe letter inquired uncle gussie jerkily  bout two oclock said mr spriggs glaring at the clock i reckon youve just got time  mr price stepped swiftly to the small sideboard and taking up his hat clapped it on he paused a moment at the door to glance up and down the street and then the door closed softly behind him mrs spriggs looked at her husband  called away to australia by special telegram said the latter winking bill white is a trump thats what he is  oh george said his wife did you really write that letter  mr spriggs winked again     illustration the test     the test   pebblesea was dull and mr frederick dix mate of the ketch starfish after a long and unsuccessful quest for amusement returned to the harbor with an idea of forgetting his disappointment in sleep the few shops in the high street were closed and the only entertainment offered at the taverns was contained in glass and pewter the attitude of the landlord of the pilots hope where mr dix had sought to enliven the proceedings by a song and dance still rankled in his memory  the skipper and the hands were still ashore and the ketch looked so lonely that the mate thinking better of his idea of retiring thrust his hands deep in his pockets and sauntered round the harbor it was nearly dark and the only other man visible stood at the edge of the quay gazing at the water he stood for so long that the mates easily aroused curiosity awoke and after twice passing he edged up to him and ventured a remark on the fineness of the night  the nights all right said the young man gloomily  youre rather near the edge said the mate after a pause  i like being near the edge was the reply  mr dix whistled softly and glancing up at the tall whitefaced young man before him pushed his cap back and scratched his head  aint got anything on your mind have you he inquired  the young man groaned and turned away and the mate scenting a little excitement took him gently by the coatsleeve and led him from the brink sympathy begets confidence and within the next ten minutes he had learned that arthur heard rejected by emma smith was contemplating the awful crime of selfdestruction  why ive known er for seven years said mr heard seven years and this is the end of it  the mate shook his head  i told er i was coming straight away to drownd myself pursued mr heard my last words to er was when you see my bloated corpse youll be sorry  i expect shell cry and carry on like anything said the mate politely  the other turned and regarded him why you dont think im going to do you he inquired sharply why i wouldnt drownd myself for fifty blooming gells  but what did you tell her you were going to for then demanded the puzzled mate  cos i thought it would upset er and make er give way said the other bitterly and all it done was to make er laugh as though shed ave a fit  it would serve her jolly well right if you did drown yourself said mr dix judiciously it ud spoil her life for her  ah and it wouldnt spoil mine i spose rejoined mr heard with ferocious sarcasm  how she will laugh when she sees you tomorrow mused the mate is she the sort of girl that would spread it about  mr heard said that she was and forgetting for a moment his great love referred to her partiality for gossip in the most scathing terms he could muster the mate averse to such a tame ending to a promising adventure eyed him thoughtfully  why not just go in and out again he said seductively and run to her house all dripping wet  that would be clever wouldnt it said the ungracious mr heard starting to commit suicide and then thinking better of it why i should be a bigger laughingstock than ever  but suppose i saved you against your will breathed the tempter how would that be  it would be all right if i cared to run the risk said the other but i dont i should look well struggling in the water while you was diving in the wrong places for me shouldnt i  i wasnt thinking of such a thing said mr dix hastily twenty strokes is about my markwith my clothes off my idea was to pull you out  mr heard glanced at the black water a dozen feet below how he inquired shortly  not here said the mate come to the end of the quay where the ground slopes to the water its shallow there and you can tell her that you jumped in off here she wont know the difference  with an enthusiasm which mr heard made no attempt to share he led the way to the place indicated and dilating upon its manifold advantages urged him to go in at once and get it over  you couldnt have a better night for it he said briskly why it makes me feel like a dip myself to look at it  mr heard gave a surly grunt and after testing the temperature of the water with his hand slowly and reluctantly immersed one foot then with sudden resolution he waded in and ducking his head stood up gasping  give yourself a good soaking while youre about it said the delighted mate  mr heard ducked again and once more emerging stumbled towards the bank  pull me out he cried sharply  mr dix smiling indulgently extended his hands which mr heard seized with the proverbial grasp of a drowning man  all right take it easy dont get excited said the smiling mate four foot of water wont hurt anyone ifhere let go o me dye hear let go if you dont let go ill punch your head  you couldnt save me against my will without coming in said mr heard now we can tell er you dived in off the quay and got me just as i was sinking for the last time youll be a hero  the mates remarks about heroes were mercifully cut short he was three stone lighter than mr heard and standing on shelving ground the latters victory was so sudden that he overbalanced and only a commotion at the surface of the water showed where they had disappeared mr heard was first up and out but almost immediately the figure of the mate who had gone under with his mouth open emerged from the water and crawled ashore  youwaittill iget my breath back he gasped  theres no illfeeling i ope said mr heard anxiously ill tell everybody of your bravery dont spoil everything for the sake of a little temper  mr dix stood up and clinched his fists but at the spectacle of the dripping forlorn figure before him his wrath vanished and he broke into a hearty laugh  come on mate he said clapping him on the back now lets go and find emma if she dont fall in love with you now she never will my eye you are a picture  he began to walk towards the town and mr heard with his legs wide apart and his arms held stiffly from his body waddled along beside him two little streamlets followed  they walked along the quay in silence and had nearly reached the end of it when the figure of a man turned the corner of the houses and advanced at a shambling trot towards them  old smith said mr heard in a hasty whisper now be careful hold me tight  the newcomer thankfully dropped into a walk as he saw them and came to a standstill with a cry of astonishment as the light of a neighboring lamp revealed their miserable condition  wot arthur he exclaimed  halloa said mr heard drearily  the idea o your being so sinful said mr smith severely emma told me wot you said but i never thought as youd got the pluck to go and do it im surprised at you  i aint done it said mr heard in a sullen voice nobody can drownd themselves in comfort with a lot of interfering people about  mr smith turned and gazed at the mate and a broad beam of admiration shone in his face as he grasped that gentlemans hand  come into the ouse both of you and get some dry clothes he said warmly  he thrust his strong thickset figure between them and with a hand on each coatcollar propelled them in the direction of home the mate muttered something about going back to his ship but mr smith refused to listen and stopping at the door of a neat cottage turned the handle and thrust his dripping charges over the threshold of a comfortable sittingroom  a pleasantfaced woman of middle age and a pretty girl of twenty rose at their entrance and a faint scream fell pleasantly upon the ears of mr heard  here he is bawled mr smith just saved at the last moment  what two of them exclaimed miss smith with a faint note of gratification in her voice her gaze fell on the mate and she smiled approvingly  no this one jumped in and saved im said her father  oh arthur said miss smith how could you be so wicked i never dreamt youd go and do such a thingnever i didnt think youd got it in you  mr heard grinned sheepishly i told you i would he muttered  dont stand talking here said mrs smith gazing at the puddle which was growing in the centre of the carpet theyll catch cold take em upstairs and give em some dry clothes and ill bring some hot whisky and water up to em  rum is best said mr smith herding his charges and driving them up the small staircase send young joe for some send up three glasses they disappeared upstairs and joe appearing at that moment from the kitchen was hastily sent off to the blue jay for the rum a couple of curious neighbors helped him to carry it back and standing modestly just inside the door ventured on a few skilled directions as to its preparation after which with an eye on miss smith they stood and conversed mostly in headshakes  stimulated by the rum and the energetic mr smith the men were not long in changing preceded by their host they came down to the sittingroom again mr heard with as desperate and unrepentant an air as he could assume and mr dix trying to conceal his uneasiness by taking great interest in a suit of clothes three sizes too large for him  they was both as near drownded as could be said mr smith looking round he ses arthur fought like a madman to prevent imself from being saved  it was nothing really said the mate in an almost inaudible voice as he met miss smiths admiring gaze  listen to im said the delighted mr smith all brave men are like that thats wots made us englishmen wot we are  i dont suppose he knew who it was he was saving said a voice from the door  i didnt want to be saved said mr heard defiantly  well you can easy do it again arthur said the same voice the dock wont run away  mr heard started and eyed the speaker with same malevolence  tell us all about it said miss smith gazing at the mate with her hands clasped did you see him jump in  mr dix shook his head and looked at mr heard for guidance nnot exactly he stammered i was just taking a stroll round the harbor before turning in when all of a sudden i heard a cry for help  no you didnt broke in mr heard fiercely  well it sounded like it said the mate somewhat taken aback  i dont care what it sounded like said the other i didnt say it it was the last thing i should ave called out i didnt want to be saved  praps he cried emma said the voice from the door  might ha been that admitted the mate well when i heard it i ran to the edge and looked down at the water and at first i couldnt see anything then i saw what i took to be a dog but knowing that dogs cant cry help  emma corrected mr heard  emma said the mate i just put my hands up and dived in when i came to the surface i struck out for him and tried to seize him from behind but before i could do so he put his arms round my neck likelike  like as if it was emmas suggested the voice by the door  miss smith rose with majestic dignity and confronted the speaker and who asked you in here george harris she inquired coldly  i see the door open stammered mr harrisi see the door open and i thought  if you look again youll see the handle said miss smith  mr harris looked and opening the door with extreme care melted slowly from a gaze too terrible for human endurance  we went down like a stone continued the mate as miss smith resumed her seat and smiled at him when we came up he tried to get away again i think we went down again a few more times but i aint sure then we crawled out leastways i did and pulled him after me  he might have drowned you said miss smith with a severe glance at her unfortunate admirer and its my belief that he tumbled in after all and when you thought he was struggling to get away he was struggling to be saved thats more like him  well theyre all right now said mr smith as mr heard broke in with some vehemence and this chaps going to ave the royal societys medal for it or ill know the reason why  no no said the mate hurriedly i wouldnt take it i couldnt think of it  take it or leave it said mr smith but im going to the police to try and get it for you i know the inspector a bit  i cant take it said the horrified mate ititbesides dont you see if this isnt kept quiet mr heard will be locked up for trying to commit suicide  so he would be said the other man from his post by the door hes quite right  and id sooner lose fifty medals said mr dix whats the good of me saving him for that  a murmur of admiration at the mates extraordinary nobility of character jarred harshly on the ears of mr heard most persistent of all was the voice of miss smith and hardly able to endure things quietly he sat and watched the tender glances which passed between her and mr dix miss smith conscious at last of his regards turned and looked at him  you could say you tumbled in arthur and then he would get the medal she said softly  say shouted the overwrought mr heard say i tum  words failed him he stood swaying and regarding the company for a moment and then flinging open the door closed it behind him with a bang that made the house tremble  the mate followed half an hour later escorted to the ship by the entire smith family fortified by the presence of miss smith he pointed out the exact scene of the rescue without a tremor and when her father narrated the affair to the skipper whom they found sitting on deck smoking a last pipe listened undismayed to that astonished mariners comments  news of the mates heroic conduct became general the next day and work on the ketch was somewhat impeded in consequence it became a point of honor with mr heards fellowtownsmen to allude to the affair as an accident but the romantic nature of the transaction was well understood and full credit given to mr dix for his selfdenial in the matter of the medal small boys followed him in the street and half pebblesea knew when he paid a visit to the smiths and discussed his chances two nights afterwards when he and miss smith went for a walk in the loneliest spot they could find conversation turned almost entirely upon the overcrowded condition of the british isles  the starfish was away for three weeks but the little town no longer looked dull to the mate as she entered the harbor one evening and glided slowly towards her old berth emma smith was waiting to see the ship come in and his taste for all other amusements had temporarily disappeared  for two or three days the course of true love ran perfectly smooth then like a dark shadow the figure of arthur heard was thrown across its path it haunted the quay hung about the house and cropped up unexpectedly in the most distant solitudes it came up behind the mate one evening just as he left the ship and walked beside him in silence  halloa said the mate at last  halloa said mr heard going to see emma  im going to see miss smith said the mate  mr heard laughed a forced mirthless laugh  and we dont want you following us about said mr dix sharply if itll ease your mind and do you any good to know you never had a chance she told me so  i shant follow you said mr heard its your last evening so youd better make the most of it  he turned on his heel and the mate pondering on his last words went thoughtfully on to the house  illustration and we dont want you following us about said mr dix sharply  amid the distraction of pleasant society and a long walk the matter passed from his mind and he only remembered it at nine oclock that evening as a knock sounded on the door and the sallow face of mr heard was thrust into the room  goodevening all said the intruder  evening arthur said mr smith affably  mr heard with a melancholy countenance entered the room and closed the door gently behind him then he coughed slightly and shook his head  anything the matter arthur inquired mr smith somewhat disturbed by these manifestations  ive got something on my mind said mr heard with a diabolical glance at the matesomething wots been worrying me for a long time ive been deceiving you  that was always your failing arthurdeceitfulness said mrs smith i remember  weve both been deceiving you interrupted mr heard loudly i didnt jump into the harbor the other night and i didnt tumble in and mr fred dix didnt jump in after me we just went to the end of the harbor and walked in and wetted ourselves  there was a moments intense silence and all eyes turned on the mate the latter met them boldly  its a habit o mine to walk into the water and spoil my clothes for the sake of people ive never met before he said with a laugh  for shame arthur said mr smith with a huge sigh of relief  ow can you said mrs smith  arthurs been asleep since then said the mate still smiling all the same the next time he jumps in he can get out by himself  mr heard raising his voice entered into a minute description of the affair but in vain mr smith rising to his feet denounced his ingratitude in language which was seldom allowed to pass unchallenged in the presence of his wife while that lady contributed examples of deceitfulness in the past of mr heard which he strove in vain to refute meanwhile her daughter patted the mates hand  its a bit too thin arthur said the latter with a mocking smile try something better next time  very well said mr heard in quieter tones i dare you to come along to the harbor and jump in just as you are where you said you jumped in after me theyll soon see whos telling the truth  hell do that said mr smith with conviction  for a fraction of a second mr dix hesitated then with a steady glance at miss smith he sprang to his feet and accepted the challenge mrs smith besought him not to be foolish and with a vague idea of dissuading him told him a slanderous anecdote concerning mr heards aunt her daughter gazed at the mate with proud confidence and taking his arm bade her mother to get some dry clothes ready and led the way to the harbor  the night was fine but dark and a chill breeze blew up from the sea twice the hapless mate thought of backing out but a glance at miss smiths profile and the tender pressure of her arm deterred him the tide was running out and he had a faint hope that he might keep afloat long enough to be washed ashore alive he talked rapidly and his laugh rang across the water arrived at the spot they stopped and miss smith looking down into the darkness was unable to repress a shiver  be careful fred she said laying her hand upon his arm  the mate looked at her oddly all right he said gayly ill be out almost before im in you run back to the house and help your mother get the dry clothes ready for me  his tones were so confident and his laugh so buoyant that mr heard who had been fully expecting him to withdraw from the affair began to feel that he had underrated his swimming powers just jumping in and swimming out again is not quite the same as saving a drownding man he said with a sneer  in a flash the mate saw a chance of escape  why theres no satisfying you he said slowly if i do go in i can see that you wont own up that youve been lying  hell ave to said mr smith who having made up his mind for a little excitement was in no mind to lose it  i dont believe he would said the mate look here he said suddenly as he laid an affectionate arm on the old mans shoulder i know what well do  well said mr smith  ill save you said the mate with a smile of great relief  save me said the puzzled mr smith as his daughter uttered a faint cry how  just as i saved him said the other nodding you jump in and after youve sunk twicesame as he didill dive in and save you at any rate ill do my best i promise you i wont come ashore without you  mr smith hastily flung off the encircling arm and retired a few paces inland ave youever beenin a lunatic asylum at any time he inquired as soon as he could speak  no said the mate gravely  neither ave i said mr smith and whats more im not going  he took a deep breath and stood simmering miss smith came forward and with a smothered giggle took the mates arm and squeezed it  itll have to be arthur again then said the latter in a resigned voice  me cried mr heard with a start  yes you said the mate in a decided voice after what you said just now im not going in without saving somebody it would be no good come on in you go  he couldnt speak fairer than that arthur said mr smith dispassionately as he came forward again  but i tell you he cant swim protested mr heard not properly he didnt swim last time i told you so  never mind we know what you said retorted the mate all youve got to do is to jump in and ill follow and save yousame as i did the other night  go on arthur said mr smith encouragingly it aint cold  i tell you he cant swim repeated mr heard passionately i should be drownded before your eyes  illustration i tell you he cant swim repeated mr heard passionately  rubbish said mr smith why i believe youre afraid  i should be drownded i tell you said mr heard he wouldnt come in after me  yes he would said mr smith passing a muscular arm round the mates waist cos the moment youre overboard ill drop im in are you ready  he stood embracing the mate and waiting but mr heard with an infuriated exclamation walked away a parting glance showed him that the old man had released the mate and that the latter was now embracing miss smith     illustration in the family     in the family   the oldest inhabitant of claybury sat beneath the sign of the cauliflower and gazed with affectionate but dim old eyes in the direction of the village street  no claybury men aint never been much of ones for emigrating he said turning to the youthful traveller who was resting in the shade with a mug of ale and a cigarette they know theyd ave to go a long way afore theyd find a place as ud come up to this  he finished the tablespoonful of beer in his mug and sat for so long with his head back and the inverted vessel on his face that the traveller who at first thought it was the beginning of a conjuring trick colored furiously and asked permission to refill it  now and then a claybury man has gone to foreign parts said the old man drinking from the replenished mug and placing it where the traveller could mark progress without undue strain but theyve generally speaking come back and wished as theyd never gone  the ony man as i ever heard of that made his fortune by emigrating was henery walkers greatuncle josiah walker by name and he wasnt a claybury man at all he made his fortune out o sheep in australey and he was so rich and welltodo that he could never find time to answer the letters that henery walker used to send him when he was hard up  henery walker used to hear of im through a relation of his up in london and tell us all about im and his money up at this here cauliflower publichouse and he used to sit and drink his beer and wonder who would ave the old mans money arter he was dead  when the relation in london died henery walker left off hearing about his uncle and he got so worried over thinking that the old man might die and leave his money to strangers that he got quite thin he talked of emigrating to australey imself and then acting on the advice of bill chamberswho said it was a cheaper thing to dohe wrote to his uncle instead and arter reminding im that e was an old man living in a strange country e asked im to come to claybury and make his ome with is loving grandnephew  it was a good letter because more than one gave im a hand with it and there was little bits o scripture in it to make it more solemnlike it was wrote on pink paper with piecrust edges and put in a green envelope and bill chambers said a man must ave a art of stone if that didnt touch it  four months arterwards henery walker got an answer to is letter from is greatuncle it was a nice letter and arter thanking henery walker for all his kindness is uncle said that he was getting an old man and praps he should come and lay is bones in england arter all and if he did e should certainly come and see his grandnephew henery walker  most of us thought henery walkers fortune was as good as made but bob pretty a nasty low poaching chap that has done wot he could to give claybury a bad name turned up his nose at it  ill believe hes coming ome when i see him he ses its my belief he went to australey to get out o your way henery  as it appened he went there afore i was born ses henery walker firing up  he knew your father ses bob pretty and he didnt want to take no risks  they ad words then and arter that every time bob pretty met im he asked arter his greatuncles ealth and used to pretend to think e was living with im  you ought to get the old gentleman out a bit more henery he would say it cant be good for im to be shut up in the ouse so much especially your ouse  henery walker used to get that riled he didnt know wot to do with imself and as time went on and he began to be afraid that is uncle never would come back to england he used to get quite nasty if anybody ony so much as used the word uncle in is company  it was over six months since he ad had the letter from is uncle and e was up here at the cauliflower with some more of us one night when dicky weed the tailor turns to bob pretty and he ses whos the old gentleman thats staying with you bob  bob pretty puts down is beer very careful and turns round on im  old gentleman he ses very slow wot are you talking about  i mean the little old gentleman with white whiskers and a squeaky voice ses dicky weed  youve been dreaming ses bob taking up is beer agin  i see im too bob ses bill chambers  ho you did did you ses bob pretty putting down is mug with a bang and wot dye mean by coming spying round my place eh wot dye mean by it  spying ses bill chambers gaping at im with is mouth open i wasnt spying anyone ud think you ad done something you was ashamed of  you mind your business and ill mind mine ses bob very fierce  i was passing the ouse ses bill chambers looking round at us and i see an old mans face at the bedroom winder and while i was wondering who e was a hand come and drawed im away i see im as plain as ever i see anything in my life and the hand too big and dirty it was  and hes got a cough ses dicky weeda churchyard coughi eard it  it aint much you dont hear dicky ses bob pretty turning on im the ony thing you never did ear and never will ear is any good of yourself  he kicked over a chair wot was in is way and went off in such a temper as wed never seen im in afore and wot was more surprising still but i know its true cos i drunk it up myself hed left over arf a pint o beer in is mug  hes up to something ses sam jones starting arter him mark my words  we couldnt make head nor tail out of it but for some days arterward youd ha thought that bob prettys ouse was a peepshow everybody stared at the winders as they went by and the children played in front of the ouse and stared in all day long then the old gentleman was seen one day as bold as brass sitting at the winder and we heard that it was a pore old tramp bob pretty ad met on the road and given a home to and he didnt like is goodartedness to be known for fear he should be made fun of  nobody believed that o course and things got more puzzling than ever once or twice the old gentleman went out for a walk but bob pretty or is missis was always with im and if anybody tried to speak to him they always said e was deaf and took im off as fast as they could then one night up at the cauliflower here dicky weed came rushing in with a bit o news that took everybodys breath away  ive just come from the postoffice he ses and theres a letter for bob prettys old gentleman wot dye think o that  if you could tell us wots inside it you might ave something to brag about ses henery walker  i dont want to see the inside ses dicky weed the name on the outside was good enough for me i couldnt hardly believe my own eyes but there it was mr josiah walker as plain as the nose on your face  o course we see it all then and wondered why we hadnt thought of it afore and we stood quiet listening to the things that henery walker said about a man that would go and steal another mans greatuncle from im three times smith the landlord said hush and the fourth time he put henery walker outside and told im to stay there till he ad lost his voice  henery walker stayed outside five minutes and then e come back in agin to ask for advice his idea seemed to be that as the old gentleman was deaf bob pretty was passing isself off as henery walker and the disgrace was amost more than e could bear he began to get excited agin and smith ad just said hush once more when we eard somebody whistling outside and in come bob pretty  he ad hardly got is face in at the door afore henery walker started on im and bob pretty stood there struck all of a heap and staring at im as though he couldnt believe his ears  ave you gone mad henery he ses at last  give me back my greatuncle ses henery walker at the top of is voice  bob pretty shook his ead at him i havent got your greatuncle henery he ses very gentle i know the name is the same but wot of it theres more than one josiah walker in the world this one is no relation to you at all hes a very respectable old gentleman  ill go and ask im ses henery walker getting up and ill tell im wot sort o man you are bob pretty  hes gone to bed now henery ses bob pretty  ill come in the fust thing tomorrow morning then ses henery walker  not in my ouse henery ses bob pretty not arter the things youve been sayin about me im a pore man but ive got my pride besides i tell you he aint your uncle hes a pore old man im giving a ome to and i wont ave im worried  ow much does e pay you a week bob ses bill chambers  bob pretty pretended not to hear im  where did your wife get the money to buy that bonnet she ad on on sunday ses bill chambers my wife ses its the fust new bonnet she has ad since she was married  and where did the new winder curtains come from ses peter gubbins  bob pretty drank up is beer and stood looking at them very thoughtful then he opened the door and went out without saying a word  hes got your greatuncle a prisoner in his ouse henery ses bill chambers its easy for to see that the pore old gentleman is getting past things and i shouldnt wonder if bob pretty dont make im leave all is money to im  henery walker started raving agin and for the next few days he tried his ardest to get a few words with is greatuncle but bob pretty was too much for im everybody in claybury said wot a shame it was but it was all no good and henery walker used to leave is work and stand outside bob prettys for hours at a time in the opes of getting a word with the old man  he got is chance at last in quite a unexpected way we was up ere at the cauliflower one evening and as it appened we was talking about henery walkers greatuncle when the door opened and who should walk in but the old gentleman imself everybody left off talking and stared at im but he walked up to the bar and ordered a glass o gin and beer as comfortable as you please  bill chambers was the fust to get is presence of mind back and he set off arter henery walker as fast as is legs could carry im and in a wunnerful short time considering he came back with henery both of em puffing and blowing their ardest  thereheis ses bill chambers pointing to the old gentleman  henery walker gave one look and then e slipped over to the old man and stood all of a tremble smiling at im goodevening he ses  wot ses the old gentleman  goodevening ses henery walker agin  im a bit

talk to im about his father and an old aunt named maria but e stopped im sharp and said he was sick and tired of the whole walker family and didnt want to ear their names agin as long as he lived henery walker began to talk about australey then and asked im ow many sheep hed got and the words was ardly out of is mouth afore the old gentleman stood up and said he was arter his money agin  henery walker at once gave im some more gin and beer and arter he ad drunk it the old gentleman said that hed go and live with im for a little while to see ow he liked it  illustration you leave go o

taking hold of old mr walker by the arm hes my lodger and hes coming with me  he began to lead the old gentleman towards the door but henery walker wot was still sitting down threw is arms round his legs and held im tight bob pretty pulled one way and henery walker pulled the other and both of em shouted to each other to leave go the row they made was awful but old mr walker made more noise than the two of em put together  you leave go o my lodger ses bob pretty  you leave go o my greatunclemy dear greatuncle ses henery walker as the old gentleman called im a bad name and asked im whether he

four of em seemed to be trying which could make the most noise  hes my lodger ses bob pretty and he cant go without giving me proper notice thats the lora weeks notice  they all shouted agin then and

walker who was sleeping in the next room with three of is boys fell out o bed for the second time he got up and rapped on the wall  bob pretty came round the next morning with a tin box that belonged to the old man and e was so perlite and nice to im that henery walker could see that he ad opes of getting im back agin the box was carried upstairs and put under old mr walkers bed and e was so partikler about its being locked and about nobody being about when e opened it that mrs walker went arf out of her mind with curiosity  i spose youve looked to see that bob pretty didnt take anything out of it ses henery walker  he didnt ave the chance ses the old gentleman its always kep locked  its a box that looks as though it might ave been made in australey ses henery walker who was longing to talk about them parts  if you say another word about australey to me ses old mr walker firing up off i go mind that youre arter my money and if youre not careful you shant ave a farthing of it  that was the last time the word australey passed henery walkers lips and even when e saw his greatuncle writing letters there he didnt say anything and the old man was so suspicious of mrs walkers curiosity that all the letters that was wrote to im he ad sent to bob prettys he used to call there pretty near every morning to see whether any ad come for im  in three months henery walker adnt seen the color of is money once and wot was worse still he took to giving henerys things away mrs walker ad been complaining for some time of ow bad the hens had been laying and one morning at

give em to bob pretty  give em to bob pretty ses henery walker arf choking wot for  cos he asked me for em ses the old gentleman wot are you looking at me like that for  henery couldnt answer im and the old gentleman looking very fierce got up from the table and told mrs walker to give im his hat henery walker clung to im with tears in his eyes amost and begged im not to go and arter a lot of talk old mr walker said hed look over it this time but it mustnt occur agin  arter that e did as e liked with henery walkers things and henery dursent say a word to im bob pretty used to come up and flatter im and beg im to go back and lodge with im and henery was so afraid hed go that he didnt say a word when old mr walker used to give bob pretty things to make up for is disappointment he eard on the quiet from bill chambers who said that the old man ad told it to bob pretty as a dead secret that e ad left im all his money and he was ready to put up with anything  the old man must ha been living with henery walker for over eighteen months when one night he passed away in is sleep henery knew that his art was wrong because he ad just paid dr green is bill for saying that e couldnt do anything for im but it was a surprise to im all the same he blew his nose ard and mrs walker kept rubbing er eyes with her apron while they talked in whispers and wondered ow much money they ad come in for  in less than ten minutes the news was all over claybury and arf the people in the place hanging round in front of the ouse waiting to hear ow much the walkers ad come in for henery walker pulled the blind on one side for a moment and shook his ead at them to go away some of them did go back a yard or two and then they stood staring at bob pretty wot come up as bold as brass and knocked at the door  wots this i ear he ses when henery walker opened it you dont mean to tell me that the pore old gentleman has really gone i told im wot would happen if e came to lodge with you  you be off ses henery walker he hasnt left you anything  i know that ses bob pretty shaking his ead youre welcome to it henery if there is anything i never bore any malice to you for taking of im away from us i could see youd took a fancy to im from the fust the way you pretended e was your greatuncle showed me that  wot are you talking about ses henery walker he was my greatuncle  have it your own way henery ses bob pretty ony if you asked me i should say that he was my wifes grandfather  yourwifesgrandfather ses henery walker in a choking voice  he stood staring at im stupidlike for a minute or two but he couldnt get out another word in a flash e saw ow hed been done and how bob pretty ad been deceiving im all along and the idea that he ad arf ruined himself keeping mrs prettys grandfather for em pretty near sent im out of his mind  illustration he slammed the door in bob prettys face  but how is it is name was josiah walker same as henerys great uncle ses bill chambers who ad been crowding round with the others tell me that  he ad a fancy for it ses bob pretty and being a armless amusement we let him ave his own way i told henery walker over and over agin that it wasnt his uncle but he wouldnt believe me ive got witnesses to it wot did you say henery  henery walker drew imself up as tall as he could and stared at him twice he opened is mouth to speak but couldnt and then he made a odd sort o choking noise in his throat and slammed the door in bob prettys face     illustration a loveknot     a loveknot   mr nathaniel clark and mrs bowman had just finished their third game of draughts it had been a difficult game for mr clark the ladys mind having been so occupied with other matters that he had had great difficulty in losing indeed it was only by pushing an occasional piece of his own off the board that he had succeeded  a penny for your thoughts amelia he said at last  mrs bowman smiled faintly they were far away she confessed  mr clark assumed an expression of great solemnity allusions of this kind to the late mr bowman were only too frequent he was fortunate when they did not grow into reminiscences of a career too blameless for successful imitation  i suppose said the widow slowlyi suppose i ought to tell you ive had a letter  mr clarks face relaxed  it took me back to the old scenes continued mrs bowman dreamily i have never kept anything back from you nathaniel i told you all about the first man i ever thought anything ofcharlie tucker  mr clark cleared his throat you did he said a trifle hoarsely more than once  ive just had a letter from him said mrs bowman simpering fancy after all these years poor fellow he has only just heard of my husbands death and by the way he writes  she broke off and drummed nervously on the table  he hasnt heard about me you mean said mr clark after waiting to give her time to finish  how should he said the widow  if he heard one thing he might have heard the other retorted mr clark better write and tell him tell him that in six weeks time youll be mrs clark then perhaps he wont write again  mrs bowman sighed i thought after all these years that he must be dead she said slowly or else married but he says in his letter that he has kept single for my sake all these years  well hell be able to go on doing it said mr clark itll come easy to him after so much practice  hehe says in his letter that he is coming to see me said the widow in a low voice totothis evening  coming to see you repeated mr clark sharply what for  to talk over old times he says was the reply i expect he has altered a great deal he was a finelooking fellowand so dashing after i gave him up he didnt care what he did the last i heard of him he had gone abroad  mr clark muttered something under his breath and in a mechanical fashion began to build little castles with the draughts he was just about to add to an already swaying structure when a thundering rattat tat at the door dispersed the draughts to the four corners of the room the servant opened the door and the next moment ushered in mrs bowmans visitor  a tall goodlooking man in a frockcoat with a huge spray of mignonette in his buttonhole met the critical gaze of mr clark he paused at the door and striking an attitude pronounced in tones of great amazement the christian name of the lady of the house  mr tucker said the widow blushing  the same girl said the visitor looking round wildly the same as the day she left me not a bit changed not a hair different  he took her extended hand and bending over it kissed it respectfully  itsits very strange to see you again mr tucker said mrs bowman withdrawing her hand in some confusion  mr tucker said that gentleman reproachfully it used to be charlie  mrs bowman blushed again and with a side glance at the frowning mr clark called her visitors attention to him and introduced them the gentlemen shook hands stiffly  any friend of yours is a friend of mine said mr tucker with a patronizing air how are you sir  mr clark replied that he was well and after some hesitation said that he hoped he was the same mr tucker took a chair and leaning back stroked his huge mustache and devoured the widow with his eyes fancy seeing you again said the latter in some embarrassment how did you find me out  its a long story replied the visitor but i always had the idea that we should meet again your photograph has been with me all over the world in the backwoods of canada in the bush of australia it has been my one comfort and guiding star if ever i was tempted to do wrong i used to take your photograph out and look at it  i spose you took it out pretty often said mr clark restlessly to look at i mean he added hastily as mrs bowman gave him an indignant glance  every day said the visitor solemnly once when i injured myself out hunting and was five days without food or drink it was the only thing that kept me alive  mr clarks gibe as to the size of the photograph was lost in mrs bowmans exclamations of pity  i once lived on two ounces of gruel and a cup of milk a day for ten days he said trying to catch the widows eye after the ten days  when the indians found me i was delirious continued mr tucker in a hushed voice and when i came to my senses i found that they were calling me amelia  mr clark attempted to relieve the situation by a jocose inquiry as to whether he was wearing a mustache at the time but mrs bowman frowned him down he began to whistle under his breath and mrs bowman promptly said hsh  but how did you discover me she inquired turning again to the visitor  wandering over the world continued mr tucker here today and there tomorrow and unable to settle down anywhere i returned to northtown about two years ago three days since in a tramcar i heard your name mentioned i pricked up my ears and listened when i heard that you were free i could hardly contain myself i got into conversation with the lady and obtained your address and after travelling fourteen hours here i am  how very extraordinary said the widow i wonder who it could have been did she mention her name  mr tucker shook his head inquiries as to the ladys appearance age and dress were alike fruitless there was a mist before my eyes he explained i couldnt realize it i couldnt believe in my good fortune  i cant think began mrs bowman  what does it matter inquired mr tucker softly here we are together again with life all before us and the misunderstandings of long ago all forgotten  mr clark cleared his throat preparatory to speech but a peremptory glance from mrs bowman restrained him  i thought you were dead she said turning to the smiling mr tucker i never dreamed of seeing you again  nobody would chimed in mr clark when do you go back  back said the visitor where  australia replied mr clark with a glance of defiance at the widow you must ha been missed a great deal all this time  mr tucker regarded him with a haughty stare then he bent towards mrs bowman  do you wish me to go back he asked impressively  we dont wish either one way or the other said mr clark before the widow could speak it dont matter to us  we said mr tucker knitting his brows and gazing anxiously at mrs bowman we  we are going to be married in six weeks time said mr clark  mr tucker looked from one to the other in silent misery then shielding his eyes with his hand he averted his head mrs bowman with her hands folded in her lap regarded him with anxious solicitude  i thought perhaps you ought to know said mr clark  mr tucker sat bolt upright and gazed at him fixedly i wish you joy he said in a hollow voice  thankee said mr clark we expect to be pretty happy he smiled at mrs bowman but she made no response her looks wandered from one to the otherfrom the goodlooking interesting companion of her youth to the short prosaic little man who was exulting only too plainly in his discomfiture  mr tucker rose with a sigh goodby he said extending his hand  you are not goingyet said the widow  mr tuckers lowbreathed i must was just audible the widow renewed her expostulations  perhaps he has got a train to catch said the thoughtful mr clark  no sir said mr tucker as a matter of fact i had taken a room at the george hotel for a week but i suppose i had better get back home again  no why should you said mrs bowman with a rebellious glance at mr clark stay and come in and see me sometimes and talk over old times and mr clark will be glad to see you im sure wont you nathmr clark  i shall bedelighted said mr clark staring hard at the mantelpiece delighted  illustration on the third morning he took mrs bowman out for a walk  mr tucker thanked them both and after groping for some time for the hand of mr clark who was still intent upon the mantelpiece pressed it warmly and withdrew mrs bowman saw him to the door and a lowvoiced colloquy in which mr clark caught the word afternoon ensued by the time the widow returned to the room he was busy building with the draughts again  mr tucker came the next day at three oclock and the day after at two on the third morning he took mrs bowman out for a walk airily explaining to mr clark who met them on the way that they had come out to call for him the day after when mr clark met them returning from a walk he was assured that his silence of the day before was understood to indicate a distaste for exercise  and you see i like a long walk said mrs bowman and you are not what i should call a good walker  you never used to complain said mr clark in fact it was generally you that used to suggest turning back  she wants to be amused as well remarked mr tucker then she doesnt feel the fatigue  mr clark glared at him and then shortly declining mrs bowmans invitation to accompany them home on the ground that he required exercise proceeded on his way he carried himself so stiffly and his manner was so fierce that a wellmeaning neighbor who had crossed the road to join him and offer a little sympathy if occasion offered talked of the weather for five minutes and inconsequently faded away at a corner  trimington as a whole watched the affair with amusement although mr clarks friends adopted an inflection of voice in speaking to him which reminded him strongly of funerals mr tuckers week was up but the landlord of the george was responsible for the statement that he had postponed his departure indefinitely  matters being in this state mr clark went round to the widows one evening with the air of a man who has made up his mind to decisive action he entered the room with a bounce and hardly deigning to notice the greeting of mr tucker planted himself in a chair and surveyed him grimly i thought i should find you here he remarked  well i always am here aint i retorted mr tucker removing his cigar and regarding him with mild surprise  mr tucker is my friend interposed mrs bowman i am the only friend he has got in trimington its natural he should be here  mr clark quailed at her glance  people are beginning to talk he muttered feebly  talk said the widow with an air of mystification belied by her color what about  mr clark quailed again aboutabout our wedding he stammered  mr tucker and the widow exchanged glances then the former took his cigar from his mouth and with a hopeless gesture threw it into the grate  plenty of time to talk about that said mrs bowman after a pause  time is going remarked mr clark i was thinking if it was agreeable to you of putting up the banns tomorrow  theretheres no hurry was the reply  marry in haste repent at leisure quoted mr tucker gravely  dont you want me to put em up demanded mr clark turning to mrs bowman  theres no hurry said mrs bowman again ii want time to think  mr clark rose and stood over her and after a vain attempt to meet his gaze she looked down at the carpet  i understand he said loftily i am not blind  it isnt my fault murmured the widow drawing patterns with her toe on the carpet one cant help their feelings  mr clark gave a short hard laugh what about my feelings he said severely what about the life you have spoiled i couldnt have believed it of you  im sure im very sorry murmured mrs bowman and anything that i can do i will i never expected to see charles again and it was so sudden it took me unawares i hope we shall still be friends  friends exclaimed mr clark with extraordinary vigor with him  he folded his arms and regarded the pair with a bitter smile mrs bowman quite unable to meet his eyes still gazed intently at the floor  you have made me the laughingstock of trimington pursued mr clark you have wounded me in my tenderest feelings you have destroyed my faith in women i shall never be the same man again i hope that you will never find out what a terrible mistake youve made  mrs bowman made a noise halfway between a sniff and a sob mr tuckers sniff was unmistakable  i will return your presents tomorrow said mr clark rising good by forever  he paused at the door but mrs bowman did not look up a second later the front door closed and she heard him walk rapidly away  for some time after his departure she preserved a silence which mr tucker endeavored in vain to break he took a chair by her side and at the third attempt managed to gain possession of her hand  i deserved all he said she cried at last poor fellow i hope he will do nothing desperate  no no said mr tucker soothingly  his eyes were quite wild continued the widow if anything happens to him i shall never forgive myself i have spoilt his life  mr tucker pressed her hand and spoke of the wellknown refining influence a hopeless passion for a good woman had on a man he cited his own case as an example  disappointment spoilt my life so far as worldly success goes he said softly but no doubt the discipline was good for me  mrs bowman smiled faintly and began to be a little comforted conversation shifted from the future of mr clark to the past of mr tucker the widows curiosity as to the extent of the latters worldly success remaining unanswered by reason of mr tuckers sudden remembrance of a bearfight  their future was discussed after supper and the advisability of leaving trimington considered at some length the towns and villages of england were at their disposal mr tuckers business it appeared being independent of place he drew a picture of life in a bungalow with modern improvements at some seaside town and the cloth having been removed took out his pocketbook and extracting an old envelope drew plans on the back  it was a delightful pastime and made mrs bowman feel that she was twenty and beginning life again she toyed with the pocketbook and complimented mr tucker on his skill as a draughtsman  a letter or two fell out and she replaced them then a small newspaper cutting which had fluttered out with them met her eye  a little veranda with roses climbing up it murmured mr tucker still drawing and a couple of  his pencil was arrested by an odd gasping noise from the window he looked up and saw her sitting stiffly in her chair her face seemed to have swollen and to be colored in patches her eyes were round and amazed  arent you well he inquired rising in disorder  mrs bowman opened her lips but no sound came from them then she gave a long shivering sigh  heat of the room too much for you inquired the other anxiously  mrs bowman took another long shivering breath still incapable of speech she took the slip of paper in her trembling fingers and an involuntary exclamation of dismay broke from mr tucker she dabbed fiercely at her burning eyes with her handkerchief and read it again  tuckerif this should meet the eye of charles tucker who knew amelia wyborn twentyfive years ago he will hear of something greatly to his advantage by communicating with n c royal hotel northtown  mrs bowman found speech at last n cnathaniel clark she said in broken tones so that is where he went last month oh what a fool ive been oh what a simple fool  mr tucker gave a deprecatory cough ii had forgotten it was there he said nervously  yes breathed the widow i can quite believe that  i was going to show you later on declared the other regarding her carefully i was really i couldnt bear the idea of keeping a secret from you long  illustration i had forgotten it was there he said nervously  mrs bowman smileda terrible smile the audacity of the man she broke out to stand there and lecture me on my behavior to talk about his spoilt life and all the time  she got up and walked about the room angrily brushing aside the proffered attentions of mr tucker  laughingstock of trimington is he she stormed he shall be more than that before i have done with him the wickedness of the man the artfulness  thats what i thought said mr tucker shaking his head i said to him  youre as bad said the widow turning on him fiercely all the time you two men were talking at each other you were laughing in your sleeves at me and i sat there like a child taking it all in ive no doubt you met every night and arranged what you were to do next day  mr tuckers lips twitched i would do more than that to win you amelia he said humbly  youll have to was the grim reply now i want to hear all about this from the beginning and dont keep anything from me or itll be the worse for you  she sat down again and motioned him to proceed  when i saw the advertisement in the northtown chronicle began mr tucker in husky voice i danced with  never mind about that interrupted the widow dryly  i went to the hotel and saw mr clark resumed mr tucker somewhat crestfallen when i heard that you were a widow all the old times came back to me again the years fell from me like a mantle once again i saw myself walking with you over the footpath to coopers farm once again i felt your hand in mine your voice sounded in my ears  you saw mr clark the widow reminded him  he had heard all about our early love from you said mr tucker and as a last desperate chance for freedom he had come down to try and hunt me up and induce me to take you off his hands  mrs bowman uttered a smothered exclamation  he tempted me for two days said mr tucker gravely the temptation was too great and i fell besides that i wanted to rescue you from the clutches of such a man  why didnt he tell me himself inquired the widow  just what i asked him said the other but he said that you were much too fond of him to give him up he is not worthy of you amelia he is fickle he has got his eye on another lady  what said the widow with sudden loudness  mr tucker nodded mournfully miss hackbutt he said slowly i saw her the other day and what he can see in her i cant think  miss hackbutt repeated the widow in a smothered voice miss she got up and began to pace the room again  he must be blind said mr tucker positively  mrs bowman stopped suddenly and stood regarding him there was a light in her eye which made him feel anything but comfortable he was glad when she transferred her gaze to the clock she looked at it so long that he murmured something about going  goodby she said  mr tucker began to repeat his excuses but she interrupted him not now she said decidedly im tired goodnight  mr tucker pressed her hand goodnight he said tenderly i am afraid the excitement has been too much for you may i come round at the usual time tomorrow  yes said the widow  she took the advertisement from the table and folding it carefully placed it in her purse mr tucker withdrew as she looked up  he walked back to the george deep in thought and over a couple of pipes in bed thought over the events of the evening he fell asleep at last and dreamed that he and miss hackbutt were being united in the bonds of holy matrimony by the rev nathaniel clark  the vague misgivings of the previous night disappeared in the morning sunshine he shaved carefully and spent some time in the selection of a tie  over an excellent breakfast he arranged further explanations and excuses for the appeasement of mrs bowman  he was still engaged on the task when he started to call on her half way to the house he arrived at the conclusion that he was looking too cheerful his face took on an expression of deep seriousness only to give way the next moment to one of the blankest amazement in front of him and approaching with faltering steps was mr clark and leaning trustfully on his arm the comfortable figure of mrs bowman her brow was unruffled and her lips smiling  beautiful morning she said pleasantly as they met  lovely murmured the wondering mr tucker trying but in vain to catch the eye of mr clark  i have been paying an early visit said the widow still smiling i surprised you didnt i nathaniel  you did said mr clark in an unearthly voice  we got talking about last night continued the widow and nathaniel started pleading with me to give him another chance i suppose that i am softhearted but he was so miserableyou were never so miserable in your life before were you nathaniel  never said mr clark in the same strange voice  he was so wretched that at last i gave way said mrs bowman with a simper poor fellow it was such a shock to him that he hasnt got back his cheerfulness yet  mr tucker said indeed  hell be all right soon said mrs bowman in confidential tones we are on the way to put our banns up and once that is done he will feel safe you are not really afraid of losing me again are you nathaniel  mr clark shook his head and meeting the eye of mr tucker in the process favored him with a glance of such utter venom that the latter was almost startled  goodby mr tucker said the widow holding out her hand nathaniel did think of inviting you to come to my wedding but perhaps it is best not however if i alter my mind i will get him to advertise for you again goodby  she placed her arm in mr clarks again and led him slowly away mr tucker stood watching them for some time and then with a glance in the direction of the george where he had left a very small portmanteau he did a hasty sum in comparative values and made his way to the railwaystation     illustration her uncle     her uncle   mr wragg sat in a highbacked windsor chair at the door of his house smoking before him the road descended steeply to the harbor a small blue patch of which was visible from his door children over five were at school children under that age and suspiciously large for their years played about in careless disregard of the remarks which mr wragg occasionally launched at them twice a ball had whizzed past him and a small but select party with a tipcat of huge dimensions and awesome points played just out of reach mr wragg snapping his eyes nervously threatened in vain  morning old crustypatch said a cheerful voice at his elbow  mr wragg glanced up at the young fisherman towering above him and eyed him disdainfully  why dont you leave em alone inquired the young man be cheerful and smile at em youd soon be able to smile with a little practice you mind your business george gale and ill mind mine said mr wragg fiercely ive ad enough of your impudence and im not going to have any more and dont lean up agin my house cos i wont ave it  mr gale laughed got out o bed the wrong side again havent you he inquired why dont you put that side up against the wall  mr wragg puffed on in silence and became absorbed in a fishingboat gliding past at the bottom of the hill  i hear youve got a niece coming to live with you pursued the young man  mr wragg smoked on  poor thing said the other with a sigh does she take after youin looks i mean  if i was twenty years younger nor what i am said mr wragg sententiously id give you a hiding george gale  its what i want agreed mr gale placidly well so long mr wragg i cant stand talking to you all day  he was about to move off after pretending to pinch the ear of the infuriated mr wragg when he noticed a stationfly with a big trunk on the boxseat crawling slowly up the hill towards them  good riddance said mr wragg suggestively  the other paid no heed the vehicle came nearer and a girl who plainly owed none of her looks to mr wraggs side of the family came into view behind the trunk she waved her hand and mr wragg removing his pipe from his mouth waved it in return mr gale edged away about eighteen inches and with an air of assumed carelessness gazed idly about him  he saluted the driver as the fly stopped and gazed hard at the apparition that descended then he caught his breath as the girl approaching her uncle kissed him affectionately mr wragg looking up fiercely at mr gale was surprised at the expression on that gentlemans face  isnt it lovely here said the girl looking about her and isnt the air nice  she followed mr wragg inside and the driver a small man and elderly began tugging at the huge trunk mr gales moment had arrived  stand away joe he said stepping forward ill take that in for you  he hoisted the trunk on his shoulders and rather glad of his lowered face advanced slowly into the house uncle and niece had just vanished at the head of the stairs and mr gale after a moments hesitation followed  in ere said mr wragg throwing open a door  halloa what are you doing in my house put it down put it down at once dye hear  mr gale caught the girls surprised glance and somewhat flustered swung round so suddenly that the corner of the trunk took the gesticulating mr wragg by the side of the head and bumped it against the wall deaf to his outcries mr gale entered the room and placed the box on the floor  where shall i put it he inquired of the girl respectfully  you go out of my house stormed mr wragg entering with his hand to his head go on out you go  the young man surveyed him with solicitude im very sorry if i hurt you mr wragg he began  out you go repeated the other  it was a pure accident pleaded mr gale  and dont you set foot in my ouse agin said the vengeful mr wragg you made yourself officious bringing that box in apurpose to give me a clump o the side of the head with it  mr gale denied the charge so eagerly and withal so politely that the elder man regarded him in amazement then his glance fell on his niece and he smiled with sudden malice as mr gale slowly and humbly descended the stairs  illustration the corner of the trunk took the gesticulating mr wragg by the side of the head  one o the worst chaps about here my dear he said loudly mate o one o the fishingboats and as impudent as they make em manys the time ive clouted his head for im  the girl regarded his small figure with surprised respect  when he was a boy i mean continued mr wragg now theres your room and when youve put things to rights come down and ill show you over the house  he glanced at his niece several times during the day trying hard to trace a likeness first to his dead sister and then to himself several times he scrutinized himself in the small glass on the mantelpiece but in vain even when he twisted his thin beard in his hand and tried to ignore his mustache the likeness still eluded him  his opinion of miss millers looks was more than shared by the young men of waterside it was a busy youth who could not spare five minutes to chat with an uncle so fortunate and in less than a couple of weeks mr wragg was astonished at his popularity and the deference accorded to his opinions  the most humble of them all was mr gale and with a pertinacity which was almost proof against insult he strove to force his company upon the indignant mr wragg debarred from that he took to haunting the road on one occasion passing the house no fewer than fiftyseven times in one afternoon his infatuation was plain to be seen of all men wise men closed their eyes to it others had theirs closed for them mr gale being naturally incensed to think that there was anything in his behavior that attracted attention  his father was at sea and to the dismay of the old woman who kept house for him he began to neglect his food a melancholy but not unpleasing idea that he was slowly fading occurred to him when he found that he could eat only two herrings for breakfast instead of four his particular friend joe harris to whom he confided the fact remonstrated hotly  theres plenty of other girls he suggested  not like her said mr gale  youre getting to be a byword in the place complained his friend  mr gale flushed id do more than that for her sake he said softly  it aint the way said mr harris impatiently girls like a man o spirit not a chap who hangs about without speaking and looks as though he has been caught stealing the cats milk why dont you go round and see her one afternoon when old wragg is out  mr gale shivered i dursent he confessed  mr harris pondered she was going to be a hospital nurse afore she came down here he said slowly praps if you was to break your leg or something shed come and nurse you shes wonderful fond of it i understand  but then you see i havent broken it said the other impatiently  youve got a bicycle said mr harris youwait a minute he halfclosed his eyes and waved aside a remark of his friends suppose you ad an accident and fell off it just in front of the house  i never fall off said mr gale simply  old wragg is out and me and charlie brown carry you into the house continued mr harris closing his eyes entirely when you come to your senses shes bending over you and crying  he opened his eyes suddenly and then closing one gazed hard at the bewildered gale tomorrow afternoon at two he said briskly me and charliell be there waiting  suppose old wragg aint out objected mr gale after ten minutes explanation  hes at the lobster pot five days out of six at that time was the reply if he aint there tomorrow it cant be helped  mr gale spent the evening practising falls in a quiet lane and by the time night came had attained to such proficiency that on the way home he fell off without intending it it seemed an easier thing than he had imagined and next day at two oclock punctually he put his lessons into practice  by a slight error in judgment his head came into contact with mr wraggs doorstep and halfstunned he was about to rise when mr harris rushed up and forced him down again mr brown who was also in attendance helped to restore his faculties by a wellplaced kick  hes lost his senses said mr harris looking up at miss miller as she came to the door  you could ha heard him fall arf a mile away added mr brown  miss miller stooped and examined the victim carefully there was a nasty cut on the side of his head and a general limpness of body which was alarming she went indoors for some water and by the time she returned the enterprising mr harris had got the patient in the passage  im afraid hes going he said in answer to the girls glance  run for the doctor she said hastily quick  we dont like to leave im miss said mr harris tenderly i spose it would be too much to ask you to go  miss miller with a parting glance at the prostrate man departed at once  what did you do that for demanded mr gale sitting up i dont want the doctor hell spoil everything why didnt you go away and leave us  i sent er for the doctor said mr harris slowly i sent er for the doctor so as we can get you to bed afore she comes back  bed exclaimed mr gale  up you go said mr harris briefly well tell her we carried you up now dont waste time  pushed by his friends and stopping to expostulate at every step mr gale was thrust at last into mr wraggs bedroom  off with your clothes said the leading spirit whats the matter with you charlie brown  dont mind me ill be all right in a minute said that gentleman wiping his eyes im thinking of old wragg  illustration what did you do that for demanded mr gale sitting up  before mr gale had made up his mind his coat and waistcoat were off and mr brown was at work on his boots in five minutes time he was tucked up in mr wraggs bed his clothes were in a neat little pile on a chair and messrs harris and brown were indulging in a congratulatory doubleshuffle by the window  dont come to your senses yet awhile said the former and when you do tell the doctor you cant move your limbs  if they try to pull you out o bed said mr brown scream as though youre being killed hsh here they are  voices sounded below miss miller and the doctor had met at the door with mr wragg and a violent outburst on that gentlemans part died away as he saw that the intruders had disappeared he was still grumbling when mr harris putting his head over the balusters asked him to make a little less noise  mr wragg came upstairs in three bounds and his mien was so terrible that messrs harris and brown huddled together for protection then his gaze fell on the bed and he strove in vain for speech  we done it for the best faltered mr harris  mr wragg made a gurgling noise in his throat and as the doctor entered the room pointed with a trembling finger at the bed the other two gentlemen edged toward the door  take him away take him away at once vociferated mr wragg  the doctor motioned him to silence and joe harris and mr brown held their breaths nervously as he made an examination for ten minutes he prodded and puzzled over the insensible form in the bed then he turned to the couple at the door  how did it happen he inquired  mr harris told him he also added that he thought it was best to put him to bed at once before he came round  quite right said the doctor nodding its a very serious case  well i cant ave him ere broke in mr wragg  it wont be for long said the doctor shaking his head  i cant ave him ere at all and whats more i wont let him go to his own bed said mr wragg quivering with excitement  he is not to be moved said the doctor decidedly if he comes to his senses and gets out of bed you must coax him back again  coax stuttered mr wragg coax whats he got to do with me this house isnt a orsepittle put his clothes on and take im away  do nothing of the kind was the stern reply in fact his clothes had better be taken out of the room in case he comes round and tries to dress  mr harris skipped across to the clothes and tucked them gleefully under his arm mr brown secured the boots  when he will come out of this stupor i cant say continued the doctor keep him perfectly quiet and dont let him see a soul  look ere began mr wragg in a broken voice  as to dietwater said the doctor looking round  water said miss miller who had come quietly into the room  water repeated the doctor as much as he likes to take of course let me see today is tuesday ill look in on friday or saturday at latest but till then he must have nothing but clear cold water  mr harris shot a horrified glance at the bed which happened just then to creak but spose he asks for food sir he said respectfully  he mustnt have it said the other sharply if he is very insistent he added turning to the sullen mr wragg tell him that he has just had food he wont know any better and he will be quite satisfied  he motioned them out of the room and then lowering the blinds followed downstairs on tiptoe a murmur of voices followed by the closing of the front door sounded from below and mr gale getting cautiously out of bed saw messrs harris and brown walk up the street talking earnestly he stole back on tiptoe to the door and strove in vain to catch the purport of the lowvoiced discussion below mr wraggs voice was raised but indistinct then he fancied that he heard a laugh  he waited until the door closed behind the doctor and then went back to bed to try and think out a situation which was fast becoming mysterious  he lay in the darkened room until a cheerful clatter of crockery below heralded the approach of teatime he heard miss miller call her uncle in from the garden and with some satisfaction heard her pleasant voice engaged in brisk talk at intervals mr wragg laughed loud and long  tea was cleared away and the long evening dragged along in silence uncle and niece were apparently sitting in the garden but they came in to supper and later on the fumes of mr wraggs pipe pervaded the house at ten oclock he heard footsteps ascending the stairs and through halfclosed eyes saw mr wragg enter the bedroom with a candle  time the pore feller had is water he said to his niece who remained outside  unless he is still insensible was the reply  mr gale who was feeling both thirsty and hungry slowly opened his eyes and fixed them in a vacant stare on mr wragg  where am i he inquired in a faint voice  buckingham pallis replied mr wragg promptly  mr gale ground his teeth how did i come here he said at last  the fairies brought you said mr wragg  the young man rubbed his eyes and blinked at the candle i seem to remember falling he said slowly has anything happened  one o the fairies dropped you said mr wragg with great readiness fortunately you fell on your head  a sound suspiciously like a giggle came from the landing and fell heavily on gales ears he closed his eyes and tried to think  how did i get into your bedroom mr wragg he inquired after a long pause  lighteaded confided mr wragg to the landing and significantly tapping his forehead  this aint my bedroom he said turning to the invalid its the kings his majesty gave up is bed at once direckly he eard you was urt  and hes going to sleep on three chairs in the front parlorif he can said a low voice from the landing  the humor faded from mr wraggs face and was succeeded by an expression of great sourness where is the pore fellers supper he inquired i dont suppose he can eat anything but he might try  he went to the door and a lowvoiced colloquy ensued the rival merits of cold chicken versus steakpie as an invalid diet were discussed at some length finally the voice of miss miller insisted on chicken and a glass of portwine  ill tell im its chicken and portwine then said mr wragg reappearing with a bedroom jug and a tumbler which he placed on a small table by the bedside  dont let him eat too much mind said the voice from the landing anxiously  mr wragg said that he would be careful and addressing mr gale implored him not to overeat himself the young man stared at him offensively and pretty certain now of the true state of affairs thought only of escape  i feel better he said slowly i think i will go home  yes yes said the other soothingly  if you will fetch my clothes continued mr gale i will go now  clothes said mr wragg in an astonished voice why you didnt ave any  mr gale sat up suddenly in bed and shook his fist at him look here he began in a choking voice  the fairies brought you as you was continued mr wragg grinning furiously and of all the perfect picturs  a series of gasping sobs sounded from the landing the stairs creaked and a door slammed violently below in spite of this precaution the sounds of a maiden in dire distress were distinctly audible  you give me my clothes shouted the now furious mr gale springing out of bed  mr wragg drew back ill go and fetch em he said hastily  he ran lightly downstairs and the young man sitting on the edge of the bed waited ten minutes passed and he heard mr wragg returning followed by his niece he slipped back into bed again  its a pore brain again he heard in the unctuous tones which mr wragg appeared to keep for this emergency its clothes he wants now by and by i suppose itll be something else well the doctor said wed got to humor him  poor fellow sighed miss miller with a break in her voice  see ow his facell light up when he sees them said her uncle  he pushed the door open and after surveying the patient with a benevolent smile triumphantly held up a collar and tie for his inspection and threw them on the bed then he disappeared hastily and closing the door turned the key in the lock  if you want any more chicken or anything he cried through the door ring the bell  the horrified prisoner heard them pass downstairs again and after a glass of water sat down by the window and tried to think he got up and tried the door but it opened inwards and after a severe onslaught the handle came off in his hand tired out at last he went to bed again and slept fitfully until morning  mr wragg visited him again after breakfast but with great foresight only put his head in at the door while miss miller remained outside in case of need in these circumstances mr gale met his anxious inquiries with a sullen silence and the other tired at last of baiting him turned to go  ill be back soon he said with a grin im just going out to tell folks ow youre getting on theres a lot of em anxious  he was as good as his word and mr gale peeping from the window raged helplessly as little knots of neighbors stood smiling up at the house unable to endure it any longer he returned to bed resolving to wait until night came and then drop from the window and run home in a blanket  the smell of dinner was almost painful but he made no sign mr wragg in high good humor smoked a pipe after his meal and then went out again the house was silent except for the occasional movements of the girl below then there was a sudden tap at his door  well said mr gale  the door opened and hardly able to believe his eyes he saw his clothes thrown into the room hunger was forgotten and he almost smiled as he hastily dressed himself  the smile vanished as he thought of the people in the streets and in a thoughtful fashion he made his way slowly downstairs the bright face of miss miller appeared at the parlor door  better she smiled  mr gale reddened and drawing himself up stiffly made no reply  thats polite said the girl indignantly after giving you your clothes too what do you think my uncle will say to me he was going to keep you here till friday  mr gale muttered an apology ive made a fool of myself he added  miss miller nodded cheerfully are you hungry she inquired  the other drew himself up again  because there is some nice cold beef left said the girl glancing into the room  mr gale started and hardly able to believe in his good fortune followed her inside in a very short time the cold beef was a thing of the past and the young man toying with his beerglass sat listening to a lecture on his behavior couched in the severest terms his hostess could devise  youll be the laughingstock of the place she concluded  i shall go away he said gloomily  i shouldnt do that said the girl with a judicial air live it down  i shall go away repeated mr gale decidedly i shall ship for a deepsea voyage  miss miller sighed its too bad she said slowly perhaps you wouldnt look so foolish if  if what inquired the other after a long pause  if said miss miller looking down ifif  mr gale started and trembled violently as a wild idea born of her blushes occurred to him  if he said in quivering tones ifif  go on said the girl softly why i got as far as that and you are a man  mr gales voice became almost inaudible if we got married do you mean he said at last  married exclaimed miss miller starting back a full two inches good gracious the man is mad after all  the bitter and loudly expressed opinion of mr wragg when he returned an hour later was that they were both mad     illustration the dreamer     the dreamer   dreams and warnings are things i dont believe in said the night watchman the only dream i ever ad that come anything like true was once when i dreamt i came in for a fortune and next morning i found half a crown in the street which i sold to a man for fourpence and once two days arter my missis ad dreamt she ad spilt a cup of tea down the front of er sunday dress she spoilt a pot o paint of mine by sitting in it  the only other dream i know of that come true happened to the cook of a bark i was aboard of once called the southern belle he was a silly pastyfaced sort o chap always giving hisself airs about eddication to sailormen who didnt believe in it and one night when we was homewardbound from sydney he suddenly sat up in is bunk and laughed so loud that he woke us all up  wots wrong cookie ses one o the chaps  i was dreaming ses the cook such a funny dream i dreamt old bill foster fell out o the foretop and broke is leg  well wot is there to laugh at in that ses old bill very sharp  it was funny in my dream ses the cook you looked so comic with your leg doubled up under you you cant think it would ha made a cat laugh  bill foster said hed make im laugh the other side of his face if he wasnt careful and then we went off to sleep agin and forgot all about it  if youll believe me ony three days arterwards pore bill did fall out o the foretop and break his leg he was surprised but i never see a man so surprised as the cook was his eyes was nearly starting out of is head but by the time the other chaps ad picked bill up and asked im whether he was hurt cook ad pulled imself together agin and was giving himself such airs it was perfectly sickening  my dreams always come true he ses its a kind o second sight with me its a gift and being tenderarted it worries me terrible sometimes  he was going on like that taking credit for a pure accident when the second officer came up and told em to carry bill below he was in agony of course but he kept is presence of mind and as they passed the cook he gave im such a clip on the side of the ead as nearly broke it  thats for dreaming about me he ses  the skipper and the fust officer and most of the hands set is leg between them and arter the skipper ad made him wot he called comfortable but wot bill called something that i wont soil my ears by repeating the officers went off and the cook came and sat down by the side o bill and talked about his gift  i dont talk about it as a rule he ses cos it frightens people  its a wonderful gift cookie ses charlie epps  all of em thought the same not knowing wot a fustclass liar the cook was and he sat there and lied to em till he couldnt ardly speak he was so oarse  my grandmother was a gypsy he ses and its in the family things that are going to appen to people i know come to me in dreams same as pore bills did its curious to me sometimes when i look round at you chaps seeing you going about appy and comfortable and knowing all the time orrible things that is going to appen to you sometimes it gives me the fair shivers  horrible things to us slushy ses charlie staring  yes ses the cook nodding i never was on a ship afore with such a lot of unfortunit men aboard never theres two pore fellers wotll be dead corpses inside o six months sitting ere laughing and talking as if they was going to live to ninety thank your stars you dont ave such dreams  whowho are the two cookie ses charlie arter a bit  never mind charlie ses the cook in a sad voice it would do no good if i was to tell you nothing can alter it  give us a hint ses charlie  well ill tell you this much ses the cook arter sitting with his ead in his ands thinking one of em is nearly the ugliest man in the focsle and the other aint  o course that didnt elp em much but it caused a lot of argufying and the ugliest man aboard instead o being grateful behaved more like a wild beast than a christian when it was pointed out to him that he was safe  arter that dream about bill there was no keeping the cook in his place he ad dreams pretty near every night and talked little bits of em in his sleep little bits that you couldnt make head nor tail of and when we asked im next morning hed always shake his ead and say never mind sometimes hed mention a chaps name in is sleep and make im nervous for days  it was an unlucky vyge that for some of em about a week arter pore bills accident ted jones started playing catchball with another chap and a empty beerbottle and about the fifth chuck ted caught it with his face we thought e was killed at fusthe made such a noise but they got im down below and arter they ad picked out as much broken glass as ted would let em the second officer did im up in sticking plaster and told im to keep quiet for an hour or two  ted was very proud of is looks and the way he went on was alarming fust of all he found fault with the chap e was playing with and then he turned on the cook  its a pity you didnt see that in a dream he ses tryin to sneer ony the stickingplaster was too strong for im  but i did see it ses the cook drawin imself up  wot ses ted starting  i dreamt it night afore last just exactly as it appened ses the cook in a offhand way  why didnt you tell me then ses ted choking  it ud ha been no good ses the cook smiling and shaking his ead wot i see must appen i ony see the future and that must be  but you stood there watching me chucking the bottle about ses ted getting out of is bunk why didnt you stop me  you dont understand ses the cook if youd ad more eddication  he didnt ave time to say any more afore ted was on him and cookie being no fighter ad to cook with one eye for the next two or three days he kept quiet about is dreams for some time arter that but it was no good because george hall wot was a firm believer gave im a licking for not warning im of a sprained ankle he got skylarking and bob law took it out of im for not telling im that he was going to lose is suit of shoregoing togs at cards  illustration why didnt you tell me then ses ted  the only chap that seemed to show any good feeling for the cook was a young feller named joseph meek a steady young chap wot was goin to be married to old bill fosters niece as soon as we got ome nobody else knew it but he told the cook all about it on the quiet he said she was too good for im but do all he could he couldnt get her to see it  my feelings ave changed he ses  praps theyll change agin ses the cook trying to comfort im  joseph shook his ead no ive made up my mind he ses very slow im young yet and besides i cant afford it but ow to get out of it i dont know couldnt you ave a dream agin it for me  wot dye mean ses the cook firing up do you think i make my dreams up  no no certinly not ses joseph patting im on the shoulder but couldnt you do it just for once ave a dream that me and emily are killed a few days arter the wedding dont say in wot way cos she might think we could avoid it just dream we are killed bills always been a superstitious man and since you dreamt about his leg hed believe anything and hes that fond of emily i believe hed ave the wedding put off at any rateif i put him up to it  it took im three days and a silver watchchain to persuade the cook but he did at last and one arternoon when old bill who was getting on fustclass was resting is leg in is bunk the cook went below and turned in for a quiet sleep  for ten minutes he was as peaceful as a lamb and old bill who ad been laying in is bunk with an eye open watching im was just dropping off imself when the cook began to talk in is sleep and the very fust words made bill sit up as though something ad bit im  there they go ses the cook emily foster and joseph meekand theres old bill good old bill going to give the bride away how appy they all look especially joseph  old bill put his and to his ear and leaned out of his bunk  there they go ses the cook agin but wot is that orrible black thing with claws thats anging over bill  pore bill nearly fell out of is bunk but he saved imself at the last moment and lay there as pale as death listening  it must be meant for bill ses the cook well pore bill he wont know of it thats one thing lets ope itll be sudden  he lay quiet for some time and then he began again  no he ses it isnt bill its joseph and emily stark and stiff and theyve ony been married a week ow awful they look pore things oh oh ooh  he woke up with a shiver and began to groan and then e sat up in his bunk and saw old bill leaning out and staring at im  youve been dreaming cook ses bill in a trembling voice  ave i ses the cook how do you know  about me and my niece ses bill you was talking in your sleep  you oughtnt to ave listened ses the cook getting out of is bunk and going over to im i ope you didnt ear all i dreamt ow much did you hear  bill told im and the cook sat there shaking his ead thank goodness you didnt ear the worst of it he ses  worst ses bill wot was there any more of it  lots more ses the cook but promise me you wont tell joseph bill let im be happy while he can it would ony make im miserable and it wouldnt do any good  i dont know so much about that ses bill thinking about the arguments some of them had ad with ted about the bottle was it arter they was married cookie that it appened are you sure  certain sure it was a week arter ses the cook  very well then ses bill slapping is bad leg by mistake if they didnt marry it couldnt appen could it  dont talk foolish ses the cook they must marry i saw it in my dream  well well see ses bill im going to ave a quiet talk with joseph about it and see wot he ses i aint agoing to ave my pore gal murdered just to please you and make your dreams come true  he ad a quiet talk with joseph but joseph wouldnt ear of it at fust he said it was all the cooks nonsense though e owned up that it was funny that the cook should know about the wedding and emilys name and at last he said that they would put it afore emily and let her decide  that was about the last dream the cook had that vyge although he told old bill one day that he had ad the same dream about joseph and emily agin so that he was quite certain they ad got to be married and killed he wouldnt tell bill ow they was to be killed because e said it would make im an old man afore his time but of course he ad to say that if they wasnt married the other part couldnt come true he said that as he ad never told is dreams beforeexcept in the case of bills leghe couldnt say for certain that they couldnt be prevented by taking care but praps they could and bill pointed out to im wot a useful man he would be if he could dream and warn people in time  by the time we got into the london river old bills leg was getting on fustrate and he got along splendid on a pair of crutches the carpenter ad made for him him and joseph and the cook had ad a good many talks about the dream and the old man ad invited the cook to come along ome with em to be referred to when he told the tale  i shall take my opportunity he ses and break it to er gentle like when i speak to you you chip in and not afore dye understand  we went into the east india docks that vyge and got there early on a lovely summers evening everybody was arf crazy at the idea o going ashore agin and working as cheerful and as willing as if they liked it there was a few people standing on the pierhead as we went in and among em several very nicelooking young wimmen  my eye joseph ses the cook who ad been staring hard at one of em theres a fine gallively too look ere  illustration i shall take my opportunity he ses and break it to er gentle like  he kissed is dirty pawwhich is more than i should ave liked to ave done it if it ad been mineand waved it and the gal turned round and shook her ead at im  here thatll do ses joseph very cross thats my gal thats my emily  eh says the cook well ow was i to know besides youre agiving of her up  joseph didnt answer im he was staring at emily and the more he stared the betterlooking she seemed to grow she really was an uncommon nicelooking gal and more than the cook was struck with her  whos that chap standing alongside of her ses the cook  its one o bills sisters lodgers ses joseph who was looking very badtempered i should like to know wot right he as to come ere to welcome me ome i dont want im  praps hes fond of er ses the cook i could be very easy  ill chuck im in the dock if he aint careful ses joseph turning red in the face  he waved his and to emily who didnt appen to be looking at the moment but the lodger waved back in a careless sort of way and then spoke to emily and they both waved to old bill who was standing on his crutches further aft  by the time the ship was berthed and everything snug it was quite dark and old bill didnt know whether to take the cook ome with im and break the news that night or wait a bit he made up his mind at last to get it over and done with and arter waiting till the cook ad cleaned imself they got a cab and drove off  bert simmons the lodger ad to ride on the box and bill took up so much room with is bad leg that emily found it more comfortable to sit on josephs knee and by the time they got to the ouse he began to see wot a silly mistake he was making  keep that dream o yours to yourself till i make up my mind he ses to the cook while bill and the cabman were calling each other names  bills going to speak fust whispers the cook  the lodger and emily ad gone inside and joseph stood there fidgeting while the cabman asked bill as a friend why he adnt paid twopence more for his face and bill was wasting his time trying to think of something to say to urt the cabmans feelings then he took bill by the arm as the cab drove off and told im not to say nothing about the dream because he was going to risk it  stuff and nonsense ses bill im going to tell emily its my dooty wots the good o being married if youre going to be killed  he stumped in on his crutches afore joseph could say any more and arter letting his sister kiss im went into the front room and sat down there was cold beef and pickles on the table and two jugs o beer and arter just telling his sister ow he fell and broke is leg they all sat down to supper  bert simmons sat on one side of emily and joseph the other and the cook couldnt elp feeling sorry for er seeing as he did that sometimes she was aving both hands squeezed at once under the table and could ardly get a bite in edgeways  old bill lit his pipe arter supper and then taking another glass o beer he told em about the cook dreaming of his accident three days afore it happened they couldnt ardly believe it at fust but when he went on to tell em the other things the cook ad dreamt and that everything ad appened just as he dreamt it they all edged away from the cook and sat staring at him with their mouths open  and that aint the worst of it ses bill  thats enough for one night bill ses joseph who was staring at bert simmons as though he could eat him besides i believe it was ony chance when cook told you is dream it made you nervous and thats why you fell  nervous be blowed ses bill and then he told em about the dream he ad heard while he was laying in is bunk  bills sister gave a scream when he ad finished and emily wot was sitting next to joseph got up with a shiver and went and sat next to bert simmons and squeezed his coatsleeve  its all nonsense ses joseph starting up and if it wasnt true love would run the risk i aint afraid  its too much to ask a gal ses bert simmons shaking his ead  i couldnt dream of it ses emily wots the use of being married for a week look at uncles legthats enough for me  they all talked at once then and joseph tried all he could to persuade emily to prove to the cook that is dreams didnt always come true but it was no good emily said she wouldnt marry im if he ad a million a year and her aunt and uncle backed her up in itto say nothing of bert simmons  ill go up and get your presents joseph she ses and she ran upstairs afore anybody could stop her  joseph sat there as if he was dazed while everybody gave im good advice and said ow thankful he ought to be that the cook ad saved him by is dreaming and by and by emily came downstairs agin with the presents he ad given er and put them on the table in front of im  theres everything there but that little silver brooch you gave me joseph she ses and i lost that the other evening when i was out withwithfor a walk  joseph tried to speak but couldnt  it was sixandsix cos i was with you when you bought it ses emily and as ive lost it its ony fair i should pay for it  she put down arf a sovereign with the presents and joseph sat staring at it as if he ad never seen one afore  and you neednt mind about the change joseph ses emily thatll elp to make up for your disappointment  old bill tried to turn things off with a bit of a laugh why youre made o money emily he ses  ah i havent told you yet ses emily smiling at him thats a little surprise i was keeping for you aunt emmapore aunt emma i should saydied while you was away and left me all er furniture and two hundred pounds  joseph made a choking noise in his throat and then e got up leaving the presents and the arfsovereign on the table and stood by the door staring at them  goodnight all he ses then he went to the front door and opened it and arter standing there a moment came back as though he ad forgotten something  are you coming along now he ses to the cook  not just yet ses the cook very quick  ill wait outside for you then ses joseph grinding his teeth dont be long     illustration angels visits     angels visits   mr william jobling leaned against his doorpost smoking the evening air pleasant in its coolness after the heat of the day caressed his shirtsleeved arms children played noisily in the long dreary street and an organ sounded faintly in the distance to mr jobling who had just consumed three herrings and a pint and a half of strong tea the scene was delightful he blew a little cloud of smoke in the air and with halfclosed eyes corrected his first impression as to the tune being played round the corner  bill cried the voice of mrs jobling who was washingup in the tiny scullery  ullo responded mr jobling gruffly  youve been putting your wet teaspoon in the sugarbasin andwell i declare if you havent done it again  done what inquired her husband hunching his shoulders  putting your herringy knife in the butter well you can eat it now i wont a lot of good me slaving from morning to night and buying good food when you go and spoil it like that  mr jobling removed the pipe from his mouth not so much of it he commanded i like butter with a little flavor to it as for your slaving all day you ought to come to the works for a week youd know what slavery was then  mrs jobling permitted herself a thin derisive cackle drowned hurriedly in a clatter of teacups as her husband turned and looked angrily up the little passage  nag nag nag said mr jobling  he paused expectantly  nag nag nag from morning till night he resumed it begins in the morning and it goes on till bedtime  its a pity began mrs jobling  hold your tongue said her husband sternly i dont want any of your back answers it goes on all day long up to bedtime and last night i laid awake for two hours listening to you nagging in your sleep  he paused again  nagging in your sleep he repeated  there was no reply  two hours he said invitingly two whole hours without a stop  i ope it done you good retorted his wife i noticed you did wipe one foot when you come in tonight  mr jobling denied the charge hotly and by way of emphasizing his denial raised his foot and sent the mat flying along the passage honor satisfied he returned to the doorpost and looking idly out on the street again exchanged a few desultory remarks with mr joe brown who with his hands in his pockets was balancing himself with great skill on the edge of the curb opposite  his gaze wandered from mr brown to a young and rather stylishlydressed woman who was approachinga tall goodlooking girl with a slight limp whose hat encountered unspoken feminine criticism at every step their eyes met as she came up and recognition flashed suddenly into both faces  fancy seeing you here said the girl well this is a pleasant surprise  she held out her hand and mr jobling with a fierce glance at mr brown who was not behaving shook it respectfully  im so glad to see you again said the girl i know i didnt thank you half enough the other night but i was too upset  dont mention it said mr jobling in a voice the humility of which was in strong contrast to the expression with which he was regarding the antics of mr brown as that gentleman wafted kisses to the four winds of heaven  there was a pause broken by a short dry cough from the parlor window the girl who was almost touching the sill started nervously  its only my missis said mr jobling  the girl turned and gazed in at the window mr jobling with the stem of his pipe performed a brief ceremony of introduction  goodevening said mrs jobling in a thin voice i dont know who you are but i spose my usband does  i met him the other night said the girl with a bright smile i slipped on a piece of peel or something and fell and he was passing and helped me up  mrs jobling coughed again first ive heard of it she remarked  i forgot to tell you said mr jobling carelessly i hope you wasnt hurt much miss  i twisted my ankle a bit thats all said the girl its painful when i walk  painful now inquired mr jobling in concern  the girl nodded a little not very  mr jobling hesitated the contortions of mr browns face as he strove to make a wink carry across the road would have given pause to a bolder man and twice his wifes husky little cough had sounded from the window  i spose you wouldnt like to step inside and rest for five minutes he said slowly  oh thank you said the girl gratefully i should like to itit really is very painful i ought not to have walked so far  she limped in behind mr jobling and after bowing to mrs jobling sank into the easychair with a sigh of relief and looked keenly round the room mr jobling disappeared and his wife flushed darkly as he came back with his coat on and his hair wet from combing an awkward silence ensued  how strong your husband is said the girl clasping her hands impulsively  is he said mrs jobling  he lifted me up as though i had been a feather responded the girl he just put his arm round my waist and had me on my feet before i knew where i was  round your waist repeated mrs jobling  where else should i put it broke in her husband with sudden violence  his wife made no reply but sat gazing in a hostile fashion at the bold dark eyes and stylish hat of the visitor  i should like to be strong said the latter smiling agreeably over at mr jobling  when i was younger said that gratified man i can assure you i didnt know my own strength as the saying is i used to hurt people just in play like without knowing it i used to have a hug like a bear  fancy being hugged like that said the girl how awful she added hastily as she caught the eye of the speechless mrs jobling  like a bear repeated mr jobling highly pleased at the impression he had made im pretty strong now there aint many as im afraid of  he bent his arm and thoughtfully felt his biceps and mrs jobling almost persuaded herself that she must be dreaming as she saw the girl lean forward and pinch mr joblings arm mr jobling was surprised too but he had the presence of mind to bend the other  enormous said the girl and as hard as iron what a prizefighter youd have made  he dont want to do no prizefighting said mrs jobling recovering her speech hes a respectable married man  mr jobling shook his head over lost opportunities im too old he remarked  hes fortyseven said his wife  best age for a man in my opinion said the girl just entering his prime and a man is as old as he feels you know  mr jobling nodded acquiescence and observed that he always felt about twentytwo a state of affairs which he ascribed to regular habits and a great partiality for the company of young people  i was just twentytwo when i married he mused and my missis was just six months  you leave my age alone interrupted his wife trembling with passion im not so fond of telling my age to strangers  you told mine retorted mr jobling and nobody asked you to do that very free you was in coming out with mine  i aint the only one thats free breathed the quivering mrs jobling i ope your ankle is better she added turning to the visitor  much better thank you was the reply  got far to go queried mrs jobling  the girl nodded but i shall take a tram at the end of the street she said rising  mr jobling rose too and all that he had ever heard or read about etiquette came crowding into his mind a weekly journal patronized by his wife had three columns regularly but he taxed his memory in vain for any instructions concerning browneyed strangers with sprained ankles he felt that the path of duty led to the tramlines in a somewhat blundering fashion he proffered his services the girl accepted them as a matter of course  mrs jobling with lips tightly compressed watched them from the door the girl limping slightly walked along with the utmost composure but the bearing of her escort betokened a mind fully conscious of the scrutiny of the street  he returned in about half an hour and having this time to run the gauntlet of the street alone entered with a mien which caused his wifes complaints to remain unspoken the cough of mr brown a particularly contagious one still rang in his ears and he sat for some time in fierce silence  i see her on the tram he said at last her names robinsonmiss robinson  indeed said his wife  seems a nice sort o girl said mr jobling carelessly shes took quite a fancy to you  im sure im much obliged to her retorted his wife  illustration he astonished mrs jobling next day by the gift of a geranium  so iso i asked her to give you a look in now and then continued mr jobling filling his pipe with great care and she said she would itll cheer you up a bit  mrs jobling bit her lip and although she had never felt more fluent in her life said nothing her husband lit his pipe and after a rapid glance in her direction took up an old newspaper and began to read  he astonished mrs jobling next day by the gift of a geranium in full bloom surprise impeded her utterance but she thanked him at last with some warmth and after a little deliberation decided to put it in the bedroom  mr jobling looked like a man who has suddenly discovered a flaw in his calculations i was thinking of the front parlor winder he said at last  itll get more sun upstairs said his wife  she took the pot in her arms and disappeared her surprise when she came down again and found mr jobling rearranging the furniture and even adding a choice ornament or two from the kitchen was too elaborate to escape his notice  been going to do it for some time he remarked  mrs jobling left the room and strove with herself in the scullery she came back pale of face and with a gleam in her eye which her husband was too busy to notice  itll never look much till we get a new hearthrug she said shaking her head theyve got one at jacksons that would be just the thing and theyve got a couple of tall pink vases that would brighten up the fireplace wonderful theyre going for next to nothing too  mr joblings reply took the form of uncouth and disagreeable growlings after that phase had passed he sat for some time with his hand placed protectingly in his trouserpocket finally in a fierce voice he inquired the cost  ten minutes later in a state fairly evenly divided between pleasure and fury mrs jobling departed with the money wild yearnings for courage that would enable her to spend the money differently and confront the dismayed mr jobling in a new hat and jacket possessed her on the way but they were only yearnings twentyfive years experience of her husbands temper being a sufficient safeguard  miss robinson came in the day after as they were sitting down to tea mr jobling who was in his shirtsleeves just had time to disappear as the girl passed the window his wife let her in and after five remarks about the weather sat listening in grim pleasure to the efforts of mr jobling to find his coat he found it at last under a chair cushion and somewhat red of face entered the room and greeted the visitor  conversation was at first rather awkward the girls eyes wandered round the room and paused in astonishment on the pink vases the beauty of the rug also called for notice  yes theyre pretty good said mr jobling much gratified by her approval  beautiful murmured the girl what a thing it is to have money she said wistfully  i could do with some said mr jobling with jocularity he helped himself to bread and butter and began to discuss money and how to spend it his ideas favored retirement and a nice little place in the country  i wonder you dont do it said the girl softly  mr jobling laughed gingell and watson dont pay on those lines he said we do the work and they take the money  its always the way said the girl indignantly they have all the luxuries and the men who make the money for them all the hardships i seem to know the name gingell and watson i wonder where ive seen it  in the paper praps said mr jobling  advertising asked the girl  mr jobling shook his head robbery he replied seriously it was in last weeks paper somebody got to the safe and got away with nine hundred pounds in gold and banknotes  i remember now said the girl nodding did they catch them  no and not likely to was the reply  miss robinson opened her big eyes and looked round with an air of pretty defiance i am glad of it she said  glad said mrs jobling involuntarily breaking a selfimposed vow of silence glad  the girl nodded i like pluck she said with a glance in the direction of mr jobling and besides whoever took it had as much right to it as gingell and watson they didnt earn it  mrs jobling appalled at such ideas glanced at her husband to see how he received them the mans a thief she said with great energy and he wont enjoy his gains  i dare sayi dare say hell enjoy it right enough said mr jobling if he aint caught that is  i believe he is the sort of man i should like declared miss robinson obstinately  i dare say said mrs jobling and ive no doubt hed like you birds of a  thatll do said her husband peremptorily thats enough about it the guvnors can afford to lose it thats one comfort  he leaned over as the girl asked for more sugar and dropped a spoonful in her cup expressing surprise that she should like her tea so sweet miss robinson denying the sweetness proffered her cup in proof and mrs jobling sat watching with blazing eyes the antics of her husband as he sipped at it  sweets to the sweet he said gallantly as he handed it back  miss robinson pouted and raising the cup to her lips gazed ardently at him over the rim mr jobling who certainly felt not more than twentytwo that evening stole her cake and received in return a rap from a teaspoon mr jobling retaliated and mrs jobling unable to eat sat looking on in helpless fury at little arts of fascination which she had discardedat mr joblings earnest requestsoon after their marriage  illustration they offered mrs jobling her choice of at least a hundred plans for bringing him to his senses  by dint of considerable selfcontrol aided by an occasional glance from her husband she managed to preserve her calm until he returned from seeing the visitor to her tram then her pentup feelings found vent quietly scornful at first she soon waxed hysterical over his age and figure tears followed as she bade him remember what a good wife she had been to him loudly claiming that any other woman would have poisoned him long ago speedily finding that tears were of no avail and that mr jobling seemed to regard them rather as a tribute to his worth than otherwise she gave way to fury and in a fine but unpunctuated passage told him her exact opinion of miss robinson  its no good carrying on like that said mr jobling magisterially and whats more i wont have it  walking into my house and making eyes at my usband stormed his wife  so long as i dont make eyes at her theres no harm done retorted mr jobling i cant help her taking a fancy to me poor thing  id poor thing her said his wife  shes to be pitied said mr jobling sternly i know how she feels she cant help herself but shell get over it in time i dont suppose she thinks for a moment we have noticed herherher liking for me and im not going to have her feelings hurt  what about my feelings demanded his wife  you have got me mr jobling reminded her  the nine points of the law was mrs joblings only consolation for the next few days neighboring matrons exchanging sympathy for information wished strangely enough that mr jobling was their husband failing that they offered mrs jobling her choice of at least a hundred plans for bringing him to his senses  mr jobling who was a proud man met their hostile glances as he passed to and from his work with scorn until a day came when the hostility vanished and gave place to smiles never so many people in the street he thought as he returned from work certainly never so many smiles people came hurriedly from their back premises to smile at him and as he reached his door mr joe brown opposite had all the appearance of a human sunbeam tired of smiling faces he yearned for that of his wife she came out of the kitchen and met him with a look of sly content the perplexed mr jobling eyed her morosely  what are you laughing at me for he demanded  i wasnt laughing at you said his wife  she went back into the kitchen and sang blithely as she bustled over the preparations for tea her voice was feeble but there was a triumphant effectiveness about the high notes which perplexed the listener sorely he seated himself in the new easychairprocured to satisfy the supposed aesthetic tastes of miss robinsonand stared at the window  you seem very happy all of a sudden he growled as his wife came in with the tray  well why shouldnt i be inquired mrs jobling ive got everything to make me so  mr jobling looked at her in undisguised amazement  new easychair new vases and a new hearthrug explained his wife looking round the room did you order that little table you said you would  yes growled mr jobling  pay for it inquired his wife with a trace of anxiety  yes said mr jobling again  mrs joblings face relaxed i shouldnt like to lose it at the last moment she said you ave been good to me lately bill buying all these nice things theres not many women have got such a thoughtful husband as what i have  have you gone dotty or what inquired her bewildered husband  its no wonder people like you pursued mrs jobling ignoring the question and smiling again as she placed three chairs at the table ill wait a minute or two before i soak the tea i expect miss robinson wont be long and she likes it fresh  mr jobling to conceal his amazement and to obtain a little fresh air walked out of the room and opened the front door  cheer oh said the watchful mr brown with a benignant smile  mr jobling scowled at him  its all right said mr brown you go in and set down im watching for her  he nodded reassuringly and not having curiosity enough to accept the others offer and step across the road and see what he would get shaded his eyes with his hand and looked with exaggerated anxiety up the road mr jobling heavy of brow returned to the parlor and looked hard at his wife  shes late said mrs jobling glancing at the clock i do hope shes all right but i should feel anxious about her if she was my gal its a dangerous life  dangerous life said mr jobling roughly whats a dangerous life  why hers replied his wife with a nervous smile joe brown told me he followed her ome last night and this morning he found out all about her  the mention of mr browns name caused mr jobling at first to assume an air of indifference but curiosity overpowered him  what lies has he been telling he demanded  i dont think its a lie bill said his wife mildly putting two and two  what did he say cried mr jobling raising his voice  he said sheshes a lady detective stammered mrs jobling putting her handkerchief to her unruly mouth  a tec repeated her husband a lady tec  mrs jobling nodded yes bill shesheshe  well said mr jobling in exasperation  shes being employed by gingell and watson said his wife  mr jobling sprang to his feet and with scarlet face and clinched fists strove to assimilate the information and all its meaning  whatwhat did she come here for do you mean to tell me she thinks i took the money he said huskily after a long pause  mrs jobling bent before the storm i think she took a fancy to you bill she said timidly  mr jobling appeared to swallow something then he took a step nearer to her you let me see you laugh again thats all he said fiercely as for that jezzybill  there she is said his wife as a knock sounded at the door dont say anything to hurt her feelings bill you said she was to be pitied and it must be a hard life to ave to go round and flatter old married men i shouldnt like it  mr jobling past speech stood and glared at her then with an inarticulate cry he rushed to the front door and flung it open miss robinson fresh and bright stood smiling outside within easy distance a little group of neighbors were making conversation while opposite mr brown awaited events  what dyou want demanded mr jobling harshly  miss robinson who had put out her hand drew it back and gave him a swift glance his red face and knitted brows told their own story  oh she said with a winning smile will you please tell mrs jobling that i cant come to tea with her this evening  isnt there anything else youd like to say inquired mr jobling disdainfully as she turned away  the girl paused and appeared to reflect you can say that i am sorry to miss an amusing evening she said regarding him steadily goodby  mr jobling slammed the door     illustration a circular tour     a circular tour   illness said the night watchman slowly yes sailormen get ill sometimes but not aving the time for it that other people have and there being no doctors at sea they soon pick up agin ashore if a mans ill he goes to a horsepittle and as a nice nurse to wait on im at sea the mate comes down and tells im that there is nothing the matter with im and asks im if he aint ashamed of imself the only mate i ever knew that showed any feeling was one who ad been a doctor and ad gone to sea to better imself he didnt believe in medicine his idea was to cut things out and he was so kind and tender and so fond of is little box of knives and saws that you wouldnt ha thought anybody could ave had the art to say no to him but they did i remember im getting up at four oclock one morning to cut a mans leg off and at hapast three the chap was sitting up aloft with four pairs o trousers on and a belayingpin in his and  one chap i knew joe summers by name got so sick o work one vyge that he went mad not dangerous mad mind you just silly one thing he did was to pretend that the skipper was is little boy and foller im up unbeknown and pat his ead at last to pacify him the old man pretended that he was is little boy and a precious handful of a boy he was too i can tell you fust of all he showed is father ow they wrestled at school and arter that he showed im ow he arf killed another boy in fifteen rounds leastways he was going to but arter seven rounds joes madness left im all of a sudden and he was as right as ever he was  sailormen are more frequent ill ashore than at sea theyve got more time for it i spose old sam small a man you may remember by name as a pal o mine got ill once and like most ealthy men who get a little something the matter with em he made sure e was dying he was sharing a bedroom with ginger dick and peter russet at the time and early one morning he woke up groaning with a chill or something which he couldnt account for but which ginger thought might ha been partly caused through im sleeping in the fireplace  is that you sam ses ginger waking up with the noise and rubbing his eyes wots the matter  im dying ses sam with another awful groan goodby ginger  gooby ses ginger turning over and falling fast asleep agin  old sam picked imself up arter two or three tries and then he staggered over to peter russets bed and sat on the foot of it groaning until peter woke up very cross and tried to push im off with his feet  im dying peter ses sam and e rolled over and buried his face in the bedcloes and kicked peter russet who was a bit scared sat up in bed and called for ginger and arter he ad called pretty near a dozen times ginger arf woke up and asked im wot was the matter  poor old sams dying ses peter  i know ses ginger laying down and cuddling into the piller agin he told me just now ive bid im goodby  peter russet asked im where his art was but ginger was asleep agin then peter sat up in bed and tried to comfort sam and listened while e told im wot it felt like to die how e was ot and cold all over burning and shivering with pains in his inside that he couldnt describe if e tried  itll soon be over sam ses peter kindly and all your troubles will be at an end while me and ginger are knocking about at sea trying to earn a crust o bread to keep ourselves alive youll be quiet and at peace  sam groaned i dont like being too quiet he ses i was always one for a bit o funinnercent fun  peter coughed  you and ginger av been good pals ses sam its hard to go and leave you  weve all got to go some time or other sam ses peter soothinglike its a wonder to me with your habits that youve lasted as long as you ave  my habits ses sam sitting up all of a sudden why you monkeyfaced son of a seacook for two pins id chuck you out of the winder  dont talk like that on your deathbed ses peter very shocked  sam was going to answer im sharp agin but just then e got a pain which made im roll about on the bed and groan to such an extent that ginger woke up agin and got out o bed  pore old sam he ses walking across the room and looking at im ave you got any pain anywhere  pain ses sam pain im a mask o pains all over  ginger and peter looked at im and shook their eds and then they went a little way off and talked about im in whispers  he looks arf dead now ses peter coming back and staring at im lets take is clothes off ginger its more decent to die with em off  i think ill ave a doctor ses sam in a faint voice  youre past doctors sam ses ginger in a kind voice  better ave your last moments in peace ses peter and keep your money in your trouserpockets  you go and fetch a doctor you murderers ses sam groaning as peter started to undress im go on else ill haunt you with my ghost  ginger tried to talk to im about the sin o wasting money but it was all no good and arter telling peter wot to do in case sam died afore he come back he went off he was gone about arf an hour and then he come back with a sandyaired young man with red eyelids and a black bag  am i dying sir ses sam arter the doctor ad listened to his lungs and his art and prodded im all over  were all dying ses the doctor only some of usll go sooner than others  will he last the day sir ses ginger  the doctor looked at sam agin and sam held is breath while e waited for him to answer yes ses the doctor at last if he does just wot i tell him and takes the medicine i send im  he wasnt in the room arf an hour altogether and he charged pore sam a shilling but wot urt sam even more than that was to hear im go off downstairs whistling as cheerful as if there wasnt a dying man within a undred miles  peter and ginger dick took turns to be with sam that morning but in the arternoon the landladys mother an old lady who was almost as fat as sam imself came up to look arter im a bit she sat on a chair by the side of is bed and tried to amuse im by telling im of all the death beds shed been at and partikler of one man the living image of sam who passed away in his sleep it was past ten oclock when peter and ginger came ome but they found pore sam still awake and sitting up in bed holding is eyes open with his fingers  illustration she asked im whether ed got a fancy for any partikler spot to be buried in  sam had another shillingsworth the next day and is medicine was changed for the worse if anything he seemed a trifle better but the landladys mother wot came up to nurse im agin said it was a bad sign and that people often brightened up just afore the end she asked im whether ed got a fancy for any partikler spot to be buried in and talking about wot a lot o people ad been buried alive said shed ask the doctor to cut sams ead off to prevent mistakes she got quite annoyed with sam for saying supposing there was a mistake and he came round in the middle of it howd he feel and said there was no satisfying some people do wot you would  at the end o six days sam was still alive and losing a shilling a day to say nothing of buying is own beeftea and suchlike ginger said it was fair highway robbery and tried to persuade sam to go to a orsepittle where hed ave lovely nurses to wait on im hand and foot and wouldnt keep is best friends awake of a night making orrible noises  sam didnt take kindly to the idea at fust but as the doctor forbid im to get up although he felt much better and his money was wasting away he gave way at last and at seven oclock one evening he sent ginger off to fetch a cab to take im to the london horsepittle sam said something about putting is clothes on but peter russet said the horsepittle would be more likely to take him in if he went in the blanket and counterpane and at last sam gave way ginger and peter helped im downstairs and the cabman laid hold o one end o the blanket as they got to the streetdoor under the idea that he was helping and very near gave sam another chill  keep your hair on he ses as sam started on im itll be threeand six for the fare and ill take the money now  youll ave it when you get there ses ginger  ill ave it now ses the cabman i ad a fare die on the way once afore  gingerwho was minding sams money for im because there wasnt a pocket in the counterpanepaid im and the cab started it jolted and rattled over the stones but sam said the air was doing im good he kept is pluck up until they got close to the horsepittle and then e got nervous and e got more nervous when the cabman got down off is box and put his ed in at the winder and spoke to im  ave you got any partikler fancy for the london horsepittle he ses  no ses sam why  well i spose it dont matter if wot your mate ses is truethat youre dying ses the cabman  wot dye mean says sam  nothing ses the cabman only fust and last i spose ive driven five undred people to that orsepittle and only one ever came out aginand he was smuggled out in a breadbasket  sams flesh began to creep all over  its a pity they dont ave the same rules as charing cross horsepittle ses the cabman the doctors ave five pounds apiece for every patient that gets well there and the consequence is they aint ad the blinds down for over five months  drive me there ses sam  its a long way ses the cabman shaking his ed and it ud cost you another arf dollar spose you give the london a try  you drive to charing cross ses sam telling ginger to give im the arfdollar and look sharp these things aint as warm as they might be  the cabman turned his orse round and set off agin singing the cab stopped once or twice for a little while and then it stopped for quite a long time and the cabman climbed down off is box and came to the winder agin  im sorry mate he ses but did you see me speak to that party just now  the one you flicked with your whip ses ginger  no he was speaking to me ses the cabman the last one i mean  wot about it ses peter  hes the underporter at the horsepittle ses the cabman spitting and he tells me that every bed is bung full and two patients apiece in some of em  i dont mind sleeping two in a bed ses sam who was very tired and cold  no ses the cabman looking at im but wot about the other one  well whats to be done ses peter  you might go to guys ses the cabman thats as good as charing cross  i blieve youre telling a pack o lies ses ginger  come out o my cab ses the cabman very fierce come on all of you out you get  ginger and peter was for getting out but sam wouldnt ear of it it was bad enough being wrapped up in a blanket in a cab without being turned out in is bare feet on the pavement and at last ginger apologized to the cabman by saying e supposed if he was a liar he couldnt elp it the cabman collected three shillings more to go to guys orsepittle and arter a few words with ginger climbed up on is box and drove off agin  they were all rather tired of the cab by this time and going over waterloo bridge ginger began to feel uncommon thirsty and leaning out of the winder he told the cabman to pull up for a drink he was so long about it that ginger began to think he was bearing malice but just as he was going to tell im agin the cab pulled up in a quiet little street opposite a small pub ginger dick and peter went in and ad something and brought one out for sam they ad another arter that and ginger getting is good temper back agin asked the cabman to ave one  look lively about it ginger ses sam very sharp you forget ow ill i am  ginger said they wouldnt be two seconds and the cabman calling a boy to mind his orse they went inside it was a quiet little place but very cosey and sam peeping out of the winder could see all three of em leaning against the bar and making themselves comfortable twice he made the boy go in to hurry them up and all the notice they took was to go on at the boy for leaving the horse  pore old sam sat there hugging imself in the bedcloes and getting wilder and wilder he couldnt get out of the cab and e couldnt call to them for fear of people coming up and staring at im ginger smiling all over with appiness had got a big cigar on and was pretending to pinch the barmaids flowers and peter and the cabman was talking to some other chaps there the only change sam ad was when the boy walked the orse up and down the road  he sat there for an hour and then e sent the boy in agin this time the cabman lost is temper and arter chasing the boy up the road gave a young feller twopence to take is place and promised im another twopence when he came out sam tried to get a word with im as e passed but he wouldnt listen and it was pretty near arf an hour later afore they all came out talking and laughing  now for the orsepittle ses ginger opening the door come on peter dont keep pore old sam waiting all night  arf a tic ses the cabman arf a tic theres five shillings for waiting fust  wot ses ginger staring at im arter giving you all them drinks  five shillings ses the cabman two hours waiting at half a crown an hour thats the proper charge  ginger thought e was joking at fust and when he found e wasnt he called im all the names he could think of while peter russet stood by smiling and trying to think where e was and wot it was all about  pay im the five bob ginger and ave done with it ses pore sam at last i shall never get to the horsepittle at this rate  certinly not ses ginger not if we stay ere all night  pay im the five bob ses sam raising is voice its my money  you keep quiet ses ginger and speak when your spoke to get inside peter  peter wot was standing by blinking and smiling misunderstood im and went back inside the pub ginger went arter im to fetch im back and hearing a noise turned round and saw the cabman pulling sam out o the cab he was just in time to shove im back agin and for the next two or three minutes im and the cabman was ard at it sam was too busy holding is clothes on to do much and twice the cabman got im arf out and twice ginger got him back agin and bumped im back in is seat and shut the door then they both stopped and took breath  well see which gets tired fust ses ginger hold the door inside sam  the cabman looked at im and then e climbed up on to is seat and just as ginger ran back for peter russet drove off at full speed  pore sam leaned back in is seat panting and trying to wrap imself up better in the counterpane which ad got torn in the struggle they went through street arter street and e was just thinking of a nice warm bed and a kind nurse listening to all is troubles when e found they was going over london bridge  youve passed it he ses putting his ead out of the winder  the cabman took no notice and afore sam could think wot to make of it they was in the whitechapel road and arter that although sam kept putting his ead out of the winder and asking im questions they kept going through a lot o little back streets until e began to think the cabman ad lost is way they stopped at last in a dark little road in front of a brick wall and then the cabman got down and opened a door and led his orse and cab into a yard  do you call this guys horsepittle ses sam  hullo ses the cabman why i thought i put you out o my cab once  ill give you five minutes to drive me to the orsepittle ses sam arter that i shall go for the police  all right ses the cabman taking his orse out and leading it into a stable mind you dont catch cold  he lighted a lantern and began to look arter the orse and pore sam sat there getting colder and colder and wondering wot e was going to do  i shall give you in charge for kidnapping me he calls out very loud  kidnapping ses the cabman who do you think wants to kidnap you the gates open and you can go as soon as you like  sam climbed out of the cab and holding up the counterpane walked across the yard in is bare feet to the stable well will you drive me ome he ses  certinly not ses the cabman im going ome myself now its time you went cos im going to lock up  ow can i go like this ses sam bursting with passion aint you got any sense  well wot are you going to do

for two hours wait ses the cabman four shillings for the drive here and arf a crown for the stable thats fair aint it  sam said it wasas soon as he was able to speakand then the cabman gave im a truss of straw to lay on and a rug to cover im up with  and then calling imself a fool for being so tenderearted he left sam the lantern and locked the stabledoor and went off  it seemed like a orrid dream to sam and the only thing that comforted im was the fact that he felt much better his illness seemed to ave gone and arter hunting round the stable to see whether e could find anything to eat e pulled the rug over him and went to sleep  he was woke up at six oclock in the morning by the cabman opening the door there was a lovely smell o hot tea from a tin he ad in one and and a lovelier smell still from a plate o bread and butter and bloaters in the other sam sniffed so ard that at last the cabman noticed it and asked im whether he ad got a cold when sam explained he seemed to think a minute or two and then e said that it was is breakfast but sam could ave it if e liked to make up the money to a pound  take it or leave it he ses as sam began to grumble  poor sam was so ungry he took it and it done him good by the time he ad eaten it he felt as right as ninepence and e took such a dislike to the cabman e could hardly be civil to im and when the cabman spoke about the letter to ginger dick he spoke up and tried to bate im down to sevenandsix  you write that letter for a pound ses the cabman looking at im very fierce or else you can walk ome in your counterpane with arf the boys in london follering you and trying to pull it off  sam rose im to seventeenandsix but it was all no good and at last e wrote a letter to ginger dick telling im to give the cabman a suit of clothes and a pound  and look sharp about it he ses i shall expect em in arf an hour  youll ave em if youre lucky when i come back to change orses at four oclock ses the cabman dye think ive got nothing to do but fuss about arter you  why not drive me back in the cab ses sam  cos i wasnt born yesterday ses the cabman  he winked at sam and then whistling very cheerful took his orse out and put it in the cab he was so goodtempered that e got quite playful and sam ad to tell him that when e wanted to ave his legs tickled with a straw hed let im know  some people cant take a int and as the cabman wouldnt beave imself sam walked into a shed that was handy and pulled the door to and he stayed there until he eard im go back to the stable for is rug it was only a yard or two from the shed to the cab and ardly thinking wot he was doing sam nipped out and got into it and sat huddled up on the floor  he sat there holding is breath and not daring to move until the cabman ad shut the gate and was driving off up the road and then e got up on the seat and lolled back out of sight the shops were just opening the sun was shining and sam felt so well that e was thankful that e hadnt got to the horsepittle arter all  the cab was going very slow and two or three times the cabman arf pulled up and waved his whip at people wot he thought wanted a cab but at last an old lady and gentleman standing on the edge of the curb with a big bag held up their ands to im the cab pulled in to the curb and the old gentleman ad just got hold of the door and was trying to open it when he caught sight of sam  why youve got a fare he ses  no sir ses the cabman  but i say you ave ses the old gentleman  the cabman climbed down off is box and looked in at the winder and for over two minutes he couldnt speak a word he just stood there looking at sam and getting purpler and purpler about the face  drive on cabby ses sam wot are you stopping for  the cabman tried to tell im but just then a policeman came walking up to see wot was the matter and e got on the box agin and drove off cabmen love policemen just about as much as cats love dogs and he drove down two streets afore he stopped and got down agin to finish is remarks  not so much talk cabman ses sam who was beginning to enjoy imself else i shall call the police  are you coming out o my cab ses the cabman or ave i got to put you out  you put me out ses sam who ad tied is clothes up with string while e was in the stable and ad got his arms free  the cabman looked at im elpless for a moment and then he got up and drove off agin at fust sam thought e was
