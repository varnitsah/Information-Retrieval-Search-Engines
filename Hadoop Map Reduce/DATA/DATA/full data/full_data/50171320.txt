to the reader  this book has been written for children i have no shame in acknowledging that i who wrote it am also a child for since i can remember my eyes have always grown big at tales of the marvelous and my heart is still accustomed to go pitapat when i read of impossible adventures it is the nature of children to scorn realities which crowd into their lives all too quickly with advancing years childhood is the time for fables for dreams for joy  these stories are not true they could no be true and be so marvelous no one is expected to believe them they were meant to excite laughter and to gladden the heart  perhaps some of those big grownup people will poke fun of usat you for reading these nonsense tales of the magical monarch and at me for writing them never mind many of the big folk are still childreneven as you and i we cannot measure a child by a standard of size or age the big folk who are children will be our comrades the others we need not consider at all for

very beginning of this history first who is the monarch of mo and why is he called the magical monarch and where is mo anyhow and why have you never heard of it before and can it be reached by a railroad or a trolleycar or must one walk all the way  these questions i realize should be answered before we that we means you and the book can settle down for a comfortable reading of all the wonders and astonishing adventures i shall endeavor faithfully to relate  in the first place the monarch of mo is a very pleasant personage holding the rank of king he is not very tall nor is he very short he is midway between fat and lean he is delightfully jolly when he is not sad and seldom sad if he can possibly be jolly how old he may be i have never dared to inquire but when we realize that he is destined to live as long as the valley of mo exists we may reasonably suppose the monarch of mo is exactly as old as his native land and no one in mo has ever reckoned up the years to see how many they have been so we will just say that the monarch of mo and the valley of mo are each a part of the other and can not be separated  he is not called the magical monarch because he deals in magicfor he doesnt deal in magic but he leads such a queer life in such a queer country that his history will surely seem magical to us who inhabit the civilized places of the world and think that anything we can not find a reason for must be due to magic the life of the monarch of mo seems simple enough to him you may be sure for he knows no other existence and our ways of living could he know of them would doubtless astonish him greatly  the land of mo which is ruled by the king we call the magical monarch is often spoken of as the beautiful valley if they would only put it on the maps of our geographies and paint it pink or light green and print a big round dot where the kings castle stands it would be easy enough to point out to you its exact location but i can not find the valley of mo in any geography i have examined so i suspect the men who made these instructive books really know nothing about mo else it would surely be on the maps  of one thing i am certain that no other country included in the maps is so altogether delightful as the beautiful valley of mo  the sun shines all the time and its rays are perfumed the people who live in the valley do not sleep because there is no night everything they can possibly need grows on the trees so they have no use for money at all and that saves them a deal of worry  there are no poor people in this quaint valley when a person desires a new hat he waits till one is ripe and then picks it and wears it without asking anybodys permission if a lady wishes a new ring she examines carefully those upon the ringtree and when she finds one that fits her finger she picks it and wears it upon her hand in this way they procure all they desire  there are two rivers in the land of mo one of which flows milk of a very rich quality some of the islands in milk river are made of excellent cheese and the people are welcome to spade up this cheese whenever they wish to eat it in the little pools near the bank where the current does not flow swiftly delicious cream rises to the top of the milk and instead of waterlilies great strawberry leaves grow upon the surface and the ripe red berries lie dipping their noses into the cream as if inviting you to come and eat them the sand that forms the river bank is pure white sugar and all kinds of candies and bonbons grow thick on the low bushes so that any one may pluck them easily  these are only a few of the remarkable things that exist in the beautiful valley  the people are merry lighthearted folk who live in beautiful houses of pure crystal where they can rest themselves and play their games and go in when it rains for it rains in mo as it does everywhere else only it rains lemonade and the lightning in the sky resembles the most beautiful fireworks and the thunder is usually a chorus from the opera of tannhauser  no one ever dies in this valley and the people are always young and beautiful there is the king and a queen besides several princes and princesses but it is not much use being a prince in mo because the king can not die therefore a prince is a prince to the end of his days and his days never end  strange things occur in this strange land as you may imagine and while i relate some of these you will learn more of the peculiar features of the beautiful valley    the second surprise  the strange adventures of the kings head   a good many years ago the magical monarch of mo became annoyed by the purple dragon which came down from the mountains and ate up a patch of his best chocolate caramels just as they were getting ripe  so the king went out to the swordtree and picked a long sharp sword and tied it to his belt and went away to the mountains to fight the purple dragon  the people all applauded him saying one to another  our king is a good king he will destroy this naughty purple dragon and we shall be able to eat the caramels ourselves  but the dragon was not alone naughty it was big and fierce and strong and did not want to be destroyed at all  therefore the king had a terrible fight with the purple dragon and cut it with his sword in several places so that the raspberry juice which ran in its veins squirted all over the ground  it is always difficult to kill dragons they are by nature thickskinned and tough as doubtless every one has heard besides you must not forget that this was a purple dragon and all scientists who have studied deeply the character of dragons say those of a purple color at the most disagreeable to fight with so all the kings cutting and slashing had no effect upon the monster other than to make him angry forgetful of the respect due to a crowned king the wicked dragon presently opening wide its jaws and bit his majestys head clean off his body then he swallowed it  of course the king realized it was useless to continue to fight after that for he could not see where the dragon was so he turned and tried to find his way back to his people but at every other step he would bump into a tree which made the naughty dragon laugh at him furthermore he could not tell in which direction he was going which is an unpleasant feeling under any circumstances  at last some of the people came to see if the king had succeeded in destroying the dragon and found their monarch running around in a circle bumping into trees and rocks but not getting a step nearer home so they took his hand and led him back to the palace where every one was filled with sorrow at the sad sight of the headless king indeed his devoted subjects for the first time in their lives came as near to weeping as an inhabitant of the valley of mo can  never mind said the king cheerfully i can get along very well without a head and as a matter of fact the loss has its advantages i shall not be obliged to brush my hair or clean my teeth or wash my ears so do not grieve i beg of you but be happy and joyful as you were before which showed the king had a good heart and after all a good heart is better than a head any say  the people hearing him speak out of his neck for he had no mouth immediately began to laugh which in a short time led to their being as happy as ever  but the queen was not contented  my love she said to him i can not kiss you any more and that will break my heart  thereupon the king sent word throughout the valley that any one who could procure for him a new head should wed one of the princesses  the princesses were all exceedingly pretty girls and so it was not long before one man made a very nice head out of candy and brought it to the king it did not look exactly like the old head but the efface was very sweet nevertheless so the king put it on and the queen kissed it at once with much satisfaction  the young man had put a pair of glass eyes in the head with which the king could see very well after he got used to them  according to the royal promise the young man was now called into the palace and asked to take his pick of the princesses there were all so sweet and ladylike that he had some trouble in making a choice but at last he took the biggest thinking that he would thus secure the greatest reward and they were married amid great rejoicing  but a few days afterward the king was caught out in a rainstorm and before he could get home his new head had melted in the great shower of lemonade that fell only the glass eyes were left and these he put in his pocket and went sorrowfully to tell the queen of his new misfortune  then another young man who wanted to marry a princess made the king a head out of dough sticking in it the glass eyes and the king tried it on and found that it fitted very well so the young man was given the next biggest princess  but the following day the sun chance to shine extremely hot and when the king walked out it baked his dough head into bread at which the monarch felt very lightheaded and when the birds saw the bread they flew down from the trees perched upon the kings shoulder and quickly ate up his new head all but the glass eyes  again the good king was forced to go home to the queen without a head and the lady firmly declared that this time her husband must have a head warranted to last at least as long as the honeymoon of the young man who made it which was not at all unreasonable under the circumstances  so a request was sent to all loyal subjects throughout the valley asking them to find a head for their king that was neat and substantial  in the meantime the king had a rather hard time of it when he wished to go any place he was obliged to hold out in front of him between his thumbs and fingers the glass eyes that they might guide his footsteps this as you may imagine made his majesty look rather undignified and dignity is very important to every royal personage  at last a woodchopper in the mountains made a head out of wood and sent it to the king it was neatly carved besides being solid and durable moreover it fitted the monarchs neck to the t so the king rummaged in his pocket and found the glass eyes and when these were put in the new head the king announced his satisfaction  there was only one drawbackhe couldnt smile as the wooden face was too stiff and it was funny to hear his majesty laughing heartily while his face maintained a solemn expression but the glass eyes twinkled merrily and every one knew that he was the same kindhearted monarch of old although he had become of necessity rather hardheaded  then the king sent word to the woodchopper to come to the palace and take his pick of the princesses and preparations were at once begun for the wedding  but the woodchopper on his way to the court unfortunately passed by the dwelling of the purple dragon and stopped to speak to the monster  now it seems that when the dragon had swallowed the kings head the unusual meal made the beast ill it was more accustomed to berries and caramels for dinner than to heads and the sharp points of the kings crown which was firmly fastened to the head pricked the dragons stomach and made the creature miserable after a few days of suffering the dragon disgorged the head and not knowing what else to do with it locked it up in a cupboard and put the key in its pocket  when the dragon met the woodchopper and learned he had made a new head for the king and as a reward was to wed one of the princesses the monster became very angry it resolved to do a wicked thing which will not surprise you when you remember the beasts purple color  step into my parlor and rest yourself said the dragon politely wicked people are most polite when they mean mischief  thank you ill stop for a few minutes replied the woodchopper but i can not stay long as i am expected at court  when he had entered the parlor the dragon suddenly opened its mouth and snapped off the poor woodchoppers head being warned by experience however it did not swallow the head but placed it in the cupboard then the dragon took from a shelf the kings head and glued it on the woodchoppers neck  now said the beast with a cruel laugh you are the king go home and claim your wife and your kingdom  the poor woodchopper was much amazed for at first he did not really know which he was the king or the woodchopper  he looked in the mirror and seeing the king made a low bow then the kings head thought who am i bowing to there is no one greater than the king and so at once there began a conflict between the woodchoppers heart and the kings head  the dragon was mightily pleased at the result of its wicked stratagem and having pushed the bewildered woodchopper out of the castle immediately sent him on his way to the court  when the poor man neared the town the people ran out and said why this is the king come back again all hail your majesty  all nonsense returned the woodchopper i am only a poor man with the kings head on my shoulders you can easily see it isnt mine for its crooked the dragon didnt glue it on straight  where then is your own head they asked  locked up in the dragons cupboard replied the poor fellow beginning to weep  here cried the kings head stop this you mustnt cry out of my eyes the king never weeps  i beg pardon your majesty said the woodchopper meekly ill not do it again  well see that you dont returned the head more cheerfully  the people were greatly amazed at this and took the woodchopper to the palace where all was soon explained  when the queen saw the kings head she immediately kissed it but the king rebuked her saying she must kiss only him  but it is your head said the poor queen  probably it is replied the king but it is on another man you must confine yourself to kissing my wooden head  im sorry sighed the queen for i like to kiss the real head best  and so you shall said the kings head i dont approve your kissing that wooden head at all  the poor lady looked from one to the other in perplexity finally a happy thought occurred to her  why dont you trade heads she asked  just the thing cried the king and the woodchopper consenting the exchange was made and the monarch of mo found himself in possession of his own head again whereat he was so greatly pleased that he laughed long and merrily  the woodchopper however did not even smile he couldnt because of the wooden face the head he had made for the king he now was compelled to wear himself  bring hither the princesses commanded the king this good man shall choose his bride at once for he has restored to me my own head  but when the princesses arrived and saw that the woodchopper had a wooden head they each and all refused to marry him and begged so hard to escape that the king was in a quandary  i promised him one of my daughters he argued and a king never breaks his word  but he hadnt a wooden head then explained one of the girls  the king realized the truth of this indeed when he came to look carefully at the wooden head he did not blame his daughters for not wishing to marry it should he force one of them to consent it was not unlikely she would call her husband a blockheada term almost certain to cause trouble in any family  after giving the matter deep thought the king resolved to go to the purple dragon and oblige it to give up the woodchoppers head  so all the fighting men in the kingdom were got together and having picked ripe swords off the swordtrees they marched in a great body to the dragons castle  now the purple dragon realized that if it attempted to fight all this army it would perhaps be cut to pieces so it retired within its castle and refused to come out  the woodchopper was a brave man  ill go in and fight the dragon alone he said and in he went by this time the dragon was both frightened and angry and the moment it saw the man it rushed forward and made a snap at his head  the wooden head came off at once and the dragons long sharp teeth got stuck in the wood and would not come out again so the monster was unable to do anything but flop its tail and groan  the woodchopper now ran to the cupboard took out his head and placed it upon his shoulders where it belonged then he proudly walked out of the castle and was greeted with loud shouts by the army which carried him back in triumph to the kings palace  and now that he wore his own head again one of the prettiest of the young princesses willingly agreed to marry him so the wedding ceremony was performed amidst great rejoicing    the third surprise  the tramp dog and the monarchs lost temper   one day the monarch of mo having nothing better to do resolved to go hunting blackberries among the bushes that grew at the foot of the mountains  so he put on an old crown that would not get tarnished if it rained and having found a tin pail in the pantry started off without telling any one where he was going  for some distance the path was a nice smooth taffy that was very agreeable to walk on but as he got nearer the mountains the ground became gravelly the stones being jacksonballs and gumdrops so that his boots which were a little green when he picked them began to hurt his feet  but the king was not easily discouraged and kept on until he found the blackberry bushes when he immediately began to fill his pail the berries being remarkably big and sweet  while thus occupied he heard a sound of footsteps coming down the mountain side and presently a little dog ran out from the bushes and trotted up to him  now there were no dogs at all in mo and the king had never seen a creature like this before therefore he was greatly surprised and said  what are you and where do you come from  the dog also was surprised at this question and looked suspiciously at the kings tin pail for many times wicked boys had tied such a pail to the end of his tail in fact that was the reason he had run away from home and found his way by accident to the valley of mo  my name is prince replied the gravely and i have come from a country beyond the mountains and the desert  indeed are you in truth a prince exclaimed the monarch then you will be welcome in my kingdom where we always treat nobility with proper respect but why do you have four feet  because six would be too many replied the dog  but i have only two said the king  i am sorry said the dog who was something of a wag because where i come from it is more fashionable to walk on four feet  i like to be in the fashion remarked the king thoughtfully but what am i to do having only two legs  why i suppose you could walk on your hands and feet returned the dog with a laugh  so i will said the king being pleased with the idea and you shall come to the palace with me and teach me all the fashions of the country from whence you came  the king got down on his hands and knees and was delighted to find he could get along in this way very nicely  how am i to carry my pail he asked  in your mouth of course replied the dog this suggestion seeming a happy one the king took the pail in his mouth and they started back toward the palace but when his majesty came to the gumdrops and jacksonballs they hurt his hands and knees so that he groaned aloud but the dog only laughed finally they reached a place where it was quite muddy of course the mud was only jelly but it hadnt dried up since the last rain the dog jumped over the place nimbly enough but when the king tried to do likewise he failed and came down into the jelly with both hands and knees and stuck fast  now the monarch had a very good temper which he carried in his vest pocket but as he passed over the gumdrop pebbles on his hands and knees this temper dropped out of his pocket and having lost it he became very angry at the dog for getting him into such a scrape  so he began to scold and when he opened his mouth the pail dropped out and the berries were all spilled this made the dog laugh more than ever at which the king pulled himself out of the jelly jumped to his feet and began to chase the dog as fast as he could finally the dog climbed a tall tree where the king could not reach him and when safe among the branches he looked down and said see how foolish a man becomes who tries to be in fashion rather than live as nature intended he should you can no more be a dog than i can be a king so hereafter if you are wise you will be content to walk on two legs  there is much truth in what you say replied the monarch of mo come with me to the palace and you shall be forgiven indeed we shall have a fine feast in honor of your arrival  so the dog climbed down from the tree and followed the king to the palace where all the courtiers were astonished to see so queer an animal and made a great favorite of him  after dinner the king invited the dog to take a walk around the grounds of the royal mansion and they started out merrily enough but the kings boots had begun to hurt him again for as they did not fit being picked green they had rubbed his toes until he had corns on them so when they reached the porch in front of the palace the king asked  my friend what is good for corns  tight boots replied the dog laughing but they are not very good for your feet  now the king not yet having found his lost temper became exceedingly angry at this poor jest so he rushed at the dog and gave it a tremendous kick  up into the air like a ball flew the dog while the king having hurt his toe by the kick sat down on the doorstep and nursed his foot while he watched the dog go farther and farther up until it seemed like a tiny speck against the blue of the sky  i must have kicked harder than i thought said the king ruefully there he goes out of sight and i shall never see him again  he now limped away into the back garden where he picked a new pair of boots that would not hurt his feet and while he was gone the dog began to fall down again of course he fell faster than he went up and finally landed with a crash exactly on the kings doorstep but so great was the force of the fall and so hard the doorstep that the poor dog was flattened out like a pancake and could not move a bit  when the king came back he said  hullo some kind friend has brought me a new doormat as a present and he leaned down and stroked the soft hair with much pleasure then he wiped his feet on the new mat and went into the palace to tell the queen  when her majesty saw the nice soft doormat she declared it was too good to be left outside so she brought it into the parlor and put it on the floor before the fireplace  the good king was sorry he had treated the dog so harshly and for fear he might do some other dreadful thing he went back to the place where he had lost his temper and searched until he found it again when he put it carefully away in his pocket where it would stay  then he returned to the palace an entered the parlor but as he passed the mat his new boots were so clumsy he stumbled against the edge and pushed the mat together into a roll  immediately the dog gave a bark got upon its legs and said  well this is better now i can breathe again but while i was so flat i could not draw a single breath  the monarch and his queen were much surprised to find that what they had taken for a mat was only the dog that had fallen so flat on their doorstep but they could not forbear laughing at his queer appearance for as the king had kicked the mat on the edge the dog was more than six feet long and no bigger around than a leadpencil which brought its font legs so far from its rear legs that it could scarcely turn around in the room without getting tangled up  but it is better than being a doormat said the dog and the king and queen agreed with him in this  then the king went away to tell the people he had found the dog again and when he left the palace he slammed the front door behind him the dog had started to follow the king out so when the front door slammed it hit the poor animal so sharp a blow on the nose that it pushed his body together again and lo and behold there was the dog in his natural shape just as he was before the king kicked him  after this the dog and the king agreed very well for the king was careful not to kick since he had recovered his temper and the dog took care not to say anything that would provoke the king to anger  and one day the dog saved the kingdom and all the valley of mo from destruction as i shall tell you another time    the fourth surprise  the peculiar pains of fruitcake island   prince zingle who was the eldest of all the princes of the valley of mo at one time became much irritated because the king his father would not allow him to milk the cow with the golden horns this cow was a great favorite with the king because she gave as large a quantity of icecream at a milking as an ordinary cow does of milk and in the warm days this was an agreeable luxury the king liked to keep the cow with the golden horns for his own use and that of the queen so prince zingle thought he was being abused having a great fondness for icecream himself  to be sure there was the great fountain of icecream sodawater playing constantly in the courtyard which was free to every one but the prince longed for what he could not have  therefore being filled with anger against his father the king he wandered away until he chanced to come near to the castle of the purple dragon  when the wicked monster saw the prince it decided that here was a splendid opportunity to make mischief so it said politely  good morning king zingle  i am not a kingi am only a prince replied zingle  what not a king exclaimed the dragon as if surprised that is too bad  i can never be a king while my father lives continued the prince and it is impossible for him to die so what can i do  since you ask my advice i will tell you answered the naughty dragon down near rootbeer river where the peanut trees grow is a very deep hole in the ground you must get the king to go and look into this hole and while he is leaning over the edge push him in of course he will not die for that as you say is impossible but no one will know where to find him so your father being out of the way you will be king in his place  that is surely good advice said the prince and i will go and do it at once then the cow with the golden horns will be mine and i shall become the monarch of mo  the prince turned to go back to the palace and as soon as he was out of sight the horrid dragon laughed to think what a fool it had made of the boy  when zingle saw his father he called him aside and said  your majesty i have discovered something very funny at the bottom of the hole near the peanut trees come and see what it is  so the king went with the prince without suspecting his evil design and while he leaned over the hole the prince gave him a sudden push the next moment down fell the monarch of moway to the bottom  then prince zingle went back to the palace and began to milk the cow with the golden horns  now when the king found himself at the bottom of the hole he at first did not know what to do so he sat down and thought about it presently a happy idea came into his head he knew if only he was at the other end of the hole he would be at the top instead of the bottom and could make his escape so the king took hold of the hole and exerting all his strength turned the hole upside down being now at the top he stepped upon the ground and walked back to the palace where he caught prince zingle milking the cow with the golden horns  oh ho he said you wish to be king do you well well see about that then he took the naughty prince by the ear and led him into the palace where he locked him up in a room from which he could not escape  the king now sat himself down in an easy chair and began to think on how he could best punish the prince but after an hour of deep thought he was unable to decide on anything that seemed a sufficient chastisement for so great an offense  at last he resolved to consult the wise donkey  the wise donkey lived in a pretty little house away at the end of the valley for he didnt like to mix with the gay life at the court he had not always been wise but at one time was a very stupid donkey indeed and he acquired his wisdom in this way  one friday afternoon just as school was letting out the stupid donkey strayed into the schoolhouse and the teachers and scholars were all so anxious to get home that they never noticed the donkey but locked him up in the schoolhouse and went away without knowing he was there  no one came into the building from friday afternoon until monday morning so the donkey got very hungry and certainly would have starved had he not chanced to taste of a geography that was sticking out from one of the desks  the hungry donkey decided it was not so very bad so he ate it all up then he ate an arithmetic an algebra and two first readers after that he lay down and went to sleep but becoming hungry again he awoke and commenced on the school library which he completely devoured this library comprised all the solid and substantial wisdom in the valley of mo and when the janitor opened the schoolhouse door on monday morning all the books of learning in the whole land had been eaten up by the stupid donkey  you can readily understand that after he had digested all this knowledge he became very wise and thereafter the king and the people often consulted the wise donkey when their own intelligence was at fault  so now the monarch went to the donkeys house and told him of the princes wickedness asking how he could best punish him  the wise donkey thought about the matter for a moment and then replied  i do not know a worse punishment than a pain in the stomach among the books i ate in the schoolhouse was a trigonometry and before i had digested it i suffered very severe pains indeed  but i can not feed the prince a trigonometry returned the king you ate the last one yourself  true answered the donkey but there are other things that cause pain in the stomach you know there is a certain island in rootbeer river that is made of fruit cake of a very rich quality i advise you to put the prince on this island and allow him nothing to eat except the fruit cake presently he will have violent pains in his stomach and will be punished as greatly as you could desire  the king was well pleased with this plan and having thanked the donkey for his wise advice hurried back to the palace  prince zingle was now brought from his room and rowed in a boat to the fruit cake island in rootbeer river where he was left without any way to escape he knew how to swim to be sure but it was forbidden by law to swim in the rootbeer as many people came to this river to drink  you shall stay here said the king sternly until you are sorry for your wickedness and you shall have nothing to eat but fruit cake  the prince laughed because he thought the punishment was no punishment at all when the king had rowed away in the boat and zingle was left alone he said to himself  why this is delightful i shall have a jolly time here and can eat all the cake i want without any one scolding me for being greedy  he broke off a large piece of the island where the raisins and citron were thickest and commenced to eat it but after a time he became tired of eating nothing but fruit cake and longed for something to go with it but the island did not contain a single thing except the cake of which it was composed  presently prince zingle began to have a pain inside him he paid no attention to it at first thinking it would pass away but instead it grew more severe so that he began to cry out but no one heard him  the pain steadily increased and the prince wept and rolled on the ground and began to feel exceeding sorry he had been so wicked finally he seized the telephone which was connected with the palace and called up the king  hullo said the kings voice in reply whats wanted  i have a terrible pain said the prince with a groan and im very sorry indeed that i pushed your majesty down the hole if youll only take me off this dreadful island ill be the best prince in all the valley from this time forth  so the king sent the boat and had the prince brought back to the palace where he forgave his naughty actions being a kind parent he next fed his suffering son a blossom from a medicine tree which quickly relieved his pain and led him to appreciate the pleasure of repentance    the fifth surprise  the monarch celebrates his birthday   there were great festivities in the valley of mo when the king had a birthday the jolly monarch was born so many years ago that so every one had forgotten the date one of the wise men said the king was born in february another declared it was in may and a third figured the great event happened in october so the king issued a royal decree that he should have three birthdays every year in order to be on the safe side and whenever he happened to think of it he put in an odd birthday or two for luck the kings birthdays came to be regarded as very joyful events for on these occasions festivities of unusual magnificence were held and everybody in the kingdom was invited to participate  on one occasion the king suddenly recollecting he had not celebrated his birthday for several weeks announced a royal festival on a most elaborate scale the creampuff crop was an unusually large one and the bushes were hanging full of the delicious ripe puffs which were highly prized by the people of mo  so all the maidens got out their best dresses and brightest ribbons and the young men carefully brushed their hair and polished their boots and soon the streets leading to the palace were thronged with gay merrymakers  when the guests were all assembled a grand feast was served in which the newlypicked cream puffs were an important item  then the king stood up at the head of the table and ordered his ruby casket to be brought him and when the people heard this they at once became quiet and attentive for the ruby casket was one of the most curious things in the valley it was given the king many years before by the sorceress maetta and whenever it was opened something was found in it that no living person had seen before  so the people and even the king himself always watched the opening of the ruby casket with much curiosity for they never knew what would be disclosed  the king placed the casket on a small table before him and then after a solemn look at the expectant faces he said slowly  gigglegagglegoo which was the magic word that opened the box  at once the lid flew back and the king peered within and exclaimed ha  this made the guests more excited than before for they did not know what he was saying ha about and they held their breaths when the king put his thumb and finger into the box and drew out a little wooden man about as big as my finger he wore a blue jacket and a red cap and held a little brass horn in his hand  the king stood the wooden man upon the table and then reached within the box and brought out another wooden man dressed just the same as the other and also holding a horn in his hand this the king stood beside the first wooden man and then took out another and another until ten little wooden men were standing in a row on the table holding drums and cymbals and horns in their small stiff hands  i declare said the king when he had stood them all up its a little german band but what a shame it is they can not play  no sooner had the king uttered the word play than every little wooden man put his horn to his mouth or beat his drum or clashed his cymbal and immediately they began to play such delicious music that all the people were delighted and even the king clapped his hands in applause  just then from out the casket leaped a tiny baby elephant about as large as a mouse and began capering about on its toes it was dressed in short fluffy skirts like those worn by a balletdancer and it danced so funnily that all who saw it roared with laughter  when the elephant stopped to rest two pretty green frogs sprang from the casket and began to play leapfrog before the astonished guests who had never before seen such a thing as a frog the little green strangers jumped over each other quick as a flash and finally one of them jumped down the others throat then as the baby elephant opened his mouth to yawn the remaining frog jumped down the elephants throat  the audience was so much amused at this feat that the baby elephant thought he would see what he could do to please them so he stood on his head and gave a great jump and disappeared down his own throat leaving the musicians to play by themselves  then all the young men caught the girls about their waists and began spinning around in a pretty dance of their own and the fun continued until they were tired out  the king thanked the tiny wooden musicians and put them back in the ruby casket he did not offer to take up a collection for them there being no money of any kind in the valley of mo the casket was then carried back to the royal treasury where it was guarded with much care when not in use  just then a young man approached the king asking permission for the people to skate on the crystal lake and his majesty graciously consented  as it was never cold in the kingdom of mo there was of course no ice for skating but the crystal lake was composed of sugarsyrup and the sun had candied the surface of the lake so it had become solid enough to skate on and was moreover as smooth as glass  it was not often the king allowed skating there for he feared some one might break through the crust but as it was his birthday he could refuse the people nothing so presently hundreds of the boys and girls were skating swiftly on the crystal lake and having rare sport for it was just as good as ice without being cold or damp  in the center there was one place where the crust was quite thin and just as the merriment was at its height crack went the iceor candy ratherand down into the sugarsyrup sank the princess truella and the prince jollikin and the kings royal chamberlain nuphsed  down and down they went until they reached the bottom of the lake and there they stood stuck fast in the syrup and unable to move a bit while all the people gathered on the shore to look at them the lake being as clear as the clearest water  of course this calamity put an end to further skating and the king rushed around asking every one how he could get his daughter and his son and his royal chamberlain out of the mass but no one could tell him  finally the king consulted the wise donkey and after he had thought the matter over and consulted his learning the donkey advised his majesty to fish for them  fish exclaimed the king how can we do that  take a fishline and put a sinker on it to make it sink through the syrup then bait the end of the line with the thing that each one of them likes best in that way you can catch hold of them and draw them out of the lake  well said the king ill try it for of course you know what you are talking about  have you ever eaten a geography demanded the wise donkey  no said the king  well i have declared the donkey haughtily and what i dont know about lakes and such things isnt in the geography  so the king went back to the crystal lake and got a strong fishline which he tied to the end of a long pole then he put a sinker on the end of the line and was ready for the bait  what does the princess truella like best he asked the queen  im sure i do not know replied the royal lady but you might try her with a kiss  so one of the nicest young men sent a kiss to the princess and the king tied it to the end of the line and put it in the lake the sinker carried it down through the sugarsyrup until the kiss was just before the sweet red lips of the pretty princess she took the kiss at once as the queen had guessed and the king pulled up the line with the princess at the end of it until he finally landed her on the shore  then all the people shouted for joy and the queen took the princess truella home to change her clothes for they were very sticky  what does the prince jollikin like best asked the king  a laugh replied a dozen at once for every one knew the princes failing  then one of the girls laughed quite hard and the king tied it to the end of the line and dropped it into the lake the prince caught the laugh at once and was quickly drawn from the syrup and likewise sent home to change his clothes  then the king looked around on the people and asked  what does the chamberlain nuphsed like best  but they were all silent for nuphsed liked so many things it was difficult to say which he liked best so again the king was obliged to go to the wise donkey in order to find out how he should bait the line to catch the royal chamberlain  the wise donkey happened to be busy that day over his own affairs and was annoyed at being consulted so frequently without receiving anything in return for his wisdom but he pretended to consider the matter as was his wont and said  i believe the royal chamberlain is fond of apples try to catch him with a red apple  at this the king and his people hunted all over the kingdom and at last found a tree with one solitary red apple growing on a little branch nearly at the top but unfortunately some one had sawed off the trunk of the tree close up to the branches and had carried it away and chopped it up for kindling wood for this reason there was no way to climb the tree to secure the apple  while the king and the people were considering how they might get into the tree prince thinkabit came up to them and asked what they wanted  we want the apple replied the king but some one has cut away the tree trunk so that we can not climb up  prince thinkabit rubbed the top of his head a minute to get his brain into good working order it was a habit he had acquired then he walked to the bank of the river which was near and whistled three times immediately a school of fishes swam up to him and one of the biggest cried out  good afternoon prince thinkabit what can we do for you  i wish to borrow a flying fish for a few minutes replied the prince  scarcely had he spoken when a fish flew out of the river and perched upon his shoulder then he walked up to the tree and said to the fish get me the apple  the flying fish at once flew into the tree and bit off the stem of the apple which fell down and hit the king on the nose for unfortunately he was standing exactly under it then the prince thanked the flying fish and sent it back to the river and the king having first put a plaster over his nose took the apple and started for the crystal lake followed by all his people  but when the apple was fastened to the fishline and let down through the syrup to the royal chamberlain nuphsed refused to touch it  he doesnt like it said the king with a sigh and he went again to the wise donkey  didnt he want the apple asked the donkey as if surprised but you must know he was not surprised at all as he had planned to get the apple for himself  no indeed replied the king we had an awful job to find the apple too  where is it inquired the donkey  here said the king taking it out of his pocket  the donkey took the apple looked at it thoughtfully for a moment and then ate it up and smacked his lips for he was especially fond of red apples  what shall we do now asked the king  i believe the thing nuphsed likes best is a kind word bait the line with that and you may catch him  so the king went again to the lake and having put a kind word on the fishline quickly succeeded in bringing the royal chamberlain to the shore in safety you can well imagine poor nuphsed was glad enough to be on dry land after his long immersion in the sugarsyrup  and now that all had been rescued from the crystal lake the king put a rope around the broken crust and stuck up a sign that said danger so that no one else would fall in  after that the festivities began again and as there were no further accidents the kings birthday ended very happily    the sixth surprise  king scowleyow and his castiron man   across the mountains at the north of the valley of mo there reigned a wicked king named scowleyow whose people lived in caves and mines and dug iron and tin out of the rocks and melted them into bars these bars they then carried away and sold for money  king scowleyow hated the monarch of mo and all his people because they lived so happily and cared nothing for money and he would have sent his army into the valley to destroy the merry people who dwelt there had he not been afraid of the sharp swords that grew on their trees which they knew so well how to use against their foes  so king scowleyow pondered for a long time how to destroy the valley of mo without getting hurt himself and at last he hit on a plan he believed would succeed  he put all his mechanics to work and built a great man out of castiron with machinery inside of him when he was wound up the castiron man could roar and roll his eyes and gnash his teeth and march across the valley crushing trees and houses to the earth as he went for the castiron man was as tall as a church and as heavy as iron could make him and each of his feet was as big as a barn  it took a long time to build this man as you may suppose but king scowleyow was so determined to ruin the pretty valley of mo that he made his men work night and day and at last the castiron man was ready to be wound up and sent on his journey of destruction  they stood him on the top of the mountain with his face toward the beautiful valley and began to wind him up it took a hundred men a whole week to do this but at last he was tightly wound and the wicked king scowleyow stood ready to touch the spring that made him go  onetwothree said the king and touched the spring with his ringer  the castiron man gave so terrible a roar that he even frightened the men who had made him and then he rolled his eyes till they flashed fire and gnashed his teeth till the noise sounded like thunder  the next minute he raised one great foot and stepped forward crushing fifty trees that stood in his path and then away he went striding down the mountain destroying everything that stood in his way and nearing with every step the beautiful valley of mo  the king and his people were having a game of ball that day and the dog was acting as umpire suddenly just as prince jollikin had made a home run and everybody was applauding him a terrible roaring noise sounded in their ears and they heard a great crashing of trees on the mountain side and saw a monstrous man approaching the valley  the people were so frightened they stood perfectly still being unable to move through surprise and terror but the dog ran with all his might toward the mountain to see what was the matter just as the dog reached the foot of the mountain the castiron man came tramping along and stepped into the valley where he ruined in one instant a large bed of ladyfingers and a whole patch of ripe pumpkin pies indeed the entire valley would soon have been destroyed had not the castiron man stubbed his toe against the dog and fallen flat on his face where he lay roaring and gnashing his teeth but unable to do any further harm  presently the king and his people recovered from their fright and gathered around their prostrate foe marveling at his great size and strength  had you not tripped him up said the king to the dog this giant would certainly have destroyed my kingdom who do you suppose was so wicked as to send this monster to crush us  it must have been king scowleyow declared the dog for no one else would care to harm you and the giant came from the direction of the wicked kings country  yes replied the monarch thoughtfully it must indeed have been scowleyow and it was a very unkind act for we never harmed him in any way but what shall we do with this great man if he is left here he will scare all the children with his roarings and none of the ladies will care to walk near this end of the valley he is so heavy that not all of us together could lift him and even if we succeeded we have no place to put him where he would be out of the way  this was indeed true so all the people sat down in a circle around the castiron man and thought upon the matter intently for the space of an hour  then the monarch asked solemnly as became the importance of the occasion  has any one thought of a way to get rid of him  the people shook their heads gravely and thought deeply for another hour at the end of that time the dog suddenly laughed and called out in a voice so loud that it startled them  i have thought of a way  good exclaimed the king let us hear your plan  you see explained the dog the castiron man is now lying on his face if we could only roll him over on to his back and then raise him to his feet again he would be turned around and would march straight back to where he came from and do us no further harm  that is a capital idea replied the king but how can we roll him over or make him stand up  that puzzled them all for a while but by and by prince thinkabit who was a very clever young man announced his readiness to undertake the job  first bring me a feather commanded the prince  the royal chamberlain hunted around and soon found for him a long fluffy feather taking this in his hand the prince approached the castiron man and tickled him under the left arm with the end of the feather  ouch said the castiron man giving a jump and rolling completely over so that he lay on his back  hurrah cried the people clapping their hands with joy at this successful stratagem the prince is a very wise prince indeed  prince thinkabit took off his hat and bowed politely to them in return for the compliment then he said  bring me a pin  so nuphsed brought him a pin with a very sharp point and the prince took it and walked up to the castiron man and gave him a sharp prod in the back with the point of the pin  ouch again yelled the castiron man giving at the same time such a great jump that he leaped square on his feet but now to their joy they saw he was facing the mountains instead of the valley  as soon as the castiron man stood up the machinery began to work again and he marched with great steps up the mountain side and over into the kingdom of the wicked scowleyow where he crushed the king and all his people and laid waste the land wherever he went  and that was their punishment for being envious of the good people of mo  as to the fate of the castiron man he was wound up so tightly that he kept walking straight on until he reached the sea where he stepped into the water went down to the bottom and stuck fast in the mud  and i have no doubt he is there to this day    the seventh surprise  timtom and the princess pattycake   now of all the monarchs daughters the most beautiful by far was the princess pattycake the deep blue of her eyes made even the sky envious and the moss roses blushed when they saw the delicate bloom on her cheeks the long strands of her silken hair were brighter than sunbeams while her ears were like two tiny pink shells from the seashore indeed there was nothing in all the valley so dainty and pretty as princess pattycake and many young men would have loved her had they dared but alas the princess had a most terrible temper and never was pleased with anything so the young men and even the old ones were afraid to come near her  she scolded from morning till night she stamped her pretty foot with rage when any one spoke to her and if ever her brothers tried to reason with her she boxed their ears so soundly that they were glad to let her alone even the good queen could not love pattycake as she did her other children and the king often sighed when he thought of the ugly disposition of his beautiful daughter of course no one cared very much for her society and she sat in her room all day long refusing to join the others in their sports and games and becoming more moody and badtempered the older she grew  one day a young man came to the court to bring pickled peaches to his majesty the king the youths name was timtom and he lived so far away and came so seldom to court that never before had he seen the princess pattycake  when he looked into her sweet blue eyes he loved her at once for her beauty and being both brave and bold he went directly to the king and asked for pattycakes hand in marriage  his majesty was naturally surprised at so strange a request so he said to the young man  what does the princess say does she love you  i do not know replied timtom for i have never spoken with her  well said the king much amazed at the ignorance and temerity of the youth go and speak to my daughter about the matter and then come and tell me what she replies  timtom went at once to the room where princess pattycake was moodily sitting and said boldly  i should like to marry you  what screamed the princess in a great rage marry me go away this instant you impudent boy or i shall throw my shoe at your head  timtom was both surprised and shocked at this outburst but he realized that the princess had a remarkably bad temper still he was not moved from his purpose for she was so pretty he decided not to abandon the attempt to win her  do not be angry for i love you he pleaded looking bravely into pattycakes blue eyes  love me echoed the surprised princess that is not possible every one else hates me  they do not hate you ventured timtom it is your temper they hate  but my temper and i are one answered the princess harshly as she stamped her foot  surely that is not so returned the young man for certainly i love you while your temper i do not like a bit dont you think you could love me  perhaps i might if you could cure my bad temper but my temper will not allow me to love any one in fact i believe that unless you go away at once i shall be obliged to box your ears  there seemed to be no help for her so timtom left the room sadly and going to the king told him what she had said  then that is the end of the matter declared the king for no one can cure pattycake of her bad temper  i am resolved to try nevertheless replied timtom and if i succeed you must give me the princess in marriage  i will and my blessing into the bargain answered the king heartily  then timtom left the court and went back to his fathers house where he thought on the problem for a week and a day at the end of that time he was no nearer solving it than he was before but his mother who had noticed that her boy was in trouble now came to him to ask the cause of his sad looks timtom told her all about the princess pattycake and of his love for her and the evil temper that would not be cured  his mother gave him her sympathy and after some thought said to him you must go to the sorceress maetta and ask her assistance she is a good lady and a friend to all the kings family i am quite sure she will aid you if only you can find your way to the castle in which she lives  where is this castle asked timtom brightening up  away to the south in the midst of a thick wood answered his mother  then said he sturdily if this castle exists i will surely find it for to win pattycake is my only hope of happiness  the next day he set out on his journey filled with the hope of finding maettas castle and securing her assistance  before he had gone very far a snowstorm began to rage now the snowstorms in mo are different from ours for the snow is popcorn and on this day it fell so thick and fast that poor timtom had much difficulty in wading through it he was obliged to stop frequently to rest and ate a great deal of the popcorn that cumbered his path for it was nicely buttered and salted  finally to his joy it stopped snowing and then he was able to walk along easily until he came to the river of needles  when he looked on this river he was nearly discouraged and could not think of a way to get across for instead of water the river flowed a perfect stream of sharp glittering needles  sitting down on the bank he was wondering what he should do when to his astonishment a small but sharp and disagreeable voice said to him  where are you going stranger  timtom looked down between his feet and saw a black spider which sat on a blade of grass and watched him curiously  i am on my way to visit the sorceress maetta replied timtom but i can not get across the river of needles  they are very sharp and would make a thousand holes through you in an instant remarked the spider thoughtfully but perhaps i can help you if you are willing to grant me a favor in return i will gladly build a bridge so you may cross the river in safety  what is the favor he asked  i have lost an eye and you must ask the sorceress to give me a new one for i can see but half as well as i could before  i will gladly do this for you said timtom  very well then i will build you a bridge promised the spider but if you have not the eye with you when you return i shall destroy the bridge and you will never be able to get home again  the young man agreed to this for he was anxious to proceed so the spider threw a web across the river and then another and another until it had made a bridge of spiderweb strong enough for timtom to cross over  it bent and swayed when his weight was on the slender bridge but it did not break and after he was safe across he thanked the spider and renewed his promise to bring back the eye then he hurried away on his journey for he had lost much time at the river  but to his dismay the young man shortly came to a deep gulf that barred his way as completely as had the river of needles he peered down into it and saw it had no bottom but opened away off at the other side of the world here was an obstacle which might well dishearten the boldest traveler and timtom was so grieved that he sat down on the brink and wept tears of disappointment  what is troubling you asked a soft voice in his ear  turning his head the youth saw a beautiful white bird sitting beside him  i wish to visit the castle of the sorceress maetta on very important business he replied but i can not get over the gulf  i could carry you over with ease said the bird and shall gladly do so if in return you promise to grant me one favor  what is the favor inquired timtom  i have forgotten my song through having a sore throat for a long time replied the bird so try as i may i can not sing a single note if you will agree to bring me a new song from the sorceress i will take you over the gulf and bring you back when you return but unless you bring the song i shall not carry you over again  timtom joyfully agreed to this bargain and then sitting on the birds neck he was borne safely across the deep gulf  after continuing his journey for an hour without further interruption he saw before him the edge of a great wood and knew that in the midst of this forest of trees was the castle of maetta  he thought then that his difficulties were all over and tramped bravely on until he reached the wood what now was the youths horror on discovering on one side of his path a great lion crouched ready to spring on any one who ventured to enter the wood while on the other side was a monstrous tiger likewise prepared to attack any intruder the fierce beasts were growling terribly and their eyes glowed like balls of fire  timtom gladly would have turned back had such a thing been possible for his heart was full of fear but he remembered that without the birds song and the spiders eye he could never reach home again he also thought of the pretty face of princess pattycake and this gave him courage resolving to perish if need be rather than fail in his adventure the youth stepped boldly forward and when he approached the snarling guardians of the forest he gave one bound and dashed into the wood  at the same moment the lion leaped at him from one side and the tiger from the other and no doubt they would have devoured him had not timtoms foot slipped just then and thrown him flat on the ground the lion and the tiger therefore met in mid air and each one thinking it had hold of timtom tried to tear him to pieces with the result that in a few moments they had devoured each other instead of him  the youth now strode rapidly through the wood and was getting along famously when he came to a high wall of jasper that completely blocked his way it was smooth as glass and timtom saw no way of climbing over it  while he stood wondering how he might overcome this new obstacle a gray rabbit hopped out from the bushes and asked  where do you wish to go stranger  to the castle of the sorceress maetta answered timtom  well perhaps i can assist you said the rabbit i need a new tail badly for my old one is merely a stump and no use at all in flytime if you will be kind enough to get me a new tail from the sorceress maettaa long nice bushy taili will dig under the wall and so make a passage for you to the other side  i shall be pleased to return the favor by bringing you the tail declared timtom eagerly  very well then you shall see how fast i can work returned the rabbit immediately it began digging away with its little paws and in a very short time had made a hole large enough for timtom to crawl under the wall  if you do not bring the tail said the rabbit in a warning voice i shall fill up the hole again so that you will be unable to get back  oh i shall bring the tail never fear answered the youth and hurried away toward the castle of maetta which was now visible through the trees  the castle was built of pure white marble and was very big and beautiful it stood in a lovely garden filled with blue roses and pink buttercups where fountains of gold spouted showers of diamonds and rubies and emeralds and amethysts all of which sparkled in the sun so gorgeously that it made timtoms eyes ache just to look at them  however he had not come to admire these things gorgeous and beautiful though they were but to win the princess pattycake so he walked to the entrance of the castle and seeing no one about entered the great doorway and passed through  he found himself in a passageway covered with motherofpearl where many electric lights were hidden in shells of most exquisite tintings at the other end of the passage was a door studded with costly gems  timtom walked up to this door and knocked on it immediately it swung open and the youth found himself in a chamber entirely covered with diamonds in the center was a large diamond throne and on this sat maetta clothed in a pure white gown with a crown of diamonds on her brow and in her hand a golden scepter tipped with one enormous diamond that glowed like a ball of fire above the throne was a diamondcovered chandelier with hundreds of electric lights and these made the grand chamber of diamonds glitter so brightly that timtom was nearly blinded and had to shade his eyes with his hand  but after a few moments he grew accustomed to the brightness and advancing to the throne fell on his knees before the sorceress and begged her earnestly to grant him her assistance  maetta was the most beautiful woman in all the world but she was likewise gracious and kind so she smiled sweetly on the youth bidding him in a voice like a silver bell to arise from his knees and sit before her timtom obeyed and looked around for a chair but could see none in the room the lady made a motion with her scepter and instantly at his side appeared a splendid diamond chair in which the young man seated himself finding it remarkably comfortable  tell me what you desire said the sorceress in her sweet voice  i love the princess pattycake replied timtom without hesitation but she has so evil a disposition that she has refused to marry me unless i am able to cure her of her bad temper which not only makes her miserable but ruins the pleasure of every one about her so knowing your power and the kindness of your heart i have been bold enough to seek your castle that i might crave your assistance without which i can not hope to accomplish my purpose  maetta waved her scepter thrice above her head and a golden pill dropped at timtoms feet  your request is granted she said if you can induce the princess to swallow this pill her evil temper will disappear and i know she will love you dearly for having cured her take great care of it for if it should be lost i can not give you another do you wish me to grant any other request before you return to the court  then timtom remembered the rabbit and the bird and the spider and told maetta how he had promised to bring back a gift for each of them  so the kind sorceress gave him a nice bushy tail for the rabbit and a very pretty song for the bird and a new bright eye for the spider these timtom put in a little red box and placed the box carefully in his pocket but the golden pill he tied into the corner of his handkerchief for that was more precious than the rest  having thanked the generous lady for her kindness and respectfully kissed the white hand she held out to him timtom left the chamber of diamonds and was soon proceeding joyfully on his homeward way  in a short time he reached the wall of jasper but the rabbit was not to be seen so while he awaited its coming he lay down to rest and being tired by the long journey was soon fast asleep and while he slept a sly fox stole out from the wood and discovered timtom lying on the ground  oh ho said the sly fox to himself this young man has been to visit the sorceress and ill warrant he has some fine gift from her in that little red box i see sticking out from his pocket i must try to steal that box and see what is in it  then while the youth slumbered unconscious of danger the sly fox carefully drew the little red box from his pocket and taking it in his mouth ran off into the woods with it  soon after this the rabbit came back and when it saw timtom lying asleep it awakened him and asked  where is my new tail  oh i have brought you a fine one replied timtom with a smile it is in this little red box but when he searched for the box he discovered it had been stolen  so great was his distress at the loss that the gray rabbit was sorry for him  i shall never be able to get home again he  moaned weeping tears of despair for all the gifts maetta gave me are now lost forever  never mind said the rabbit i shall allow you to go under the wall without giving me the tail for i know you tried to keep your promise i suppose i can make this stubby tail do a while longer since it is the only one i ever possessed but beware when you come to the bird and the spider for they will not be so kind to you as i am the bird has no heart at all and the spiders heart is hard as a stone still i advise you to keep up your courage for if you are brave and fearless you may succeed in getting home after all if you can not cross the gulf and the river of needles you are welcome to come back and live with me  hearing this timtom dried his eyes and thanked the kind rabbit after which he crawled under the wall and resumed his journey he became more cheerful as he trudged along for the golden pill was still safe in the corner of his handkerchief  when he came to the white bird and began to explain how it was he had lost the song and could not keep his promise the bird became very angry and refused to listen to his excuses nor could he induce it to carry him again across the gulf  i shall keep my word declared the bird stiffly for i warned you that if you returned without the song i should refuse to assist you further  poor timtom was at his wits end to know what to do so he sat down near the brink of the gulf and twirled his thumbs and tried to keep up his courage and think of some plan while the white bird strutted around in a cold and stately manner  now it seems that just about this time the sly fox reached his den and opened the little red box to see what was in it the spiders eye being small rolled out into the moss and was lost the fox thought he would put the bushy tail on himself and see if it would not add to his beauty and while he did this the song escaped from the box and was blown by the wind directly to the spot where timtom was sitting beside the gulf  he happened to hear the song coming so he took off his hat and caught it after which he called to the bird that he had found the song again  then i shall keep my promise said the bird first however let me try the song and see if it is suited to my voice  so he tried the song and liked it fairly well  it sounds something like a comic opera said the bird but after all it will serve my purpose very nicely  a minute later timtom rejoiced to find himself on the other side of the gulf and so much nearer home but when he came to the river of needles there was more trouble in store for him for the spider became so angry at the loss of its eye that it tore down the spiderweb bridge and refused to build another  this was indeed discouraging to the traveler and he sat down beside the river and looked longingly at the farther shore the spider paid no attention to him but curled up and went to sleep and the needles looked at him curiously out of their small eyes as they flowed by in an endless stream  after a time a wren came flying along and when it noticed the look of despair on timtoms face the little creature perched on his shoulder and asked  what is your trouble young man  timtom related his adventures to the sympathetic wren and when he came to the loss of the spiders eye and the refusal of the spiteful creature to allow him to cross the bridge the wren exclaimed with every appearance of surprise  a spiders eye did you say why i believe that is what i have here in my claw  where cried timtom eagerly  the wren hopped into his lap and carefully opening one of its tiny claws disclosed the identical spiders eye which maetta had given him  that is wonderful exclaimed timtom in amazement but where did you get it  i found it in the wood hidden in the moss near the den of the sly fox it is so bright and sparkling i thought i would take it home for my children to play with but now as you seem to want it so badly i shall have much pleasure in restoring it to you  timtom thanked the little wren most gratefully and called to the spider to come and get its eye when the spider tried the eye and found that it fitted perfectly and was even brighter than the old one it became very polite to the young man and soon built the bridge again  having passed over the glittering needles in safety timtom pushed forward on his way being urged to haste by the delays he had suffered when he reached the place where he had encountered the snowstorm he found the birds had eaten all the popcorn so he was able to proceed without interruption  at last he reached the monarch of mos palace and demanded an audience with the princess pattycake but the young lady being in an especially bad temper that day positively refused to see him  having overcome so many obstacles timtom did not intend to be thwarted by a sulky girl so he walked boldly to the room where the princess sat alone every one being afraid to go near her  good day my dear pattycake he said pleasantly i have come to cure your bad temper  i do not want to be cured cried the princess angrily go away at once or i shall hurt you  i shall not go away until you have promised to marry me replied timtom firmly  at this pattycake began to scream with rage and threw her shoe straight at his head timtom dodged the shoe and paid no attention to the naughty action but continued to look at the pretty princess smilingly seeing this pattycake rushed forward and seizing him by his hair began to pull with all her strength at the same time she opened her mouth to scream and while it was open timtom threw the golden pill down her throat  immediately the princess released his hair and sank at his feet sobbing and trembling while she covered her pretty face with her hands to hide her blushes and shame  timtom tenderly patted her bowed head and tried to comfort her saying  do not weep sweetheart for the bad temper has left you at last and now every one will love you dearly  can you forgive me for having been so naughty asked pattycake looking up at him pleadingly from her sweet blue eyes  i have forgiven you already answered timtom promptly for it was not you but the temper that made you so naughty  the princess pattycake dried her tears and kissed timtom promising to marry him and together they went to seek the king and queen those good people were greatly delighted at the change in their daughter and consented at once to the betrothal  a week later there was a great feast in the valley of mo and much rejoicing among the people for it was the weddingday of timtom and the princess pattycake    the eighth surprise  the bravery of prince jollikin   there is no country so delightful but that it suffers some disadvantages and so it was with the valley of mo at times the good people were obliged to leave their games and sports to defend themselves against a foe or some threatened disaster but there was one danger they never suspected which at last came upon them very suddenly  away at the eastern end of the valley was a rough plain composed entirely of loaf sugar covered with boulders of rock candy which were piled up in great masses reaching nearly to the foot of the mountains containing many caves and recesses  the people seldom came here as there was nothing to tempt them the rock candy being very hard and difficult to walk on  in one of the great hollows formed by the rock candy lived a monstrous gigaboo completely shut in by the walls of its cavern it had been growing and growing for so many years that it had attained an enormous size  for fear you may not know what a gigaboo is i shall describe this one its body was round like that of a turtle and on its back was a thick shell from the center of the body rose a long neck much like that of a goose with a most horrible looking head perched on the top of it this head was round as a ball and had four mouths on the sides of it and seven eyes set in a circle and projecting several inches from the head the gigaboo walked on ten short but thick legs and in front of its body were two long arms tipped with claws like those of a lobster so sharp and strong were these claws that the creature could pinch a tree in two easily its eyes were remarkably bright and glittering one being red in color another green and the others yellow blue black purple and crimson  it was a dreadful monster to seeonly no one had yet seen it for it had grown up in the confinement of its cave  but one day the gigaboo became so big and strong that in turning around it broke down the walls of the cavern and finding itself at liberty the monster walked out into the lovely valley of mo to see how much evil it could do  the first thing the gigaboo came to was a large orchard of preserved apricots and after eating a great quantity of the preserves it wilfully cut off the trees with its sharp claws and utterly ruined them why the gigaboo should have done this i can not tell but scientists say these creatures are by nature destructive and love to ruin everything they come across  one of the people being in the neighborhood came on the monster and witnessed its terrible deeds whereupon he ran in great terror to tell the king that the gigaboo was on them and ready to destroy the entire valley although no one had ever before seen a gigaboo or even heard of one the news was so serious that in a short time the king and many of his people came to the place where the monster was all having hastily armed themselves with swords and spears  but when they saw the gigaboo they were afraid and stood gazing at it in alarm without knowing what to do or how to attack it  who among us can hope to conquer this great beast asked the king in dismay yet something must be done or soon we shall not have a tree left standing in all the valley of mo the people looked at one another in a frightened way but no one volunteered his services or offered to advise the monarch what to do  at length prince jollikin who had been watching the monster earnestly stepped forward and offered to fight the gigaboo alone  in a matter of this kind said he one man is as good as a dozen so you will all stand back while i see where the beast can best be attacked  is your sword sharp asked his father the king anxiously  it was the sharpest on the tree replied the prince if i fail to kill the monster at least it can not kill me although it may cause me some annoyance at any rate our trees must be saved so i will do the best i can  with this manly speech he walked straight toward the gigaboo which when it saw him approaching raised and lowered its long neck and twirled its head around so that all the seven eyes might get a glimpse of its enemy  now you must remember when you read what follows that no inhabitant of the valley of mo can ever be killed by anything if one is cut to pieces the pieces still live and although this seems strange you will find if you ever go to this queer valley that it is true perhaps it was the knowledge of this fact that made prince jollikin so courageous  if i can but manage to cut off that horrible head with my sword thought he the beast will surely die  so the prince rushed forward and made a powerful stroke at its neck but the blow fell short and cut off instead one of the gigaboos ten legs quick as lightning the monster put out a claw and nipped the princes arm which held the sword cutting it from its body as the sword fell the prince caught it in his other hand and struck again but the blow fell on the beasts shell and did no harm  the gigaboo now very angry at once nipped off the princes left arm with one of its claws and his head with the other the arm fell on the ground and the head rolled down a little hill behind some bonbon bushes the prince having lost both arms and his head as well now abandoned the fight and turned to run knowing it would be folly to resist the monster further but the gigaboo gave chase and so swiftly did its nine legs carry it that soon it overtook the prince and nipped off both his legs  then its seven eyes flashing with anger the gigaboo turned toward the rest of the people as if seeking a new enemy but the brave men of mo seeing the sad plight of their prince and being afraid of the awful nippers on the beasts claws decided to run away which they did uttering as they went loud cries of terror  but had they looked back they might not have gone so fast nor so far for when the gigaboo heard their cries it in turn became frightened having been accustomed all its life to silence so that it rushed back to its cavern of rock candy and hid itself among the boulders  when prince jollikins head stopped rolling he opened his eyes and looked about him but could see no one for the people and the gigaboo had now gone so being unable to move he decided to lie quiet for a time and this was not a pleasant thing for an active young man like the prince to do to be sure he could wiggle his ears a bit and wink his eyes but that was the extent of his powers after a few minutes because he had a cheerful disposition and wished to keep himself amused he began to whistle a popular song and then becoming interested in the tune he whistled it over again with variations  the princes left leg lying a short distance away heard his whistle and recognizing the variations at once ran up to the head  well said the prince here is a part of me at any rate i wonder where the rest of me can be  just then hearing the sound of his voice the right leg ran up to the head where is my body asked the prince  but the legs did not know  pick up my head and place it on top of my legs continued the prince then with my eyes and your feet we can hunt around until we find the rest of me  obeying this command the legs took the head and started off and perhaps you can imagine how funny the princes head looked perched on his legs with neither body nor arms  after a careful search they found the body lying upon the ground at the foot of a shrimpsalad tree but nothing more could be done without the arms so they next searched for those and having discovered them the legs kicked them to where the body lay  the arms now took the head from the legs and put the legs on the body where they belonged then the right arm stuck the left arm in its place after which the left arm picked up the right arm and placed it also where it belonged then all that remained was for the prince to place his head on his shoulders and there he wasas good as new  he picked up his sword and was feeling himself all over to see if he was put together right when he chanced to look up and saw the gigaboo again coming toward him the beast had recovered from its fright and tempted by its former success again ventured forth  but prince jollikin did not intend to be cut to pieces a second time he quickly climbed a tree and hid himself among the branches  presently the gigaboo came to the tree and reached its head up to eat a cranberry tart quick as a flash the prince swung his sword downward and so true was his stroke that he cut off the monsters head with ease  then the gigaboo rolled over on its back and died for wild and ferocious beasts may be killed in mo as well as in other parts of the world having vanquished his enemy prince jollikin climbed down from the tree and went to tell the people that the gigaboo was dead  when they heard this joyful news they gave their prince three cheers and loved him better than ever for his bravery the king was so pleased that he presented his son with a tin badge set with diamonds on the back of which was engraved the picture of a gigaboo  although prince jollikin was glad to be the hero of his nation and enjoyed the triumph of having been able to conquer his ferocious enemy he did not escape some inconvenience for as the result of his adventure he found himself very stiff in the joints for several days after his fight with the gigaboo    the ninth surprise  the wizard and the princess   within the depths of the mountains which bordered the valley of mo to the east lived a wicked wizard in a cavern of rubies it was many many feet below the surface of the earth and cut off entirely from the rest of the world save for one passage which led through dangerous caves and tunnels to the top of the highest mountain so that in order to get out of his cavern the wizard was obliged to come to this mountain top and from there descend to the outside world  the wizard lived all alone but he did not mind that for his thoughts were always on his books and studies and he seldom showed himself on the surface of the earth but when he did go out every one laughed at him for this powerful magician was no taller than my knee and was very old and wrinkled so that he looked comical indeed beside an ordinary man  the wizard was nearly as sensitive as he was wicked and was sorry he had not grown as big as other people so the laughter that always greeted him made him angry  at last he determined to find some magical compound that would make him grow bigger he shut himself up in his cave and searched diligently amongst his books until finally he found a formula recommended by some dead and gone magician as sure to make any one grow a foot each day so long as the dose was taken most of the ingredients were quite easy to procure being such as spiders livers kerosene oil and the teeth of canary birds mixed together in a boiling caldron but the last item of the recipe was so unusual that it made the wizard scratch his head in perplexity  it was the big toe of a young and beautiful princess  the wizard thought on the matter for three days but nowhere could he think of a young and beautiful princess who would willingly part with her big toeeven that he might grow to be as big as he wished  then as such a thing was not to be come by honestly the wicked wizard resolved to steal it so he went through all the caves and passages until he came to the mountaintop standing on the point of a rock he placed one hand on his chin and the other on the back of his neck and then recited the following magical incantation       i wish to go      to steal the big toe      of a princess i know      in order to grow      quite big and so     ill change to a crow  no sooner had he spoken the words than he changed into a black crow and flew away into the valley of mo where he hid himself in a tall tree that grew near the kings palace  that morning as the princess truella was lying late in bed with one of her dainty pink feet sticking out from under the covers in through the window fluttered a black crow which picked off her big toe and immediately flew away with it  the princess awoke with a scream and was horrified to find her beautiful foot ruined by the loss of her biggest toe when the king and queen and the princes and princesses having heard her outcry came running in to see what was the matter they were each and all very indignant at the theft  but search as they might nowhere could they find the audacious black crow nor the princess big toe and the whole court was in despair  finally timtom who was now a prince suggested that truella seek assistance from the kind sorceress maetta who had helped him out of his own difficulties the princess thought well of this idea and determined to undertake a journey to the castle  she whistled for her favorite stork and soon the great bird came to her side it was pure white and of an extraordinary size when the stork had been saddled the princess kissed her father and mother good by and seated herself on the birds back when it instantly rose into the air and flew away toward the castle of maetta  traveling in this pleasant way high in the air the princess crossed the river of needles and the deep gulf and the dangerous wood and at last was set down safe at the castle gates  maetta welcomed the pretty princess very cordially and on being told of her misfortune at once agreed to assist her so the sorceress consulted her oracle which told her truly anything she wanted to know and then said to the princess  your toe is in the possession of the wicked wizard who lives in the ruby cave under the mountains in order to recover it you must go yourself to seek it but i warn you that the wizard will put every obstacle in your path to prevent your finding the toe and taking it from him  oh dear exclaimed truella i am afraid i shall never be able to get my toe from such a horrid man  have courage and trust in me returned maetta for i believe my powers are stronger than his i shall now furnish you the weapons you must use to overcome him here is a magic umbrella and in this basket which you must carry on your arm you will find a lump of putty an iron ball a mirror a package of chewinggum and a magic veil all of which will be very useful here also is a winged dagger with which you must protect yourself if the wizard attempts to harm you with these enchanted weapons and a brave heart i believe you will succeed so kiss me my child and start on your journey  truella thanked the kind sorceress and mounting the saddle of her stork flew away toward the high mountain in which dwelt the wicked wizard  but the naughty man by means of his black magic saw her coming and sent such a fierce wind to blow against her that it prevented the stork from making any headway through the air therefore in spite of his huge wings and remarkable strength the brave bird was unable to get an inch nearer the mountain  when truella saw this she put up the umbrella and held it in front of the stork whereupon being shielded from the wind he flew easily to the mountain  the princess now dismounted and looking into the hole at the top of the mountain discovered a flight of stairs leading downward  taking her basket on her arm as she had been directed truella walked boldly down the steps until she came to a door but then she shrank back in affright for before the door was coiled a great serpent not quite a mile long and fully as large around as a stick of wood the girl knew she must manage in some way to overcome this terrible creature so when the serpent opened its mouth and raised its head to bite her she reached within the basket and finding the lump of putty threw it quickly into the serpents mouth the creature snapped its jaws together so suddenly that its teeth stuck fast in the putty and this made it so furious that it wriggled around until it had tied itself into a hard knot and could wriggle no longer  seeing there was no further danger the princess passed the door and entered a large cave which was but dimly lighted while she paused to allow her eyes to become accustomed to the darkness so she might see her way a faint rustling sound reached her ears and a moment later there came toward her a hideous old woman lean and bent with wrinkled face and piercing black eyes she had only one tooth but that was of enormous size being nearly as large as the tusk of an elephant and it curved out of her mouth and down under her chin where it ended in a very sharp point her fingernails were a foot long and they also were very sharp and strong  what are you doing here asked the old woman in a harsh voice while she moved her horrible fingers as if about to scratch out truellas eyes  i came to see the wizard said the princess calmly and if you will allow me to pass i shall give you in return for the favor some delicious chewinggum  chewinggum croaked the old woman what is that  it is a dainty of which all ladies are very fond replied truella taking the packet from her basket this is it  the old woman hesitated a moment and then said  well ill try the chewinggum and see what it is like there will be plenty of time to scratch out your eyes afterwards  she placed the gum in her mouth and tried to chew it but when she shut her jaws together the great tusk went straight through her neck and came out at the back the old hag gave a scream and put up her hands to pull out the tusk again but so great was her excitement that in her haste she scratched out both her own eyes and could no longer see where the princess was standing  so truella ran through the cave and came to a door on which she knocked instantly it flew open and before her she saw another cave this time brightly lighted but filled with knives and daggers which were flying about in every direction to enter this cave was impossible for the princess saw she would immediately be pierced by dozens of the sharp daggers so she hesitated for a time not knowing how to proceed but chancing to remember her basket she took from it the iron ball which she tossed into the center of the cave of daggers at once the dangerous weapons began to strike against the ball and as soon as they touched it they were broken and fell to the floor in a short time every one of the knives and daggers had been spoiled by contact with the iron ball and truella passed safely through the cave and came to another long stairway leading downward at the bottom of this she reached the third cave and came upon a horrible monster  it had the body of a zebra the legs of a rhinoceros the neck of a giraffe the head of a bull dog and three corrugated tails this monster at once began to growl and run toward her showing its terrible teeth and lashing its three tails the princess snatched the mirror from her basket and as the creature came near her she held the glittering surface before its eyes it gave one look into the mirror and fell lifeless at her feet being frightened to death by its own reflection in the mirror  truella now walked through several more caves and descended a long flight of stairs which brought her to another door on which was a sign that read    a wizard esq     office hours   from 1045 until   a quarter to 11  the princess knowing that she had now reached the den of the wizard who had stolen her big toe knocked boldly on the door  come in called a voice  truella obeyed and found herself in a large cave the walls of which were lined with rubies in each of the four corners were big electric lights and these shining upon the rubies filled the cave with a deep red glow the wizard himself sat at his desk in one of the corners and when the princess entered he looked up and exclaimed  what is it you really i did not expect to see you how did you manage to pass the guards i placed within the caves and passageways to prevent your coming here  oh that was not difficult answered truella for you must know i am protected by a power stronger than your own  the wizard was much annoyed at this reply for he knew it was true and that only by cunning could he hope to oppose the pretty princess still he was resolved not to give up the big toe unless obliged to for it was necessary to complete the magic compound  what do you want he asked after a moments thought  i want the toe you stole from me while i was asleep  the wizard knew it was useless to deny the theft so he replied  very well take a chair and i will see if i can find it  but truella feared the little man was deceiving her so when he turned his back she took the magic veil from her basket and threw it over her head immediately it began unfolding until it covered her completely from head to foot  the wizard walked over to a cupboard which he opened and while pretending to search for the toe he suddenly turned on a big faucet that was concealed under a shelf at once the thunder rolled the lightning flashed and from the arched ceiling of the cavern drops of fire began to fall coming thicker and thicker until a perfect shower of burning drops filled the room  these fell hissing upon truellas veil but could not penetrate it for they all bounded off and were scattered upon the rocky floor where they soon burned themselves out seeing this the wizard gave a sigh of disappointment and turned off the faucet when the firedrops ceased to fall  please excuse this little interruption he said as if he had not been the cause of it himself ill find the toe in a few minutes i must have mislaid it somewhere  but truella suspected he was up to more mischief and was on her guard she saw him stealthily press a button and in the same instant a deep gulf opened in the floor of the cave half way between the princess and the wizard  truella did not know what this meant at first unless it was to prevent her getting across the room to where her toe was but soon she noticed that the gulf was moving toward her slowly but steadily and as it extended across the cave from wall to wall it would in time be sure to reach the spot where she stood when she would of course fall into it  when she saw her danger the princess became frightened and tried to escape through the door by which she had entered but to her dismay she found it locked then she turned to look at the wizard the little man had perched himself upon a high stool and was carelessly swinging his feet and laughing with glee at truellas awful peril he thought that at last he had certainly found a way to destroy her the poor princess again looked into the gulf which was gradually getting nearer and nearer and she shuddered at its vast depths  a cold wind began to sweep up from the abyss and she heard mocking laughter and savage growls from below as if evil spirits were eagerly waiting to seize her  just as she was giving way to despair and the gulf had crept very close to her feet truella thought of her winged dagger she drew it from her bosom and pointing it toward her enemy said     save me from the wizards art    fly until you reach his heart    foil his power and set me free    this is my command to thee  in a flash the dagger flew from her hand and struck the wizard full on his breast with a loud cry he fell forward into the gulf which in the same instant closed up with a crash then when the rocks about her had ceased trembling from the shock the door swung open leaving the princess at liberty to go where she pleased  she now searched the wizards cupboard until she found her toe which had been safely hidden in a little ivory box truella stopped only long enough to put on her toe and then she ran through the caves and up the stairways until she reached the top of the mountain again  there she found her stork patiently awaiting her and having seated herself on its back she rode safely and triumphantly back to her fathers palace  the king and queen were delighted when she recounted to them the success of her adventure but they shuddered when they learned of the fearful dangers their sweet little daughter had encountered  it seems to me said the good queen that a big toe is scarcely worth all the trouble you have had in recovering it  perhaps not replied the princess thoughtfully but a big toe is very handy to have when you wish to dance and after all i succeeded in destroying the wicked wizard which surely repays me for the trials i have been forced to undergo    the tenth surprise  the duchess bredenbuttas visit to turvyland   the duchess bredenbutta was fortyseventh cousin to the monarch of mo and greatgrandniece to the queen so you can readily see she was nearly related to the princess pattycake and had blue blood in her veins she lived in a pretty house on the banks of rootbeer river and one of her favorite amusements was to row on the river in her boat which although rather small was light as a cork  one day as usual the duchess went for a row on the river expecting to return home in about an hour but after floating a long distance down the stream she fell asleep in the boat and did not awake until she felt a sudden shock  then sitting up and looking about her she found to her alarm that the boat had drifted to the end of the land of mo and was in the rapids leading to the great hole in the ground where the river disappeared from view becoming very much frightened bredenbutta looked for the oars of her boat that she might row to the bank but soon she discovered that the oars had fallen overboard and were lost leaving her without any means of saving herself  the poor duchess now began to cry out but no one heard her gradually the boat came nearer and nearer to the great hole now bumping against the rocks and now spinning around with the current until at last it paused for an instant on the very brink of the chasm down which the river fell  the girl seized the sides of the boat in a firm grasp and the next moment it plunged headlong into the hole  after the shock was over bredenbutta wiped the moisture from her eyes and looked to see where she was and what had become of her she found that she had landed in a very remarkable country and for a time could do nothing but gaze in wonder on the strange sights that met her view  the trees were all growing on their top branches with their roots high in the air and the houses rested on the tops of their chimneys the smoke going into the ground and the doorsteps being at the tops of the buildings a rabbit was flying around in the air and a flock of skylarks walked on the ground as if they belonged there  bredenbutta rubbed her eyes for at first the girl thought she must be dreaming but when she looked again everything was in the same unnatural position  to add to her amazement she now saw a queer creature coming toward her she might have taken him for a young man only ho was just the reverse of any young man bredenbutta had ever seen he stood upon his hands which were clad in boots and used his feet as we use our hands seeming to be very handy with his toes his teeth were in his ears and he ate with them and heard with his mouth he also smelled with his eyes and saw out of his nosewhich was all very curious when he walked he ran and when he ran he stood still he spoke when he was silent and remained dumb when he had anything to say in addition to this he wept real tears when he was pleased and laughed merrily whenever anything grieved him  it was no wonder the duchess bredenbutta stared in surprise when such an odd creature came up to her backward and looked at her solemnly from his pug nose  who are you asked bredenbutta as soon as she could find breath to speak  the young man kept quiet and answered my name is upsydoun  i think you are laughed bredenbutta  you think i am what demanded the young man the voice coming from his ear  upsidedown she replied  at this retort the tears rolled down his cheeks with joy  why it is you who are upsidedown he said how in the world did you get up here  down here you mean corrected the duchess with dignity  i mean nothing of the kind he said silently while his nose twinkled with amusement this country is up and not down  what country is it inquired bredenbutta much perplexed by such an absurd statement  why turvyland to be sure was the answer  oh sighed bredenbutta but she was no wiser than before  now you are here said upsydoun you may come home with me and eat some dinner  i shall be very glad to answered the duchess who was really hungry where do you live  over there replied upsydoun pointing to the south so stay where you are and follow me then he walked away on his hands in exactly the opposite direction from that he had indicated  bredenbutta followed him and shortly after encountered several other people of just the same queer appearance as her conductor they looked out of their noses at her in great surprise and without speaking asked upsydoun who she was  the duchess bredenbutta he silently answered i found her where the rootbeer river bubbles up isnt she a queerlooking creature  she is indeed they all answered in a still chorus and then they followed the girl out of curiosity as boys follow a band or a dancing bear when they reached the house of upsydoun more than a hundred inhabitants of turvyland were at bredenbuttas heels and upsydouns thumbs  she was welcomed very kindly however and the young mans mother kissed the duchess with her left ear an act which was considered a special mark of favor in turvyland  would you like to stand up and rest yourself until dinnertime asked the lady when the girl had entered the parlor  no thank you replied bredenbutta who was very tired being ignorant of their customs she did not know these people usually stood up when they slept or rested her answer seemed to satisfy upsydouns mother who thought when she said no she meant yes  you really dont look equal to lying down she remarked pleasantly so you may stand until i call you to dinner which will be in a long time then she excused herself and walked backward out of the window which bredenbutta noticed they all used instead of doors  dear me said the duchess when she was left alone i am sure i shall never be able to understand these strange people but i mean to sit down anyway and if it really is a long time before dinner i shall probably starve in the meantime  she had not rested more than a few minutes however before the lady again put her foot through the window and waving it invitingly toward her exclaimed go away to dinner  go away replied the duchess in dismay where shall i go to  why to me of course answered upsydouns mother dumbly but she winked her nose thoughtfully as if she scarcely knew how to converse with her strange visitor surely bredenbutta ought to know that when they said go in turvyland they meant come  in spite of her uncertainty she followed her hostess and when they entered the diningroom the duchess was shocked to see all the family stand on their heads on the chairs and pick up their knives and forks with their toes she was more horrified however when they began to eat for contrary to all custom these people placed their food in their ears and they did it so calmly that she did not even remonstrate remembering it must be their habit to eat in this way  she herself sat down in her chair in a proper manner and began to eat with the fork in her hand and when the people of turvyland saw this they all shed tears of merriment  just then the youngest child of the family began laughing and the mother rushed to it as fast as her hands could carry her to see what was the matter but the child had only put its foot into its pocket and could not get it out again the mother soon managed to get it free and then the child stopped laughing and began weeping as happily as any of the others  bredenbutta was greatly bewildered at all this but she ate heartily nevertheless and after having begged her in vain to stand on her head as they did the family let her alone being surprised to see how well she could use her hands after dinner upsydouns sister played on the piano with her toes while the others indulged in a dance whirling around on their thumbs in a manner truly marvelous and seeming by their tears to enjoy themselves very much  as the dance ended a kitten came running into the room on its ears and the tip of its tail and this looked so funny that bredenbutta began laughing but seeing she had frightened her kind friends who wanted to send for a doctor she refrained from laughing and asked gravely if she could not find a way to return to the valley of mo  the only possible way of getting down there replied upsydoun is to jump into the rootbeer river but that would be dangerous and none of our people have ever tried it  any danger said the duchess i will gladly brave for otherwise i shall be obliged to spend my entire life down here among people whose ways are exactly opposite to my own if you will kindly take me to the river i shall lose no time in making an effort to return home  they goodnaturedly assented to this and walked backward with her until they came to the place where the river bubbled up it really did bubble up bredenbutta noticed although she knew very well she had fallen down the great hole but then everything was topsyturvy in this strange land  the girl found her little boat which had stranded on the beach and having placed it where she could push it into the river she turned to say good by to the queer people of turvyland  i am glad to see you go said upsydoun without speaking for i like you but you are a strange creature and perhaps know what is best for you here are some oars for your boat for i see you have none and when you get down to your country you may need them  bredenbutta joyfully accepted the oars and placed them in her boat then the people of turvyland all kissed her with their left ears and waved their toes in farewell while the duchess got into the boat and pushed it out into the river  instantly she was in the midst of such a whirling of foam and rushing and roaring of rootbeer that she could neither see nor hear anything gasping for breath the girl clung tightly to the sides of the boat and in a few minutes it was all over and the boat bobbed up in the valley of mojust above the great hole bredenbutta then seized the oars and rowed hard until there was no danger of her falling in again and soon she had passed the rapids and was rowing safely up the river to her own home  of course the duchess was very glad again to be among the people who acted in a natural manner instead of the absurd fashion of her friends the turvylanders she resolved that whenever she rowed her boat upon the river again she would be careful to keep away from the great hole for she realized that another visit to upsydoun and his people would be very trying to her nerves    the eleventh surprise  prince fiddlecumdoo and the giant   it happened one morning that the monarch of mo was not in his usual pleasant humor and of course there was an excellent reason for this  at the back of his garden grew one tree that generally bore an abundant crop of animalcrackers and although the king and his court being surfeited with all the dainties of the land did not care much for these edibles the younger inhabitants of mo were especially fond of them and yelled with delight whenever the king divided the crop of his tree among them  a few days before the king had examined the tree and found the animalcrackers not quite ripe whereupon he had gone away and forgotten all about them and in his absence they had ripened to a delicious light brown and their forms had rounded out so that they hung as thickly together as peas in a pod as they swung from their stems swaying backward and forward in the light breeze they waited and waited for some one to come and pick them but no one came near the tree and the animals grew cross and restless in consequence  i wonder when we shall be gathered remarked a hippopotamuscracker with a yawn  oh you wonder do you mockingly replied a camelcracker hanging near do you really expect any one to gather you with your thick hide and clumsy legs why the children would break their teeth on you at the first bite  what screamed the hippopotamus in much anger do you dare insult me you humpbacked beast of burden  now thennow then interrupted a wolfcracker that hung from a stem just above them whats the use of fighting when we are so soon to be eaten  but the camelcracker would not be appeased  thickheaded brute he yelled at the hippopotamus angrily  humpbacked idiot shrieked the other  at this the camel swung himself fiercely on his branch and bumped against the hippopotamus knocking him off from the tree the ground underneath was chocolate and it was soft and sticky not having dried since the last rain so when the hippopotamus fell he sank half way into the ground and his beautiful brown color was spattered with the muddy chocolate  at this vengeful deed on the part of the camel all the other animals became furious a fullgrown goatcracker swung himself against the camel and knocked it in turn from its stem and in falling on the ground it broke its hump off then a lioncracker knocked the goat down and an elephant knocked a cat down and soon the whole tree was in a violent commotion the animals fought with each other so desperately that before long the entire treeful of animalcrackers had fallen to the ground where many lay broken and disfigured and the remainder were sunk deep in the chocolate mud  so when the king finally remembering his tree came and looked on the sorry sight it dampened his usual good spirits and he heartily wished he had picked the quarrelsome crackers before they began to fight among themselves  while he stood thinking dismally on this up came prince fiddlecumdoo and asked permission to go on a journey  where do you wish to go asked the king  i am tired of this beautiful valley answered fiddlecumdoo and as the bicycle tree beside the crystal lake is now hanging full of ripe wheels i thought i would gather one and ride over into the next valley in search of adventure you see this prince was the kings youngest son and had been rather spoiled by petting as youngest sons often are  the next valley my son is inhabited by the giant hartilaf said the king and should you meet him he might do you an injury  oh i am not afraid of hartilaf replied fiddlecumdoo boldly if he should not be pleasant to me i could run away from him on my wheel  i dont know about that responded the king there may be bicycle trees in the next valley as well as here and it is always dangerous and foolish for any one to leave this valley where there is everything that heart could wish instead of running away in search of adventures you would do better to remain at home and help your mother pick collar buttons and neckties for the family  that is work said fiddlecumdoo sulkily and i hate work  yet somebody has to pick the collar buttons returned the king or we should be unable to keep our collars on  then let jollikin help my mother i am horribly tired of this stupid place and shall not be happy until i have traveled around and seen something more of the world  well well go if you wish answered the king impatiently but take care of yourself for when you are away from this valley there will be no one to protect you from danger  i can take care of myself cried the prince so do not worry about me and he ran away quickly before his father had time to change his mind and withdraw his consent  he selected the best and ripest bicycle on the tree and having mounted it was soon speeding away along the path to the mountains  when he reached the far eastern part of mo he came on a bush bearing a very good quality of violins and this at once attracted fiddlecumdoo who was a most excellent violinist being able to play correctly a great number of tunes so he dismounted and selected from the bush a small violin that seemed to have a sweet tone this he carried with him under his arm thinking if he became lonesome he could amuse himself with the music  shortly after resuming his journey he came to the maple plains a level stretch of country composed entirely of maple sugar these plains were quite smooth and very pleasant to ride on but so swiftly did his bicycle carry him that he soon crossed the plains and came on a river of pure maple syrup so wide and deep that he could neither leap nor swim it  dismounting from his bicycle the prince began looking for some means of crossing the river no bridge was visible in either direction and the bank was bare save for a few low bushes on which grew maple bonbons and maple caramels  but prince fiddlecumdoo did not mean to be turned back by so small a matter as a river so he scooped a hole in the maple sand and having filled it with syrup from the river lighted a match and began boiling it after it had boiled for a time the maple syrup became stringy and the prince quickly threw a string of it across the river it hardened almost immediately and on this simple bridge the prince rode over the stream  once on the other side he sped up the mountain and over the top into the next valley where he stopped and began to look about him  he could see no roads in any direction but away down at the foot of the valley was a monstrous house so big you could easily put a small village inside it including the church this fiddlecumdoo thought must be where the giant lived and although he saw no one about the house he decided to make a call and introduce himself to mr hartilaf so he rode slowly down the valley playing on his violin as he went that the music might announce his coming  the giant hartilaf was lying on the sofa in his sittingroom waiting for his wife to prepare the dinner and he had nearly fallen asleep when the sound of fiddlecumdoos music fell on his ear this was so unusual in his valley that the giant arose and went to the front door to see what caused it  the prince had by this time nearly reached the house and when the giant appeared he was somewhat startled as he had not expected to see any one quite so big but he took care not to show any fear and taking off his hat he bowed politely to the giant and said  this is mr hartilaf i suppose  that is my name replied the giant grinning at the small size of his visitor may i ask who you are  i am prince fiddlecumdoo and i live in the next valley which is called the valley of mo being determined to see something of the world i am traveling for pleasure and have just dropped in on you for a friendly call  you are very welcome i am sure returned the giant if you will graciously step into my humble home i shall be glad to entertain you at dinner  prince fiddlecumdoo bowed low and accepted the invitation but when he endeavored to enter the house he found the steps so big that even the first one was higher than his head and he could not climb to the top of it  seeing his difficulty the giant carefully picked him up with one finger and his thumb and put him down on the palm of his other hand  do not leave my bicycle said the prince for should anything happen to it i could not get home again  so the giant put the bicycle in his vest pocket and then he entered the house and walked to the kitchen where his wife was engaged preparing the dinner  guess what ive found said the giant to his wife holding his hand doubled up so she could not see the prince  im sure i dont know answered the woman  but guess pleaded the giant  go away and dont bother me she replied bending over the stewpan or you wont have any dinner today  the giant however was in a merry mood and for a joke he suddenly opened his hand and dropped the prince down his wifes neck  oh oh she screamed trying to get at the place where the prince had fallen which was near the small of her back what is it im sure its some horrible crocodile or dragon or something that will bite me and the poor woman lay down on the carpet and began to kick her heels against the floor in terror  the giant roared with laughter but the prince now being able to crawl out scrambled from the ladys neck and standing beside her head he made a low bow and said  do not be afraid madam it is only i but i must say it was a very ungallant trick for your husband to play on you to say nothing of my feelings in the matter  so it was she exclaimed getting upon her feet again and staring curiously at fiddlecumdoo but tell me who you are and where you came from  the giant having enjoyed his laugh now introduced the prince to his wife and as dinner was ready to serve they sat down at the table together  fiddlecumdoo got along very well at dinner for the giant thoughtfully placed him on the top of the table where he could walk around as he pleased there being no knife nor fork small enough for him to use the prince took one of the giants toothpicks which was as big as a sword and with this served himself from the various dishes that stood on the table  when the meal was over the giant lighted his pipe the bowl of which was as big as a barrel and asked fiddlecumdoo if he would kindly favor them with some music  certainly replied the prince  please come into the kitchen said the giantess for then i can listen to the music while i am washing the dishes  the prince did not like to refuse this request although at home he was not allowed to enter his mothers kitchen so the giant carried him in and placed him on a high shelf where fiddlecumdoo seated himself on a spool of thread and began to play his violin  the big people enjoyed the music very much at first for the prince was a capital player but soon came a disagreeable interruption  about a month before the giant had caught several dancingbears in the mountains and having brought them home had made them into strings of sausages these were hanging in graceful festoons from the beams of the kitchen ceiling awaiting the time when they should be eaten  now when the dancingbear sausages heard the music of fiddlecumdoos violin they could not resist dancing for it is well known that sausages made from real dancingbears can not remain quiet where there is music the prince was playing such a lively tune that presently the strings of sausage broke away from the ceiling and fell clattering to the floor where they danced about furiously not being able to see where they were going they bumped against the giant and his wife thumping them on their heads and backs and pounding them so severely that the woman became frightened and hid under the table while the giant started to run away  seeing their plight fiddlecumdoo stopped playing and at once the sausages fell to the floor and lay still  that was strange said the giant as soon as he could catch his breath the bears evidently do not forget how to dance even after they are chopped up into sausage meat i must beg you to abandon your concert for the present but before you visit us again we shall have eaten the sausages and then you may play to your hearts content  had i known they were so lively remarked the giantess as she crawled from beneath the table we should have eaten them before this  that reminds me that i intended to have stewed polar bears for supper continued the giant so i think i will walk over into alaska and catch some  perhaps the prince would prefer elephant pie suggested the lady and in that case you might make a run into south america for elephants  i have no choice in the matter said the prince never having eaten either but is it not rather a long journey to alaska or to south america  not at all protested the giant i shall enjoy the walk and can easily be back by sundown wont you come with me he asked the boy but fiddlecumdoo did not like the idea of so long a journey and begged to be excused  the giantess brought her lord a great bag to put the polar bears in and he prepared to start  i leave you to amuse my wife during my absence he said to the prince pray make yourself entirely at home and use my castle as you would your own house and if i have good luck you shall eat a delicious polarbear stew for your supper  then he slung the sack across his back and went away whistling merrily and so great were his strides that in less than a minute he was out of sight  this is my busy day said the giantess to fiddlecumdoo and i fear i shall not be able to entertain you in a proper manner for i must hasten to the laundry to wash the clothes however if you care to accompany me we may converse together while i am doing my work  i shall take great pleasure in visiting your laundry he replied for never before have i been in such a place and surely it will be more agreeable to watch you at your work than to spend the day alone in these great rooms  come along then she said and picking him up she placed him in the pocket of her apron for she knew he would be unable to walk down the flight of stairs that led to the laundry he was very comfortable in the pocket which was just deep enough to allow his head and shoulders to project from the top therefore he was able to see all that was going on while the lady was at work he watched her wash and rinse the clothes and was greatly interested in the operation as it was all new to him  by and by the giantess brought an immense clotheswringer from a shelf and having fastened it to the side of the big wash tub began to wring out the clothes  prince fiddlecumdoo had never seen a clotheswringer before and so pleased was he with the novelty of it that he leaned far out of the pocket to watch it work but unfortunately he lost his balance and before he knew what had happened to him had fallen from the pocket and lay sprawling on one of the giants shirts which was just then passing through the wringer  the woman did not notice his fall and the next instant he was drawn between the two great rollers and came out on the other side as thin and flat as a sheet of paper  then the giants wife saw what she had done and realizing how serious was the princes condition the good lady was much grieved over the accident she picked fiddlecumdoo up and tried to stand him on his feet but he was so thin that at the least draft he fluttered like a flag while a puff of wind would blow him completely over  dear me exclaimed the woman sorrowfully whatever can we do with you in that shape  i really do not know what will become of me replied the prince i am certainly no good in this condition i can not even walk across the room without toppling over can not you manage to push me together again the giantess tried to do this but the prince was so sharp that his edges hurt her hands and all she could do was to fold him up and carry him into the drawingroom where she laid him carefully on the centertable  just before sundown the giant returned from alaska bringing several fat polarbears in his bag and scarcely had he set foot within the house before he inquired after his guest the prince  you will find him on the drawingroom table said the giantess i accidently ran him through the clotheswringer this afternoon and the poor boy is as thin as a pie crust so i folded him up and put him away until you returned  the giant immediately went to the table and unfolded fiddlecumdoo asking him how he felt  very miserable answered the prince for i can not move at all when i am folded up where is my bicycle  the giant searched all his pockets but could not find it  i must have lost it on my journey to alaska he said  then how am i ever to get home again asked the prince  that is a puzzle the giant responded thoughtfully i do not see how you could ride on a bicycle even if you had one and you certainly can not walk far in your present condition  not if the wind blows acknowledged the prince  couldnt you go edgewise asked the giant after a moments reflection  i might try answered fiddlecumdoo hopefully  so the giant stood him up and he tried to walk edgewise but whenever a breath of wind struck him he fell over at once and several times he got badly crumpled up so that the giant had to smooth him out again with his hands  this certainly will not do at all declared the giant for not only are you getting wrinkled but you are liable to be blown away altogether i have just thought of a plan to get you back into the valley of mo again and when you are in your own country your friends may get you out of the scrape the best way they can  hartilaf then made the prince into a neat roll and tied a string around the middle to hold it in place then he tucked the roll under his arm and carried it to the top of the mountain that stood between the two valleys placing the prince carefully on the ground he started him rolling and in a short time he had rolled down the mountain side into the valley of mo  at first the people were much frightened not knowing what this strange thing could be that had come rolling into their midst they stood around curiously looking at the roll but afraid to touch it when suddenly fiddlecumdoo began to cry out and then so fearful was the sound they all ran away as fast as their legs could carry them  prince thinkabit however being more courageous than the rest at last ventured to approach and cut the string that fastened the roll instantly it opened and to their amazement the people saw what it was  upon my word it is brother fiddlecumdoo cried prince thinkabit the giant must have stepped on him  no indeed said poor fiddlecumdoo ive been run through a clotheswringer which is much worse than being stepped on  with many expressions of pity the kind people stood the prince up and helped him to the palace where the king was greatly shocked at his sad plight fiddlecumdoo was so broad that the only thing he could sit down on was the sofa and he was so thin that when princess pattycake sneezed he was blown half way across the room  at dinner he could eat nothing that was not sliced as thin as a shaving and so sad was his predicament that the king determined to ask the wise donkey what could be done to relieve his unfortunate son  after hearing all the particulars of the accident the donkey said blow him up  i did blow him up for being so careless replied the king but it didnt make him any thicker  what i mean explained the donkey is to bore a hole in the top of his head and blow air into him until he resumes his natural shape then if he takes care of himself he soon will be all right again  so the king returned to the palace and bored a hole in fiddlecumdoos head and then pumped him full of air with a bicycle pump when he had filled out into his natural shape they put a plug in the hole and stopped it up and after that fiddlecumdoo could walk around as well as before his accident  his only danger now was that he might get punctured and indeed his friends found him one day lying in the garden all flattened out again the prince having pricked his finger on a rosebush and thereby allowed his air to escape but they inflated him once again and afterward he was more careful of himself  fiddlecumdoo had such a horror of being flat that if his father ever wished to make him behave he threatened to stick a pin into him and that always had the desired effect  after several years the prince being a hearty eater filled up with solid flesh and had no further use for the airpump but his experience had made him so nervous that he never again visited the giant hartilaf for fear of encountering another accident    the twelfth surprise  the land of the civilized monkeys   i must now tell you of a very strange adventure that befell prince zingle which had it not turned out exactly as it did might have resulted in making him a captive for life in a remarkable country  by consulting smiths history of prince zingle you will notice that from boyhood he had a great passion for flying kites and unlike other boys he always undertook to make each kite larger than the last one therefore his kites grew in size and became larger and larger until at length the prince made one twice as tall as himself  when it was finished he was very proud of this great kite and took it out to a level place to see how well it would fly being accompanied by many of the people of mo who took considerable interest in the princes amusement  there happened to be a strong south wind blowing and fearing the kite might get away from him zingle tied the string around his waist it flew beautifully at first but pulled so hard the prince could scarcely hold it  at last when the string was all let out there came a sudden gust of wind and in an instant poor zingle was drawn into the air as easily as an ordinary kite draws its tail up and up he soared and the kite followed the wind and carried him over many countries until the strength died out of the air when the kite slowly settled toward the earth and landed the prince in the top of a tall tree  he now untied the string from his waist and fastened it to a branch of the tree as he did not wish to lose the kite after all his bother in making it  then he began to climb down to the ground but on reaching the lower branches he was arrested by a most curious sight  standing on the ground and gazing up at him were a dozen monkeys all very neatly dressed and all evidently filled with surprise at the princes sudden appearance in the tree  what a very queer animal exclaimed an old monkey who wore a tall silk hat and had white kid gloves on his hands gold spectacles rested on his nose and he pointed toward the prince with a goldheaded cane by his side was a little girlmonkey dressed in pink skirts and a blue bonnet and when she saw zingle she clung to the old monkeys hand and seemed frightened  oh grandpapa she cried take me back to mamma im afraid the strange beast will bite me  just then a big monkey wearing a blue coat with brass buttons and swinging a short club in his hand strutted up to them and said  dont be afraid little one the beast cant hurt you while im around and then he tipped his cap over his left ear and shook his club at the prince as if he did not know what fear meant  two monkeys who were dressed in red jackets and carried muskets in their hands now came running up and having looked at zingle with much interest they called for some one to bring them a strong rope  we will capture the brute and put him in the zoo said one of the soldiermonkeys  what kind of animal is it asked the other  i do not know but some of our college professors can doubtless tell and even if they cant they will give it some scientific name that will satisfy the people just as well  all this time prince zingle remained clinging to the branches of the tree he could not understand a word of the monkey language and therefore had no idea what they were talking about but he judged from their actions that the monkeys were not friendly when they brought a long and stout rope and prepared to throw one end of it over his head in order to capture him he became angry and called out to them  stopi command you what is the meaning of this strange conduct i am prince zingle eldest son of the monarch of mo and since i have been blown into your country through an accident i certainly deserve kind treatment at your hands  but this speech had no meaning in the ears of the monkeys who said to each other  hear him bark he jabbers away almost as if he could talk  by this time a large crowd of monkeys had surrounded the tree some being barefooted boymonkeys and some ladymonkeys dressed in silken gowns and gorgeous raiment of the latest mode and others menmonkeys of all sorts and conditions there were dandified monkeys and soberlooking business monkeys as well as several who appeared to be politicians and officials of high degree  stand back all of you shouted one of the soldiers were going to capture this remarkable beast for the royal menagerie and unless you stand out of the way he may show fight and bite some one  so they moved back to a safe distance and the soldiermonkey prepared to throw a rope  stop cried zingle again do you take me for a thief that you try to bind me i am a prince of the royal blood and unless you treat me respectfully i shall have my father the king march his army on you and destroy your whole country  he barks louder said the soldier look out for him he may be dangerous the next moment he threw the rope and caught poor zingle around his arms and body so that he was helpless then the soldiermonkey pulled hard on the rope and prince zingle fell out of the tree to the ground  at first the monkeys all pressed backward as if frightened but their soldiers cried out  weve got him he cant bite now  then one of them approached the prince and punched him with a stick saying stand up  zingle did not understand the words but he resented being prodded with the stick so he sprang up and rushed on the soldier kicking the stick from his hands his own arms being bound by the rope  the monkeys screamed and rushed in every direction but the other soldier came behind the prince and knocked him down with the butt of his gun then he tied his legs with another rope and seeing him thus bound the crowd of monkeys which had scattered and fallen over one another in their efforts to escape came creeping timidly back and looked on him with fear and trembling  weve subdued him at last remarked the soldier who had been kicked but hes a very fierce animal and i shall take him to the zoo and lock him in one of the strongest cages  so they led poor zingle away to where the royal zoological gardens were located and there they put him into a big cage with iron bars the door being fastened with two great padlocks  before very long every monkey in the country learned that a strange beast had been captured and brought to the zoo and soon a large crowd had gathered before zingles cage to examine him  isnt he sweet said a ladymonkey who held a green parasol over her head and wore a purple veil on her face  sweet grunted a manmonkey standing beside her hes the ugliest looking brute i ever saw scarcely has any hair on him at all and no tail and very little chin i wonder where on earth the creature came from  it may be one of those beings from whom our race is descended said another onlooker  the professors say we evolved from some primitive creature of this sort  heaven forbid cried a dandymonkey whose collar was so high that it kept tipping his hat over his eyes if i thought such a creature as that was one of my forefathers i should commit suicide at once  zingle had been sitting on the floor of his cage and wondering what was to become of him in this strange country of monkeys and now to show his authority one of the keepers took a long stick and began to poke the prince to make him stand up  stop that shouted the angry captive and catching hold of the stick he jerked it from the keepers hand and struck him a sharp blow on the head with it  all the ladymonkeys screamed at this and the menmonkeys exclaimed  what an ugly disposition the beast has  the childrenmonkeys began to throw peanuts between the bars of the cage and zingle who had now become very hungry picked them up and ate them this act so pleased the little monkeys that they shouted with laughter  at last two solemnlooking monkeys with gray hair and wearing long black coats and white neckties came up to the cage where they were greeted with much respect by the other monkeys  so this is the strange animal said one of the newcomers putting on his spectacles and looking sharply at the captive do you recognize the species professor  the other aged monkey also regarded the prince critically before he answered  i can not say i have ever seen a specimen of this genus before but one of our textbooks mentions an obscure animal called homo peculiaris and i have no doubt this is one of that family i shall write an article on the creature and claim he is a homo and without doubt the paper will create quite a stir in the scientific world  see here suddenly demanded prince zingle standing up and shaking the bars of his cage are you going to give me anything to eat or do you expect me to live on peanuts forever  not knowing what he said none of the monkeys paid any attention to this question but one of the professormonkeys appeared to listen attentively and remarked    to friend there seems to be a smoothness and variety of sound in his speech that indicates that he possesses some sort of language had i time to study this brute i might learn his method of communicating with his fellows indeed there is a possibility that he may turn out to be the missing link  however the professor not yet having learned his language prince zingle was obliged to remain hungry the monkeys threw several cocoanuts into the cage but the prisoner did not know what kind of fruit these were so after several attempts to bite the hard shell he decided they were not good to eat  day after day now passed away and although crowds of monkeys came to examine zingle in his cage the poor prince grew very pale and thin for lack of proper food while the continuance of his unhappy imprisonment made him sad and melancholy  could i but escape and find my way back to my fathers valley he moaned wearily i should be willing to fly small kites forever afterward  often he begged them to let him go but the monkeys gruffly commanded him to stop his jabbering and poked him with long sticks having sharp points so that the princes life became one of great misery  at the end of about two weeks a happy relief came to zingle for then a baby hippopotamus was captured and brought to the royal zoo and after this the monkeys left the princes cage and crowded around that of the new arrival  finding himself thus deserted prince zingle began to seek a means of escape from his confinement his first attempt was to break the iron bars but soon he found they were too big and strong then he shook the door with all his strength but the big padlocks held firm and could not be broken then the prisoner gave way to despair and threw himself on the floor of the cage weeping bitterly  suddenly he heard a great shout from the direction of the cage where the baby hippopotamus was confined and rising to his feet the prince walked to the bars and attempted to look out and discover what was causing the excitement to his astonishment he found he was able to thrust his head between two of the iron bars having grown so thin through hunger and abuse that he was much smaller than when the monkeys had first captured him he realized at once that if his head would pass between the bars his body could be made to do so likewise so he struggled bravely and at last succeeded in squeezing his body between the bars and leaping safely to the ground  finding himself at liberty the prince lost no time in running to the tree where he had left his kite but on the way some of the boymonkeys discovered him and raised a great cry which soon brought hundreds of his enemies in pursuit  zingle had a good start however and soon reached the tree quickly he climbed up the trunk and branches until he had gained the limb where the string of his kite was still fastened untying the cord he wound it around his waist several times and then finding a strong north wind blowing he skilfully tossed the kite into the air at once it filled and mounted to the sky lifting zingle from the tree and carrying him with perfect ease  it was fortunate he got away at that moment for several of the monkeys had scrambled up the tree after him and were almost near enough to seize him by the legs when to their surprise he shot into the air indeed so amazed were they by this remarkable escape of their prisoner that the monkeys remained staring into the air until prince zingle had become a little speck in the sky above them and finally disappeared  that was the last our prince ever saw of the strange country of the monkeys for the wind carried his kite straight back to the valley of mo when zingle found himself above his fathers palace he took out his pocketknife and cut the string of the kite and immediately fell head foremost into a pond of custard that lay in the back yard where he dived through a floating island of whipped cream and disappeared from view  nuphsed who was sitting on the bank of the custard lake was nearly frightened into fits by this sight and he ran to tell the king that a new meteor had fallen and ruined one of his floating islands  thereupon the monarch and several of his courtiers rushed out and found prince zingle swimming ashore and the king was so delighted at seeing his lost son again that he clasped him joyfully in his arms  the next moment he regretted this act for his best ermine robe was smeared its whole length with custard and would need considerable cleaning before it would be fit to wear again  the prince and the king soon changed their clothes and then there was much rejoicing throughout the land of course the first thing zingle asked for was something to eat and before long he was sitting at a table heaped with all sorts of good things plucked fresh from the trees  the people crowded around him demanding the tale of his adventures and their surprise was only equaled by their horror when they learned he had been captured by a band of monkeys and shut up in a cage because he was thought to be a dangerous wild beast  experience is said to be an excellent teacher although a very cruel one prince zingle had now seen enough of foreign countries to remain contented with his own beautiful valley and although it was many years before he again attempted to fly a kite it was noticed that when he at last did indulge in that sport the kite was of a very small size    the thirteenth surprise  the stolen plumpudding   the kings plumpudding crop had for some time suffered from the devastations of a secret enemy each day as he examined the vines he found more and more of the plumpudding missing and finally the monarch called his wise men together and asked them what he should do  the wise men immediately shut their eyes and pondered so long over the problem that they fell fast asleep while they slept still more of the plumpudding was stolen when they awoke the king was justly incensed and told the wise men that unless they discovered the thief within three days he would give them no cake with their icecream  this terrible threat at last aroused them to action and after consulting together they declared that in their opinion it was the fox that had stolen the pudding  hearing this the king ordered out his soldiers who soon captured the fox and brought him to the palace where the king sat in state surrounded by his wise men  so ho master fox exclaimed the king we have caught you at last  so it seems returned the fox calmly may i ask your majesty why i am thus torn from my home from my wife and children and brought before you like any common criminal  you have stolen the plumpudding answered the king  i beg your majestys pardon for contradicting you but i have stolen nothing declared the fox i can easily prove my innocence when was the plumpudding taken  a great deal of it was taken this morning while the wise men slept said the king  then i can not be the thief replied the fox as you will admit when you have heard my story  ah have you a story to tell inquired the king who dearly loved to hear stories  it is a short story your majesty but it will prove clearly that i have not taken your pudding  then tell it commanded the king it is far from my wish to condemn any one who is innocent  the wise men then placed themselves in comfortable positions and the king crossed his legs and put his hands in his pockets while the fox sat before them on his haunches and spoke as follows    the foxs story  it has been unusually damp in my den of late so that both my family and myself have suffered much first my wife became ill and then i was afflicted with a bad cold and in both cases it settled in our throats then my four children who are all of an age began to complain of sore throats so that my den became a regular hospital  we tried all the medicines we knew of but they did no good at all my wife finally begged me to go to consult doctor prairiedog who lives in a hole in the ground away toward the south so one morning i said good by to my family and ran swiftly to where the doctor lives  finding no one outside the hole to whom i might apply for admission i walked boldly in and having followed a long dark tunnel for some distance i suddenly came to a door  come in said a voice so in i walked and found myself in a very beautiful room lighted by fortyeight fireflies which sat in a row on a rail running all around the apartment in the center of the room was a table made of clay and painted in bright colors and seated at this table with his spectacles on his nose was the famous doctor prairiedog engaged in eating a dish of stewed snails  good morning said the doctor will you have some breakfast  no thank you i replied for the snails were not to my liking i wish to procure some medicine for my children who are suffering from sore throats   how do you know their throats are sore inquired the doctor  it hurts them to swallow i explained  then tell them not to swallow said the doctor and went on eating  sir i exclaimed if they did not swallow they would starve to death  that is true remarked the doctor we must think of something else after a moment of silence he cried out ha i have it go home and cut off their necks after which you must turn them inside out and hang them on the bushes in the sun when the necks are thoroughly cured in the sun turn them rightsideout again and place them on your childrens shoulders then they will find it does not hurt them to swallow  i thanked the great doctor and returned home where i did as he had told me for the last three days the necks of not only my children but of my wife and myself as well have been hanging on the bushes to be cured so we could not possibly have eaten your plumpudding indeed it was only an hour ago when i finished putting the neck on the last of my children and at that moment your soldiers came and arrested me  when the fox ceased speaking the king was silent for a while then he asked  were the necks all cured  oh yes replied the fox the sun cured them nicely  you see remarked the king turning to his wise men the fox has proved his innocence you were wrong as usual in accusing him i shall now send him home with six baskets of cherry phosphate as a reward for his honesty if you have not discovered the thief by the time i return i shall keep my threat and stop your allowance of cake  then the wise men fell atrembling and put their heads together counseling with one another  when the king returned they said your majesty it must have been the bullfrog  so the king sent his soldiers who captured the bullfrog and brought him to the palace  why have you stolen the plumpudding demanded the king in a stern voice  i steal your plumpudding exclaimed the frog indignantly surely you must be mistaken i am not at all fond of plumpudding and besides i have been very busy at home during the past week  what have you been doing asked the king  i will tell you for then you will know i am innocent of this theft  so the bullfrog squatted on a footstool and after blinking solemnly at the king and his wise men for a moment spoke as follows    the frogs story  some time ago my wife and i hatched out twelve little tadpoles they were the sweetest children parents ever looked on their heads were all very large and round and their tails were long and feathery while their skins were as black and shiny as could be we were proud of them my wife and i and took great pains to train our children properly that they might become respectable frogs in time and be a credit to us  we lived in a snug little hole under the bank of the river and in front of our dwelling was a large stone on which we could sit and watch the baby tadpoles grow although they loved best to lie in the mud at the bottom of the river we knew that exercise is necessary to the proper development of a tadpole so we decided to teach our youngsters to swim we divided them into two lots my wife training six of the children while i took charge of the other six we drilled them to swim in single file in column of twos and in line of battle but i must acknowledge they were quite stupid being so young and unless we told them when to stop they would keep on swimming until they bumped themselves into a bank or a stone  one day about a week ago while teaching our children to swim we started them all going in single file one after the other they swam in a straight line that was very pretty to see and my wife and i sat on the flat stone and watched them with much pride unfortunately at that very moment a large fish swam into our neighborhood and lay on the bottom of the river to rest it was one of those fishes that hold their great mouths wide open and i was horrified when i saw the advancing line of tadpoles headed directly toward the gaping mouth of the monster fish i croaked as loudly as i could for them to stop but either they failed to hear me or they would not obey the next moment all the line of swimming tadpoles had entered the fishs mouth and were lost to our view  mrs frog threw herself into my arms with a cry or anguish exclaiming  oh what shall we do our children are lost to us forever  do not despair i answered although i was myself greatly frightened we must try to prevent the fish from swimming away with our loved ones if we can keep him here some way may yet be found to rescue the children  up to this time the big fish had remained motionless but there was an expression of surprise in its round eyes as if it did not know what to make of the lively inhabitants of its stomach  mrs frog thought for a moment and then said  a short distance away is an old fishline and hook lying at the bottom of the river where some boys lost it while fishing one day if we could only  fetch it at once i interrupted with its aid we shall endeavor to capture the fish  she hastened away soon returning with the line which had a large hook on one end i tied the other end firmly about the flat stone and then advancing cautiously from behind that the fish might not see me i stuck the iron hook through its right gill  the monster gave a sudden flop that sent me head over heels a yard away then it tried to swim down the stream but the hook and line held fast and soon the fish realized it was firmly caught after which it wisely abandoned the struggle  mrs frog and i now sat down to watch the result and the time of waiting was long and tedious after several weary days however the great fish lay over on its side and expired and soon after there hopped from its mouth the sweetest little green frog you ever laid eyes on another and another followed until twelve of them stood beside us and then my wife exclaimed  they are our children the tadpoles they have lost their tails and their legs have grown out but they are our own little ones nevertheless  indeed this was true for tadpoles always become frogs when a few days old the children told us they had been quite comfortable inside the great fish but they were now hungry for young frogs always have wonderful appetites so mrs frog and i set to work to feed them and had just finished this pleasant task when your soldiers came to arrest me i assure your majesty this is the first time i have been out of the water for a week and now if you will permit me to depart i will hop back home and see how the youngsters are growing  when the bullfrog had ceased speaking the king turned toward the wise men and said angrily  it seems you are wrong again for the frog is innocent your boasted wisdom appears to me very like folly but i will give you one more chance if you fail to discover the culprit next time i shall punish you far more severely than i at first promised  the king now gave the bullfrog a present of a red silk necktie and also sent a bottle of perfumery to mrs frog the soldiers at once released the prisoner who joyfully hopped away toward the river   the wise men now rolled their eyes toward the ceiling and twirled their thumbs and thought as hard as they could at last they told the king they had decided the yellow hen was undoubtedly responsible for the theft of the plumpudding  so the king sent his soldiers who searched throughout the valley and at last captured the yellow hen and brought her into the royal presence  my wise men say you have stolen my plumpudding said his majesty if this is true i am going to punish you severely  but it is not true answered the yellow hen for i have just returned from a long journey  where have you been inquired the king  i will tell you she replied and after rearranging a few of her feathers that the rough hands of the soldiers had mussed the yellow hen spoke as follows    the yellow hens story  all my life i have been accustomed to hatching out thirteen eggs but the last time there were only twelve eggs in the nest when i got ready to set being experienced in these matters i knew it would never do to set on twelve eggs so i asked the red rooster for his advice  he considered the question carefully and finally told me he had seen a very nice large egg lying on the rocks near the sugar mountain  if you wish said he i will get it for you  i am very sorry to trouble you yet certainly i need thirteen eggs i answered  the red rooster is an accommodating fowl so away he flew and shortly returned with a large white egg under his wing this egg i put with the other twelve and then i set faithfully on my nest for three weeks at the end of which time i hatched out my chickens  twelve of them were as yellow and fluffy as any mother could wish but the one that came from the strange egg was black and awkward and had a large bill and sharp claws still thinking he was one of my children despite his deformity i gave him as much care as any of them and soon he outgrew the others and became very big and strong  the red rooster shook his head and said bluntly  that chick will be a great trouble to you for it looks to me strangely like one of our enemies the hawks  what i exclaimed reproachfully do you think one of my darling children could possibly be a hawk i consider that remark almost an insult mr rooster  the red rooster said nothing more but he kept away from my big black chick as if really afraid of it  to my great grief this chick suddenly developed a very bad temper and one day i was obliged to reprove it for grabbing the food away from its brothers suddenly it began screaming with anger and the next moment it sprang on me digging its sharp claws into my back  while i struggled to free myself he flew far up into the air carrying me with him and uttering loud cries that filled me with misgivings for i now realized when it was too late that his voice sounded exactly like the cry of a hawk  away and away he flew over mountains and valleys and rivers and lakes until at last as i looked down i saw a man pointing a gun at us a moment later he shot and the black chick gave a scream of pain at the same time releasing his hold of me so that i fell over and over and finally fluttered to the ground  then i found i had escaped one danger only to encounter another for as i reached the ground the man seized me and carried me under his arm to his home entering the house he said to his wife  here is a nice fat hen for our breakfast  put her in the coop replied the woman after supper i will cut off her head and pick the feathers from her body  this frightened me greatly as you may suppose and when the man placed me in the coop i nearly gave way to despair but finding myself alone i plucked up courage and began looking for a way to escape to my great joy i soon discovered that one of the slats of the coop was loose and having pushed it aside i was not long in gaining my liberty  once free i ran away from the place as fast as possible but did not know in which direction to go the country being so strange to me so i fluttered on half running and half flying until i reached the place where an army of soldiers was encamped if these men saw me i feared they would also wish to eat me for breakfast so i crept into the mouth of a big cannon thinking i should escape attention and be safe until morning soon i fell asleep and so sound was my slumber that the next thing i heard was the conversation of some soldiers who stood beside the cannon  it is nearly sunrise said one you must fire the salute is the cannon loaded  oh yes answered the other what shall i shoot at   fire into the air for then you will not hurt any one said the first soldier  by this time i was trembling with fear and had decided to creep out of the cannon and take the chances of being caught when suddenly bang went the big gun and i shot into the air with a rush like that of a whirlwind  the noise nearly deafened me and my nerves were so shattered that for a time i was helpless i felt myself go up and up into the air until soon i was far above the clouds then i recovered my wits and when i began to come down again i tried to fly i knew the valley of mo must be somewhere to the west so i flew in that direction until i found myself just over the valley when i allowed myself to flutter to the ground  it seems my troubles were not yet over for before i had fully recovered my breath after this long flight your soldiers seized me and brought me here  i am accused of stealing your plumpudding but in truth your majesty i have been away from your kingdom for nine days and am therefore wholly innocent  the yellow hen had scarce finished this story when the king flew into a violent rage at the deceptions of his wise men and turning to his soldiers he ordered them to arrest the wise men and cast them into prison  having given the unfortunate hen a pair of gold earrings that fitted her ears and matched her complexion the king sent her home with many apologies for having accused her wrongfully  then his majesty seated himself in an easy chair and pondered how best to punish the foolish wise men  i would rather have one really wise man he said to himself than fifty of these who pretend to be wise and are not  that gave him an idea so the next morning he ordered the wise men taken to the royal kitchen where all were run through the meat chopper until they were ground as fine as mincemeat having thoroughly mixed them the king stirred in a handful of salt and then made them into one man which the cook baked in the oven until it was well done  now said the king i have one wise man instead of several foolish ones perhaps he can tell me who stole the plumpudding  certainly replied the wise man that is quite easy it was the purple dragon  good cried the monarch i have discovered the truth at last  and so he had as you will find by reading the next surprise    the fourteenth surprise  the punishment of the purple dragon   scarcely had the king spoken when some of his soldiers came running with news that they had seen the purple dragon eating plumpudding in the royal garden  what did you do about it asked the monarch  we did nothing they answered for had we interfered with its repast the dragon would probably have eaten us for dessert  that is true remarked the king yet something must be done to protect us from this monster for many years it has annoyed us by eating our choicest crops and nothing we can do seems of any avail to save us from its ravages  if we were able to destroy the dragon said prince thinkabit we should be doing our country the greatest possible service  we have often tried to destroy it replied the king but the beast always manages to get the best of the fight having wonderful strength and great cunning however let us hold a council of war and see what is suggested  so a council of war was called the wise man all the princes and noblemen the dog and the wise donkey being assembled to talk the matter over  i advise that you build a high wall around the dragon said the wise man then it will be unable to get out and will starve to death  it is strong enough to break down the wall said the king  i suggest you dig a great hole in the ground remarked the donkey then the dragon will fall into it and perish  it is too clever to fall into the hole said the king  the best thing to do declared timtom is to cut off its legs for then it could not walk into our gardens  the scales on its legs are too hard and thick said the king we have tried that and failed  we might take a redhot iron and put the dragons eyes out ventured prince jollikin  its eyes are glass replied the king with a sigh and the iron would have no effect on them  suppose we tie a tin can to its tail suggested the dog the rattling of the can would so frighten the dragon that it would run out of the country  its tail is so long answered the king gloomily that the dragon could not hear the can rattle  then they all remained silent for a time thinking so hard that their heads began to ache but no one seemed able to think of the right thing to do  finally the king himself made a proposition  one thing we might attempt with some hope of success said his majesty should it fail we can not be worse off than we are at present my idea is for us to go in a great body to the castle of the dragon and pull out its teeth with a pair of forceps having no teeth the monster will be harmless to annoy us in any way and since we seem unable to kill it i believe this is the best way out of our difficulty  the kings plan pleased every one and met with shouts of approval the council then adjourned and all the members went to prepare for the fight with the purple dragon  first the blacksmith made a large pair of forceps to pull the dragons teeth with the handles of the forceps were so long that fifty men could take hold of them at one time then the people armed themselves with swords and spears and marched in a great body to the castle of the purple dragon  this remarkable beast which for so long had kept the valley of mo in constant terror was standing on the front porch of its castle when the army arrived it looked at the crowd of people in surprise and said  are you not weary with your attempts to destroy me what selfish people you must be whenever i eat anything that belongs to you there is a great row and immediately you come here to fight me these battles are unpleasant to all of us the best thing for you to do is to return home and behave yourselves for i am not in the least afraid of you  neither the king nor his people replied to these taunts they simply brought forward the big pair of forceps and reached them toward the dragon  this movement astonished the monster who never having been to a dentist in his life had no idea what the strange instrument was for  surely you can not think to hurt me with that iron thing it called out in derision and then the dragon laughed at the idea of any one attempting to injure it  but when the dragon opened its mouth to laugh the king opened the jaws of the forceps quickly closing them again on one of the monsters front teeth  pull cried the king and fifty men seized the handles of the forceps and began to pull with all their strength  but pull as they might the tooth would not come out and this was the reason the teeth of dragons are different from ours for they go through the jaw and are clinched on the other side therefore no amount of pulling will draw them out  the king did not know this fact but thought the tooth must have a long root so he called again  pull my brave men pull  and they pulled so hard that the dragon was nearly pulled from the porch of its castle to avoid this danger the cunning beast wound the end of its tail around a post of the porch and tied a hard knot in it  pull shouted the king for the third time  then a surprising thing happened any one who knows anything at all about dragons is aware that these beasts stretch as easily as if made of indiarubber therefore the strong pulling of the fifty men resulted in the dragon being pulled from its foothold and as its tail was fastened to the post its body began to stretch out  the king and his people thinking the tooth was being pulled started down the hill the forceps still clinging fast to the monsters big front tooth and the farther they went the more dragons body stretched out  keep going cried the king we mustnt let go now and away marched the fifty men and farther and farther stretched the body of the dragon  still holding fast to the forceps the king and his army marched into the valley and away across it and up the hills on the other side not even stopping to take breath when they came to the mountains and the forests and could go no farther they looked back and behold the dragon had stretched out so far that it was now no bigger around than a fiddlestring  what shall we do now asked the fifty men who were perspiring with the long pull and the march across the valley  im sure i dont know replied the panting king let us tie this end of the beast around a tree then we can think what is best to be done  so they tied that end of the dragon to a big tree and sat down to rest being filled with wonder that the mighty purple dragon was now no larger around than a piece of twine  the wicked creature will never bother us again said the king yet it was only by accident we found a way to destroy it the question now is what shall we do with this long thin dragon if we leave it here it will trip any one who stumbles against it  i shall use it for fiddlestrings said prince fiddlecumdoo for the crop failed this year and i have none for my violin let us cut the dragon up into the proper sizes and store the strings in the royal warehouse for general use  the king and the people heartily approved this plan so the prince brought a pair of shears and cut the dragon into equal lengths to use on his violin thus the wicked monster was made good use of at last for the strings had an excellent tone  and that was not only the end of the purple dragon but there were two other ends of him one tied to a tree in the mountains and the other fastened to a post of the castle  that same day the monarch of mo gave a magnificent feast to all his people to celebrate the destruction of their greatest foe and ever afterward the gardens of the beautiful valley were free from molestation
