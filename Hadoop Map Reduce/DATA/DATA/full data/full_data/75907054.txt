75907054	a monk of fife being the chronicle written by norman leslie of pitcullo concerning marvellous deeds that befell in the realm of france in the years of our redemption mccccxxixxxxi  now first done into english out of the french by andrew lang   to henrietta lang  my dear auntto you who read to me stories from the history of france before i could read them for myself this chronicle is affectionately dedicated  yours ever  andrew lang     preface   norman leslie of pitcullo whose narrative the reader has in his hands refers more than once to his unfinished latin chronicle  that work usually known as the book of pluscarden has been edited by mr felix skene in the series of historians of scotland vol vii  to mr skenes introduction and notes the curious are referred  here it may suffice to say that the original ms of the latin chronicle is lost that of six known manuscript copies none is older than 1480 that two of these copies contain a prologue and that the prologue tells us all that has hitherto been known about the author  the date of the lost latin original is 1461 as the author himself avers he also in his prologue states the purpose of his work  at the bidding of an unnamed abbot of dunfermline who must have been richard bothwell he is to abbreviate the great chronicle and bring it up to date as we now say  he is to recount the events of his own time with certain other miraculous deeds which i who write have had cognisance of seen and heard beyond the bounds of this realm  also lastly concerning a certain marvellous maiden who recovered the kingdom of france out of the hands of the tyrant henry king of england  the aforesaid maiden i saw was conversant with and was in her company in her said recovery of france and till her lifes end i was ever present  after i was ever present the copies add etc perhaps a sign of omission  the monkish author probably said more about the heroine of his youth and this the copyists have chosen to leave out  the author never fulfilled this promise of telling in latin the history of the maid as her career was seen by a scottish ally and friend  nor did he ever explain how a scot and a foe of england succeeded in being present at the maidens martyrdom in rouen  at least he never fulfilled his promise as far as any of the six latin mss of his chronicle are concerned  every one of these mssdoubtless following their incomplete originalbreaks off short in the middle of the second sentence of chapter xxxii book xii  here is the brief fragment which that chapter contains  in those days the lord stirred up the spirit of a certain marvellous maiden born on the borders of france in the duchy of lorraine and the see of toul towards the imperial territories  this maiden her father and mother employed in tending sheep daily too did she handle the distaff mans love she knew not no sin as it is said was found in her to her innocence the neighbours bore witness      here the latin narrative of the one man who followed jeanne darc through good and evil to her lifes end breaks off abruptly  the author does not give his name even the name of the abbot at whose command he wrote is left blank as if it had been erased in the original mr felix skene liber pluscardensis in the historians of scotland vii p 18  it might be guessed that the original fell into english hands between 1461 and 1489 and that they blotted out the name of the author and destroyed a most valuable record of their conqueror and their victim jeanne darc  against this theory we have to set the explanation here offered by norman leslie our author in the ratisbon scots colleges french ms of which this work is a translation  leslie never finished his latin chronicle but he wrote in french the narrative which follows decorating it with the designs which mr selwyn image has carefully copied in black and white  possessing this information we need not examine mr w f skenes learned but unconvincing theory that the author of the fragmentary latin work was one maurice drummond out of the lennox  the hypothesis is that of mr w f skene and mr felix skene points out the difficulties which beset the opinion of his distinguished kinsman  our monk is a man of fife  as to the veracity of the following narrative the translator finds it minutely corroborated wherever corroboration could be expected in the large mass of documents which fill the five volumes of m quicherats proces de jeanne darc in contemporary chronicles and in mss more recently discovered in french local or national archives  thus charlotte boucher barthelemy barrette noiroufle the scottish painter and his daughter elliot capdorat ay even thomas scott the kings messenger were all real living people traces of whose existence with some of their adventures survive faintly in brown old manuscripts  louis de coutes the pretty page of the maid a boy of fourteen may have been hardly judged by norman leslie but he certainly abandoned jeanne darc at her first failure  so after explaining the true position and character of our monkish author and artist we leave his book to the judgment which it has tarried for so long     chapter ihow this book was written and how norman leslie fled out of fife   it is not of my own will nor for my own glory that i norman leslie sometime of pitcullo and in religion called brother norman of the order of benedictines of dunfermline indite this book  but on my coming out of france in the year of our lord one thousand four hundred and fifty nine it was laid on me by my superior richard abbot in dunfermline that i should abbreviate the great chronicle of scotland and continue the same down to our own time 1  he bade me tell moreover all that i knew of the glorious maid of france called jeanne la pucelle in whose company i was from her beginning even till her end  obedient therefore to my superior i wrote in this our cell of pluscarden a latin book containing the histories of times past but when i came to tell of matters wherein as maro says pars magna fui i grew weary of such rude barbarous latin as alone i am skilled to indite for of the manner ciceronian as it is now practised by clerks of italy i am not master my book therefore i left unfinished breaking off in the middle of a sentence  yet considering the command laid on me in the end i am come to this resolve namely to write the history of the wars in france and the history of the blessed maid so far at least as i was an eyewitness and partaker thereof in the french language being the most commonly understood of all men and the most delectable  it is not my intent to tell all the story of the maid and all her deeds and sayings for the world would scarcely contain the books that should be written  but what i myself beheld that i shall relate especially concerning certain accidents not known to the general by reason of which ignorance the whole truth can scarce be understood  for if heaven visibly sided with france and the maid no less did hell most manifestly take part with our old enemy of england  and often in this life if we look not the more closely and with the eyes of faith sathanas shall seem to have the upper hand in the battle with whose very imp and minion i myself was conversant to my sorrow as shall be shown  first concerning myself i must say some few words to the end that what follows may be the more readily understood  i was born in the kingdom of fife being by some five years the younger of two sons of archibald leslie of pitcullo near st andrews a cadet of the great house of rothes  my mother was an englishwoman of the debatable land a storey of netherby and of me in our country speech it used to be said that i was a mothers bairn  for i had ever my greatest joy in her whom i lost ere i was sixteen years of age and she in me not that she favoured me unduly for she was very just but that within ourselves we each knew who was nearest to her heart  she was indeed a saintly woman yet of a merry wit and she had great pleasure in reading of books and in romances  being always when i might in her company i became a clerk insensibly and without labour i could early read and write wherefore my father was minded to bring me up for a churchman  for this cause i was some deal despised by others of my age and yet more because from my mother i had caught the southron trick of the tongue  they called me english norman and many a battle i have fought on that quarrel for i am as true a scot as any and i hated the english my own mothers people though they were for taking and holding captive our king james i of worthy memory  my fancy like that of most boys was all for the wars and full of dreams concerning knights and ladies dragons and enchanters about which the other lads were fain enough to hear me tell what i had read in romances though they mocked at me for reading  yet they oft came ill speed with their jests for my brother had taught me to use my hands and to hold a sword i was instructed by our smith who had been prentice to harry gow the burnthe wind of perth and the best man at his weapon in broad scotland  from him i got many a trick of fence that served my turn later  but now the evil time came when my dear mother sickened and died leaving to me her memory and her great chain of gold  a bitter sorrow is her death to me still but anon my father took to him another wife of the bethunes of blebo  i blame myself rather than this lady that we dwelt not happily in the same house  my father therefore still minded to make me a churchman sent me to robert of montroses new college that stands in the south street of st andrews a city not far from our house of pitcullo  but there like a wayward boy i took more pleasure in the battles of the nationsas of fife against galloway and the lennox or in games of catchpull football wrestling hurling the bar archery and golfthan in divine learningas of logic and aristotle his analytics  yet i loved to be in the scriptorium of the abbey and to see the good father peter limning the blessed saints in blue and red and gold of which art he taught me a little  often i would help him to grind his colours and he instructed me in the laying of them on paper or vellum with white of egg and in fixing and burnishing the gold and in drawing flowers and figures and strange beasts and devils such as we see grinning from the walls of the cathedral  in the french language too he learned me for he had been taught at the great university of paris and in avignon had seen the pope himself benedict xiii of uncertain memory  much i loved to be with father peter whose lessons did not irk me but jumped with my own desire to read romances in the french tongue whereof there are many  but never could i have dreamed that in days to come this art of painting would win me my bread for a while and that a leslie of pitcullo should be driven by hunger to so base and contemned a handiwork unworthy when practised for gain of my blood  yet it would have been well for me to follow even this craft more and my sports and pastimes less dickon melville had then escaped a broken head and i perchance a broken heart  but youth is given over to vanities that war against the soul and among others to that wicked game of the golf now justly cried down by our laws 2 as the mother of cursing and idleness mischief and wastery of which game as i verily believe the devil himself is the father  it chanced on an october day of the year of grace fourteen hundred and twentyeight that i was playing myself at this accursed sport with one richard melville a student of like age with myself  we were evenly matched though dickon was tall and weighty being great of growth for his age whereas i was of but scant inches slim and as men said of a girlish countenance  yet i was well skilled in the game of the golf and have driven a holland ball the length of an arrowflight there or thereby  but wherefore should my sinful soul be now in mind of these old vanities repented of i trust long ago  as we twain dickon and i were known for fell champions at this unholy sport many of the other scholars followed us laying wagers on our heads  they were but a wild set of lads for as then there was not as now there is a house appointed for scholars to dwell in together under authority  we wore coloured clothes and our hair long gold chains and whingers 3 in our belts all of which things are now most righteously forbidden  but i carried no whinger on the links as considering that it hampered a man in his play  so the game went on now dickon leading by a hole as they say and now myself and great wagers were laid on us  now at the hole that is set high above the eden whence you see far over the country and the rivermouth and the shipping it chanced that my ball lay between dickons and the hole so that he could in no manner win past it  you laid me that stimy of set purpose cried dickon throwing down his club in a rage and this is the third time you have done it in this game  it is clean against common luck quoth one of his party and the game and the money laid on it should be ours  by the blessed bones of the apostle i said no luck is more common today to me tomorrow to thee  lay it of purpose i could not if i would  you lie he shouted in a rage and gripped to his whinger  it was ever my fathers counsel that i must take the lie from none therefore as his steel was out and i carried none i made no more ado and the word of shame had scarce left his lips when i felled him with the iron club that we use in sand  he is dead cried they of his party while the lads of my own looked askance on me and had manifestly no mind to be partakers in my deed  now melville came of a great house and partly in fear of their feud partly like one amazed and without any counsel i ran and leaped into a boat that chanced to lie convenient on the sand and pulled out into the eden  thence i saw them raise up melville and bear him towards the town his friends lifting their hands against me with threats and malisons  his legs trailed and his head wagged like the legs and the head of a dead man and i was without hope in the world  at first it was my thought to row up the rivermouth land and make across the marshes and fields to our house at pitcullo  but i bethought me that my father was an austere man whom i had vexed beyond bearing with my late wicked follies into which since the death of my mother i had fallen  and now i was bringing him no college prize but a blood feud which he was like to find an ill heritage enough even without an evil and thankless son  my stepmother too who loved me little would inflame his anger against me  many daughters he had and of gear and goods no more than enough  robin my elder brother he had let pass to france where he served among the men of john kirkmichael bishop of orleanshe that smote the duke of clarence in fair fight at bauge  thinking of my father and of my stepmothers ill welcome and of robin abroad in the wars against our old enemy of england it may be that i fell into a kind of half dream the boat lulling me by its movement on the waters  suddenly i felt a crashing blow on my head  it was as if the powder used for artillery had exploded in my mouth with flash of light and fiery taste and i knew nothing  then how long after i could not tell there was water on my face the blue sky and the blue tide were spinning roundthey spun swiftly then slowly then stood still  there was a fierce pain stounding in my head and a voice said  that good oarstroke will learn you to steal boats  i knew the voice it was that of a merchant sailorman with whom on the day before i had quarrelled in the marketplace  now i was lying at the bottom of a boat which four seamen who had rowed up to me and had broken my head as i meditated were pulling towards a merchantvessel or carrick in the edenmouth  her sails were being set the boat wherein i lay was towing that into which i had leaped after striking down melville for two of the ships men being on shore had hailed their fellows in the carrick and they had taken vengeance upon me  you scholar lads must be taught better than your masters learn you said my enemy  and therewith they carried me on board the vessel the st margaret of berwick laden with a cargo of dried salmon from edenmouth  they meant me no kindness for there was an old feud between the scholars and the sailors but it seemed to me in my foolishness that now i was in lucks way  i need not go back with blood on my hands to pitcullo and my father  i had money in my pouch my mothers gold chain about my neck a ships deck under my foot and the seas before me  it was not hard for me to bargain with the shipmaster for a passage to berwick whence i might put myself aboard a vessel that traded to bordeaux for wine from that country  the sailors i made my friends at no great cost for indeed they were the conquerors and could afford to show clemency and hold me to slight ransom as a prisoner of war  so we lifted anchor and sailed out of edenmouth none of those on shore knowing how i was aboard the carrick that slipped by the bishops castle and so under the great towers of the minster and st rules forth to the northern sea  despite my broken headwhich put it comfortably into my mind that maybe dickons was no worsei could have laughed to think how clean i had vanished away from st andrews as if the fairies had taken me  now having time to reason of it quietly i picked up hope for dickons life remembering his head to be of the thickest  then came into my mind the many romances of chivalry which i had read wherein the young squire has to flee his country for a chance blow as did messire patroclus in the romance of troy who slew a man in anger over the game of the chess and many another knight in the tales of charlemagne and his paladins  for ever it is thus the story opens and my story methought was beginning today like the rest  now not to prove more wearisome than need be and so vex those who read this chronicle with much talk about myself and such accidents of travel as beset all voyagers and chiefly in time of war i found a trading ship at berwick and reached bordeaux safe after much sickness on the sea and in bordeaux with a very sore heart i changed the links of my mothers chain that were left to meall but four that still i keepfor money of that country and so with a lighter pack than spirit i set forth towards orleans and to my brother robin  on this journey i had good cause to bless father peter of the abbey for his teaching me the french tongue that was of more service to me than all my latin  yet my latin too the little i knew stood me in good stead at the monasteries where often i found bed and board and no small kindness i little deeming that in time to come i also should be in religion an old man and weary glad to speak with travellers concerning the news of the world from which i am now these ten years retired  yet i love even better to call back memories of these days when i took my part in the fray  if this be a sin may god and the saints forgive me for if i have fought it was in a rightful cause which heaven at last has prospered and in no private quarrel  and methinks i have one among the saints to pray for me as a friend for a friend not unfaithful  but on this matter i submit me to the judgment of the church as in all questions of the faith     chapter iihow norman leslie met noiroufle the cordelier called brother thomas in religion and of miracles wrought by brother thomas   the ways were rude and long from bordeaux town to orleans whither i had set my face not knowing when i left my own country that the city was beleaguered by the english  for who could guess that lords and knights of the christian faith holding captive the gentle duke of orleans would besiege his own citya thing unheard of among the very saracens and a deed that god punished  yet the news of this great villainy namely the leaguer of orleans then newly begun reached my ears on my landing at bordeaux and made me greatly fear that i might never meet my brother robin alive  and this my doubt proved but too true for he soon after this time fell with many other scottish gentlemen and archers deserted shamefully by the french and by charles de bourbon comte de clermont at the battle of the herrings  but of this i knew nothingas indeed the battle was not yet foughtand only pushed on for france thinking to take service with the dauphin against the english  my journey was through a country ruinous enough for though the english were on the further bank of the loire the partisans of the dauphin had made a ruin round themselves and their holds and not being paid they lived upon the country  the further north i held by ways broken and ruined with rains and suns the more bare and rugged grew the whole land  once stopping hard by a hamlet i had sat down to munch such food as i carried and was sharing my meal with a little brown herdboy who told me that he was dinnerless a few sheep and lean kine plucked at such scant grasses as grew among rocks and herbs useless but sweetscented when suddenly a horn was blown from the tower of the little church  the first note of that blast had not died away when every cow and sheep was scampering towards the hamlet and a kind of barmkyn 4 they had builded there for protection and the boy after them running with his bare legs for dear life  for me i was too amazed to run in time so lay skulking in the thick sweet smelling herbs whence i saw certain menatarms gallop to the crest of a cliff hard by and ride on with curses for they were not of strength to take the barmkyn  such was the face of france in many counties  the fields lay weedy and untilled the starving peasantfolk took to the highway every man preying on his neighbour  woods had grown up and broken in upon the roads  howbeit though robbers harboured therein none of them held to ransom a wandering poor scots scholar  slowly i trudged being often delayed and i was now nearing poictiers and thought myself well on my road to chinon where as i heard the dauphin lay when i came to a place where the road should have crossed a streamnot wide but strong smooth and very deep  the stream ran through a glen and above the road i had long noted the towers of a castle  but as i drew closer i saw first that the walls were black with fire and roofless and that carrion birds were hovering over them some enemy having fallen upon the place and next behold the bridge was broken and there was neither ford nor ferry  all the ruin was fresh the castle still smouldering the kites flocking and yelling above the trees the planks of the bridge showing that the destruction was but of yesterday  this matter of the broken bridge cost me little thought for i could swim like an otter  but there was another traveller down by the stream who seemed more nearly concerned  when i came close to him i found him standing up to his waist in the water taking soundings with a long and heavy staff  his cordeliers frock was tucked up into his belt his long brown legs with black hairs thick on them were naked  he was a huge dark man and when he turned and stared at me i thought that among all men of the church and in religion whom i had ever beheld he was the foulest and most fierce to look upon  he had an ugly murderous visage fell eyes and keen and a right long nose hooked like a falcons  the eyes in his head shone like swords and of all eyes of man i ever saw his were the most piercing and most terrible  on his back he carried as i noticed at the first what i never saw on a cordeliers back before or on any but his sincean arbalest and he had bolts enough in his bag the feathers showing above  pax vobiscum he cried in a loud grating voice as he saw me and scrambled out to shore  et cum anima tua i answered  nom de dieu he said you have bottomed my latin already that is scarce so deep as the river here  my malison on them that broke the bridge  then he looked me over fiercely  burgundy or armagnac he asked  i thought the question strange as a traveller would scarce care to pronounce for burgundy in that country  but this was a man who would dare anything so i deemed it better to answer that i was a scot and so far of neither party  tugmutton winesack he said these being two of many ill names which the french gave our countrymen for of all men the french are least grateful to us who under heaven and the maid have set their king on his throne again  the english knew this if the french did not and their great king harry the fifth when he fell ill of st fiacres sickness after plundering that scots saints shrine of certain horseshoes silvergilt said well that go where he would he was bearded by scots dead or alive  but the french are not a thankful people  i had no answer very ready to my tongue so stepped down silent to the wateredge and was about taking off my doublet and hose meaning to carry them on my head and swim across  but he barred the way with his staff and for me i gripped to my whinger and watched my chance to run in under his guard  for this cordelier was not to be respected i deemed like others of the order of st francis and all men of holy church  answer a civil question he said before it comes to worse armagnac or burgundy  armagnac i answered or anything else that is not english  clear the causeway mad friar  at that he threw down his staff  i go north also he said to orleans if i may for the foul manants and peasant dogs of this country have burned the castle of alfonse rodigo a good knight that held them in right good order this year past he was worthy indeed to ride with that excellent captain don rodrigo de villandradas  kings captain or village labourer all was fish that came to his net and but two days ago i was his honourable chaplain  but he made the people mad and a great carouse that we kept gave them their opportunity  they have roasted the good knight alfonse and would have done as much for me his almoner frock and all if wine had any mastery over me  but i gave them the slip  heaven helps its own  natheless i would that this river were between me and their vengeance and for once i dread the smell of roast meat that is still in my nostrilspah  and here he spat on the ground  but one door closes he went on and another opens and to orleans am i now bound in the service of my holy calling  there is indeed cause enough for the shriving of souls of sinners father in that country as i hear and a holy man like you will be right welcome to many  they need little shriving that are opposite my culverin said this strange priest  though now i carry but an arbalest the gun is my mistress and my patron is the gunners saint st barbara  and even with this toy methinks i have the lives of a score of goddams in my bolt pouch  i knew that in these wild days many clerics were careless as to that which the church enjoins concerning the effusion of bloodnay i have named john kirkmichael bishop of orleans as having himself broken a spear on the body of the duke of clarence  the abbe of cerquenceaux also was a valiant man in religion and a good captain and all over france clerics were gripping to sword and spear  but such a priest as this i did not expect to see  your name he asked suddenly the words coming out with a sound like the first grating of a saw on stone  they call me norman leslie de pitcullo i answered  and yours  my name he said is noiroufleand i thought that never had i seen a man so well fitted with a namein religion brother thomas a poor brother of the order of the mad st francis of assisi  then brother thomas how do you mean to cross this water which lies between you and the exercise of your holy calling  do you swim  like a stone cannonball and for all that i can find the cursed water has no bottom  cross he snarled  let me see you swim  i was glad enough to be quit of him so soon but i noticed that as i stripped and packed my clothes to carry in a bundle on my head the holy man set his foot in the stirrup of his weapon and was winding up his arbalest with a windlass a bolt in his mouth watching at the same time a heron that rose from a marsh on the further side of the stream  on this bird i deemed he meant to try his skill with the arbalest  adieu brother thomas i said as i took the water and in a few strokes i was across and running up and down on the bank to get myself dry  back came his grating voiceback and without your clothes you winesack of scotland or i shoot and his arbalest was levelled on me  i have often asked myself since what i should have done and what was the part of a brave man  perchance i might have dived and swum downstream under water but then i had bestowed my bundle of clothes some little way off and brother thomas commanded it from his side of the stream  he would have waited there in ambush till i came shivering back for hose and doublet and i should be in no better case than i was now  meanwhile his weapon was levelled at me and i could see the boltpoint set straight for my breast and glittering in a pale blink of the sun  the bravest course is ever the best  i should have thrown myself on the earth no doubt and so crawled to cover taking my chance of death rather than the shame of obeying under threat and force  but i was young and had never looked death in the face so being afraid and astonished i made what seemed the best of an ill business and though my face reddens yet at the thought of it i leaped in and swam back like a dog to heel  behold me i said making as brave a countenance as i might in face of necessity  well done norman leslie de pitcullo he snarled baring his yellow teeth  this is the obedience which the young owe to the church  now ferry me over you are my boat  you will drown man i said  not while you swim  then unbuckling his frock he packed it as he had seen me do bade me put it on my head and so stepped out into the water holding forth his arm to put about my neck  i was for teaching him how to lay it on my shoulder and was bidding him keep still as a plank of wood but he snarled  i have sailed on a boat of flesh before today  to do him justice he kept still as a log of wood and so yielding partly to the stream i landed him somewhat further down than the place where my own clothes were lying  to them he walked and very quietly picking up my whinger and my raiment that he gathered under his arm he concealed himself in a thick bush albeit it was leafless where no man could have been aware of him  this amazed me not a little for modesty did not seem any part of his nature  now says he fetch over my arbalest  lying where i am you have no advantage to shoot me as nom de dieu i would have shot you had you not obeyed  and hark ye by the way unwind the arbalest before you cross it is ever well to be on the safe side  and be sure you wet not the string  he pushed his face through the bush and held in his mouth my naked whinger that shone between his shining eyes  now again i say it i have thought over this matter many a time and have even laughed aloud and bitterly when i was alone at the figure of me shivering there on a cold february day and at my helpless estate  for a naked man is no match for a man with a whinger and he was sitting on my clothes  so this friar unworthy as he was of his holy calling had me at an avail on every side nor do i yet see what i could do but obey him as i did  and when i landed from this fifth voyage he laughed and gave me his blessing and what i needed more some fiery spirits from a watergourd in which father thomas carried no water  well done my son he said and now we are comrades  my life was not over safe on yonder side seeing that the manants hate me and respect not my hood and two are better company than one where we are going  this encounter was the beginning of many evils and often now the picture shines upon my eyes and i see the grey water and hear the cold wind whistle in the dry reeds of the riverbank whereon we sat  the man was my master heaven help me as surely as sathanas was his  and though at last i slipped his clutches as you shall hear more readily than i trow he will scape his lord in the end for he still lives yet it was an ill day that we metan ill day for me and for france  howbeit we jogged on he merrily enough singing a sculdudery song i something surly under a grey february sky with a keen wind searching out the threadbare places in our raiment  my comrade as he called himself told me what passages he chose in the history of his life how he came to be frocked but cucullus non facit monachum and how in the troubles of these times he had discovered in himself a great aptitude for the gunners trade of which he boasted not a little  he had been in one and another of these armed companies that took service with either side for hire being better warriors and more skilled than the noblesse but a curse to france for in peace or war friend or foe they plundered all and held all to ransom  with rodrigo de villandradas that bloodhound of spain he had been high in favour but when rodrigo went to harry south and east he had tarried at ruffec with another thief of that nation alfonse rodigo  all his talk as we went was of slaying men in fight whom he slew he cared not much but chiefly he hated the english and them of burgundy  to him war was what hunting and shooting game is to others a cruel and bloody pastime when christians are the quarry  john the lorrainer and i there are no others to be named with us at the culverin he would brag  we two against an army give us good cover and powder and leaden balls enough  hey  master john and i must shoot a match yet against english targets and of them there are plenty under orleans  but if i make not the better speed the town will have fallen or yielded rescue or no rescue and of rescue there is no hope at all  the devil fights for the english who will soon be swarming over the loire and that king of bourges of ours will have to flee and gnaw horses fodder oats and barley with your friends in scotland  this was one of the many ungenerous taunts which the french made often against us scots that have been their ancient and leal brethren in arms since the days of king achaius and charlemagne  the dauphin he went on for king he is none and crowned he will never be should be in orleans leading his men and lo he is tied to the belt of fat la tremouille and is dancing of ballets at chinona murrain on him and on them that make his music  then he fell to cursing his king a thing terrible to hear and so to asking me questions about myself  i told him that i had fled my own country for a manslaying hoping may heaven forgive me to make him think the higher of me for the deed  so we all begin said he a shrewd blow or a fair wench a death or a birth unlawful tis all one forth we are driven to the world and the wars  yet you have started wellwell enough and better than i gave your girls face credit for  bar steel and rope you may carry some french gold back to stinking scotland yet  he gave me so much credit as this for a deed that deserved none but rather called for rebuke from him who however unworthy was in religion and wore the garb of the blessed francis  but very far from fortifying me in virtuous courses as was his bounden duty there was no wickedness that he did not try to teach me till partly i hated him and partly i fear i admired one so skilled in evil  the truth is as i said that this man for that time was my master  he was learned in all the arts by which poor and wandering folk can keep their bellies full wandering by the way  with women ugly and terrible of aspect as he was he had a great power a pious saying for the old a way with the young which has ever been a mystery to me unless as some of the learned think all women are naturally lovers of wickedness if strength and courage go with it  what by wheedling what by bullying what by tales of pilgrimages to holy shrines he was coming from jerusalem by way of rome so he told all we met he ever won a welcome  other more devilish cantrips he played one of them at the peasants house where we rested on the first night of our common travel  the lenten supper which they gave us with no little kindness was ended and we were sitting in the firelight brother thomas discoursing largely of his pilgrimages and of his favour among the high clergy  thus at i know not what convent of the clarisses 5 in italy the holy sisters had pressed on him a relic of monsieur st aignan the patron of the good town of orleans  to see this relic the farmer his wife and his sons and daughters crowded eagerly it was but a little blackened finger bone yet they were fain to touch it as is the custom  but this he would not yet allow  perchance some of you he said are already corrupt not knowing it with the poisonous breath of that damnable hussite heresy which is blowing from the east like wind of the pestilence and ye may have doubts concerning the verity of this most holy and miraculous relic  they all crossed themselves protesting that no such wicked whisper of sathanas had ever come into their minds nor had they so much as heard of huss and his blasphemies  nay said brother thomas i could scarcely blame you if it were partly as i said  for in this latter time of the world when i have myself met jews flocking to babylon expecting the birth of antichrist there be many false brethren who carry about feigned relics to deceive the simple  we should believe no man if he be as i am a stranger unless he shows us a sign such as now i will show you  give me of your grace a kerchief or a napkin  the goodwife gave him a clean white napkin from her aumbry and he tore it up before their eyes she not daring to stay his hand  now note this holy relic and its wonderful power he said holding the blackened bone high in his left hand and all our eyes were fixed on it now mark he said again passing it over the napkin and lo there was a clean white napkin in his hands and of the torn shreds not a trace  we were still gaping and crossing ourselves with blessings on this happy day and our unworthy eyes that beheld a miracle when he did a thing yet more marvellous if that might be which i scarce expect any man will believe  going to the table and catching up a glass vessel on which the goodwife set great store he threw it against the wall and we all plainly heard it shiver into tinkling pieces  then crossing the room into the corner that was dusky enough he faced us again holding the blessed relic whereon we stared in holy fear  then he rose and in his hand was the goodwifes glass vessel without crack or flaw 6  such he said are the properties of this miraculous relic there is nothing broken but it will mend ay a broken limb as i can prove on my own sinful bodythrusting out his great brown leg whereon assuredly were signs of a fracture ay a broken leg or my dear daughters a broken heart  at this of course they were all eager to touch the blessed relic with their poor rings of base metal such as they wear who are not rich  nay but first he said they must give their mites for a convent of the clarisses that was building at castres by the care of the holy colette whom he might call his patroness unworthy as he was  then he showed us a safeconduct signed with that blessed womans own hand such as she was wont to give to the religious of the order of st francis  by virtue of this he said and by miracle for once he said truly as i had but too good cause to learn he could go freely in and out among the camps of french english and burgundians  you may conceive how joyous they were in that poor cottage on a night so blessed and how brother thomas told us of the holy colette that famous nun and mother in christ as he that had often been in her company  he had seen her body lifted in the air while she remained in a pious ecstasy her mind soaring aloft and her fleshly body following it some way  he had often watched that snowwhite beast which followed her such a creature as is known in no country of the sinful world but is a thing of paradise  and he had tried to caress this wondrous creature of god but vainly for none but the holy sister colette may handle it  concerning her miracles of healing too he told us all of which we already knew for very truth and still know on better warranty than his  ye may believe that late and at last brother thomas had his choice of the warmest place to sleep inby the four as is the wont of pilgrims for in his humility this holy man would not suffer the farmers wife and the farmer to give him their bed as they desired  i too was very kindly entreated by the young lads but i could scarcely sleep for marvelling at these miracles done by one so unworthy and great indeed i deemed must be the virtue of that relic which wrought such signs in the hands of an evil man  but i have since held that he feigned all by art magic and very sorcery for as we wended next morning on our road he plainly told me truly or falsely that he had picked up the blackened fingerbone out of the loathly ashes of the dead in the burned castle near ruffec  wherefore i consider that when brother thomas sold the grace of his relic by the touching of rings he dealt in a devilish black simony vending to simple christians no grace but that of his master sathanas thus he was not only evil if i guess aright which i submit to the judgment of my ecclesiastical superiors and of the church but he had even found out a new kind of wickedness such as i never read of in any books of theology wherein is much to be learned  i have spoken with some however knights and men of this world who deemed that he did but beguile our eyes by craft and sleightofhand  this other hellish art he had by direct inspiration as i hold of his master behemoth that he could throw his voice whither he would so that in all seeming it came from above or from below or from a corner of a room fashioning it to resemble the voice of whom he would yet none might see his lips move  with this craft he would affray the peasants about the fire in the little inns where we sometimes rested when he would be telling tales of bogles and eldritch fantasies and of fiends that rout and rap and make the tables and firkins dance  such art of speech i am advised is spoken of by st jerome in his comment on the holy prophet the saint isaiah and they that use it he calls ventriloqui in the latin or bellyspeakers and he takes an unfavourable sense of them and their doings  so much i have from the learned william de boyis prior of pluscarden where now i write with whom i have conversed of these matters privately and he thinks this art a thing that men may learn by practice without dealing in nigromancy and the black magic  this question i am content to leave as is fitting to the judgment of my superiors  and indeed as at that time brother thomas spake not in his belly except to make sport and affray the simple people soon turning their fears to mirth  certainly the country folk never misdoubted him the women for a holy man the men for a good fellow though all they of his own cloth shrank from him and i have seen them cross themselves in his presence but to no avail  he would say a word or two in their ears and they straightway left the place where he might be  none the less with his tales and arts brother thomas commonly so wrought that we seldom slept a la belle etoile in that bitter spring weather but we ordinarily had leave to lie by the hearth and got a supper and a breakfast  the good peasants would find their hen roosts the poorer often for all that he could snap up was to him fortune of war  i loved these manners little but leave him i could not  his eye was ever on me if i stirred in the night he was awake and watching me and by day he never let me out of a bolts flight  to cut the string of his wicked weapon was a thought often in my mind but he was too vigilant  my face was his passport he said my face indeed being innocent enough as was no shame to me but an endless cause of mirth and mockery to him yet by reason of the serviceableness of the man in that perilous country and my constant surprise and wonder at what he did and said and might do next which no man could guess beforehand and a kind of foolish pride in his very wickedness so much beyond what i had ever dreamed of and for pure fear of him also i found myself following with him day by day ever thinking to escape and never escaping  i have since deemed that just as his wickedness was to a boy for i was little more a kind of charm made up of a sort of admiring hate and fear so my guilelessness as it seemed to him also wrought on him strangely  for in part it made sport for him to see my open mouth and staring eyes at the spectacle of his devilries and in part he really hated me and hated my very virtue of simplicity which it was his desire and delight to surprise and corrupt  on these strange terms then now drawn each to other and now forced apart we wended by poictiers towards chinon where the dauphin and his court then lay  so we fared northwards through poitou where we found evil news enough  for walking into a village we saw men women and children all gathered gaping about one that stood beside a horse nearly foundered its legs thrust wide its nostrils all foam and blood  the man who seemed as weary as his horse held a paper in his hands which the priest of that parish took from him and read aloud to us  the rider was a royal messenger one thomas scott of easter buccleuch in rankel burn whom i knew later and his tidings were evil  the dauphin bade his good towns know that on the 12th of february sir john stewart constable of the scottish forces in france had fallen in battle at rouvray with very many of his company and some frenchmen  they had beset a convoy under sir john fastolf that was bringing meat to the english leaguered about orleans  but fastolf had wholly routed them by treachery as we later learned of the comte de clermont and sir john stewart with his brother sir william were slain  wherefore the dauphin bade the good towns send him money and men or all was lost  such were the evil tidings which put me in sore fear for my brother robin one that in such an onfall would go far as beseemed his blood but as touching his fortunes thomas scott could tell me neither good nor bad though he knew robin and gave him a good name for a stout manat arms  it was of some comfort to me to hear a scots tongue but for the rest i travelled on with a heavier heart deeming that orleans must indeed fall ere i could seek my brother in that town     chapter iiiwhat befell outside of chinon town   my old nurse when i was a child used to tell me a long story of a prince who wandering through the world made friends with many strange companions  one she called lynxeye that could see through a mountain one was swiftfoot that could outrun the wind one was fineear that could hear the grass growing and there was greedygut that could swallow a river  all these were very serviceable to this gracious prince of i know not what country in his adventures and they were often brought into my mind by the companions whom we picked up on the grassgrown roads  these wanderers were as strange as the friends of the prince and were as variously but scarce as honourably gifted  there was the onearmed soldier who showed his stump very piteously when it was a question of begging from a burgess but was as well furnished with limbs as other men when no burgess was in sight  there was a wretched woman violer with her jackanapes and with her husband a hangdog ruffian she bearing the mark of his fist on her eye and commonly trailing far behind him with her brat on her back  there was a blind man with his staff who might well enough answer to keeneye that is when no strangers were in sight there was a layman wearing cope and stole and selling indulgences but our captain brother thomas soon banished him from our company for that he divided the trade  others there were each one of them a greedygut a crew of broken men who marched with us on the roads but we never entered a town or a house with these discreditable attendants  now it may seem strange but the nearer we drew to chinon and the court the poorer grew the country for the court and the menatarms had stripped it bare like a flight of locusts  for this reason the dauphin could seldom abide long at one place for he was so much better known than trusted that the very cordwainer would not let him march off in a new pair of boots without seeing his money and as the song said he even greased his old clouted shoon and made them last as long as he might  for headgear he was as ill provided seeing that he had pawned the fleurons of his crown  there were days when his treasurer at tours as i myself have heard him say did not reckon three ducats in his coffers and the heir of france borrowed money from his very cook  so the people told us and i have often marvelled how despite this poverty kings and nobles when i have seen them go always in cloth of gold with rich jewels  but as you may guess near the court of a beggar dauphin the countryfolk too were sour and beggarly  we had to tighten our belts before we came to the wood wherein crossroads meet from north south and east within five miles of the town of chinon  there was not a white coin among us night was falling and it seemed as if we must lie out under the stars and be fed like the wolves we heard howling on wind  by the roadside at the crossways but not in view of the road a council of our ragged regiment was held in a deep ditch  it would be late ere we reached the town gates would scarce open for us we could not fee the warders houses would be shut and dark the kings archers were apt to bear them unfriendly to wandering men with the devil dancing in their pouches  resource we saw none if there was a cottage dogs like wolves for hunger and fierceness were baying round it  as for brother thomas an evil bruit had gone before us concerning a cordelier that the fowls and geese were fain to follow as wilder things they say follow the blessed st francis  so there sat brother thomas at the crossroads footsore hungry and sullen in the midst of us who dared not speak he twanging at the string of his arbalest  he called himself our moses in his blasphemous way and the blind man having girded at him for not leading us into the land of plenty he had struck the man till he bled and now stood stanching his wound  suddenly brother thomas ceased from his twanging and holding up his hand for silence leaned his ear to the ground  the night was still though a cold wind came very stealthily from the east  horses he said  it is but the noise of the brook by the way said the blind man sullenly  brother thomas listened again  no it is horses he whispered  my men they that ride horses can spare somewhat out of their abundance to feed the poor  and with that he began winding up his arbalest hastily  aymeric he said to one of our afflicted company you draw a good bow for a blind man hide yourself in the opposite ditch and be ready when i give the word pax vobiscum  you giles he spoke to the onearmed soldier go with him and do you hear aim low at the third mans horse  from the sound there are not more than five or six of them  we can but fail at worst and the wood is thick behind us where none may pursue  you norman de pitcullo have your whinger ready and fasten this rope tightly to yonder birchtree stem and then cross and give it a turn or two about that oak sapling on the other side of the way  that trap will bring down a horse or twain  be quick you scotch winebag  i had seen many ill things done and to my shame had held my peace  but a leslie of pitcullo does not take purses on the highroad  therefore my heart rose in sudden anger i having all day hated him more and more for his bitter tongue and i was opening my mouth to cry a secoursa warning to them who were approaching when quick as lightning brother thomas caught me behind the kneejoints and i was on the ground with his weight above me  one cry i had uttered when his hand was on my mouth  give him the steel in his guts whispered the blind man  slit his weasand the scotch pig said the onearmed soldier  they were all on me now  no i keep him for better sport snarled brother thomas  he shall learn the scots for ecorcheurs flayers of men when we have filled our pouches  with that he crammed a great napkin in my mouth so that i could not cry made it fast with a piece of cord trussed me with the rope which he had bidden me tie across the path to trip the horses and with a kick sent me flying to the bottom of the ditch my face being turned from the road  i could hear giles and aymeric steal across the way and the rustling of boughs as they settled on the opposite side  i could hear the trampling hoofs of horses coming slowly and wearily from the east  at this moment chanced a thing that has ever seemed strange to me i felt the hand of the violer woman laid lightly and kindly on my hair  i had ever pitied her and as i might had been kind to her and her bairn and now as it appears she pitied me  but there could be no help in her nor did she dare to raise her voice and give an alarm  so i could but gnaw at my gag trying to find scope for my tongue to cry for now it was not only the travellers that i would save but my own life and my escape from a death of torment lay on my success  but my mouth was as dry as a kiln my tongue was doubled back till i thought that i should have choked  the night was now deadly still and the ring of the weary hoofs drew nearer and nearer  i heard a stumble and the scramble of a tired horse as he recovered himself for the rest all was silent though the beating of my own heart sounded heavy and husky in my ears  closer and closer the travellers drew and soon it was plain that they rode not carelessly nor as men who deemed themselves secure for the tramp of one horse singled itself out in front of the others and this doubtless was ridden by an eclaireur sent forward to see that the way ahead was safe  now i heard a low growl of a curse from brother thomas and my heart took some comfort  they might be warned if the brother shot at the foremost man or at worst if he was permitted to pass the man would bear swift tidings to chinon and we might be avenged the travellers and i for i now felt that they and i were in the same peril  the single rider drew near and passed and there came no cry of pax vobiscum from the friar  but the foremost rider had perchance the best horse and the least wearied for there was even too great a gap between him and the rest of his company  and now their voices might be heard as they talked by the way yet not so loud that straining my ears as i did i could hear any words  but the sounds waxed louder with words spoken ring of hoofs and rattle of scabbard on stirrup and so i knew at least that they who rode so late were men armed  brother thomas too knew it and cursed again very low  nearer nearer they came then almost opposite and now as i listened to hear the traitorous signal of murderpax vobiscumand the twang of bowstrings on the night there rang a voice a womans voice soft but wondrous clear such as never i knew from any lips but hers who then spoke that voice i heard in its last word jesus and still it is sounding in my ears  that voice said  nous voila presquarrives grace a mes freres de paradis  instantly i knew not how at the sound of that blessed voice and the courage in it i felt my fear slip from me as when we awaken from a dreadful dream and in its place came happiness and peace  scarce otherwise might he feel who dies in fear and wakes in paradise  on the forest boughs above me my face being turned from the road somewhat passed or seemed to pass like a soft golden light such as in the scots tongue we call a boyn that ofttimes men say travels with the blessed saints  yet some may deem it but a glancing in my own eyes from the blood flying to my head howsoever it be i had never seen the like before nor have i seen it since and assuredly the black branches and wild weeds were lit up bare and clear  the tramp of the horses passed there was no cry of pax vobiscum no twang of bows and slowly the ring of hoofs died away on the road to chinon  then came a rustling of the boughs on the further side of the way and a noise of footsteps stealthily crossing the road and now i heard a low sound of weeping from the violer woman that was crouching hard by where i lay  her man struck her across the mouth and she was still  you saw it  saints be with us  you saw them he whispered to brother thomas  fool had i not seen would i not have given the word  get you gone all the sort of you there is a fey man in this company be he who he will  wander your own ways and if ever one of you dogs speak to me again in field or street or market or ever mention this night    ye shall have my news of it  begone  off  nay but brother thomas sawst thou what we saw  what sight sawst thou  what saw i  fools what should i have seen but an outrider and he a kings messenger sent forward to warn the rest by his fall if he fell or to raise the country on us if he passed and if afterward they passed us not  they were men wary in war and travelling on the dauphins business  verily there was no profit in them  and that was all  we saw other things  what i saw was enough for me or for any good clerk of st nicholas and of questions there has been more than enough  begone scatter to the winds and be silent  and may we not put the steel in that scotch dog who delayed us  saints or sorcerers their horses must have come down but for him  brother thomas caught me up as if i had been a child in his arms and tossed me over the ditchbank into the wood where i crashed on my face through the boughs  only one horse would have fallen and that had brought the others on us the scot is safe enough his mouth is well shut  i will have no blood to night leave him to the wolves  and now begone with you to fierbois if you will i go my own roadalone  they wandered each his own way sullen and murmuring starved and weary what they had seen or fancied and whether if the rest saw aught strange brother thomas saw nought i knew not then and know not till this hour  but the tale of this ambush and of how they that lay in hiding held their hands and fledhaving come none might say whence and gone whither none might tellis true and was soon widely spoken of in the realm of france  the woods fell still again save for the babble of the brook and there i lay bound and heard only the stream in the silence of the night  there i lay quaking when all the caitiffs had departed and the black chill night received me into itself  at first my mind was benumbed like my body but the pain of my face smarting with switch and scratch of the boughs through which i had fallen awoke me to thought and fear  i turned over to lie on my back and look up for any light of hope in the sky but nothing fell on me from heaven save a cold rain that the leafless boughs did little to ward off  scant hope or comfort had i my whole body ached and shuddered only i did not thirst for the rain soaked through the accursed napkin on my mouth while the dank earth with its graveyard smell seemed to draw me down into itself as it drags a rotting leaf  i was buried before death as it were even if the wolves found me not and gave me other sepulture and now and again i heard their long hunting cry and at every patter of a beasts foot or shivering of the branches i thought my hour was comeand i unconfessed the road was still as death no man passing by it  this night to me was like the night of a man laid living in the tomb  by no twisting and turning could i loosen the rope that brother thomas had bound me in with a hand well taught by cruel practice  at last the rain in my face grew like a watertorture always dropping and i half turned my face and pressed it to the ground  whether i slept by whiles or waked all night i know not but certainly i dreamed seeing with shut eyes faces that came and went shifting from beauty such as i had never yet beheld to visages more and more hideous and sinful ending at last in the worstthe fell countenance of noiroufle  then i woke wholly to myself in terror to find that he was not there and now came to me some of that ease which had been born of the strange sweet voice and the strange words mes freres de paradis  my brethren of paradise who could she be that rode so late in company of armed men and yet spoke of such great kinsfolk  that it might be the holy colette then as now so famous in france for her miracles and good deeds and her austerities was a thought that arose in me  but the holy sister as i had heard never mounted a horse in her many wanderings she being a villeins daughter but was carried in a litter or fared in a chariot nor did she go in company with armed men for who would dare to lay hands on her  moreover the voice that i had heard was that of a very young girl and the holy sister colette was now entered into the vale of years  so my questioning found no answer  and now i heard light feet as of some beast stirring and scratching in the trees overhead and there with a light jingling noise  was it a squirrel  whatever it was it raced about the tree coming nearer and going further away till it fell with a weight on my breast and shivering with cold all strained like a harpstring as i was i could have screamed but for the gag in my mouth  the thing crawled up my body and i saw two red eyes fixed on mine and deemed it had been a wild cat such as lives in our corries of the northa fell beast if brought to bay but otherwise not hurtful to man  there the red eyes looked on me and i on them till i grew giddy with gazing and half turned my head with a stifled sob  then there came a sharp cry which i knew well enough and the beast leaped up and nestled under my breast for this so dreadful thing was no worse than the violer womans jackanapes that had slipped its chain or rather had drawn it out of her hand for now i plainly heard the light chain jingle  this put me on wondering whether they had really departed the man verily thirsted for my life but he would have slain me ere this hour i thought if that had been his purpose  the poor beast a little helped to warm me with the heat of his body and he was a friendly creature making me feel less alone in the night  yet in my own misery i could not help but sorrow for the poor woman when she found her jackanapes gone that was great part of her living and i knew what she would have to bear for its loss from the man that was her master  as this was in my mind the first grey stole into the sky so that i could see the black branches overhead and now there awoke the cries of birds and soon the wood was full of their sweet jargoning  this put some hope into my heart but the morning hours were long and colder than the night to one wet to the bone with the rains  now too i comforted myself with believing that arrive what might i was wholly quit of brother thomas whereat i rejoiced like the man in the tale who had sold his soul to the enemy and yet in the end escaped his clutches by the aid of holy church  death was better to me than life with brother thomas who must assuredly have dragged me with him to the death that cannot die  morning must bring travellers and my groaning might lead them to my aid  and indeed footfarers did come and i did groan as well as i could but like the levite in scripture they passed by on the other side of the way fearing to meddle with one wounded perchance to the death lest they might be charged with his slaying if he died or might anger his enemies if he lived  the light was now fully come and some rays of the blessed sun fell upon me whereon i said orisons within myself commanding my case to the saints  devoutly i prayed that if i escaped with life i might be delivered from the fear of man and namely of brother thomas  it were better for me to have died by his weapon at first beside the broken bridge than to have lived his slave going in dread of him with a slaves hatred in my heart  so now i prayed for spirit enough to defend my honour and that of my country which i had borne to hear reviled without striking a blow for it  never again might i dree this extreme shame and dishonour  on this head i addressed myself as was fitting to the holy apostle st andrew our patron to whom is especially dear the honour of scotland  then as if he and the other saints had listened to me i heard sounds of horses hoofs coming up the road from chinon way and also voices these like the others of the night before came nearer and i heard a womans voice gaily singing  and then awoke such joy in my heart as never was there before and this was far the gladdest voice that ever yet i heard for behold it was the speech of my own country and the tune i knew and the words     o we maun part this love willie    that has been lang between    theres a french lord coming over sea    to wed me wi a ring    theres a french lord coming oer the sea    to wed and take me hame  and who shall the french lord be elliot came another voice a mans this time though he need not cross the sea for you the worse the luck is it young pothon de xaintrailles  faith he comes often enough to see how his new penoncel fares in my hands and seems right curious in painting  it may be deemed strange that even in this hour i conceived in my heart a great mislike of this young french lord how unjustly i soon well understood     o nae french lord for me father    o nae french lord for me    but ill ware my heart on a trueborn scot    and wi him ill cross the sea  oh father lo you i can make as well as sing for that is no word of the old ballant but just came on to my tongue  they were now right close to me and half in fear half in hope i began to stir and rustle in the grass for of my stifled groaning had hitherto come no profit  then i heard the horses stop  what stirring is that in the wood father  i am afraid came the girls voice  belike a fox shifting his lair  push on maid elliot  the horses advanced when by the blessing of the saints the jackanapes woke in my breast  the creature was used to run questing with a little wooden bowl he carried for largesse to beg of horsemen for his mistress  this trick of his he did now hearing the horses tramp  he leaped the ditch and i suppose he ran in front of the steeds shaking his little bowl as was his wont  oh father sounded the girls voice see the little jackanapes  some travelling body has lost him  let me jump down and catch him  look he has a little coat on made like a heralds tabard and wears the colours of france  here hold my reins  no lass  who can tell where or who his owner is  take you my reins and i will bring you the beast  i heard him heavily dismount  it will not let itself be caught by a lame man he said and he scrambled up the ditch bank while the jackanapes fled to me and then ran forward again back and forth  nom dieu whom have we here cried the man in french  i turned and made such a sound with my mouth as i might while the jackanapes nestled to my breast  why do ye not speak man he said again and i turned my eyes on him looking as pitifully as might be out of my bloodbedabbled face  he was a burly man great of growth with fresh red cheeks blue eyes reddish hair and a red beard such as are many in the border marches of my own country the saints bless them for true men  withal he dragged his leg in walking which he did with difficulty and much carefulness  he hirpled as we say towards me very warily then seeing the rope bound about me and the cloth in my mouth he drew his dagger but not to cut my bonds  he was over canny for that but he slit the string that kept the cursed gag in my mouth and picked it out with his dagger point and oh the blessed taste of that first long draught of air i cannot set it down in words  what in the name of all the saints make you here in this guise he asked in french but with a rude border accent  i am a kindly scot i said in our own tongue of your own country give me water  and then a dwawm as we call it or faintingfit came over me  when i knew myself again i was lying with my head in a maidens lap and well i could have believed that the fairies had carried me to their own land as has befallen many whereof some have returned to earth with the tale and some go yet in that unearthly company  gentle demoiselle are you the gracious queen of faerie i asked as one halfwakened not knowing what i said  indeed this lady was clad all in the fairy green and her eyes were as blue as the sky above her head and the long yellow locks on her shoulders were shining like the sun  father he is not dead she said laughing as sweet as all the singing birds in marchhe is not dead but sorely wandering in his mind when he takes elliot hume for the fairy queen  faith he might have made a worse guess cried the man  but now sir now that your bonds are cut i see nothing better for you than a well washed face for indeed you are by ordinary kenspeckle and no company for maids  with that he brought some water from the burn by the road and therewith he wiped my face first giving me to drink  when i had drunk the maid whom he called elliot got up her face very rosy and they set my back against a tree which i was right sorry for as indeed i was now clean out of fairyland and back in this troublesome world  the horses stood by us tethered to trees and browsed on the budding branches  and now maybe he said speaking in the kindly scots that was like music in my earnow maybe you will tell us who you are and how you came into this jeopardy  i told him shortly that i was a scot of fife whereto he answered that my speech was strangely english  on this matter i satisfied him with the truth namely that my mother was of england  i gave my name but not that of our lands and showed him how i had been wandering north to take service with the dauphin when i was set upon and robbed and bound by thieves for i had no clearness as to telling him all my tale and no desire to claim acquaintance with brother thomas  and the jackanapes he asked whereto i had no better answer than that i had seen the beast with a wandering violer on the day before and that she having lost it as i supposed it had come to me in the night  the girl was standing with the creature in her arms feeding it with pieces of comfits from a pouch fastened at her girdle  the little beast is not mine to give i went on seeing how she had an affection to the ape but till the owner claims it it is all the ransom i have to pay for my life and i would fain see it wear the colours of this gentle maid who saved me  it has many pretty tricks but though to day i be a beggar i trow she will not let it practise that ill trick of begging  sooner would i beg myself fair sir she said with such a courtly reverence as surprised me for though they seemed folks well to see in the world they were not methought of noble blood nor had they with them any company of palfreniers or archers  elliot you feed the jackanapes and let our countryman hunger said the man and blushing again she made haste to give me some of the provision she had made for her journey  so i ate and drank she waiting on me very gently but now being weary of painful writing and hearing the call to the refectory and the brethren trampling thither i must break off for if i be late they will sconce me of my ale  alas it is to these little cares of creature comforts that i am come who have seen the face of so many a war and lived and fought on rats flesh at compiegne     chapter ivin what company norman leslie entered chinon and how he demeaned himself to take service   not seemly was it that i should expect these kind people even though they were of my own country to do more for me than they had already done  so when i had eaten and drunk i made my obeisance as if i would be trudging towards chinon adding many thanks as well i might  nay countryman said the man for all that i can see you may as well bide a while with us for indeed with leave of my graceless maid i think we may even end our wildgoose chase here and get us back to the town  seeing me marvel perhaps that any should have ridden some four miles or five and yet speak of returning he looked at the girl who was playing with the jackanapes and who smiled at him as he spoke  you must know said he that though i am the father of your fairy queen i am also one of the gracious princesss obedient subjects  no mother has she poor wench he added in a lower voice and faith we men must always obey some womanas it seems now that the king himself must soon do and all his captains  you speak i said of the gracious queen of sicily and jerusalema lady who was thought to be of much avail as was but right in the counsels of her soninlaw the dauphin he having married her gentle daughter  ay queen yolande is far ben 7 with the kingwould he had no worse counsellors said he smiling but i speak of a far more potent sovereign if all that she tells of herself be true  you have heard or belike you have not heard of the famed pucelleso she calls herself i hope not without a warrantythe lorrainer peasant lass who is to drive the english into the sea so she gives us all fair warning  never a word have i heard or never marked so senseless a bruit if i heard it she must be some moonstruck wench and in her wits wandering  moonstruck or sunstruck or saintstruck she will strike down our ancient enemy of england and show you men how it is not wine and wickedness that make good soldiers cried the girl whom he called elliot her face rosered with anger and from her eyes two blue rays of light shot straight to mine so that i believe my face waxed wan the blood flying to my heart  listen to her look at her said her father jestingly  elliot if your renowned maid can fright the english as you have affrayed a good scot the battle is won and orleans is delivered  but she had turned her back on us pettishly and was talking in a low voice to her jackanapes  as for me if my face had been pale before it now grew red enough for shame that i had angered her who was so fair though how i had sinned i knew not  but often i have seen that women and these the best will be all afire at a light word wherein the touchiest manatarms who ever fought on the turn of a straw could pick no honourable quarrel  how have i been so unhappy as to offend mademoiselle i asked in a whisper of her father giving her a high title in very confusion  oh she will hear no bourde nor jest on this pucelle that all the countryside is clashing of and that is bewitching my maid methinks even from afar  my maid elliot so i call her from my mothers kin but her true name is marion and the french dub her heliote hath set all her heart and her hope on one that is a young lass like herself and she is full of old soothsayings about a virgin that is to come out of an oak wood and deliver franceno less  for me i misdoubt that merlin the welsh prophet on whom they set store and the rest of the soothsayers are all in one tale with old thomas rhymer of ercildoune whose prophecies our own folk crack about by the ingle on winter nights at home  but be it as it may this wench of lorraine has these threequarters of a year been about the sieur robert de baudricourt now commanding for the king at vaucouleurs away in the east praying him to send her to the court  she has visions and hears voicesso she says and she gives baudricourt no peace till he carries her to the king  the story goes that on the ill day of the battle of the herrings she being at vaucouleursa hundred leagues away and moresaw that fight plainly and our countrymen fallen manlike around the constable and the french flying like hares before a little pack of english talbots  when the evil news came and was approved true baudricourt could hold her in no longer and now she is on the way with half a dozen esquires and archers of his command  the secondsight she may haveit is common enough if you believe the redshanked highlanders but if maiden she set forth from vaucouleurs great miracle it is if maiden she comes to chinon  he whispered this in a manner that we call pauky being a free man with his tongue  this is a strange tale enough i said the saints grant that the maid speaks truly  but yesterday came a letter of her sending to the king he went on but never of her writing for they say that she knows not a from b if she meets them in her voyaging  now nothing would serve my wilful daughter elliot she being possessed as i said with love for this female mystery but that we must ride forth and be the first to meet the maid on her way and offer her shelter at my poor house if she does but seem honest though methinks a hostelry is good enough for one that has ridden so far with men for all her company  and i being but a subject of my daughters as i said and this a saints day when a man may rest from his paints and brushes i even let saddle the steeds and came forth to see what ferlies heaven would send us  oh a lucky day for me fair sir i answered him marvelling to hear him speak of paint and brushes and even as i spoke a thought came into my mind  if you will listen to me sir i said and if the gentle maid your daughter will pardon me for staying you so long from the road i will tell you that to my thinking you have come over late for that yesterday the maiden you speak of rode after nightfall into chinon  now the girl turned round on me and in faith i asked no more than to see her face kind or angry  you tell us sir that you never heard speak of the maid till this hour and now you say that you know of her comings and goings  unriddle your riddle sir if it pleases you and say how you saw and knew one that you never heard speech of  she was still very wroth and i knew not whether i might not anger her yet more so i louted lowly cap in hand and said  it is but a guess that comes into my mind and i pray you be not angry with me who am ready and willing to believe in this maid or in any that will help france for if i be not wrong last night her coming saved my life and that of her own company  how may that be if thieves robbed and bound you  i told you not all my tale i said for indeed few would have believed the thing that had not seen it  but upon my faith as a gentleman and by the armbone of the holy apostle andrew which these sinful eyes have seen in the church of the apostle in his own town somewhat holy passed this way last night and if this maid be indeed sent from heaven that holy thing was she and none other  nom dieu saints are not common wayfarers on our roads at night  there is no wale of saints in this country said the father of elliot and as this pucelle of lorraine must needs pass by us here if she is still on the way even tell us all your tale  with that i told them how the brigands for so they now began to call such reivers as brother thomas were to my shame and maugre my head for a time of my own company  and i told them of the bushment that they laid to trap travellers and how i had striven to give a warning and how they bound me and gagged me and of the strange girls voice that spoke through the night of mes freres de paradis and of that golden boyn faring in the dark that i thought i saw and of the words spoken by the blind man and the soldier concerning some vision which affrayed them i know not what  at this tale the girl elliot crossing herself very devoutly cried aloud  o father did i not tell you so  this holy thing can have been no other but that blessed maiden guarded by the dear saints in form visible whom this gentleman for the sin of keeping evil company was not given the grace to see  oh come let us mount and ride to chinon for already she is within the walls had we not ridden forth so early we must have heard tell of it  it seemed something hard to me that i was to have no grace to behold what others and they assuredly much more sinful men than myself had been permitted to look upon if this damsel was right in that she said  and how could any man were he himself a saint see what was passing by when his head was turned the other way  howbeit she called me a gentleman as indeed i had professed myself to be and this i saw that her passion of anger against me was spent as then and gone by like a shower of april  gentleman you call yourself sir said her father may i ask of what house  we are cadets of the house of rothes i answered  my father leslie of pitcullo is the fourth son of the third son of the last laird of rothes but one and for me i was of late a clerk studying in st andrews  i will not ask why you left your lore he said i have been young myself and faith the story of one lad varies not much from the story of another  if we have any spirit it drives us out to fight the foreign loons in their own country if we have no feud at home  but you are a clerk i hear you say and have skill enough to read and write  yea and if need were can paint in my degree and do fair lettering on holy books for this art was my pleasure and i learned it from a worthy monk in the abbey  o day of miracles he cried  listen elliot and mark how finely i have fallen in lucks way  lo you sir i also am a gentleman in my degree simple as you see me being one of the humes of polwarth but by reason of my maimed leg that came to me with scars many from certain shrewd blows got at verneuil fight i am disabled from war  a murrain on the english bill that dealt the stroke  to make up my ransom for i was taken prisoner there where so few got quarter cost me every crown i could gather so i even fell back on the skill i learned like you when i was a lad from a priest in the abbey of melrose  ashamed of my craft i am none for it is better to paint banners and missals than to beg and now for these five years i am advanced to be court painter to the king himself thanks to john kirkmichael bishop of orleans who is of my far away kin  a sore fall it is for a hume of polwarth and strangely enough do the french scribes write my namehauves poulvoir and otherwise so please you but that is ever their wont with the best names in all broad scotland  lo you even now there is much ado with banner painting for the companies that march to help orleans ever and again  when the maiden marches father you shall have bannerpainting said the girl  ay lass when the maid marches and when the lift falls and smoors the laverocks we shall catch them in plenty 8 but maid or no maid saving your presence sir i need what we craftsmen i pray you again to pardon me call an apprentice and i offer you if you are skilled as you say this honourable post till you find a better  my face grew red again with anger at the word apprentice and i know not how i should have answered an offer so unworthy of my blood when the girl broke in  till this gentleman marches with the flower of france against our old enemy of england you should say father and helps to show them another bannockburn on loireside  ay well till then if it likes you he said smiling  till then there is bed and meat and the penny fee for him till that great day  that is coming soon she cried her eyes raised to heaven and so fair she looked that being a young man and of my complexion amorous i could not bear to be out of her company when i might be in it so stooped my pride to agree with him  sir i said i thank you heartily for your offer  you come of as good a house as mine and yours is the brag of the border as mine is of the kingdom of fife  if you can put your pride in your pouch faith so can i the rather that there is nothing else therein and so room enough and to spare  but as touching what this gentle demoiselle has said i may march also may i not when the maid rides to orleans  ay verify with my goodwill then you may he cried laughing while the lass frowned  then we clapped hands on it for a bargain and he did not insult me by the offer of any arles or luck penny  the girl was helped to horse setting her foot on my hand that dirled as her little shoe sole touched it and the jackanapes rode on her saddle bow very proudly  for me i ran as well as i might but stiffly enough being cold to the marrow holding by the fathers stirrupleather and watching the lasss yellow hair that danced on her shoulders as she rode foremost  in this company then so much better than that i had left we entered chinon town and came to their booth and their house on the waterside  then of their kindness i must to bed which comfort i sorely needed and there i slept in fragrant linen sheets till compline rang     chapter vof the fray on the drawbridge at chinon castle   during supper to which they called me my master showed me the best countenance that might be and it was great joy to me to eat off clean platters once again on white linen strewn with spring flowers  as the time was lent we had fare that they called meagre fish from the vienne water below the town and eggs cooked in divers fashions all to the point of excellence for the wine and fare of chinon are famous in france  as my duty was i waited on my master and on the maid elliot who was never silent but babbled of all that she had heard since she came into the town as to where the pucelle had lighted off her horse on the edgestone of a well so it seemed and where and with what goodwife she lodged and how as yet no message had come to her from the castle and the king and great joy it was to watch and to hear her  but her father mocked though in a loving manner and once she wept at his bourdes and shone out again when he fell on his knees offering her a knife and baring his breast to the stroke for i have never seen more love between father and child my own experience being contrary  yet to my sisters my father was ever debonnair for as i have often marked the mothers love the sons best and the sons the mothers and between father and daughters it is the same  but of my mother i have spoken in the beginning of this history  when supper was ended and all things made orderly i had no great mind for my bed having slept my fill for that time  but the maid elliot left us early which was as if the light had been taken out of the room  beside the fire my master fell to devising about the state of the country as burgesses love to do  and i said that if i were the dauphin chinon castle should not hold me long for my spur would be in my horses side and the bridle on his mane 9 as the old song of the battle of harlaw runs and i on the way to orleans  thereto he answered that he well wished it were so and mocking wished that i were the dauphin  not that our dauphin is a coward the blood of saint louis has not fallen so low but he is wholly under the sieur de la tremouille who was thrust on him while he was young and still is his master or as we say his governor  now this lord is one that would fain run with the hare and hunt with the hounds and this side of him is burgundian and that is armagnac and on which of the sides his heart is none knows  at azincour as i have heard he played the man reasonably well  but he waxes very fat for a manatarms and is fond of women and wine and of his ease  now if once the king ranges up with the bastard of orleans and xaintrailles and the other captains who hate la tremouille then his power and the power of the chancellor the archbishop of rheims is gone and ended  so these two work ever to patch up a peace with burgundy but seeing that the duke has his fathers death to avenge on our king they may patch and better patch but no peace will come of it and the captains cry forward and the archbishop and la tremouille cry back and in the meantime orleans will fall and the dauphin may fly whither he will for france is lost  but for myself i would to the saints that i and my lass were home again beneath the old thorntree at polwarth on the green where i have been merry lang syne  with that word he fell silent thinking i doubt not of his home as i did of mine and of the house of pitcullo and the ashtree at the door and the sea beyond the ploughed land of the plain  so after some space of silence he went to his bed and i to mine where for long i lay wakeful painting on the dark the face of elliot and her blue eyes and remembering her merry changeful ways  betimes in the morning i was awakened by the sound of her moving about through the house and having dressed and gone forth from my little chamber i found her in the houseplace she having come from early mass she took little heed of me giving me some bread and wine the same as she and her father took and she was altogether less gay and wilful than she had been and there seemed to be something that lay heavy on her mind  when her father asked her if the gossips at the church door had given her any more tidings of the maid she did but frown and soon left the chamber whence my master led me forth into his booth and bade me show him my hand in writing  this pleased him not ill and next i must grind colours to his liking and again he went about his business while i must mind the booth and be cap in hand to every saucy page that came from the castle with an order from his lord  full many a time my hand was on my whinger and yet more often i wished myself on the free road again so that i were out of ill company and assuredly the lorrainer maid whatever she might be was scarcely longing more than i for the day when she should unfurl her banner and march with me at her back to orleans  for so irksome was my servitude and the laying of colours on the ground of banners for my master to paint and the copying of books of hours and missals and the insolence of customers worse born than myself that i could have drowned myself in the vienne water but for the sight of elliot  yet she was become staid enough and betimes sad as it seemed that there was no good news of her dear maid for the king would not see her and all men it appeared save those who had ridden with her mocked the pucelle for a bold ramp with a bee in her bonnet  but the two gentlemen that had been her escort were staunch their names were jean de metz and bertrand de poulengy good esquires  of me elliot made ofttimes not much more account than of her jackanapes which was now in very high favour and waxing fat so that when none but her father could hear her she would jest and call him la tremouille  yet i as young men will was forward in all ways to serve her and to win her grace and favour  she was fain to hear of scotland her own country which she had never seen and i was as fain to tell her  and betimes i would say how fair were the maidens of our own country and how any man that saw her would know her to be a scot though from her tongue in french none might guess it  and knowing that she loved wildflowers i would search for them and bring them to her and would lead her to speak of romances which she loved no less than i and of pages who had loved queens and all such matters as young men and maids are wont to devise of and now she would listen and at other seasons would seem proud and as if her mind were otherwhere  young knights many came to our booth and looked illpleased when i served them and their eyes were ever on the inner door watching for elliot whom they seldom had sight of  so here was i in a double service who before i met brother thomas had been free of heart and hand  but if my masters service irked me in that other i found comfort when i could devise with elliot as concerning our country and her hopes for the maid  but my own hopes were not high nor could i mark any sign that she favoured me more than another though i had the joy to be often in her company  and indeed what hope could i have being so young and poor and in visible station no more than any prentice lad  my heart was much tormented in these fears and mainly because we heard no tidings that the maid was accepted by the dauphin and that the day of her marching and of my deliverance from my base craft of painting was at hand  it so fell out how i knew not whether i had shown me too presumptuous for an apprentice or because of any other reason that elliot had much forborne my company and was more often in church at her prayers than in the house or when in the house was busy in divers ways and i scarce ever could get word of her  finding her in this mood i also withdrew within myself and was both proud and sorely unhappy longing more than ever to take my own part in the world as a manatarms  now one day right early i being alone in the chamber copying a psalter elliot came in looking for her father  i rose at her coming doffing my cap and told her in few words that my master had gone forth  thereon she flitted about the chamber looking at this and that while i stood silent deeming that she used me in a sort scarce becoming my blood and lineage  suddenly she said without turning round for she was standing by a table gazing at the pictures in a book of hours  i have seen her  the pucelledo you speak of her gentle maid  i saw her and spoke to her and heard her voice and here her own broke and i guessed that she was near to weeping  i went up within the castle precinct to the tower coudraye she said for i knew that she lodged hard by with a good woman who dwells there  i passed into the chapel of st martin on the cliff and there heard the voice of one praying before the image of our lady  the voice was even as you said that daythe sweetest of voices  i knelt beside her and prayed aloud for her and for france  she rested her hand on my hairher hair is black and cut en ronde like a mans  it is true that they say she dresses in mans garb  we came forth together and i put my hand into hers and said i believe in you if none other believes yet do i believe  then she wept and she kissed me she is to visit me here to morrow la fille de dieu  she drew a long sob and struck her hand hard on the table then keeping her back ever towards me she fled swiftly from the room  i was amazedso light of heart as she commonly seemed and of late disdainfulto find her in this passion  yet it was to me that she had spokento me that she had opened her heart  now i guessed that if i was ever to win her it must be through this pucelle on whom her mind was so strangely bent  so i prayed that if it might be gods will he would prosper the maid and let me be her loyal servitor and at last bring me to my desire  something also i dreamed as young men will who have read many romances of myself made a knight for great feats of arms and wearing in my salade my ladys favour and breaking a spear on talbot or fastolf or glasdale in some last great victory for france  then shone on my eyesight as it were the picture of these two children for they were little more elliot and the maid kneeling together in the chapel of st martin the gold hair and the black blended and what were they two alone against this world and the prince of this world  alas how much and again how little doth prayer avail us  these thoughts were in my mind all day while serving and answering customers and carrying my masters wares about the town and up to the castle on the cliff where the soldiers and sentries now knew me well enough and the scots archers treated me kindly  but as for elliot she was like her first self again and merrier than common with her father to whom as far as my knowledge went she said not a word about the meeting in the crypt of st martins chapel though to me she had spoken so freely  this gave me some hope but when i would have tried to ask her a question she only gazed at me in a manner that abashed me and turned off to toy with her jackanapes  whereby i went to my bed perplexed and with a heavy heart as one that was not yet conversant with the ways of womennay nor ever in my secular life have i understood what they would be at happier had it been for my temporal life if i had been wiser in womans ways  but commonly when we have learned a lesson the lore comes too late  next day my master had business at the castle with a certain lord and took me thither to help in carrying his wares  this castle was a place that i loved well it is so old having first been builded when the romans were lords of the land and is so great and strong that our bishops castle of st andrews seems but a cottage compared to it  from the hilltop there is a wide prospect over the tower and the valley of the vienne which i liked to gaze upon  my master then went in by the drawbridge high above the moat which is so deep that i trow no foeman could fill it up and cross it to assail the walls  my master in limping up the hill had wearied himself but soon passed into the castle through the gateway of the belltower as they call it while i waited for him on the further end of the bridge idly dropping morsels of bread to the swans that swam in the moat below  on the drawbridge standing sentinel was a french manatarms a young man of my own age armed with a long fauchard which we call a bill or halberd a weapon not unlike the lochaber axes of the highlandmen  other soldiers french scottish spaniards germans a mixed company were idling and dicing just within the gate  i was throwing my last piece of crust to a swan my mind empty of thought when i started out of my dream hearing that rare womans voice which once i had heard before  then turning quickly i saw walking between two gentlemen even those who had ridden with her from vaucouleurs one whom no man could deem to be other than that muchtalked of maid of lorraine  she was clad very simply like the varlet of some lord of no great estate in a black cap with a little silver brooch a grey doublet and black and grey hose trussed up with many points a sword of small price hung by her side 10 in stature she was something above the common height of women her face brown with sun and wind her eyes great grey and beautiful beneath black brows her lips red and smiling  in figure she seemed strong and shapely but so slimshe being but seventeen years of agethat were it not for her sweet girls voice and for the beauty of her grey eyes she might well have passed for a page her black hair being cut en ronde as was and is the fashion among menatarms  thus much have i written concerning her bodily aspect because many have asked me what manner of woman was the blessed maid and whether she was beautiful  i gazed at her like one moonstruck then remembering my courtesy i doffed my cap and louted low and she bowed smiling graciously like a great lady but with such an air as if her mind was far away  she passed with her two gentlemen but the french sentinel barred the way holding his fauchard thwartwise  on what business come you and by what right he cried in a rude voice  by the dauphins gracious command to see the dauphin said one of the gentlemen right courteously  here is his own letter and you may know the seal bidding la pucelle to come before him at this hour  the fellow looked at the seal and could not but acknowledge the arms of france thereon  he dropped his fauchard over his shoulder and stood aside staring impudently at the maiden and muttering foul words  so this is the renowned pucelle he cried by gods name    and here he spoke words such as i may not set down in writing blaspheming god and the maid  she turned and looked at him but as if she saw him not and then a light of joy and love transfiguring her face she knelt down on the drawbridge folding her hands her face bowed and so abode while one might count twenty we that beheld her being amazed  then she rose and bent as if in salutation to one we saw not next addressing herself to the sentinel she said very gently  sir how canst thou take in vain the name of god thou that art in this very hour to die  so speaking she with her gentlemen went within the gate while the soldier stood gazing after her like a man turned to stone  the maid passed from our sight and then the sentinel coming to himself turned in great wrath on me who stood hard by  what make you gaping here you lousy winesack of scotland he cried and at the word my prayer which i had made to st andrew in my bonds came into my mind namely that i should not endure to hear my country defamed  i stopped not to think of words wherein i never had a ready wit but his were still in his mouth when i had leaped within his guard so that he might not swing out his long halberd  blasphemer and liar i cried gripping his neck with my left hand while with two upcuts of my right i sent his lies down his throat in company as i deem with certain of his teeth  he dropped his halberd against the wooden fence of the bridge and felt for his dagger  i caught at his right hand with mine cries were in my earsst denis for france  st andrew for scotlandas the other men on guard came running forth to see the sport  we gripped and swayed for a moment then the staff of his fauchard coming between his legs he tripped and fell i above him our weight soused against the low pales of the bridge side that were crazy and old there was a crash and i felt myself in midair failing to the moat far below us  down and down i whirled and then the deep water closed over me     chapter vihow norman leslie escaped out of chinon castle   down and down i sank the water surging up into my nostrils and sounding in my ears but being in water i was safe if it were but deep enough presently i struck out and with a stroke or two came to the surface but no sooner did my head show above and i draw a deep breath or twain looking for my enemy than an arbalest bolt cleft the water with a clipping sound missing me but narrowly  i had but time to see that there was a tumult on the bridge and swords out the scots as i afterwards heard knocking up the arbalests that the french soldiers levelled at me  then i dived again and swam under water making towards the right and the castle rock which ran sheer down to the moat this course i chose because i had often noted from the drawbridge a jutting buttress of rock behind which at least i should be out of arrowshot  my craft was to give myself all the semblance of a drowning man throwing up my arms when i rose to see whereabout i was and to take breath as men toss their limbs who cannot swim  on the second time of rising thus i saw myself close to the jut of rock  my next dive took me behind it and i let down my feet close under the side of this natural buttress to look around being myself now concealed from the sight of those who were on the bridge  to my surprise i touched bottom for i had deemed that the water was very deep thereby  next i found that i was standing on a step of hewn stone and that a concealed staircase cut in the rock goes down in that place to the very bottom of the moat for what purpose i know not but so it is 11  i climbed up the steps shook myself and wrung the water out of my hair looking about the while for any sign of my enemy who had blasphemed against my country and the maiden  but there was nothing to see on the water save my own cloth cap floating  on the other side of the fosse howbeit men were launching a pleasureboat which lay by a stair at the foot of the further wall of the fosse  the sight of them made me glad to creep further up the steps that rounded a sharp corner till i came as far as an iron wicketgate which seemed to cut off my retreat  there i stopped deeming that the wicket must be locked  the men were now rowing the boat into the middle of the water so without expecting to find the gate open i tried the handle  it turned to my no little amazement the gate swang lightly aside as if its hinges had been newly oiled and i followed the staircase creeping up the slimy steps in the halfdark  up and round i went till i was wellnigh giddy and then i tripped and reeled so that my body struck against a heavy ironed door under my weight it yielded gently and i stumbled across the threshold of a room that smelled strangely sweet and was very warm being full of the sun and the heat of a great fire  is that you robin of my heart said a girls voice in french and before i could move a pair of arms were round my neck  back she leaped finding me all wet and not the man she looked for and there we both stood in a surprise that prevented either of us from speaking  she was a pretty lass with brown hair and bright red cheeks and was dressed all in white being indeed one of the laundresses of the castle and this warm room fragrant with lavender whereinto i had stumbled was part of the castle laundry  a mighty fire was burning and all the tables were covered with piles and flat baskets of white linen sweet with scented herbs  back the maid stepped towards the door keeping her eyes on mine and as she did not scream i deemed that none were within hearing wherein i was wrong and she had another reason for holding her peace  save me gentle maid if you may i cried at last falling on my knees just where i stood i am a luckless man and stand in much peril of my life  in sooth you do she said if robert lindsay of the scottish archers finds you here  he loves not that another should take his place at a tryst  maiden i said beginning to understand why the gate was unlocked and wherefore it went so smooth on its hinges i fear i have slain a man one of the kings archers  we wrestled together on the drawbridge and the palisade breaking we fell into the moat whence i clomb by the hidden stairs  one of the archers cried she as pale as a lily and catching at her side with her hand  was he a scot  no maid but i am and i pray you hide me or show me how to escape from this castle with my life and that speedily  come hither she said drawing me through a door into a small square empty room that jutted out above the moat  the other maids are at their dinner she went on and i all alonethe season being lent and i under penance and thinking of no danger  for which reason i doubt not namely that the others had gone forth she had made her tryst at this hour with robin lindsay  but he if he was as she said one of the scottish archers that guarded the gate was busy enough belike with the tumult on the bridge or in seeking for the body of mine enemy  how to get you forth i know not she said seeing that from yonder room you pass into the kitchen and thence into the guardroom and thence again by a passage in the wall behind the great hall and so forth to the court and through the gate and thereby there is no escape for see you the soldiers must and will avenge their comrade  hearing this speech i seemed to behold myself swinging by a tow from a tree branch a death not beseeming one of gentle blood  up and down i looked in vain and then i turned to the window thinking that as better was not to be i might dive thence into the moat and take my chance of escape by the stairs on the further side  but the window was heavily barred  yet again if i went forth by the door and lurked on the postern stair there was robin lindsays dirk to reckon with when he came a laggard to his lovetryst  stop  i have it said the girl and flying into the laundry she returned with a great bundle of white womens gear and a gown of linen and a womans white coif such as she herself wore  in less time than a man would deem possible she had my wet hair that i wore about my shoulders as our students manner was tucked up under the cap and the clean white smock over my wet clothes and belted neatly about my middle  a pretty wench you make i swear by st valentine cried she falling back to look at me and then coming forward to pin up something about my coif with her white fingers  i reckoned it no harm to offer her a sisterly kiss  tis lucky robin lindsay is late cried she laughing though even were he here he could scarce find fault that one maid should kiss another  now she said snatching up a flat crate full of linen carry these the kings shirts and sorely patched they are on your head march straight through the kitchen then through the guardroom and then by the door on the left into the long passage and so into the court and begone they will but take you for a newly come blanchisseuse  only speak as little as may be for your speech may betray you  she kissed me very kindly on both cheeks for she was as frank a lass as ever i met and a merry  then leading me to the door of the inner room she pushed it open the savoury reek of the kitchen pouring in  make good speed margot she cried aloud after me so that all could hear and i walked straight up the kings kitchen full as it was of men and boys breaking salads spitting fowls basting meat though it was lent but doubtless the king had a dispensation for his healths sake watching pots tasting dishes and all in a great bustle and clamour  the basket of linen shading my face i felt the more emboldened though my legs verily trembled under me as i walked  through the room i went none regarding me and so into the guardroom but truly this was another matter  some soldiers were dicing at a table some drinking some brawling over the matter of the late tumult but all stopped and looked at me  a new face and by st andrew a fair one said a voice in the accent of my own country  but she has mighty big feet belike she is a countrywoman of thine quoth a french archer and my heart sank within me as the other cast a tankard at his head  come my lass cried another a scot with a dicebox in his hand catching at my robe as i passed kiss me and give me luck and striking up my basket of linen so that the wares were all scattered on the floor he drew me on to his knee and gave me a smack that reeked sorely of garlic  never came man nearer getting a sore buffet yet i held my hand  then making his cast with the dice he swore roundly when he saw that he had thrown deuces  lucky in love unlucky in gaming  lug out your losings said his adversary with a laugh and the man left hold of my waist and began fumbling in his pouch  straightway being free i cast myself on the floor to pick up the linen and hide my face which so burned that it must have seemed as red as the most modest maid might have deemed seemly  leave the wench alone she is new come i warrant and has no liking for your wantonness said a kind voice and glancing up i saw that he who spoke was one of the gentlemen who had ridden with the maiden from vaucouleurs  bertrand de poulengy was his name belike he was waiting while the king and the nobles devised with the maiden privately in the great hall  he stooped and helped me to pick up my linen as courteously as if i had been a princess of the blood and because he was a gentleman i suppose and a stranger the archers did not meddle with him save to break certain soldiers jests making me glad that i was other than i appeared  come he said my lass i will be your escort it seems that fortune has chosen me for a champion of dames  with these words he led the way forth and through a long passage lit from above which came out into the court at the stairs of the great hall  down these stairs the maiden herself was going her face held high and a glad look in her eyes her conference with the king being ended  poulengy joined her they said some words which i did not hear for i deemed that it became me to walk forward after thanking him by a look and bending my head for i dared not trust my foreign tongue  before i reached the gateway they had joined me which i was glad of fearing more insolence from the soldiers  but these men held their peace looking grave and even affrighted being of them who had heard the prophecy of the maiden and seen its fulfilment  have ye found the body of that man said poulengy to a sergeantatarms  nay sir we deem that his armour weighed him down for he never rose once though that scots head was seen thrice and no more  belike they are good peaceful friends at the bottom of the fosse together  of what man speak you asked the maiden of poulengy  of him that blasphemed as we went by an hour ago  wrestling with a scot on some quarrel they broke the palisade andlo there are joiners already mending it  tis old and frail  the gentle dauphin is over poor to keep the furnishings of his castle as a king should do  the maiden grew wan as sundried grass in summer when she heard this story told  crossing herself she said  alas  i warned him but he died unconfessed  i will do what i may to have masses said for the repose of his soul poor man and he so young  with that she wept for she wept readily even for a less thing than such a death as was that archers  we had now crossed the drawbridge whereat my heart beat more lightly and the maiden told poulengy that she would go to the house where she lodged near the castle  and thence she said i must fare into the town for i have promised to visit a damsel of my friends one heliote poulvoir if i may find my way thither  know you gentle damsel she said to me where she abides  or perchance you can lead me thither if it lies on your way  i was even going thither pucelle i said mincing in my speech whereat she laughed for of her nature she was merry  scots are heliote and her father and a scot are not you also damsel your speech betrays you she said you all cling close together you scots as beseems you well being strangers in this sweet land of france and her face lighted up as she spoke the name she loved and my heart worshipped her with reverence  farewell she cried to poulengy smiling graciously and bowing with such a courtesy as a queen might show for i noted it myself as did all men that this peasant girl had the manners of the court being schooled as i deem by the greatest of ladies her friends st margaret and st catherine  then with an archer who had ridden beside her from vaucouleurs following after her as he ever did the maiden and i began to go down the steep way that led to the town  little she spoke and all my thought was to enter the house before elliot could spy me in my strange disguise     chapter viiconcerning the wrath of elliot and the jeopardy of norman leslie   the while we went down into the city of chinon a man attired as a maid a maiden clad as a manstrange companionswe held but little converse her mind belike was on fire with a great light of hope of which afterwards i learned and the end of the days of trouble and of mens disbelief seemed to her to be drawing near  we may not know what visions of victory and of auxiliary angels of her king crowned and fair france redeemed and at peace were passing through her fancy  therefore she was not fain to talk being at all times a woman of few words and in this as in so many other matters unlike most of her sex  on my side i had more than enough to think of for my case and present jeopardy were enough to amaze older and wiser heads than mine  for imprimis i had slain one of the kings guards and moreover had struck the first blow though my adversary indeed had given me uttermost provocation  but even if my enemies allowed me to speak in my own defence which might scarcely be save by miracle it was scantly possible for me to prove that the other had insulted me and my country  some little hope i had that sir patrick ogilvie now constable of the scottish menatarms in france or sir hugh kennedy or some other of our knights might take up my quarrel for the sake of our common blood and country we scots always backing each the other when abroad  yet on the other hand it was more probable that i might be swinging with a flock of crows pecking at my face before any of my countrymen could speak a word for me with the king  it is true that they who would most eagerly have sought my life deemed me already dead drowned in the fosse and so would make no search for me yet as soon as i went about my masters affairs as needs i must i would be known and taken and as we say in our country proverb my craig would ken the weight of my hurdies 12 none the less seeing that the soldiers deemed me dead i might readily escape at once from chinon and take to the roads again if but i could reach my masters house unseen and get rid of this foolish feminine gear of cap and petticoat which now i wore to my great shame and discomfort  but on this hand lay little hope for once on the road i should be in a worse jeopardy than ever before as an apprentice fled from my master and moreover with blood on my hands  moreover i could ill brook the thought of leaving elliot to whom my heart went forth in love and of missing my chance to strike a blow in the wars for the maiden and against the english of which reward i had the promise from my master fortune and fame and love if i were to gain what every young man most desires were only to be won by remaining at chinon but there too the face of death was close to mineas indeed death or at least shame and poverty lay ambushed for me on all sides  here i sadly remembered how with a light heart i had left st andrews deeming that the story of my life was now about to begin as it did for many young esquires of greece and other lands concerning whom i had read in romances  verily in the tale of my adventures hitherto there had been more cuffs than crowns more shame than honour and as to winning my spurs i was more in point to win a hempen rope and in my end disgrace my blood  now as if these perils were not enough to put a man beside himself there was another risk which even more than these took up my thoughts among all my dangers and manifold distresses this raised its head highest in my fancy namely the fear that my love should see me in my outlandish guise clad in womans weeds and carrying on my head a womans burden  it was not so much that she must needs laugh and hold me in little account  elliot laughed often so that now it was not her mirth to which she was ever ready but her wrath whereto she was ready also that i held in awful regard  for her heart and faith in a marvellous manner passing the love of women were wholly set on this maid in whose company i now fared  and if the maid went in mens attire as needs she must for modestys sake who was about mens business in mens company here was i attending her in womans gear as if to make a mock of her though in my mind i deemed her no less than a sister of the saints  and elliot was sure to believe that i carried myself thus in mockery and to make laughter for at that time there were many in france who mocked as did that soldier whose death i had seen and caused  thus i stood in no more danger of death great as was that risk than in jeopardy of my mistresss favour which indeed of late i had been in some scant hope at last to win  thus on all hands i seemed to myself as sore bestead as ever man was and on no side saw any hope of succour  i mused so long and deep on these things that the thought which might have helped me came to me too late namely to tell all my tale to the maiden herself and throw me on her mercy  nay even when at last and late this light shone on my mind i had shame to speak to her considering the marvellous thing which i had just beheld of her in the fulfilment of her prophecy  but now my masters house was in sight at the turning from the steep stairs and the wynd and there stood elliot on the doorstep watching and waiting for the maid as a girl may wait for her lover coming from the wars  there was no time given me to slink back and skulk in the shadow of the corner of the wynd for like a greyhound in speed elliot had flown to us and was kneeling to the maid who with a deep blush and some anger in her facefor she loved no such obeisancesbade her rise and so kissed and embraced her as young girls use among themselves when they are friends and fain of each other  i had turned myself to go apart into the shadow of the corner as secretly as i might when i ran straight into the arms of the archer that followed close behind us  on this encounter he gave a great laugh and i believe would have kissed me but the maiden looking round he stood erect and grave as a soldier on guard for the maiden would suffer no light loves and daffing  whither make you damsel in such haste she cried to me  come let me present you to this damsel my friendand one of your own country women  elliot ma mie she said to my mistress here is this kind lass a scot like yourself who has guided me all the way from the castle hither and faith the way is hard to find  do you thank her for me and let her sit down in your house she must be weary with the weight of her basket and her linenfor these when she spoke to me i had laid on the ground  with this she led me up to elliot by the hand who began to show me very gracious countenance and to thank me my face burning all the while with confusion and fear of her anger  suddenly a new look such as i had never seen before on her face in her light angers came into her eyes which grew hard and cold her mouth also showing stiff and so she stood pale gazing sternly and as one unable to speak  then  go out of my sight she said very low and from my fathers house forth with you for a mocker and a gangrel loonspeaking in our common scotsand herd with the base thieves from whom you came coward and mocking malapert  the storm had fallen on my head even as i feared it must and i stood as one bereft of speech and reason  the maid knew no word of our speech and this passion of elliots and so sudden a change from kindness to wrath were what she might not understand  elliot ma mie she said very sweetly what mean you by this anger the damsel has treated me with no little favour  tell me i pray in what she has offended  but elliot not looking at her said to me again and this time tears leaped up in her eyesforth with you begone ere i call that archer to drag you before the judges of the good town  i was now desperate for clad as i was the archer had me at an avail and if i were taken before the men of the law all would be known and my shrift would be short  gracious pucelle i said in french turning to the maiden my life and the fortune of one who would gladly fight to the death by your side are in your hands  for the love of the blessed saints your sisters and of him who sends you on your holy mission pray this demoiselle to let me enter the house with you and tell my tale to you and her  if i satisfy you not of my honour and good intent i am ready in this hour to go before the men of law and deliver myself up to their justice  for though my life is in jeopardy i dread death less than the anger of this honourable demoiselle  and verily this is a matter of instant life or death  so saying i clasped my hands in the manner of one in prayer setting all my soul into my speech as a man desperate  the maiden had listened very gravely and sweetly she smiled when my prayer was ended  verily she said to me here is deeper water than i can fathom elliot ma mie you hear how gently and in what distress this fair lass beseeches us  fair lass cried elliot and then broke off between a sob and a laugh her hand catching at her side  if you love me said the maid looking on her astonished and not without angerif you love me as you have said you that are the first of my comforters and till this day my only friend in your strange town let the lass come in and tell us her tale  for even if she be distraught and beside herself as i well deem i am sent to be a friend of all them that suffer  moreover ma mie i have glad tidings for you which i am longing to speak but speak it i will never while the lass goes thus in terror and fear of death or shame  in saying these last words the fashion of her countenance was changed to a sweet entreaty and command such as few could have beheld and denied her what she craved and she laid her hand lightly on elliots shoulder  come said elliot be it as you will come in with me and youturning to myselfdo you follow us  they passed into the house i coming after and the archer waiting at the door  let none enter said the maiden to her archer unless any come to me from the king or unless it be the master of the house  we passed into the chamber where my master was wont to paint his missals and psalters when he would be alone  then elliot very graciously bade the maiden be seated but herself stood up facing me  gracious maiden and messenger of the holy saints she said this lass as you deem her is no woman but a man my fathers apprentice who has clad himself thus to make of you a mockery and a laughingstock because that you being a maid go attired as a man by the will of them who sent you to save france  have i said enough and do i well to be angry and her eyes shone as she spoke  the maidens brows met in wrath she gazed upon me steadfastly and i lookedsinful man that i amto see her hand go to the hilt of the sword that she wore  but making no motion she only said  and thou wherefore hast thou mocked at one who did thee no evil and at this damsel thy masters daughter  gentle maiden i said listen to me for but a little moment  it may be when thou hast heard all that thou wilt still be wroth with me though not for mockery which was never in my mind  but the gentle damsel thy friend will assuredly pardon me who have already put my life in peril for thy sake and for the sake of our dear country of scotland and her good name  thy life in peril for me  how mean you  i stood in no danger and i never saw your face before  yet hast thou saved my life i said but of that we may devise hereafter  i am indeed though a gentleman by blood and birth the apprentice of the father of this damsel thy friend who is himself a gentleman and of a good house but poverty drives men to strange shifts this day i went with my master to the castle and i was on the drawbridge when thou with the gentlemen thy esquires passed over it to see the king  on that bridge a manatarms spoke to thee shameful words blaspheming the holy name of god  no sooner hadst thou gone by than he turned on me reviling my native country of scotland  then i not deeming that to endure such taunts became my birth and breeding struck him on his lying mouth  then as we wrestled on the bridge we both struck against the barrier which was low frail and old so that it gave way under our weight and we both fell into the moat  when i rose he was not in sight otherwise i would have saved him by swimming for i desire to have the life of no man on my hands in private quarrel  but the archers shot at me from the drawbridge so that i had to take thought for myself  by swimming under the water i escaped behind a jutting rock to a secret stair whence i pushed my way into a chamber of the castle  therein was a damsel busy with the linen who of her goodwill clad me in this wretched apparel above my own garb and so for that time saved my life and i passed forth unknown but yet hath caused me to lose what i prize more highly than lifethat is the gracious countenance of this gentle lady thy friend and my masters daughter whom it is my honour and duty in all things to please and serve  tell me then do i merit your wrath as a jester and a mockmaker or does this gentle lady well to be angry with her servitor  the maiden crossed herself and murmured a prayer for the soul of him who had died in the moat  but elliot instantly flew to me and dragging off my womans cap tore with her fair hands at the white linen smock about my neck and waist so that it was rent asunder and fell on the floor leaving me clad in my wet doublet and hose  at this sight without word spoken she broke out into the merriest laughter that ever i heard and the most welcome and the maid too catching the malady of her mirth laughed low and graciously so that to see and hear her was marvel  begone cried elliotbegone and shift thy dripping gear and as i fled swiftly to my chamber i heard her laughter yet though there came a sob into it but for the maid she had already stinted in her mirth ere i left the room  in this strange and unseemly fashion did i first come into the knowledge of this admirable maidwhom alas i was to see more often sad than merry and weeping rather than laughing though even in her utmost need her heart could be light and her mirth free a manner that is uncommon even among brave men but in women never known by me save in her  for it is the way of women to be very busy and seriously concerned about the smallest things whereat a man only smiles  but she with her life at stake could pluck gaiety forth of danger if the peril threatened none but herself  these manners of hers i learned to know and marvel at in the later days that came too soon but now in my chamber i shifted my wet raiment for dry with a heart wondrous light  my craig 13 was in peril as we say neither less nor more than half an hour agone but i had escaped the anger of elliot and even as i deemed had won more of her good countenance seeing that i had struck a blow for scotland and for her friend  this thought made me great cheer in my heart as i heard from the room below the voices of the two girls devising together very seriously for nigh the space of an hour  but knowing that they might have matters secret between themselves to tell of for the maiden had said that she brought good tidings i kept coy and to myself in my little upper chamber  to leave the house indeed was more than my life was worth  now to fly and hide was what i could not bring myself to venture here i would stay where my heart was and take what fortune the saints might send  so i endured to wait and not gladden myself with the sight of elliot and the knowledge of how i now stood with her  to me this was great penance but at last the voices ceased and looking secretly from the window i saw the maiden depart her archer following her  now i could no longer bridle in my desire to be with elliot and learn whether i was indeed forgiven and how i stood in her favour  so passing down the stair that led from my cubicle i stood at the door of the room wherein she was and knocked twice  but none answered and venturing to enter i heard the sound of a stifled sob  she had thrown herself on a settle her face turned to the wall and the afternoon sun was shining on her yellow hair which lay loose upon her shoulders  i dared to say no word and she only made a motion of her hand towards me that i should begone without showing me the light of her countenance  on this i went forth stealthily my heart again very heavy for the maiden had spoken of learning good tidings and wherefore should my mistress weep who an hour agone had been so merry  difficult are the ways of women a language hard to be understood wherefore love as the roman says is full of anxious fears  much misdoubting how i fared in elliots heart and devising within myself what this new sorrow of elliots might signify i half forgot my own danger yet not so much as to fare forth of the doors or even into the booth where customers might come and i be known  therefore i passed into a room behind the booth where my master was wont to instruct me in my painting and there since better might not be i set about grinding and mixing such colours as i knew that he required  i had not been long about this task when i heard him enter the booth from without whence he walked straight into my workroom  i looked up from my colours whereat his face which was ruddy grew wan he staggered back and being lame reeled against the wall  there he brought up crossing himself and making the sign of the cross at me  avaunt he said in the name of this holy sign whether thou art a wandering spirit or a devil in a dead mans semblance  master i said i am neither spirit nor devil  was it ever yet heard that brownie or bogle mixed colours for a painter  nay touch me and see whether i am not of sinful scots flesh and blood and thereon i laughed aloud knowing what caused his fear and merry at the sight of it for he had ever held tales of diablerie and of wraiths and freits and fetches in high scorn  he sat him down on a chair and gaped upon me while i could not contain myself from laughing  for gods sake said he bring me a cup of red wine for my wits are wandering  deils buckie he said in the scots will water not drown you  faith then it is to hemp that you were born as shall shortly be seen  i drew him some wine from a cask that stood in the corner on draught  he drank it at one venture and held out the cup for more the colour coming back into his face  did the archers tell me false then when they said that you had fired up at a chance word and flung yourself and the sentinel into the moat and where have you been wasting your time and why went you from the bridge ere i came back if the archers took another prentice lad for norman leslie  they told you truth i said  then in the name of antichristthat i should say sohow scaped you drowning and how came you here  i told him the story as briefly as might be  ill luck go with yon secondsighted wench that has bewitched elliot and you too for all that i can see  never did i think to be frayed with a bogle 14 and as might have been deemed the bogle but a prentice loon when all was done  to my thinking all this fairy work is no more true than that you are a dead mans wraith  but they are all wild about it at the castle where i was kept long doing no trade and listening to their mad clatter  he took out of his pouch a parcel heedfully wrapped in soft folds of silk  here is this book of hours he said that i have spent my eyesight and gold purple and carmine and cobalt upon these three years past a jewel it is though i say so  and i had good hope to sell it to hugh kennedy for he has of late had luck in taking two english knights prisoners at orleansthe only profitable trade that men now can driveand the good knight dearly loves a painted book of devotion especially if like this of mine it be adorned with the loves of jupiter and the swan and danae and other heathen pliskies  we were chaffering over the price and getting near a bargain when in comes patrick ogilvie with a tale of this secondsighted maid and how she had been called to see the king and of what befell  first it seems she boded the death of that luckless limb of a sentinel and then you took it upon you to fulfil her saying and so you and he were drowned and i left prenticeless  little comfort to me it was to hear kennedy and ogilvie praise you for a good scot and true and say that it was great pity of your death  at this hearing my heart leaped for joy first at my own praise from such good knights and next because i saw a blink of hope having friends at court  my master went on  next ogilvie told how he had been in hall with the dauphin the chancellor tremouille and some scores of knights and nobles a great throng  they were all waiting on this lorrainer wench for the dauphin had been told at last that she brought a letter from baudricourt but before he would not see her  this letter had been kept from him i guess by whom and there was other clash of marvels wrought by her i know not what  so their wisdom was set on putting her to a kind of trial foolish enough  a young knight was dressed in jewels and a coronet of the kings and the king was clad right soberly and held himself far back in the throng while the other stood in front looking big  so the wench comes in and walking straight through the press of knights with her head high kneels to the king where he stood retired and calls him gentle dauphin  nay ma mie says he tis not i who am the dauphin but his highness yonderpointing to the young knight who showed all his plumage like a muircock in spring  nay gentle dauphin she answers so ogilvie said it is to thee that i am sent and no other and i am come to save the good town of orleans and to lead thee to thy sacring at rheims  here they were all struck amazed and the king not least who then had some words apart with the girl  and he has given her rooms in the tour coudraye within the castle and the clergy and the doctors are to examine her straitly whether she be from a good airt 15 or an ill and all because she knew the king she who had never seen him before  why should she never have seen himwho warrants me of itshe dwelling these last days nigh the castle  freits are folly to my thinking and fools they that follow them  lad you gave me a gliff pass me another stoup of wine  freits forsooth  i served him and he sat and chuckled in his chair being pleasured by the thought of his own wisdom  not a word of this to elliot though he said suddenly when there is a woman in a houseblessings on herit is anything for a quiet life  but nom dieu what with the fright you gave me sitting there whereas i deemed you were meat for eels and carp and what with thy taleha haand my tale and the wine maybe i forgot your own peril my lad  faith your neck is like to be longer if we be not better advised  hearing him talk of that marvellous thing wrought through inspiration by the maidwhereat as his manner was he mocked i had clean forgotten my own jeopardy  now this was instant for who knew how much the archer might have guessed that followed with the maid and me and menatarms might anon be at our door  it may be said i that sir patrick ogilvie and sir hugh kennedy would say a word for me in the kings ear  faith that is our one chance and luckily for you the lad you drowned though in the kings service came hither in the following of a poor knight who might take bloodransom for his man  had he been la tremouilles man you must assuredly have fled the country  he took up his book of hours with a sigh and wrapped it again in its silken parcel  this must be your price with kennedy he said if better may not be it is like parting with the apple of my eye but i know not well how i love you my lad and blood is thicker than water  give me my staff i must hirple up that weary hill again and you come hither  he led me to his own chamber where i had never been before and showed me how in the chimneyneuk was a way into a certain black hole of little ease wherein if any came in search for me i might lie hidden and fetching me a cold fish lenten cheer a loaf and a stoup of wine whereof i was glad enough he left me groaning the while at his illfortune but laden with such thanks as i might give for all his great kindness  there then i sat when i had eaten my ears pricked to listen for the tramp of armed men below and the thunder of their summons at the door but they came not and presently my thought stole back to elliot who indeed was never out of my mind thennay nor now is  but whether that memory be sinful in a man of religion or not i leave to the saints and to good confession  much i perplexed myself with marvelling why she did so weep above all since i knew what hopeful tidings she had gotten of her friend and her enterprise  but no light came to me in my meditations  i did not know then that whereas young men and many lasses too are like the roman lad who went with his bosom bare crying aura veni and sighing for the breeze of love to come other maidens are wroth with love when he creeps into their hearts and would fain cast him outbeing in a manner mad with anger against love and against him whom they desire and against themselves  this mood as was later seen was elliots for her heart was like a wild bird trapped that turns with bill and claw on him who comes to set it free  moreover i have since deemed that her passion of faith in the maid made war on her love for me one breast being scantly great enough to contain these two affections and her pride taking against the natural love the part of the love which was divine  but all these were later thoughts that came to me in musing on the sorrows of my days and like most wisdom this knowledge arrived too late and i as then was holden in perplexity     chapter viiiof certain quarrels that came on the hands of norman leslie   belike i had dropped asleep outwearied with what had befallen me mind and body but i started up suddenly at the sound of a daggerhilt smitten against the main door of the house and a voice crying open in the name of the dauphin  they had come in quest of me and when i heard them it was as if a hand had given my heart a squeeze and for a moment my breath seemed to be stopped  this past i heard the old servingwoman fumbling with the bolts and peering from behind the curtain of my casement i saw that the ways were dark and the narrow street was lit up with flaring torches the lights wavering in the wind  i stepped to the wide ingle thinking to creep into the secret hidinghole  but to what avail  it might have served my turn if my escape alive from the moat had only been guessed but now my master must have told all the story and the menatarms must be assured that i was within  thinking thus i stood at pause when a whisper came as if from within the ingle  unbar the door and hide not  it must be elliots voice speaking through some tube contrived in the ingle of the dwellingroom below or otherwise  glad at heart to think that she took thought of me i unbarred the door and threw myself into a chair before the fire trying to look like one unconcerned  the bolts were now drawn below i heard voices rather scots than french to my sense  then the step of one man climbed up the stair heavily and with the tap of a staff keeping tune to it  it was my master  his face was pale and falling into a chair he wiped the sweat from his brow unhappy man that i am he said i have lost my apprentice  i gulped something down in my throat ere i could say then it is death  nay he said and smiled  but gliff for gliff 16 you put a fear on me this day and now we are even  yet i scarce need a cup of wine for my recovery master i said filling him a beaker from the flagon on the table which he drained gladly being sore wearied so steep was the way to the castle and hard for a lame man  my heart was as light as a leaf on a tree and the bitterness of shameful death seemed gone by  i have lost my prentice another way he said setting down the cup on the table  i had much a do to see kennedy for he was at the dice with other lords  at length deeming there was no time to waste i sent in the bonny book of hours praying him to hear me for a moment on a weighty matter  that brought him to my side he leaped at the book like a trout at a fly and took me to his own chamber  there i told him your story when it came to the wench in the kings laundry and robin lindsay and you clad in girls gear and kissed in the guardroom he struck hand on thigh and laughed aloud  then i deemed your cause as good as three parts won and he could not hold in but led me to a chamber where were many lords dicing and drinking tremouille ogilvie the bishop of orleansthat holy man who has come to ask for aid from the kingla hire xaintrailles and i know not whom  there i must tell all the chronicle again and some said this and some that and tremouille mocks that the maid uttered her prophecy to no other end but to make you fulfil it and slay her enemy for the sake of her beaux yeux  the others would hear nothing of this and indeed though i am no gull i wot that tremouille is wrong here and over cunning he trusts neither man nor woman  howsoever it be he went with the story to the king who is keen to hear any new thing  and to be short the end of it is this that you have your free pardon on these terms namely that you have two score of masses said for the dead man and yourself take service under sir hugh kennedy that the king may not lose a manatarms  never sure came gladder tidings to any man than these to me  an hour ago the rope seemed tight about my neck one day past and i was but a prentice to the mean craft of painting and limning arts good for a monk or a manant but save for pleasure not to be melled or meddled with by a man of gentle blood  and now i was to wear arms and that in the best of causes under the best of captains one of my own countrya lord in ayrshire  ay even so my master said marking the joy in my face you are right glad to leave usa lass and a lameter 17 well well such is youth and eld is soon forgotten  i fell on my knees at his feet and kissed his hands and i believe that i wept  sir i said you have been to me as a father and more than it has been my fortune to find my own father  never would i leave you with my will and for the gentle demoiselle your daughter  but here i stinted since in sooth i knew not well what words to say  ay we shall both miss you betimes but courage man  after all this new life beseems you best and mark me a lass thinks none the worse of a lad because he wears not the prentices hodden grey but a scots archers green white and red and charles for badge on breast and sleeve and a sword by his side  and as for the bonny book of hoursmaster i said with shame was that my ransom  kennedy would have come near my price and strove to make me take the gold  but what is bred in the bone will out i am a gentleman born not a huckster and the book i gave him freely  may it profit the good knight in his devotions  but now come they are weary waiting for us the hour waxes late and elliot i trow is long abed  you must begone to the castle  in the stairs and about the door some ten of sir hughs men were waiting all countrymen of my own and the noise they made and their speech were pleasant to me  they gave me welcome with shouts and laughter and clasped my hands for him that called us winesacks you have given him water to his wine and the frog for his butler they said making a jest of life and death  but my own heart for the nonce was heavy enough again i longing to take farewell of elliot which might not be nor might she face that wild company  howbeit thinking it good to have a friend at court i made occasion to put in the hand of the old servingwoman all of such small coins as i had won in my life servile deeming myself well quit of such illgotten gear  and thereafter with great mirth and noise they set forth to climb the hill towards the castle where i was led through many a windy passage to the chamber of sir hugh kennedy  there were torches lit and the knight a broadshouldered fairhaired man with a stern flushed face was turning over and gazing at his new book of hours like a child busy with a fresh toy  he laid the book down when we entered and the senior of the two archers who accompanied me told him that i was he who had been summoned  your name he asked and i gave it  you are of gentle blood  and i answering yes he replied then see that you are ready to shed it for the king  your life that was justly forfeit is now by his royal mercy returned to you to be spent in his service  rutherford and douglas go take him to quarters and see that tomorrow he is clad as beseems a man of my command  now good night to youbut stay  you norman leslie you will have quarrels on your hand wait not for them but go to meet them if they are with the french men atarms and in quarrel see that you be swift and deadly  for the townsfolk no brawling marauding or haling about of honest wenches here we are strangers and my men must be respected  he bowed his head his words had been curt no grace or kindness had he shown me of countenance  i felt in my heart that to him i was but a pawn in the game of battle  now i seemed as far off as ever i was from my foolish dream of winning my spurs nay perchance never had i sunk lower in my own conceit  till this hour i had been as it were the hinge on which my share of the world turned and now i was no more than a wheel in the carriage of a couleuvrine an unconsidered cog in the machine of war i was to be lost in a multitude every one as good as myself or better and when i had thought of taking service i had not foreseen the manner of it and the nature of the soldiers trade  my head that i had carried high somewhat drooped as i saluted imitating my companions and we wheeled forth of the room  hugh has taken the pride out of you lad or my name is not randal rutherford said the border man who had guided me  faith he has a keen tongue and a short way with him but there are worse commanders  and now you must to your quarters for the hour is late and the guardroom shut  he led me to our common sleepingplace where among many snoring menat arms in a great bare hall a pallet was laid for me and my flesh crept as i remembered how this was the couch of him whom i had slain  howbeit being well weary despite the strangeness of the place after brief orisons i slept sound till a trumpet called us in the morning  concerning the strangeness of this waking to me who had been gently nurtured and the rough life and profane words which i must hear not indeed that they had been wholly banished from our wild days at st andrews it is needless that i should tell  seeing that i was come among rude neighbours i even made shift to fall back in semblance on such manners as i had used among the students before i left scotland though many perils and the fear wherein i stood of brother thomas and the company of the maid elliot had caused me half to forget my swaggering ways  so may god forgive me i swore roundly i made as if i deemed lightly of that frenchmans death and in brief i so bore me that ere noon when i behoved to go into chinon with randal rutherford and there provide me with the rich apparel of our company i had three good quarrels on my hand  first there was the manatarms who had kissed me in the guardroom  he in a bourde and mockery making pretence that he would repeat his insult got that which was owing him and with interest for indeed he could see out of neither of his squint eyes when i had dealt with him and for this cause perforce if he needed more proof of my manhood than the weight of my fist he must tarry for the demonstration which he desired  then there was robin lindsay and at his wrath i make no marvel for the tale of how he came late to tryst and at secondhand with many such rude and wanton additions as soldiers use to make was noised abroad all over the castle  his quarrel was no matter for fisticuffs so being attired in helmet vambrace rerebrace gauntlets and greaves out of the armoury where many such suits were stored i met him in a certain quiet court behind the castle where quarrels were usually voided  and now my practice of the sword at home and the lessons of our smith came handily to my need  after much clashing of steel and smiting out of sparks i chanced by an art known to me to strike his sword out of his hand then having him at an avail i threw down my own blade and so plainly told him the plain truth and how to his mistress i owed my life which i would rather lose now at his hand than hear her honour blamed that he forgave me and we embraced as friends  neither was this jest anew cast up against either of us men fearing to laugh as we say with the wrong side of their mouths  after this friendly bout at point and edge robin and randal rutherford being off duty must needs carry me to the tennis court where tremouille and the king were playing two young lords and that for such a stake as would have helped to arm a hundred men for the aid of orleans  it was pretty to see the ball fly about basted from the walls and the players bounding and striking and little as i understood the game so eager was i over the sport that a gentleman within the dedans touched me twice on the shoulder before i was aware of him  i would have a word with you sir if your grace can spare me the leisure  may it not be spoken here i asked for i was sorry to lose the spectacle of the tennis which was new to me and is a pastime wherein france beats the world  pity it is that many players should so curse and blaspheme god and his saints  my business replied the stranger is of a kind that will hardly endure waiting  with that i rose and followed him out into the open courtyard much marvelling what might be toward  you are that young gentleman said my man for a gentleman i take you to be from your aspect and common report who yesterday were the death of gilles de puiseux  sir to my sorrow and not by my will i am he and but now i was going forth to have certain masses said for his souls welfare which was true randal rutherford having filled my purse against payday  i thank you sir for your courtesy and perchance may have occasion to do the like gentle service for you  gilles de puiseux was of my blood and kin he has none other to take up his feud for him in this place and now your quickness of comprehension will tell you that the business wherewith i permit myself to break your leisure will brook no tarrying let me say that i take it not upon me to defend the words of my cousin who insulted a woman and as i believe a messenger from the blessed saints that love france  i looked at him in some amazement  he was a young man of about my own years delicately and richly clad in furs silks and velvets a great gold chain hanging in loops about his neck a gold brooch with an ancient roman medal in his cap  but the most notable thing in him was his thick golden hair whence la hire had named him capdorat because he was so blond and right keen in war and hardy beyond others  and here he was challenging me who stood before him in a prentices hodden grey  sir i said i could wish you a better quarrel but not more courtesy many a gentleman seeing me such as i am would bid me send ere he crossed swords with me to my own country for my borbrief 18 which i came away in too great haste to carry with me  nay i was but now to set forth and buy me a sword and other accoutrements natheless from the armoury here they may equip me with sword and body armour  of bodyarmour take no thought he answered for this quarrel is of a kind that must needs be voided in our smocks he meaning that it was a outrance till one of us fell  verily now i saw that this was not to be a matter of striking sparks from steel as robin and i had done but of life and death  i shall be the more speedily at your service i made answer and as i spoke randal and robin came forth from the dedans the sport being over  they joined me and i told them in few words my new business my adversary tarrying cap in hand till i had spoken and then proclaiming himself aymar de puiseux a gentleman of dauphine as indeed my friends knew  i shall wait on you with your leave at the isle in the river where it is of custom opposite the booths of the goldworkers quoth he about the hour of noon and so saluting us he went as he said to provide himself with friends  blood of judas quoth robin who swore terribly in his speech you have your hands full young norman  he is but now crept out of the rank of pages but when the french and english pages fought a valliance of late under orleans none won more praise than he who was captain of the french party  he played a good sword i asked  he threw a good stone  man it was a stone bicker and they had lids of baskets for targes  and he challenges me to the field i said hotly by st andrew  i will cuff his ears and send him back to the other boys  norman my lad when were you in a stone bicker last quoth randal and i hung my head for it was not yet six months gone since the sailors and we students were stoning each other in north street  yet he does play a very good sword and is cunning of fence for your comfort said randal  so i hummed the old lilt of the leslies whence they say comes our name     between the less lea and the mair    he slew the knight and left him there  for i deemed it well to show a good face  moreover i had some conceit of myself as a swordsman and randal was laughing like a foolbody at my countenance  faith you will make a spoon or spoil a horn andlet me have my laugh outyou bid well for an archer said randal and robin counselling me to play the same prank on the french lads sword as late i had done on his own they took each of them an arm of mine and so we swaggered down the steep ways into chinon  first i would go to the tailor and the cordwainer and be fitted for my new splendours as an archer of the guard  they both laughed at me again for said they very cheerfully you may never live to wear these fine feathers  but randal making the reflection that if i fell there would be none to pay the shopmaster they both shouted with delight in the street so that passersby turned and marvelled at them  clearly i saw that to go to fight a duel is one thing and to go and look on is another and much more gay for my heart had no desire of all this merriment  rather would i have recommended my case to the saints and chiefly to st andrew for whose cause and honour i was about to put my life in jeopardy  but shame and the fear of seeming fearful drove me to jest with the otherssuch risks of dying unconfessed are run by sinful men  howbeit they helped me to choose cloth of the best colour and fashion laughing the more because i being short of stature and slim the tailor if i fell might well find none among the archers to purchase that for which belike i should have no need  we must even enlist the pucelle in our guard for she might wear this apparel quoth randal  thus boisterously they bore themselves but more gravely at the swordsmiths where we picked out a good cutandthrust blade well balanced that came readily to my hand  then i with sword at side like a gentleman we made to the river passing my masters booth where i looked wistfully at the windows for a blink of elliot but saw none that i knew only from an open casement the little jackanapes mopped and mowed at me in friendly fashion  hard by the booth was a little pier and we took boat and so landed on the island where were waiting for us my adversary and two other gentlemen  having saluted each other we passed to a smooth grassy spot surrounded on all sides by tall poplar trees  here in places daffodils were dancing in the wind but otherwhere the sward was much trampled down and in two or three spots were black patches that wellnigh turned my courage for i was not yet used to the sight of mens blood here often shed for little cause  the friends of us twain adversaries for enemies we could scarce be called chose out a smooth spot with a fair light the sun being veiled and when we had stripped to our smocks we drew and fell to work  he was very quick and light in his movements bounding nimbly to this side or that but i using a hanging guard in our common scots manner did somewhat perplex him to whom the fashion was new  one or two scratches we dealt each other but for all that i could see we were well matched and neither closed as men rarely do in such a combat till they are wroth with hurts and their blood warm  now i gashed his thigh but not deeply and with that as i deemed his temper fired for he made a full sweep at my leg above the knee  this i have always reckoned a fools stroke as leaving the upper part of the body unguarded and avoiding with my right leg i drove down with all my force at his head  but even as i struck came a flash and the sudden deadness of a deep wound for he had but feinted and then avoiding me so that i touched him not he drove his point into my breast  between the force of my own blow and this stab i fell forward on my face and thence rolled over on my back catching at my breast with my hands as though to stop the blood but in sooth not well knowing what i did  he had thrown down his sword and now was kneeling by my side  i take you to witness he said that this has befallen to my great sorrow and had i been where this gentleman was yesterday and heard my cousin blaspheme i would myself have drawn on him but  and here as i later heard he fainted from loss of blood my sword having cut a great vein and i likewise lost sense and knowledge  nor did i know more till they lifted me and laid me on a litter of poplar boughs having stanched my wound as best they might  in the boat as they ferried us across the river i believe that i fainted again and so between home and hell as the saying is i lay on my litter and was carried along the street beside the water  folk gathered around us as we went  i heard their voices as in a dream when lo there sounded a voice that i knew right well for elliot was asking of the people who was hurt  at this hearing i hove myself up on my elbow beckoning with my other hand and i opened my mouth to speak but in place of words came only a wave of blood that sickened me and i seemed to be dreaming in my bed of elliot and her jackanapes and then feet were trampling and at length i was laid down and so seemed to fall most blessedly asleep with a little hand in mine and rarely peaceful and happy in my heart though wherefore i knew not  after many days of tossing on the waves of the world it was as if i had been brought into the haven where i would be  of what was passing i knew or i remember nothing  later i heard that a good priest had been brought to my bedside and perchance there was made some such confession as the church in her mercy accepts from sinful men in such case as mine  but i had no thought of life or death purgatory or paradise only if paradise be rest among those we love such rest for an unknown while and such sense of blissful companionship were mine  but whether it was well to pass through and beyond this scarce sensible joy or whether that peace will ever again be mine and unending i leave with humility to them in whose hands are christian souls     chapter ixof the winning of elliot   the days of fever and of dreams went by and passed leaving me very weak but not ignorant of where i was and of what had come and gone  my master had often been by my bedside and elliot now and again the old housewife also watched me by night and gave me drink when i thirsted most of the while i deemed i was at home in the house of pitcullo yet i felt there was something strange and that there was pain somewhere in the room  but at length as was said i came to knowledge of things and could see elliot and remember her when she knelt praying by my bed as oft she did whiles i lay between life and death  i have heard speak of men who being inflamed with love as i had been fell into a fever of the body and when that passed lo their passion had passed with it and their longing  and so it seemed to be with me  for some days i was not permitted to utter a word and later i was as glad in elliots company as you may have seen a little lad and lass not near come to full age who go playing together with flowers and such toys  so we were merry together the jackanapes keeping us company and making much game and sport  perchance these were my most blessed days as of one who had returned to the sinless years when we are happier than we know and not yet acquainted with desire  now and again rutherford and lindsay would come to visit me seeming strangely still and gentle speaking little but looking at me with kind eyes and vowing that my tailor should yet be paid for his labour  capdorat also came for he had but suffered a flesh wound with much loss of blood and we showed each other the best countenance  so time went by while i grew stronger daily and now it was ordained by the leech a skilful man that i might leave my bed and be clothed and go about through the house and eat stronger food whereof i had the greatest desire and would ever be eating like a howlet 19  now when i was to rise i looked that they should bring me my old prentices gabardine and hose but on the morning of that day elliot came bearing in her arms a parcel of raiment very gay and costly  here is your fine clothing new come from the tailors booth she cried merrily  see you shall be as bright as spring in green and white and red  there was the bonnet with its three coloured plumes and the doublet with charles wrought in silver on the arm and breast and all other things seemlya joy to mine eyes  she held them up before me her face shining like the return of life with a happy welcome and my heart beat to see and hear her as of old it was wont to do  and wherefore should not i go to the wars she cried and fight beside the maid  i am as tall as she if scantly so strong and braveoh i am very brave glacidas i bid you beware she said putting the archers bonnet gallantly cocked on her beautiful head and drawing forth the sword from his scabbard as one in act to fight but in innocent unwarlike wise  there she stood before me in the sunlight like the angel of victory all glad and fair and two blue rays from her eyes shot into my heart and lo i was no more a child but a man again and a lover  o elliot i said ere ever i wist what i was saying and i caught her left hand into mineo elliot i love you  give me but your love and i shall come back from the wars a knight and claim my love to be my lady  she snatched her hand suddenly as if angered out of mine and therewith being very weak i gave a cry my wound fiercely paining me then her face changed from rosered to lilywhite she dropped on her knees by my bed and her arms were about my neck and all over my face her soft sweetscented hair and her tears  oh i have slain you i have slain you my love she sobbed making a low sweet moan as a cushat in the wild wood for i lay deadly still being overcome with pain and joy  and there i was my love comforting me as a mother comforts her child  i moved my hand to take hers in mineher little hand and so for a space there was silence between us save for her kind moaning and in my heart was such gladness as comes but once to men and may not be spoken in words of this world  there was silence between us then she rose very gently and tossed back her hair showing her face wet with tears but rosyred with happiness and sweet shame  had it not been for that chance hurt how long might i have wooed ere i won her  but her heart was molten by my anguish  hath the pain passed she whispered  sweet was the pain my love and sweetly hast thou healed it with thy magic  then she kissed me and so fled from the room as one abashed and came not back that day when indeed i did not rise nor for two days more being weaker than we had deemed  but happiness is the greatest leech on earth and does the rarest miracles of healing so in three days space i won strength to leave my bed and my room and could sit by the door at noon in the sun of spring that is warmer in france than in our own country  now it could not be but that elliot and i must meet when her father was in town about his affairs or busy in the paintingroom and much work he had then on his hands  but elliot was right coy hiding herself from me who watched warily till one day when my master was abroad i had the fortune to find her alone in the chamber putting spring flowers in a very fair vessel of glass  i made no more ado but coming in stealthily i caught her boldly about the body saying  yield you rescue or no rescue and strive not against me lest you slay a wounded manatarms  for very fear as i believe lest she might stir my wound again she was still as a bird that lies in your hands when once you have caught it  and all that passes of kiss and kind word between happy lovers passed between us till i prayed of her grace that i might tell her father how things stood for well i had seen by his words and deeds that he cherished me as a son  so she granted this and we fell to devising as to what was to be in days to come  lackland was i and penniless save for my pay if i got it but we looked to the common fortune of young menatarms namely spoil of war and the ransom of prisoners of england or burgundy  for i had set up my resolve either to die gloriously or to win great wealth and honour which to a young man and a lover seem things easily come by  nor could my master look for a great fortune in marriage seeing that despite his gentle birth he lived but as a burgess and by the work of his hands  as we thus devised she told me how matters now were in the country of which indeed i still knew but little for to a man sick and nigh upon death nothing imports greatly that betides beyond the walls of his chamber  what i heard was this namely that about orleans the english ever pressed the good town more closely building new bastilles and other great works so as to close the way from blois against any that came thence of our party with victual and menatarms  and daily there was fighting without the walls wherein now one side had the better now the other but food was scant in orleans and many were slain by cannonshots  yet much was spoken of a new cannonier lately come to aid the men of orleans and how he and john of lorraine slew many of the hardiest of the english with their couleuvrines  at this telling i bethought me of brother thomas but spoke no word concerning him for my mistress began very gladly to devise of her dear maid concerning whom indeed she could never long be silent  faithless heart and fickle i said in a jest i believe you love that maid more than you love me and as she wears sword at side like a man i must even challenge her to fight in the island  here she stayed my speech in the best manner and the most gracious laughing low so that verily i was clean besotted with love and marvelled that any could be so fair as she and how i could have won such a lady  beware how you challenge my maid said she at last for she fights but on horseback with lance and sperthe 20 and the duc dalencon has seen her tilt at the ring and has given her the best steed in his stables whereon she shall soon lead her army to orleans  then i must lay by my quarrel for who am i to challenge my captain but tell me hath she heard any word of thee and me  elliot waxed rosy and whispered  we had spoken together about thee ere she went to poictiers to be examined and questioned by the doctors of law and learning after thou wert wounded  concerning this journey to poictiers i knew nothing but i was more concerned to hear what the maid had said about elliot and me for seeing that the maid herself was vowed as men deemed to virginity it passed into my mind that she might think holy matrimony but a low estate and might try to set my mistresss heart on following her own example  and then i thought but foolishly elliots love for me might be weaker than her love for the maid  yes my lady went on i could not but open my heart about thee and me to one who is of my own age and so wise unlike other girls  moreover i scarce knew well whether your heart was like disposed with my heart therefore i devised with her more than once or twice  hiding her face on my breast she spoke very low and as my fancy had once seen the children the dark head and the golden bowed together in prayer for france and the dauphin so now i saw them again held close together in converse and that strange maid and prophetess listening like any girl to a girls tale of the secrets of her heart  and what counsel gave the maid i said or had she any prophecy of our fortune  nay on such matters she knows no more than you or i or knows but seldom nor seeks to learn from her counsel  only she is bidden that she must rescue orleans and lead the dauphin to his sacring at rheims  but she wished me well and comforted me that your heart was even as my own as she saw on that day when you wore womans gear and slew him that blasphemed her  and of you she spoke the best words for that you who knew her not took her part against her enemy  and for your wound she sorrowed much not knowing more than i who am simple whether it would turn to life or death  and if to life then if she could but persuade the doctor and clergy and the kings counsellors to let her go she said that you should follow with her to the wars and she if so the saints pleased would be the making of your fortune you and i being her first friends  the saints fight for her i said for we have done our part thus far and i would that i may be well ere she raises her standard  but here elliot turned right pale at the thought of my going to the wars she holding my face off and gazing steadily upon me with wistful eyes  o god send that the maid go speedily she cried for as now you are not fit to bear arms  thou wouldst not have me lag behind when the maids banner is on the wind  nay she said but slowly thee and all that i have would i give for her and for her cause and for the saints  but now thou must not goand her eyes yearned upon menow that i could overthrow thee if we came to war  so here she laughed again being like the weather withouta changeful thing of shower and shine  thus we continued devising and she told me that some days after my wounding the maid had held converse apart with the king and then gave him to wit of certain marvellous matters that none might know save by heavenly inspiration  but what these matters might be none could tell save the king and the maiden only  that this was sooth i can affirm having myself been present in later years when one that affected to be the very pucelle never slain or re arisen by miracle came before the king and truly she had beguiled many then the king said welcome pucelle ma mie thou art welcome if thou hast memory of that secret thing which is between thee and me  whereon this false woman as one confounded fell on her knees and confessed her treason  this that elliot told me therefore while the sun shone into the chamber through the bare vinetendrils was sooth and by this miracle it seems the maid had at last won the ear of the king  so he bade carry her to poictiers where the doctors and the learned were but now examining into her holy life and her knowledge of religion being amazed by the wisdom of her answers  the noble ladies about her too and these mendicant friars that were sent to hold inquisition concerning her at domremy had found in her nothing but simplicity and holy maidenhood pity and piety but as for a sign of her sending and a marvel to convince all mens hearts that she said she would only work at orleans  so now she was being accepted and was to raise her standard as we had cause to believe  but said elliot the weeks go by and much is said and men and victual are to be gathered and still they tarry doing no great deed oh would that today her standard were on the wind for today and for these many days i must have you here and tend you till you be fit to bear arms  therewith she made me much good cheer then very tenderly taking her arms from about me lest i should be hurt again she cried  but we speak idly and thou hast not seen the standard and the banner and the pennon of the maid that my father is painting  then i must lean on her shoulder as indeed i still had cause to do and so right heedfully she brought me into the paintingchamber  there upon great easels were stretched three sheets of bougran 21 very white and glisteringa mighty long sheet for the standard a smaller one square for the banner and the pennon smaller yet in form of a triangle as is customary  the great standard in the maidens wars was to be used for the rallying of all her host the pennon was a signal to those who fought around her as guards of her body and about the banner afterwards gathered for prayer and praise those men confessed and clean of conscience whom she had called and chosen  these cloths were now but half painted the figures being drawn by my masters hands and the groundcolours laid but some portions were quite finished very bright and beautiful  on the standard was figured god the father having the globe in his hand two angels knelt by him one holding for his blessing the lily of france  the field was to be sown with fleursdelys and to bear the holy names jhesumaria  on the banner was our lord crucified between the holy virgin and st john  and on the pennon was wrought the annunciation the angel with a lily kneeling to the blessed virgin  on the standard my master later fashioned the chosen blazon of the maida dove argent on a field azure but the blazon of the sword supporting the crown between two lilies that was later given to her and her house she did not use as her enemies said she did out of pride and vainglory mixing her arms with holy things even at rheims at the sacring  for when she was at rheims no armorial bearings had yet been given to her  herein then as always they lied in their cruel throats for as the psalmist says quare fremuerunt gentes  all these evil tongues and all thought of evil days were far from us as we stood looking at the work and praising it as well we might for never had my master wrought so well  now as i studied on the paintings i well saw that my master had drawn the angel of the pennon in the likeness of his own daughter elliot  wonderful it was to see her fair face and blue eyes holy and humble with the gold halo round her head  ah love i said that banner i could follow far pursuing fame and the face of my lady  with that we fell into such dalliance and kind speech as lovers use wholly rapt from the world in our happiness  even then before we so much as heard his step at the door my master entered and there stood we my arm about her neck and hers about my body embracing me  he stood with eyes wide open and gave one long whistle  faith he cried our surgery hath wrought miracles  you are whole beyond what i looked for but surely you are deaf for my step is heavy enough yet me thinks you heard me not  elliot spoke no word but drawing me very heedfully to a settle that was by the side of the room she fled without looking behind her  sir i said as soon as she was gone i need make no long story  faith no he answered standing back from the banner and holding his hands at each side of his eyes regarding his work as limners do  you twain i doubt not were smitten senseless by these great masterpieces and the thought of the holy use to which they were made  that might well have been sir but what we had covenanted to tell you this day we have told unwittingly methinks already  i could not be in your daughters company and have the grace of her gentle ministerings  but you must stand senseless before her fathers paintings  faith you are a very grateful lad  but so it is and i am not one of those blind folk who see not what is under their eyes  and now what now  well i can tell you  you are to be healed and follow these flags to war and win your spurs and much wealth by ransoms and so make my lass your lady  is it not so  i was abashed by his bourdes and could say nought for being still very weak the tears came into my eyes  then he drew near me limping and put his hand on my shoulder but very gently saying  even so be it my son as better may not be  tis no great match but i looked in this country for nothing nobler or more wealthy  that my lass should be happy and have one to fend for her there is my affair and i am not one of those fathers who think to make their daughters glad by taking from them their hearts desire  so cheer up  what a manat arms weeping  strange times when maids lead menatarms and menatarms weep at home  with these words he comforted me and made me welcome for indeed he was a kind man and a wise so many there are that cause shrewd sorrow when there should be joy in their houses  this was never his way and wise do i call him for all that has come and gone  in a little time when i had thanked him and shown him i trow how he stood in my love he bade me go to my chamber and be at rest saying that he must take thought as to how matters stood  for you are not yet fit to bear arms nor will be for these many days nor is it seemly nor our countrys custom that my maid should dwell here in the house with you as things are between you and i must consider of how i may bestow her till you march with your troop if marching there is to be  this i dared not gainsay and so i went to my chamber with a heart full of grief and joy for these hours that are all of gladness come rarely to lovers and to me were scantly measured  perchance it was for my souls welfare to win me from the ways of the world  but to elliot and me that night bore no joy but sorrow albeit passing at supper we met indeed but she stayed with us not long after supper when my master with a serious countenance told me how he had taken counsel with a very holy woman of his own kin widow of an archer and how she was going on pilgrimage to our lady of puy en velay by reason of the jubilee for this year good friday and the annunciation fell on the same day  tomorrow she sets forth and whatsoever prayer can do for france and the king shall be done  always after this day of jubilee they say that strange and great matters come to pass  that there will be strange matters i make no doubt for when before save under holy deborah in scripture did men follow a woman to war  may good come of it  however it fall out elliot is willing to go on pilgrimage for she is very devout  moreover she tells me that it had been in her mind before for the mother of that maid is to be at puy praying for her daughter as certes she hath great need if ever woman had  and elliot is fain to meet her and devise with her about the maid  and for you you still need our nursing and the sooner you win strength the nearer you are to that which you would win  still i am sorry lad for i remember my courting days and the lasss mother blessings on her  to all this i could make no answer but that his will was mine and so the day ended in a mingling of gladness and sorrow     chapter xhow norman leslie was out of all comfort   my brethren the good benedictine fathers here in pluscarden priory are wont betimes to be merry over my penitents for all the young lads and lasses in the glen say they are fain to be shriven by old father norman and by no other  this that my brethren report may well be true and yet i take no shame in the bruit or fama  for as in my hot youth i suffered sorrows many from love so now i may say like that carthaginian queen in maro miseris succurrere disco  the years of the youth of most women and men are like a tourney or jousts courteous and many fall in the lists of love and many carry sorer wounds away from loves spears than they wot of who do but look on from the safe seats and secure pavilions of age  though all may seem but a gentle and joyous passage of arms and the weapons that they use but arms of courtesy yet are shrewd blows dealt and wounds taken which bleed inwardly perchance through a whole life long  to medicine these wounds with kind words is it may be part of my poor skill as a healer of souls in my degree and therefore do the young resort to father norman  some confessors there be who laugh within their hearts at these sorrows of lovers as if they were mere nugae and featherweights others there are who wax impatient holding all love for sin in some degree and forgetting that monseigneur st peter himself was a married man and doubtless had his own share of trouble and amorous annoy when he was winning the lady his wife even as other men  but if i be of any avail as they deem in the healing of hearts i owe my skill of that surgery to remembrance of the days of my youth when i found none to give me comfort save what i won from a book that my master had in hand to copy and adorn namely the book of one hundred ballades containing counsel to a knight that he should love loyally this counsel offered by messire lyonnet de coismes messire jehan de mailly the sieur dyvry and many other good knights that were true lovers  verily in sermons of preachers and lives of holy men i found no such comfort  almost the sorest time of my sorrowing was for very grief of heart when elliot set forth on pilgrimage to puy en velay for we were but newly come together twain we were with one heart as a maker sang whom once i met in france ere i came back to scotland sweetly could he make but was a young clerk of no godly counsel and had to name maitre francoys villon  our heart was one the heart of elliot and mine own and lo here in a day it was torn asunder and we were set apart by the wisdom of men  i remember me how i lay wakeful on the night before the day when elliot should depart  tossing and turning i lay till the small fowls brake forth with their songs and my own thought seemed to come and go and come again in my head like the ritournelle of the birds  at last i might not endure but rose and attired myself very early and so went down into the chamber  thither presently came elliot feigning wonder to find me arisen and making pretence that she was about her housewiferies but well i wot that she might sleep no more than i  the old housewife coming and going through the room there we devised comforting each other with hopes and prayers indeed we sorely wanted comfort because never till we were wed if ever that should be might we have such solace of each others presence as we desired  then i brought from the workshop a sheet of vellum and colours and the painting tools and so fashioned a little picture of her to wear within the breast of my doublet  a rude thing it was and is for what gold however finely handled could match with her golden hair whereof at my desire she gave me a lock and of all worldly gear from my secular life these and the four links of my mothers chain alone are still mine and where my heart is there is my treasure  and she too must clip a long curl of my hair for as yet it was not cut en ronde as archers use to wear it but when she came again she said she would find me shrewdly shaven and then would love me no longer  then she laughed and kissed me and fell to comforting me for that she would not be long away  and in three months or four she said the king will be sacred at rheims and the maid will give you red wine to drink in paris town and the english will be swept into the sea and then we shall have peace and abundance  and then shall we be wedded and never part i cried whereat she blushed bidding me not be over bold for her heart might yet change and so laughed again and thus we fleeted the time till her father came and sent her about disposing such things as she must take with her  among these she was set on carrying her jackanapes to make her merry on the road though here i was of another counsel  for in so great a gathering there must be many gangrel folk and among them peradventure the violer woman who would desire to have the creature given back to her  but if it were so elliot said she would purchase the jackanapes for i am no lifter of other mens cattle as all you scots are and i am fain to own my jackanapes honestly  so she carried him with her the light chain about her wrist and he riding on her saddlebow for presently with many banners waving and with singing of hymns came the troop who wended together on pilgrimage many townsfolk well armed were there to guard their women the flags of all the crafts were on the wind the priests carried blessed banners so with this goodly company and her confessor and her fathers old kinswoman elliot rode away  the jackanapes was screeching on her saddle bow her yellow hair was lifted on her shoulder with the light breeze her father rode the first two stages with them  merry enough they seemed that went and the bells were chiming but i was left alone my heart empty or only full of useless longings  i betook myself therefore to a chapel hard by and there made my orisons for their safety and for good speed to the maid and her holy enterprise  thereafter there was no similitude for me and my unhappy estate save that of a dog who has lost his master in a strange place and goes questing everywhere and comfortless  then randal rutherford coming to visit me found me such a lackmirth he said and my wits so distraught that a lovesick wench were better company for a manatarms  cheer up man he said  look at me did i not leave my heart at branxholme mains with mally grieve and so in every town where i have been in garrison and do you see me cast down  off with this green sickness or never will you have strength to march with the maid where there is wealth to be won and golden coronets and gaudy stones such as saunders macausland took off the duke of clarence at bauge  faith between the wound capdorat gave you and this arrow of dan cupids in your heart i believe you will not be of strength to carry arms till there is not a pockpudding left in broad france  come forth and drain a pot or two of wine or if the leech forbids it come i will play you for all that is owing between you and me  with that he lugged out his dice and fetched a tablier but presently vowed that it was plain robbery for i could keep no count of the game therewith he left me laughing and mocking and saying that i had been bolder with robin lindsays lass  being alone and out of all comfort i fell to wandering in the workroom and there lit to my solace on that blessed book of the hundred ballades which my master was adorning with pictures and with scarlet blue and gold  it set forth how a young knight in sorrow of love was riding between pont de ce and angiers and how other knights met him and gave him counsel  these lines i read and getting them by rote took them for my device for they bid the lover thrust himself foremost in the press and in breach mine and escalade     sen assault viens devant te lance    en mine en eschielle en tous lieux    ou proesce les bons avance    ta dame ten aimera mieux  but reading soon grew a weariness to me as my life was and my master coming home bade me be of better cheer  by st andrew quoth he this is no new malady of thine but well known to leeches from of old and never yet was it mortal  remede there is none save to make ballades and rondels and forget sorrow in hunting rhymes if thou art a maker  thou art none  nay nor ever was i lad but i have had this disease and yet you see me whole and well  come lend me a hand at painting in these lilies it passes not thy skill  so i wrought some work whereof i have reason to be proud for these lilies were carried wheresoever blows and honour were to be won ay and where few might follow them  meanwhile my master devised with me about such sights as he had seen on the way and how great a concourse was on pilgrimage to puy and how if prayers availed the cause of france was won and yet in england too wives are praying for their lords and lasses for their lads in france  but ours is the better quarrel  so that weary day went by one of the longest that i have known and other days till now the leech said that i might go back to the castle though that i might march to the wars he much misdoubted  among the archers i had the best of greetings and all quarrels were laid by for as was said we were to set forth to orleans where would be blows enough to stay the greediest stomach  for now the maid had won all hearts taking some with her piety and others with her wit and knowledge that confounded the doctors how she a simple wench was so subtle in doctrine which might not be but by inspiration  others again were moved by her mirth and goodfellowship for she would strike a manat arms on the shoulder like a comrade and her horsemanship and deftness with sword and lance bewitched others she seeming as valiant and fair as these lady crusaders of whom old romances tell  and others again she gained by bourdes and jests others by her manners the fairest and most courtly that might be for she a manants daughter bore herself as an equal before the blood of france and was right dear to the young bride of the fair duc dalencon  yet was there about her such a grace of purity as of one descended from the skies that no man of them all was so hardy as to speak to her of love or even so much as to think thereof in the secret of his heart  so all reported of her and she had let write a letter to the english at orleans bidding them yield to god and the maid and begone to their own country lest a worse thing befall them  at this letter they mocked swearing that they would burn her heralds who carried the message  but the king had named her chief of war and given her a household with a good esquire jean daulon to govern it and all that beseems noble or royal blood  new armour had been made for her all of steel and silver and there was talk of a sword that she had come by in no common way but through revelation of the saints  for she being in tours had it revealed to her that a certain ancient sword with five crosses on the blade lay buried behind the altar of st catherine of fierbois  an armourer of tours was therefore sent thither and after much labour and search they of st catherines church found that sword very ancient and much bestained with rust  howbeit they cleaned it and made for it a sheath of cloth of gold  nevertheless the maid wore it in a leathern scabbard     chapter xihow madame catherine of fierbois wrought a miracle for a scot and how norman rode to the wars   now in this place i cannot withhold me from telling of an adventure which at this very time befell though it scarce belongs to my present chronicle  but it may be that in time to come faith will wax cold and the very saints be misdoubted of men  it therefore behoves me not to hold back the truth which i know and which this tale makes plain and undeniable even by hussites lollards and other miscreants  for he who reads must be constrained to own that there is no strait so terrible but the saints can bring safely forth therefrom such men as call upon them  there came at this season to chinon from fierbois where the maids sword was found by miracle a scottish archer not aforetime of our company though now he took service with us  he was named michael hamilton and was a tall man and strong grim of face sudden in anger heavy of hand walked a little lame and lacked one ear  that which follows he himself told to us and to our chaplain father urquhart and i myself have read it in the book of the miracles of madame st catherine of fierbois 22  you must know that brittany as at this time held for the english and michael hamilton had gone thither reiving and pillaging the country with a company of scots menatarms  hard by a place called clisson they had seized a deserted tower and held it for some days  it so fell out that they took a burgess of the country who was playing the spy on their quarters him they put to the torture and so learned that the english were coming against them with a great company of menatarms and of the country folk on that very night  they therefore delayed no longer than to hang the spy from a sufficient bough of a tree this michael doing what was needful and so were hurrying to horse when lo the english were upon them  not having opportunity to reach the stables and mount michael hamilton fled on foot with what speed he might but sorely impeded by the weight of his armour  the country folk therefore being light of foot easily overtook him and after slaying one and wounding more he was caught in a noose of rope thrown over him from behind  now even as he felt the noose tighten about his arms he though not commonly pious beyond the wont of menatarms vowed in his heart to make a pilgrimage to fierbois and to the shrine of madame st catherine if she would but aid him  and indeed he was ever a worshipper of st catherine she being the patroness of his own parish kirk near bothwell none the less he was overcome and bound whereon he that had thrown the noose and was son of the spy whom michael had hanged vowed that he would with his own hands hang michael  no ransom would this manant take nor would he suffer michael as a gentleman of blood and birth to die by the sword  so hanged michael was doubt not but it was done in the best manner and there he was left hanging  now that night of maundy thursday the cure of clisson was in his chamber and was about to go to bed  but as he made ready for bed he heard from a corner of the chamber a clear voice saying go forth and cut down the scots manatarms who was hanged for he yet lives  the cure thinking that he must be half asleep and dreaming paid no manner of regard to these commands  thereon the voice twice and thrice spoke aloud none save the cure being present and said go forth and cut down the scots manatarms who was hanged for he yet lives  it often so chances that men in religion are more hard of heart to believe than laymen and the simple  the cure therefore having made all due search and found none living who could have uttered that voice went not forth himself but at noon of good friday his service being done he sent his sexton as one used not to fear the sight and company of dead men  the sexton set out whistling for joy of the slaying of the scot but when he came back he was running as fast as he might and scarce could speak for very fear  at the last they won from him that he had gone to the tree where the dead scot was hanging and first had heard a faint rustle of the boughs  not affrighted the sexton drew out a knife and slit one of michaels bare toes for they had stripped him before they hanged him  at the touch of the knife the blood came and the foot gave a kick whereon the sexton hastened back with these tidings to the cure  the holy man therefore sending for such clergy as he could muster went at their head in all his robes canonical to the wild wood where they cut michael down and rubbed his body and poured wine into his throat so that at the end of half an hour he sat up and said pay waiter hay the two testers that i owe him  thereon most ran and hid themselves as if from a spirit of the dead but the manant he whose father michael had hanged made at him with a sword and dealt him a great blow cutting off his ear  but others who had not fled and chiefly the cure held the manant till his hands were bound that he might not slay one so favoured of madame st catherine  not that they knew of michaels vow but it was plain to the cure that the man was under the protection of heaven  michael then being kindly nursed in a house of a certain abbess was wellnigh recovered and his vow wholly forgotten when lo he being alone one invisible smote his cheek so that the room rang with the buffet and a voice said to him wilt thou never remember thy pilgrimage  moved therefore to repentance he stole the cures horse and so journeying by night till he reached france he accomplished his vows and was now returned to chinon  this michael hamilton was hanged not very long afterwards by command of the duc dalencon for plundering a church at jargeau  the story i have thought it behoved me to tell in this place because it shows how good and mild is madame st catherine of fierbois also lest memory of it be lost in scotland where it cannot but be of great comfort to all gentlemen of michaels kin and of the name and house of hamilton again i tell it because i heard it at this very season of my waiting to be recovered of my wound  moreover it is a tale of much edification to menatarms as proving how ready are the saints to befriend us even by speaking as it were with human voices to sinful men  of this i myself later had good proof as shall be told wherefore i praise and thank the glorious virgin madame st catherine of fierbois  this tale was the common talk in chinon which i heard very gladly taking pleasure in the strangeness of it  and in the good fortune of the maid i was yet more joyful both for her own sake and for elliots to whom she was so dear  but for my own part the leeches gave me little comfort saying that i might in no manner set forth with the rest for that i could not endure to march on foot but must die by the way  poor comfort was this for me who must linger in garrison while the fortune of france was on the cast of the dice and my own fortune was to be made now or never  so it chanced that one day i was loitering in the gateway watching the soldiers who were burnishing armour sharpening swords and all as merry and busy as bees in spring  then to me comes my master with a glad countenance and glad was i for these eight days or nine i had no tidings of him and knew not if elliot had returned from pilgrimage  i rose to greet him and he took my hand bidding me be of good cheer for that he had good tidings  but what his news might be he would not tell me i must come with him he said to his house  all about his door there was much concourse of people and among them two archers led a great black charger fairly caparisoned and covered with a rich silk hucque of colour cramoisie adorned with lilies of silver  as i marvelled who the rider might be conceiving that he was some great lord the door of my masters house opened and there within and plain to view was elliot embracing a young knight and over his silver armour fell her yellow hair covering gorget and rerebrace  then my heart stood still my lips opened but gave no cry when lo the knight kissed her and came forth all in shining armour but unhelmeted  then i saw that this was no knight but the maid herself boden in effeir of war 23 and so changed from what she had been that she seemed a thing divine  if st michael had stepped down from a church window leaving the dragon slain he would have looked no otherwise than she all gleaming with steel and with grey eyes full of promise of victory the holy sword girdled about her and a little battleaxe hanging from her saddlegirth  she sprang on her steed from the mountingstone beside the door and so waving her hand she cried farewell to elliot that stood gazing after her with shining eyes  the people went after the maid some way shouting noel and striving to kiss her stirrup the archers laughing meanwhile and bidding them yield way  and so we came humbly enough into the house where her father being present and laughing and the door shut elliot threw her arms about me and wept and smiled on my breast  ah now i must lose you again she said whereat i was half glad that she prized me so half sorry for that i knew i might not go forth with the host  this ill news i gave them both we now sitting quietly in the great chamber  nay thou shalt go said elliot  is it not so father  for the maid gave her promise ere she went to poictiers and now she is fulfilling it for the gentle king has given her a householdpages and a maitre dhotel a good esquire and these two gentlemen who rode with her from vaucouleurs and an almoner brother jean pasquerel an augustine that the maids mother sent with us from puy for we found her there  and the maid has appointed you to go with her for that you took her part when men reviled her  and money she has craved from the king and messire aymar de puiseux that was your adversary is to give you a good horse for that you may not walk  and above all the maid has declared to me that she will bring you back to us unscathed of sword but for herself she shall be wounded by an arrow under orleans yet shall she not die but be healed of that wound and shall lead the king to his sacring at rheims  so now verily for you i have no fear but my heart is sore for the maids sake and her wound  none the less she made as if she would dance for joy and i could have done as much not indeed that as then i put my faith in prophecies but for gladness that i was to take my fortune in the wars  so the hours passed in great mirth and good cheer  many things we spoke of as concerning the mother of the maidhow wise she was yet in a kind of amazement and not free from fear wherefore she prayed constantly for her child  moreover elliot told me that the jackanapes was now hers of right for that the woman its owner had been at puy but without her man and had sold it to her as to a good mistress yet with tears at parting  this news was none of the gladdest to me for still i feared that tidings of us might come to brother thomas  howbeit at last with a light heart though i was leaving elliot i went back to the castle  there aymar de puiseux meeting me made me the best countenance and gave me a right good horse that i named capdorat after him by his good will  and for my armour which must needs be light they gave me a mailleta coat of slender mail which did not gall my old wound  so accoutred i departed next day in good company to blois whence the maid was to set forth to orleans  marvel it was to find the road so full of bestialoxen cows sheep and swineall gathered as if to some great market for the victualling of orleans  but how they were to be got through the english lines into the city men knew not  for the english by this time had girdled the city all about with great bastilles each joined to other by sunken ways dug in the earth wherein were streets and marts and chambers with fires and chimneys as i have written in my latin chronicle 24 there false frenchmen came as to a fair selling and buying with store of food wine arms and things of price buying and selling in safety for the cannon and couleuvrines in the town could not touch them  but a word ran through the host how the maid knew by inspiration of the saints that no man should sally forth from among the english but that we should all pass unharmed  meantime the town of blois was in great turmoilthe cattle lowing in the streets the churches full to the doors of menatarms waiting their turn to be shrived for the maid had ordained that all who followed her must go clean of sin  and there was great wailing of light o loves and leaguer lasses that had followed the army as is custom for this custom the maid did away and drove these women forth and whither they wandered i know not  moreover she made proclamation that all dice and tabliers and instruments of gambling must be burned and myself saw the great pile yet smoking in the public place for this was to be a holy war  so we lodged at blois where the maid showed me the best countenance speaking favourable words of elliot and me and bidding me keep near her banner in battle which i needed no telling to make me resolve to do  so there for that night we rested     chapter xiihow the maid came to orleans and of the dolorous stroke that first she struck in war   concerning the ways of the saints and their holy counsel it is not for sinful men to debate but verify their ways are not as our ways as shall presently be shown in the matter of the maids march to orleans  for the town of blois where now we lay is as all men know on the right bank of the water of loire a great river wider and deeper and stronger by far than our tay or tweed and the town of orleans whither we were bound is also on the same side namely the right side of the river  now orleans was beleaguered in this manner the great stone bridge had been guarded on the left or further side of the stream first by a boulevard or strong keep on the land whence by a drawbridge men crossed to a yet stronger keep called les tourelles builded on the last arches of the bridge  but early in the siege the english had taken from them of orleans the boulevard and les tourelles and an arch of the bridge had been broken so that in nowise might menatarms of the party of france enter into orleans by way of that bridge from the left bank through the country called sologne  yet that keep les tourelles had not been a lucky prize to our enemies of england  for their great captain the lord salisbury had a custom to watch them of orleans and their artillery from a window in that tower and to guard him from arrowshots he had a golden shield pierced with little holes to look through that he held before his face  one day he came into this turret when they who worked the guns in orleans were all at their meat  but it so chanced that two boys playing truant from school went into a niche of the wall where was a cannon loaded and aimed at les tourelles  they seeing the gleam of the golden shield at the window of the turret set match to the touchhole of the cannon and as heaven would have it the ball struck a splinter of stone from the side of the window which breaking through the golden shield slew my lord of salisbury a good knight  thus plainly that tower was to be of little comfort to the english  none the less as they held les tourelles and the outer landward boulevard thereof the english built but few works on the left side of the river namely champ st prive that guarded the road by the left bank from blois les augustins that was a little inland from the boulevard of les tourelles so that no enemy might pass between these two holds and st jean le blanc that was higher up the river and a hold of no great strength  on the orleans side to guard the road from burgundy the english had but one fort st loup for burgundy and the north were of their part and by this way they expected no enemy  but all about orleans on the right bank of the river to keep the path from blois on that hand the english had builded many great bastilles and had joined them by hollow ways wherein as i said they lived at ease as men in a secure city underground  and the skill of it was to stop convoys of food and starve them of orleans for to take the town by open force the english might in nowise avail they being but some four thousand menat arms  thus matters stood and it was the maids mind to march her men and all the cattle clean through and past the english bastilles on the right side of the river and by inspiration she well knew that no man would come forth against us  moreover she saw not how by the other way and the left bank the cattle might be ferried across and the great company of menatarms into orleans town under the artillery of the english  for the english held the pass of the broken bridge as i said and therefore all crossing of the water must be by boat  now herein it was shown as often again that the ways of the saints are not as our ways  for the captains namely the sieur de rais who afterwards came to the worst end a man might and la hire and ambroise de lore and de gaucourt in concert with the bastard of orleans then commanding for the king in that town gave the simple maid to understand that orleans was on the left bank of the river  this they did because they were faithless and slow of belief and feared that so great a company as ours might in nowise pass meun and beaugency towns of the english and convey so many cattle through the bastilles on the right bank  therefore with many priests going before singing the veni creator with holy banners as on a pilgrimage with menatarms archers pages and trains of carts and with bullocks rowting beneath the goad and swine that are very hard to drive and slowfooted sheep we all crossed the bridge of blois on the morning of april 25th  now had the holy saints deemed it wise and for our good to act as men do verily they would have spoken to the maid telling her that we were all going clean contrary to her counsel  nevertheless the saints held their peace and let us march on  belike they designed that this should turn to the greater glory of the maid and to the confusion of them that disbelieved which presently befell as i shall relate  all one day of spring we rode and slept beneath the stars the maid lying in her armour so that as one later told me who knew namely elliot her body was sorely bruised with her harness  early in the morning we mounted again and so rode north fetching a compass inland after noontide we came to a height and lo beneath us lay the english bastilles and holds on the left bank and beyond the glittering river and the broken bridge the towers and walls of orleans  then i saw the maid in anger for well she knew that she had been deceived by them who should have guided her  between us and the town of orleans lay the wide river the broken bridge and the camps of the english  on the further shore we beheld the people swarming on the walls and quays labouring to launch boats with sails and so purposing to ascend the river against the stream and meet us two leagues beyond the english lines  but this they might not do for a strong wind was blowing down stream and all their vessels were in disarray  the maid spurred to the front where were de rais lore kennedy and la hire  we could see her pointing with her staff and hear speech high and angry but the words we could not hear  the captains looked downcast as children caught in a fault and well they might for we were now as far off victualling orleans as ever we had been  the maid pointed to the english keep at st jean le blanc on our side of the water and as it seems was fain to attack it but the english had drawn off their men to the stronger places on the bridge and to hold st jean le blanc against them if we took it we had no strength  so we even wended from the height of olivet for six long miles till we reached the stream opposite checy where was an island  a rowingboat with a knight in glittering arms was pulled across the stream and the maid in her eagerness spurred her steed deep into the water to meet him  he was a young man brown of visage hardy and fierce and on his shield bore the lilies of orleans crossed with a baton sinister  he bowed low to the maid who cried  are you the bastard of orleans  i am he said and right glad of your coming  was it you who gave counsel that i should come by this bank and not by the other side and so straight against talbot and the english  she spoke as a master to a faulty groom fierce and high and to hear her was marvel  i and wiser men than i gave that counsel said he deeming this course the surer  nom dieu she cried  the council of messire is safer and wiser than yours  she pointed to the rude stream running rough and strong a great gale following with it so that no sailingboats might come from the town  you thought to beguile me and are yourselves beguiled for i bring you better succour than ever came to knight or townthe help of the king of heaven  then even as she spoke and as by miracle that fierce wind went right about and blew straight up the stream and the sails of the vessels filled  this is the work of our lord said the bastard of orleans crossing himself and the anger passed from the eyes of the maid  then he and nicole de giresme prayed her to pass the stream with them and to let her host march back to blois and so come to orleans crossing by the bridge of blois  to this she said nay that she could not leave her men out of her sight lest they fell to sin again and all her pains were lost  but with many prayers her confessor pasquerel joining in them she was brought to consent  so the host with priests and banners must set forth again to blois while the maid and we that were of her company crossed the river in boats and so rode towards the town  on this way the same is a road of the old romans the english held a strong fort called st loup and well might they have sallied forth against us but the people of orleans who ever bore themselves more hardily than any townsfolk whom i have known made an onfall against st loup that the english within might not sally out against us where was fierce fighting and they took a standard from the english  so at nightfall the maid with the bastard and other captains at her side rode into the town all the people welcoming her with torches in hand shouting noel as to a king throwing flowers before her horses feet and pressing to touch her or even the harness of her horse which leaped and plunged for the fire of a torch caught the fringe of her banner  lightly she spurred and turned him and lightly she caught at the flame with her hand and quenched it while all men marvelled at her grace and goodly bearing  never saw i more joy of heart for whereas all had feared to fall into the hands of the english now there was such courage in them as if monseigneur st michael himself or monseigneur st aignan had come down from heaven to help his good town  if they were hardy before as indeed they were now plainly they were full of such might and fury that man might not stand against them  and soon it was plain that no less fear had fallen on the english  but the maid with us who followed her was led right through the great street of orleans from the burgundy gate to the gate regnart whereby the fighting was ever most fell and there we lodged in the house of the treasurer of the duke of orleans jacquet boucher  never was sleep sweeter to me after the two weary marches and the sounds of music and revelry in the street did not hum a moment in my ears before i had passed into that blessed world of slumber without a dream  but my waking next day brought instantly the thought of my brother robin concerning whom i had ever feared that he fell with the flower of scotland when the comte de clermont deserted us so shamefully on the day of the battle of the herrings  no sooner did this doubt come into my mind than i leaped from my bed attired myself and went forth to the quarters of the scots under sir christian chambers  little need i had to tell my errand for they that met me guessed who i was because indeed robin and i favoured each other greatly in face and bodily presence  it was even as i had deemed my dear brother and friend and tutor of old days had died charging back upon the english who pursued us and fighting by the side of pothon de xaintrailles  all that day and in the week which followed my thought was ever upon him a look in a strangers face a word on anothers lips by some magic of the mind would bring my brother almost visibly before me ay among the noise of swords on mail and the screaming of arrows and of great cannonballs  if i heard ill news it was no more than i looked for but better news as it seemed i also heard though in my sorrow i marked it little  for the soldiers were lamenting the loss of their famed gunner not john the lorrainer but one who had come to them they said now some weeks agone in the guise of a cordelier though he did not fight in that garb but in common attire and ever wore his vizor down which men deemed strange whither he had gone or how disappeared they knew not for he had not been with those who yesterday attacked st loup  he could never thole the thought of the blessed maid said allan rutherford but would tell all that listened how she was a brainsick wench or a witch and under her standard he would never fight  he even avowed to us that she had been a chamberwench of an inn in neufchateau and there had learned to back a horse and many a worse trick which was a lie devised by the english and them of burgundy  but go where he would or how he would i deemed it well that brother thomas and i for of a surety it was brother thomas were not to meet in orleans  concerning the english in this wonderful adventure of the siege i have never comprehended nor do i now know wherefore they bore them as they did  that they sallied not out on the trains which the maid led and brought into the town a man might set down to mere cowardice and faint heartthey fearing to fight against a witch as they deemed her  in later battles when she had won so many a victory they may well have feared her  but as now they showed no dread where honour was to be won but rather pride and disdain  on this very saturday the morrow of our arrival la hire with florent dilliers and many other knights pushed forth a matter of two bowshots from the city walls and took a keep that they thought to have burned  they were very hardy men and being comforted by the maids coming were full of courage and goodwill yet the english rallied and drove them back with much firing of guns and now first i heard the din of war and saw the great stone balls fly scattering as they fell into splinters that screamed in the air with a very terrible sound  truly the english had the better of that fray and were no whit adread for at sunset the maid sent them two heralds bidding them begone yet they answered only that they would burn her for a witch and called her a ribaulde or loose wench and bade her go back and keep her kine  i was with her when this message came and her brows met and her eyes flashed with anger  telling us of her company to follow she went to the fair cross on the bridge where now her image stands fashioned in bronze kneeling before the cross with the king kneeling opposite  there she stood and cried aloud to the english who were in the fort on the other side of the bridge that is called les tourelles and her voice rang across the water like a trumpet so that it was marvel  then came out on to the bridge a great knight and a tall sir william glasdale no bigger man have i seen and i bethought me of goliath in holy scripture  he spoke in a loud northcountry voice and whereas she addressed him courteously as she did all men he called her by the worst of names mocking at her for a ribaulde  she made answer that he lied and that he should die in four days time or five without stroke of sword and so waving her hand haughtily turned and went back  but i who walked close by her noted that she wept like any girl at his evil and lying accusations  next day was sunday and no stroke was struck but the bastard of orleans set forth to bring back the army from blois  and on monday the maid rode out and under the very walls of the english keeps the townsfolk running by her rein as if secure in her company yet no man came forth against them which was marvel  and on the wednesday the maid with many knights rode forth two leagues and met the bastard of orleans and all the array from blois and all the flocks and herds that were sent to orleans by the good towns  right beneath the forts of the english they rode and marched with chanting of hymns priests leading the way but none dared meddle with them  yet a child might have seen that now or never was the chance howbeit talbot and glasdale and scales men well learned in war let fire not even a single cannon  it may be that they feared an attack of the orleans folk on their bastilles if they drew out their men  for to tell the plain truth the english had not menatarms enough for the task they took in hand but they oft achieve much with but little force and so presume the more sometimes to their undoing  and till the maid came ten of them could chase a hundred of the french  so the maid returned leading the army and then being very weary she went into her chamber and lay down on a couch to sleep her esquire daulon also resting in the room where were the lady and a daughter of the house one charlotte boucher  there was i devising idly with her page louis de coutes a boy half scots by birth and goodbrother to messire florent dilliers who had married his sister  but alas he was more french than scots and later he left the maid  but then we were playing ourselves at the door of the house and all was still the menat arms reposing as we deemed after their march  then suddenly the maid ran forth to us her face white and her eyes shining and cried to louis de coutes in great anger  wretched boy the blood of france is being shed and you told me no word of it  demoiselle said he trembling i wotted not of it  what mean you  and i also stood in amaze for we had heard no sound of arms  go fetch my horse she said and was gone  i went with him and we saddled and bridled a fresh courser speedily but when we reached the door she stood there already armed and sprang on the horse crying for her banner that de coutes gave her out of the upper window  then her spurs were in her horses side and the sparks flying from beneath his hoofs as she galloped towards st loup the english fort on the burgundy road  thither we followed her with what speed we might yet over tardily and when we came through crowds of people many bearing the wounded on litters there was she under the wall of that fort in a rain of arrows holding up her banner and crying on the french and scots to the charge  they answered with a cry and went on de coutes and i pressing forward to be with them but ere ever we could gain the fosse the english had been overwhelmed and for the more part slain  for as we found the french captains had commanded an attack on st loup and had told the maid no word of it whether as desiring to win honour without her or to spare her from the peril of the onslaught i know not  but their men were giving ground when by the monition of the saints as i have shown she came to them and turned the fray  of the english as i said most were slain natheless certain men in priests raiment came forth from the church of st loup and very humbly begged their lives of the maid who turning to daulon her esquire bade him with de coutes and me and such men as we could gather to have charge of them and be answerable for them  so while the french were plundering we mustered these priests orderly together they trembling and telling their beads and we stood before them for their guard  false priests i doubt many of them were englishmen who had hastily done on such holy robes as they found in the church of st loup  now louis de coutes being but a boy and of a mad humour cried  cucullus non facit monachum good sirs let us see your reverend tonsures  with that he twitched the hood from the head of a tall cordelier who without more ado felled him to the earth with his fist  the hood was off but for a flash of time yet i saw well the shining wolfs eyes and the long dark face of brother thomas  so in the pictures of the romance of renard fox have i seen isengrim the wolf in the friars hood  felon and traitor i cried and drawing my sword was about to run him through the body when my hand was stunned by a stroke and the sword dropped from it  i turned in great anger and saw the maid her sword in her hand wherewith she had smitten me flatlings and not with the edge  knave of a scot she cried wouldst thou strike a holy man and my prisoner  verily they say well that the scots are all savages  begone home till i speak with the captains about thy case  and for these holy men she said to daulon in a soft voice see that they are safely housed and ministered to in the church of monseigneur st aignan  with that i shrank back like a beaten hound and saw the maid no more that night as fearing her wrath  so was i adread and out of all comfort  but when first i might i sought daulon and told him all the tale of brother thomas and all the evil i knew of him as well as i could and i showed him wherefore i had sought to slay the man as forsworn and a traitor who had manifestly fled to the english being by his doggish nature the enemy of the maid  i so wrought with him though he was weary and would scarce listen to my tale that he promised to speak for me to the maid without whom i was a man lost  moreover he swore that as early as might be he would visit the church of st aignan and there examine into the matter of this cordelier whom some knew and could testify against if he was my man  no more could i do that night but next morning daulon awoke me a little after dawn  it is a true tale he said and worse than i deemed for your bird has flown  last night he so spoke with me in the church when i lodged him there that i reckoned him a simple man and a pious  but he has vanished from among his brethren none knows how or whither  the devil his master knows i said  faith he has a shrewd care of his own  but this i misdoubt me is the beginning of evil to us and to the maid  a knave more or less is of little count in the world said he but now i must make your peace with the maid for she speaks of no less than sending you forth from her household  his promise he kept so wellfor he was a very honourable man as any in francethat the maid sent for me and showed me the best countenance even begging my pardon with all sweetness and in so fair a manner that i could have wept  it was my first blow in war she said smiling kindly as was her manner and i hope to strike no more as with my own hand wherefore i carry my banner to avoid the slaying of men  but verily i deemed that you were about stabbing my prisoner and him a priest  belike we shall hear no more of him and i misdoubt that he is no true son of holy church  today let me see you bear yourself as boldly against armed men that i may report well of you to your lady and my friend  therewith she held out her hands and took mine as frankly as does one brother in arms with another  and i kissed her hand and kept my tears in my own heart  but no deadlier blow for france and for herself was ever dealt than when the maid struck down my sword that was thirsting for the blood of brother thomas and was within an inch of his throat often have i marvelled how the saints who as then guarded her gave her no warning as they did of the onslaught on st loup but it might not be or it was not their will to which we must humbly submit ourselves  and now i think i see that wolfs face under the hood with anger and fear in the ominous eyes  in the church of st loup we found him and he was a wolf of the holy places  none the less the words of the maid brought more keenly to my mind the thought of elliot whom in these crowded hours between my sorrow and anger and fear of the maids wrath i had to some degree forgotten  they were now ordering an onslaught on a post of the english beyond the river and there came into my heart that verse of the book of a hundred ballades how a lover must press into breach and mine and escalade to win advancement and his ladys favour and i swore within myself that today i would be among the foremost     chapter xiiiof the fighting at les augustins and the prophecy of the maid   just above the broken bridge of orleans there is a broad island lying very near the opposite shore with a narrow swift passage of water between bank and island  some two furlongs higher up the river and on the further bank the english had built a small fort named st jean le blanc to guard the road and thither they sent men from les augustins the plan of our captains was to cross by boats on to the island and thence by a bridge of planks laid on boats to win over the narrow channel and so make an onslaught on st jean le blanc  for this onslaught the maid had now been armed by her women and with all her company and many knights was making ready to cross  but before she or we with her could attain the shore horses being ill beasts in a boat ferry the lightarmed townsfolk had crossed over against st jean le blanc to spy on it and had found the keep empty for the english had drawn back their men to the bastille of les augustins  thus there was no more to do for the captains deemed not that we were of any avail to attack les augustins  they were retreating then to the bridge of boats and messires de gaucourt de villars and other good knights were guarding the retreat all orderly lest the english might sally out from les augustins and taking us in the rear might slay many in the confusion of crossing the boatbridge when the maid and la hire by great dint of toil passed their horses in a ferryboat on to the further bank  at this moment the english sallied forth with loud cries from les augustins and were falling on our men who fearing to be cut off began to flee disorderly while the english called out ill words as cowards and ribaulds and were blaspheming god that he should damn all frenchmen  hereon the maid with her banner and la hire with lance in rest they two alone spurred into the press and now her banner was tossing like the flag of a ship in the breakers and methought there was great jeopardy lest they should be taken  but the other french and scots perceiving the banner in such a peril turned again from their flight and men who once turn back to blows again are ill to deal with  striking then and crying montjoie st denis and st andrew for scotland they made the english give ground till they were within the palisade of les augustins where they deemed them safe enough  now i had struggled through the throng on the island some flying some advancing as each mans heart bade him till i leaped into the water up to my waist and won the land  there i was running to the front of the fight when daulon would have stopped me for he had a command to hold a certain narrow way lest the english should drive us to the water again  all this was rightly done but i hearing the cry of st andrew was as one possessed and paying no heed to daulon was for thrusting me forward when a certain spaniard alphonse de partada caught me by the arm and told me with an oath that i might well bide where better men than i were content to be  at this i made answer that my place was with the maid and as for better men bigger he might well be but i for one was not content to look on idly where blows were being dealt  he answered in such terms that i bade him follow me and see which of us would fare furthest into the press  and for that you may be swifter of foot than i as you have longer legs i cried clasp hands on this bargain and let us reach the palisades with the same step  to this he agreed and daulon not refusing permission for he loved to look on a vaillance we clasping hands ran together swiftly and struck our swords in the same moment against the wooden fence  a little opening there was not yet closed or he that kept it deemed he might win more honour by holding it with his body  he was a great knight and tall well armed the red cross of st george on his breast and he fought with a mighty sword  together then we made at him two to one as needs must be for this was no gentle passage of arms but open battle  one sweep of his sword i made shift to avoid but the next lighting on my salade drove me staggering back for more yards than two or three and i reeled and fell on my hands  when i rose alphonse de partada was falling beneath a swordstroke and i was for running forward again but lo the great english knight leaped in the air and so turning fell on his face his hands grasping at the ground and his feet kicking  later i heard from daulon that he had bidden john the lorrainer mark the man with his couleuvrine for that he did overmuch mischief  but thinking of nought save to be foremost in the breach i ran in stumbling over the dead mans body and shouldered at the same time by alphonse who warded off a stab of a pike that was dealt at me  then it was a fair mellay our men pressing after us through the gap and driving us forward by mere weight of onset they coming with all speed against our enemies that ran together from all parts of the keep and so left bare the further wall  it was body to body weight against weight short strokes at close quarters and over our heads bills striking and foining at the english  each man smote where he could we wavered and swayed now off our feet in the press now making some yard of ground and evil was the smell and thick the dust that arose  meanwhile came the sound of the riving of planks from the other side of the palisade above the steel points and the dust i saw the maids pennon advancing with the face of my lady painted thereon and i pressed towards it crying st andrew with such breath as was in me  then rang out the maids voice like a clarion st denis and so stroke echoing stroke and daggers going at close quarters beaten on and blinded deaf and breathless now up now down we staggered forward till i and the maid stood side by side and the english broke some falling some flying to the outgate  and when all was done there was i knowing little enough of what had come and gone dazed with my sword bloody and bent my head humming and my foot on the breast of an english knight one robert heron  him i took to prisoner rescue or no rescue and so sat we down very weary in the midst of blood and broken arms for many had been slain and a few taken though the more part had fled into the boulevard of les tourelles  and here with a joyous face and the vizor of her helm raised stood the maid her sword sheathed waving her banner in the sight of the english that were on the bridge fort  natheless her joy was but for a moment and soon was she seated lowly on the ground holding in her arms the head of an english knight sore wounded for whom her confessor father pasquerel was doing the offices of religion  tears were running down her cheeks even as if he had been one of her own people and so comforting and helping the wounded as she might she abode till the darkness came and the captains had made shift to repair the fortress and had set guards all orderly  and all the river was dark with boats coming and going their lanterns glittering on the stream and they were laden with food and munitions of war  in one of these boats did the maid cross the river taking with her us of her company and speaking to me above others in the most gracious manner for that i had been the first with that spanish gentleman to pass within the english palisade  and now my heart was light though my flesh was very weary for that i had done my devoir and taken the firstfruits of elliots wedding portion  no heavy ransom i put on that knight sir robert heron and it was honourably paid in no long time though he ill liked yielding him to one that had not gained his spurs  but it was fortune of war  so half in a dream we reached our house and there was the greatest concourse of townsfolk clamouring in the praise of the maid who showed herself to them from the window and promised that tomorrow they should take les tourelles  that night was friday yet so worn were we all that the maid bade us sup and herself took some meat and a little wine in her water though commonly she fasted on friday  and now we were about to boun us for bed and the maid had risen and was standing with her arms passed about the neck of the daughter of the house a fair lass and merry called charlotte boucher who always lay with her for she had great joy to be with girls of her own age when there came the sound of a daggerhilt beating at the door  we opened and there stood a tall knight who louted low to the maid cap in hand and she bade him drink to the taking of les tourelles that should be tomorrow  but he with the flagon full in his hands and withal a thirsty look upon his face shook his head  to another pledge maiden i will gladly drink namely to the bravest damsel under the sky  and therewith he drank deep  but now i am sent from gaucourt and the bastard for all the captains are in counsel again  and they bid me tell you that enough hath been done and they are right well content  but we are few against so great a host in a place so strong that men may not avail to master it by main force  the city is now well seen in all manner of victual moreover we can now come and go by sologne and the left bank  the skill is therefore to hold the city till the english wax weary and depart or till we have succour anew from the king  therefore tomorrow the menatarms shall take rest having great need thereof and therefore gentle maid pardon me that i drank not to the pledge which a lady called  then he drained the flagon  the maid holding the girl charlotte yet closer to her smote her right hand on the table so that it dirled and the cups and dishes leaped  you have been with your counsel she cried and i have been with mine the counsel of messire will stand fast and prevail and yours shall perish for it is of men  go back and bear my words to the captains quoth she and then turning to us who looked on her in amazement she said  do ye all rise right early and more than ye have done today shall ye do  keep ever close by me in the mellay for tomorrow i shall have much to do and more than ever yet i did  and tomorrow shall my blood leap from my body above my breast for an arrow shall smite here and she struck the place with her hand  thereon the knight seeing that she was not to be moved made his obeisance and went back to them that sent him and all we lay down to sleep while we might  these words of the maid i norman leslie heard and bear record that they are true     chapter xivof the fighting at the bridge and of the prize won by norman leslie from the river   on that night i slept soft and woke oft being utterly foredone  in the grey dawn i awoke and gave a little cough when lo there came a hot sweet gush into my mouth and going to the window i saw that i was spitting of blood belike from my old wound  it is a strange thing that therewith a sickness came over me and a cold fit as of fear though fear i had felt none where men met in heat of arms  none the less seeing that today or never i was to be made or marred i spoke of the matter neither to man nor woman but drinking a long draught of very cold water i spat some deal more and then it stanched and i armed me and sat down on my bed  my thoughts as i waited for the first stir in the house were not glad birds were singing in the garden trees all else was quiet as if men were not waking to slay each other and pass unconfessed to their account there came on me a great sickness of war  yesterday the boulevard of les augustins when the fight was over had been a shambles white bodies that had been stripped of their armour lay here and there like sheep on a hillside and were now smirched with dust a thing unseemly  i put it to myself that i was engaged if ever man was in a righteous quarrel fighting against cruel oppression and i was under the protection of one sent as i verily believed by heaven  but blood runs tardy in the cold dawn my thoughts were chilled and i deemed to speak sooth that i carried my death within me from my old wound and even if unhurt could scarce escape out of that days labour and live  i said farewell to life and the sun in my own mind and to elliot thinking of whom with what tenderness she had nursed me and of her mirth and pitiful heart i could scarce forbear from weeping  of my brother also i thought and in death it seemed to me that we could scarcely be divided  then my thought went back to old days of childhood at pitcullo old wanderings by eden banks old kindness and old quarrels and i seemed to see a vision of a great tree growing alone out of a little mound by my fathers door where robin and i would play willie wastle in his castle for that was our first manner of holding a siege a manatarms has little to make with such fancies and well i wot that randal rutherford troubled himself therewith in no manner  but now there came an iron footstep on the stairs and the maids voice rang clear and presently there arose the sound of hammers on rivets and all the din of men saddling horses and sharpening swords so i went forth to join my company  stiff and sore was i and felt as if i could scarce raise my swordarm but the sight of the maid all gleaming in her harness and clear of voice and swift of deed like st michael when he marshalled his angels against the enemies of heaven drove my brooding thoughts clean out of mind  the sun shone yellow and slanting down the streets out of the shadow of the minster came the bells ringing for war  the armed townsfolk thronged the ways and one man old and illclad brought to the maid a great fish which he had caught overnight in the loire  our host prayed her to wait till it should be cooked that she might breakfast well for she had much to do  yet she who scarce seemed to live by earthly meat but by the will of god took only a sop of bread dipped in wine and gaily leaping to her selle and gathering the reins as a lady bound for a hunting where no fear was she cried keep the fish for supper when i will bring back a goddon 25 prisoner to eat his part  and tonight gentle sir my host i will return by the bridgewhich as we deemed might in no manner be for an arch of the bridge was broken  thereon we all mounted and rode down to the burgundy gate the women watching us and casting flowers before the maiden  but when we won the gate behold it was locked and two ranks of menatarms with lances levelled wearing the colours of the sieur de gaucourt were drawn up before it  that lord himself in harness but bareheaded stood before his men and cried hereby is no passage  to day the captains give command that no force stir from the town  today quoth the maid shall we take les tourelles and tomorrow not a goddon save prisoners and slain men shall be within three leagues of orleans  gentle sir bid open the gate for today have i work to do  thereat gaucourt shook his head and from the multitude of townsfolk rose one great angry shout  they would burn the gate they cried they would fire the town but they would follow the maid and the guidance of the saints  thereon stones began to fly and arbalests were bended till the maid turned and facing the throng her banner lifted as in anger  back my good friends and people of orleans she said back and open the postern door in the great tower on the river wall  by one way or another shall i meet the english this day nor shall might of man prevent me  then many ran back and soon came the cry that the postern was opened and thither streamed the throng  therefore gaucourt saw well that an onslaught would verily be made moreover as a man wise in war he knew that the townsfolk that day would be hard to hold and would go far  so he even yielded not ungraciously and sending a messenger to the bastard and the captains he rode forth from the burgundy gate by the side of the maid  he was indeed little minded to miss his part of the honour nor were the other captains more backward for scarce had we taken boat and reached the farther bank when we saw the banners of the bastard and la hire florent dilliers and xaintrailles chambers and kennedy above the heads of the armed men who streamed forth by the gate of burgundy  less orderly was no fight ever begun but the saints were of our party  it was the wise manner of the maid to strike swift blow upon blow each stroke finding less resistance among the enemy that had been used to a laggard war for then it was the manner of captains to dally for weeks or months round a town castle or other keep and the skill was to starve the enemy  but the manner of the maid was ever to send cloud upon cloud of men to make escalade by ladders their comrades aiding them from under cover with fire of couleuvrines and bows  even so fought that famed knight of brittany sir bertrand du guesclin  but he was long dead and whether the maid who honoured his memory greatly fought as she did through his example or by direct teaching of the saints i know not  if disorderly we began the fault was soon amended they who had beleaguered the boulevard all night were set in the rear to rest out of shot the fresh men were arrayed under their banners in vineyards and under the walls of fields so that if one company was driven back another was ready to come on that the english might have no repose from battle  now the manner of the boulevard was this first there was a strong palisade and many men mustered within it then came a wide deep dry fosse then a strong wall of earth bound in with withes and palisaded and within it the gate of the boulevard  when that was won and the boulevard taken men defending it might flee across a drawbridge over a stream narrow and deep and swift into les tourelles itself  here they were safe from them on the side of orleans by reason of the broken arch of the bridge  so strong was this tower that monseigneur the duc dalencon visiting it later said he could have staked his duchy on his skill to hold it for a week at least with but few men against all the forces in france  the captain of the english was that glasdale who had reviled the maid and concerning whom she had prophesied that he should die without stroke of sword  there was no fiercer squire in england and his men were like himself being picked and chosen for that post moreover their backs were at the wall for the french and scots once within the boulevard it was in nowise easy for talbot to bring the english a rescue as was seen  the battle began with shooting of couleuvrines at the palisade to weaken it and it was marvel to see how the maid herself laid the guns as cunningly as her own countryman the famed lorrainer  now when there was a breach in the palisade xaintrailles led on his company splendid in armour for he was a very brave young knight  we saw the pales fall with a crash and the men go in and heard the cry of battle but slowly one by one they staggered back some falling some reeling wounded and rolling their bodies out of arrowshot  and there in the breach shone the backplate of xaintrailles his axe falling and rising and not one foot he budged till the men of la hire with a cry broke in to back him and after a little space swords fell and rose no more but we saw the banners waving of xaintrailles and la hire  soon the side of the palisade towards us was all down as if one had swept it flat with his hand but there stood the earthen wall of the boulevard beyond the fosse  then all orderly marched forth a band of men in the colours of florent dilliers bearing scalingladders and so began the escalade their friends backing them by shooting of arbalests from behind the remnant of the palisade  a ladder would be set against the wall and we could see men with shields or doors or squares of wood on their heads to fend off stones swarm up it and axes flashing on the crest of the wall and arrows flying and smoke of guns but the smoke cleared and lo the ladder was gone and the three libbards grinned on the flag of england  so went the war company after company staggering thinned from the fosse and reforming behind the cover of the vineyards company after company marching forth fresh and glorious to fare as their friends had fared  and ever with each company went the maid at their head and daulon she crying that the place was theirs and now was the hour  but the day went by till the sun turned in heaven towards evening and no more was done  the english in sooth showed no fear nor faint heart with axe and sword and mace and with their very hands they smote and grappled with the climbers and i saw a tall man his sword being broken strike down a french knight with his mailed fist and drag another from a ladder and take him captive  boldly they showed themselves on the crest running all risk of our arrows as our men did of theirs  now came the scots under kennedy  a gallant sight it was to see them advance shoulder to shoulderscots of the marches and the lennox fife argyll and the isles all gentlemen born  come on cried randal rutherford  come on men of the marches scots of the forest elliots rutherfords armstrongs and deem that wheresoever a southron slinks behind a stone there is carlisle wall  the rough clan roared bellenden the buchanans cried clare innis a rag of a hairy highlander from the lennox blew a wild skirl on the war pipes and hearing the border slogan shouted in a strange country nom dieu my blood burned as that of any scotsman would  contrary to the maids desire for she had noted that i was wan and weary and had commanded me to bide in cover i cried a leslie a leslie and went forward with my own folk sword in hand and buckler lifted  beside good randal rutherford i ran and we both leaped together into the ditch  there was a forest of ladders set against the wall and i had my foot on a rung when the maid ran up and cried nom dieu what make you here  let me lead my scots and so pennon and axe in her left hand she lightly leaped on the ladder and arrows ringing on her mail and a great stone glancing harmless from her salade she so climbed that my ladys face on the pennon above her looked down into the english keep  but even then i saw a face at an archere an ill face and fell the wolfs eyes of brother thomas glancing along the stock of an arbalest  gardezvous pucelle gardezvous i cried in her ear for i was next her on the ladder but a bolt whistled and smote her full and reeling she fell into my arms  i turned my back to guard her and felt a bolt strike my backpiece then we were in the fosse and all the scots that might be were between her and harm  swiftly they bore her out of the fray into a little green vineyard where was a soft grassy ditch  but the english so cried their hurrah that it was marvel and our men gave back in fear and had not the bastard come up with a fresh company verify we might well have been swept into the loire  some while i remained with rutherford kennedy and many others for what could we avail to help the maid and to run has an ill look and gives great heart to an enemy  moreover that saying of the maid came into my mind that she should be smitten of a bolt but not unto death  so i even abode by the fosse and having found an arbalest my desire was to win a chance of slaying brother thomas wherefore i kept my eyes on that archere whence he had shot  but no arbalest was pointed thence and the fight flagged  on both sides men were weary and they took some meat as they might no ladders being now set on the wall  then i deemed it no harm to slip back to the vineyard where the maid lay and there i met the good father pasquerel that was her confessor  he told me that now she was quiet either praying or asleep for he had left her as still as a babe in its cradle her page watching her  the bolt had sped by a rivet of her breastpiece clean through her breast hard below the shoulder and it stood a handbreadth out beyond  then she had wept and trembled seeing her own blood but presently with such might and courage as was marvel she had dragged out the bolt with her own hands  then they had laid on the wound cotton steeped with olive oil for she would not abide that they should steep the bolt with weapon salve and charm the hurt with a song as the soldiers desired  then she had confessed herself to pasquerel and so had lain down among the grass and the flowers  but it was pasquerels desire to let ferry her across secretly to orleans  this was an ill hearing for me yet it was put about in the army that the maid had but taken a slight scratch and again would lead us on a thing which i well deemed to be impossible  so the day waxed late and few onslaughts were made and these with no great heart the english standing on the walls and openly mocking us  they asked how it went with the maid and whether she would not fain be at home among her kine or in the greasy kitchen  we would cry back and for my own part i bade them seek the kitchen as pockpuddings and belly gods and that i cried in their own tongue while they to my great amaze called me prentice boy and jackanapes  herein i saw the craft and devilish enmity of brother thomas and well i guessed that he had gotten sight of me but his face i saw not  ill names break no bones and arrows from under cover wrought slight scathe so one last charge the bastard commanded and led himself and a sore tussle there was that time on the wallcrest one or two of our men leaping into the fort whence they came back no more  now it was eight hours of the evening the sky grey the men outworn and out of all heart and the captains were gathered in council  of this i conceived the worst hope for after a counsel men seldom fight  so i watched the fort right sullenly and the town of orleans looking black against a red lowering sky in the west  some concourse of townsfolk i saw on the bridge beside the broken arch and by the boulevard belle croix but i deemed that they had only come to see the fray as near as might be  others were busy under the river wall with a great black boat belike to ferry over the horses from our side  all seemed ended and i misdoubted that we would scarce charge again so briskly in the morning nay we might well have to guard our own gates  as i sat thus pondering by the vineyard ditch the maid stood by me suddenly  her helmet was off her face deadly white her eyes like two stars  bring me my horse she said so sternly that i crushed the answer on my lips and the prayer that she would risk herself no more  her horse that had been cropping the grass near him happily enough i found and brought to her and so with some ado she mounted and rode at a foots pace to the little crowd of captains  maiden ma mie said the bastard  glad i am to see you able to mount we have taken counsel to withdraw for this night  martin he said to his trumpeter sound the recall  i pray you sir she said very humbly grant me but a little while and so saying she withdrew alone from the throng of men into the vineyard  what passed therein i know not and no man knows but in a quarter of an hours space she came forth like another woman her face bright and smiling her cheeks like the dawn and so beautiful that we marvelled on her with reverence as if we had seen an angel  the place is ours she cried again and spurred towards the fosse thence her banner had never gone back for daulon held it there to be a terror to the english  even at that moment he had given it to a certain basque a very brave man for he himself was outworn with its weight and he had challenged the basque to do a vaillance or boastful deed of arms as yesterday i and the spaniard had done  so daulon leaped into the fosse his shield up defying the english but the basque did not follow for the maid seeing her banner in the hands of a man whom she knew not laid hold of it crying ha mon estandart mon estandart  there as they struggled for it the basque being minded to follow daulon to the wall foot the banner wildly waved and all men saw it and rallied and flocked amain to the rescue  charge cried the maid  forward french and scots the place is yours when once my banner fringe touches the wall  with that word the wind blew out the banner fringe and so suddenly that though i saw the matter i scarce knew how it was done the whole host swarmed up and on ladders lifted and so furiously went they that they won the wall crest and leaped within the fort  then the more part of the english adread as i think at the sight of the maid whom they had deemed slain fled madly over the drawbridge into les tourelles  then standing on the wall crest whither i had climbed i beheld strange sights  first through the dimness of the dusk i saw a man armed walking as does a ropedancer balancing himself with his spear across the empty air for so it seemed above the broken arch of the bridge this appeared in very sooth to be a miracle but gazing longer i saw that a great beam had been laid by them of orleans to span the gap and now other beams were being set and many men bearing torches were following that good knight nicole giresme who first showed the way over such a bridge of dread  so now were the english in les tourelles between two fires  another strange sight i saw for in that swift and narrow stream which the drawbridge spanned whereby the english fled was moored a great black barge its stem and stern showing on either side of the bridge  boats were being swiftly pulled forth from it into the stream and as i gazed there leaped up through the dark one long tongue of fire  then i saw the skill of it namely to burn down the drawbridge and so cut the english off from all succour  fed with pitch and pine the flame soared lustily and now it shone between the planks of the drawbridge  on the stone platform of the boulevard wherein the drawbridge was laid stood a few english and above them shone the axe of a tall squire glasdale as it fell on shield and helm of the french  others held us at bay with long lances and never saw i any knight do his devoir more fiercely than he who had reviled the maid  for on his head lay all the blame of the taking of the boulevard  to rear of him rang the shouts of them of orleans who had crossed the broken arch by the beam but he never turned about and our men reeled back before him  then there shone behind him the flames from the blazing barge and so black against that blaze he smote and slew not knowing that the drawbridge began to burn  on this the maid ran forth and cried to him  rendstoi rendstoi  yield thee glacidas yield thee for i stand in much sorrow for thy souls sake  then falling on her knees her face shining transfigured in that fierce light she prayed him thus  ah glacidas thou didst call me ribaulde but i have sorrow for thy soul  ah yield thee yield thee to ransom and the tears ran down her cheeks as if a saint were praying for a soul in peril  not one word spoke glasdale he neither saw nor heard  but the levelled spears at his side flew up a flame caught his crest making a plume of fire and with a curse he cast his axe among the throng and the man who stood in front of it got his death  glasdale turned about as he threw he leaped upon the burning drawbridge where the last of his men were huddled in flight and lo beneath his feet it crashed down he plunged through smoke and flame and the stream below surged up as bridge and flying men went under in one ruin  the maid gave a cry that rang above the roar of fire and water  saints will no man save him she shrieked looking all around her on the faces of the french  a mad thought leaped up in my mind  unharness me i cried and one who stood by me undid the clasps of my light jaseran  i saw a head unhelmeted i saw a hand that clutched at a floating beam  i thought of the maids desire and of the ransom of so great a squire as glasdale and then i threw my hands up to dive and leaped head foremost into the water  deep down i plunged and swam far under water to avoid a stroke from floating timber and then i rose and glanced upstream  all the air was fiercely lit with the blaze of the burning barge a hand and arm would rise and fall ere i could seize it  a hand was thrown up before me the glinting fingers gripping at empty air  i caught the hand swimming strongly with the current for so the man could not clutch at me and if a drowning man can be held apart it is no great skill to save him  in this art i was not unlearned and once had even saved two men from a wrecked barque in the long surf of st andrews bay  save for a blow from some great floating timber i deemed that i had little to fear nay now i felt sure of the maids praise and of a rich ransom  a horn of bank with alder bushes ran out into the stream a smooth eddy or backwater curling within  i caught a bough of alder and though nigh carried down by the drowning mans weight i found bottom yet hardly and drew my man within the backwater  he lay like a log his face in the stream  pushing him before me i rounded the horn and with much ado dragged him up to a sloping gravelly beach where i got his head on dry land his legs being still in the water  i turned him over and looked eagerly  lo it was no glasdale but the drowned face of brother thomas  then something seemed to break in my breast blood gushed from my mouth and i fell on the sand and gravel  footsteps i heard of men running to us  i lifted my hand faintly and waved it and then i felt a hand on my face     chapter xvhow norman leslie was absolved by brother thomas   certain scots that found me weak and bleeding by the riverside were sent by the maid in hopes that i had saved glasdale whereas it was the accursed cordelier i had won from the water  what they did with him i knew not then but me they laid on a litter and so bore me to a boat wherein they were ferrying our wounded men across to orleans  the maid herself as she had foretold returned by way of the bridge that was all bright with moving torches as our groaning company were rowed across the black water to a quay  thence i was carried in a litter to our lodgings and so got to bed a physician doing what he might for me  a noisy night we passed for i verily believe that no man slept but all after service held in the church of st aignan went revelling and drinking from house to house and singing through the streets as folk saved from utter destruction  with daybreak fell a short silence short or long it seemed brief to me who was now asleep at last and i was rueful enough when a sound aroused me and i found the maid herself standing by my bedside with one in the shadow behind her  the chamber was all darkling lit only by a thread of light that came through the closed shutters of wood and fell on her pale face  she was clad in a light jaseran of mail because of her wound and was plainly eager to be gone and about her business that is to meet the english in open field  leslie my friend she said in her sweet voice there were many brave men in the fight yesterday but in gods name none did a braver deed than thou  nay speak not she said as i opened my lips to thank her for the leech that tended thee last night forbids it on peril of thy very life  so i have brought thee here a sheet of fair paper and a pen and horn of ink that thou being a clerk mayst write what thou hast to say  alas such converse is not for me who know not a from his brother b  but the saints who helped thee have rewarded thee beyond all expectation  thou didst not save that unhappy glacidas whom god in his mercy forgive but thou hast taken a goodlier prizethis holy man that had been prisoner in the hands of the english  here she stood a little aside and the thread of light shone on the fell face of brother thomas lowering beneath his hood  then i would have spoken leech or no leech to denounce him for the maid had no memory of his face and knew him not for the false friar taken at st loup  but she laid her mailed finger gently on my lips  silence  thou art my manatarms and must obey thy captain  this worthy friar hath been long in the holy company of the blessed colette and hath promised to bring me acquainted with that daughter of god  ay and he hath given to me unworthy as i am a kerchief which has touched her wonderworking hands  almost i believe that it will heal thee by miracle if the saints are pleased to grant it  herewith she drew a kerchief across my lips and i began being most eager to instruct her innocence as to this accursed man  lady but alas no miracle was wrought for a sinner like me  howbeit i am inclined to believe that the kerchief was no saintly thing and had never come near the body of the blessed colette but rather was a gift from one of the cordeliers lightoloves  assuredly it was stained red with blood from my lungs ere i could utter two words  the maid stanched the blood saying  did i not bid thee to be silent  the saints forgive my lack of faith whereby this blessed thing has failed to heal thee  and now i must be gone to face the english in the field if they dare to meet us which methinks they will not do but rather withdraw as speedily as they may so now i leave thee with this holy man to be thy nursetender and thou canst write to him concerning thy needs for doubtless he is a clerk farewell  with that she was gone and this was the last i saw of her for many a day  never have i known such a horror of fear as fell on me now helpless and dumb a sheep given over to the slaughter in that dark chamber which was wondrous lown 26 alone with my deadly foe  never had any man more cause for dread for i was weak and to resist him was death  i was speechless and could utter no voice that the people in the house might hear  as for mine enemy he had always loathed and scorned me he had a long account of vengeance to settle with me and ifwhich was not to be thought ofhe was minded to spare one that had saved his life yet for his own safety he dared not  he had beguiled the maid with his false tongue and his face not seen by her in the taking of st loup she knew not  but he knew that i would disclose all the truth so soon as the maid returned wherefore he was bound to destroy me which he would assuredly do with every mockery cruelty and torture of body and mind  merely to think of him when he was absent was wont to make my flesh creep so entirely evil beyond the nature of sinful mankind was this monster and so set on working all kinds of mischief with greediness  whether he had suffered some grievous wrong in his youth which he spent his life in avenging on all folk or whether as i deem likely he was the actual emissary of satan as the maid was of the saints i know not and as i lay there had no wits left to consider of it  only i knew that no more unavailing victim than i was ever so utterly in the power of a foe so deadly and terrible  the maid had gone and all hope had gone with her  for a time that seemed unending mine enemy neither spoke nor moved standing still in the chink of light a devil where an angel had been  there was silence and i heard the maids iron tread pass down the creaking wooden stairs and soon i heard the sound of singing birds for my window looked out on the garden  the steps ceased and then there was a low grating laughter in the dark room as if the devil laughed  brother thomas moved stealthily to the door and thrust in the wooden bolt  then he sat him heavily down on my bed and put his fiends face close to mine his eyes stabbing into my eyes  but i bit my lip and stared right back into his yellow wolfs eyes that shone like flames of the pit with evil and cruel thoughts  so i lay with that yellow light on me and strength came strangely to me and i prayed that since die i must i might at least gladden him with no sign of fear  when he found that he could not daunton me he laughed again  our chick of pitcullo has picked up a spirit in the wars he said and turning his back on me he leaned his face on his hand and so sat thinking  the birds of may sang in the garden there was a faint shining of silver and green from the appleboughs and buds without in the little chamber and the hooded back of the cordelier was before me on my bed like the shape of death beside the sick man in a picture  now i did not even pray i waited  doubtless he knew that no cruel thing which the devil could devise was more cruel than this suspense  then he turned about and faced me grinning like a dog  these are good words said he in that foolish old book they read to the faithful in the churches vengeance is mine saith the lord  ay it is even too sweet a morsel for us poor christian men such as the lowly brother thomas of the order of st francis  nevertheless i am minded to put my teeth in it and he bared his yellow dogs fangs at me smiling like a hungry hound  my sick brother he went on both as one that has some science of leechcraft and as thy ghostly counsellor it is my duty to warn thee that thou art now very near thine end  nay let me feel thy pulse and seizing my left wrist he grasped it lightly in his iron fingers  now ere i administer to thee thy due as a christian man let me hear thy parting confession  but alas as the blessed maid too truly warned thee thou must not open thy poor lips in speech  there is death in a word  write then write the story of thy sinful life that i may give thee absolution  so saying he opened the shutter and carefully set the paper and inkhorn before me putting the pen in my fingers  now write what i shall tell thee and here he so pressed and wrung my wrist that his fingers entered into my living flesh with a fiery pang  i writhed but i did not cry  write  i norman leslie of pitcullo and to escape that agony i wrote as he bade me  being now in the article of death  and i wrote  do attest on my hope of salvation  and i wrote  and do especially desire madame jeanne la pucelle and all frenchmen and scots loyal to our sovereign lord the dauphin to accept my witness that brother thomas of the order of st francis called noiroufle while of the world has been most falsely and treacherously accused by me  i wrote but i wrote not his false words putting my own in their placehas been most truly and righteously accused by me  of divers deeds of black treason and dealing with our enemies of england against our lord the dauphin and the maid the sister of the saints and of this i heartily repent me  but i wrote all which i maintain  as may god pardon my sins on the faith of a sinful and dying man  now sign thy name and that of thy worshipful cabbagegarden and dunghill in filthy scotland  so i signed norman leslie the younger of pitcullo and added the place orleans with the date of day and year of our lord namely may the eighth fourteen hundred and twentynine  a very laudable confession quoth brother thomas would that all the sinners whom i have absolved as i am about to absolve thee had cleansed and purged their sinful souls as freely  and now my brother read aloud to me this scroll nay methinks it is ill for thy health to speak or read  a sad matter is this for in faith i have forgotten my clergy myself and thou mayst have beguiled me by inditing other matter than i have put into thy lying mouth  still where the safety of a soul is concerned a few hours more or less of this vain perishable life weigh but as dust in the balance  here he took from about his hairy neck a heavy italian crucifix of black wood whereon was a figure of our lord wrought in white enamel with golden nails and a golden crown of thorns  now read he whispered heaving up the crucifix above me  and as he lifted it a bright blade strong narrow and sharp leaped out from beneath the feet of our lord and glittered within an inch of my throat an emblem of this false friar it was the outside of whom was as that of a holy man while within he was a murdering sword  read he whispered again pricking my throat with the daggers point  then i read aloud and as i read i was half choked with my blood and now and then was stopped but still he cried  read and if one word is wrong thine absolution shall come all the swifter  so i read and may i be forgiven if i sinned in deceiving one so vile  i uttered not what i had written but what he had bidden me to write  i norman leslie of pitcullo being now in the article of death do attest on my hope of salvation and do especially desire madame jeanne la pucelle and all frenchmen and scots loyal to our sovereign lord the dauphin to accept my witness that brother thomas of the order of st francis called noiroufle while of the world has been most falsely and treacherously accused by me of divers deeds of black treason and dealing with our enemies of england against our lord the dauphin and the maid the sister of the saints and of this i heartily repent me as may god pardon my sins on the faith of a sinful and dying man  signed at orleans norman leslie the younger of pitcullo this eighth of may in the year of our lord fourteen hundred and twentynine  when i had ended he took away his blasphemous daggerpoint from my throat  very clerkly read he spake and all runs smooth methinks myself had been no poor scribe were i but a clerk  hadst thou written other matter to betray my innocence thou couldst not remember what i said even word for word he added gleefully  now i might strangle thee slowly and he set his fingers about my throat i being too weak to do more than clutch at his hand with a grasp like a babes  but that leaves black fingermarks another kind of witness than thine in my favour  or i might give thee the blade of this blessed crucifix yet dagger wounds are like lips and have a voice and blood cries from the ground says holy writ  pardon my tardiness my poor brother but this demands deep thought and holy offices must not be hurried unseemly  he sat now with his back to me his hand still on my throat so deep in thought that he heard not as did my sharpened ears a door shut softly and footfalls echoing in the house below  if i could only cry aloud but he would stifle me ere the cry reached my throat  this will serve he said  thou wilt have died of thy malady and i will go softly forth and with hushed voice will tell how the brave young scot passed quietly to the saints  yet after all i know not  thou hast been sent by heaven to my aid clearly thou art an instrument of god to succour the unworthy brother thomas  once and twice thou hast been a boat to carry me on my way and to save my useful life  a third time thou mightst well be serviceable not by thy will alas but by gods my poor brother and he mockingly caressed my face with his abhorred hand still this must even serve though i would fain find for thee a more bitter way to death and he gently and carefully drew the pillow from beneath my head  this leaves no marks and tells no tales and permits no dying cry  he was looking at me the pillow in his hands his gesture that of a tender nurse when a light tap sounded on the door  he paused then came a louder knock one pushed and knocked again  open in the name of the dauphin came a voice i knew well the voice of daulon  the rope of judas strangle thee said brother thomas dropping the pillow and turning to the casement  but it was heavily barred with stanchions of iron as the manner is and thereby he might not flee  then came fiercer knocking with a dagger hilt and the cry open in the name of the dauphin or we burst the door  brother thomas hastily closed the wooden shutter to darken the chamber as much as might be  gently gently he said  disturb not my penitent who is newly shrived and about to pass and so speaking he withdrew the bolt  daulon strode in dagger in hand followed by the physician  what make you here with doors barred false priest he said laying his hand on the frock of noiroufle  and what make you here fair squire with arms in a sick mans chamber and loud words to disturb the dying  and wherefore callest thou me false priest  but an hour agone the blessed maid herself brought me hither to comfort and absolve her follower to tend him if he lived and if he must die to give him his dues as a christian man  and the door was bolted that the penitent might be private with his confessor for he has a heavy weight to unburden his sinful soul withal  ay the maid sent thee not knowing who thou wert the traitor friar taken at st loup and thou hast a tongue that beguiled her simplicity but one that knew thee saw thy wolfs face in her company and told me and i told the maid who sent me straightway back from the gate that justice might be done on thee  thou art he whom this scot charged with treason and would have slain for a spy some nights agone  brother thomas cast up his eyes to heaven  forgive us our trespasses said he as we forgive them that trespass against us  verily and indeed i am that poor friar who tends the wounded and verify i am he against whom this young scot as i fear is the manner of all his benighted people brought a slanderous accusation falsely  all the more reason was there that i should hear his last confession and forgive him freely as may i also be forgiven  thou liest in thy throat said daulon  this is a brave manatarms and a loyal  would that thou wert not beguiled fair sir for i have no pleasure in the sin of any man  but if thou wilt believe him rather than me even keep thy belief and read this written confession of his falsehood  of free will with his own hand my penitent hereby absolves me from all his slanders  as holy church enjoins in the grace of repentance he also makes restitution of what he had stolen namely all my wealth in this world the good name of a poor and lowly follower of the blessed francis here is the scroll  with these words uttered in a voice of sorrowing and humble honesty the friar stretched out the written sheet of paper to daulon  had i been a false traitor he said would not her brethren of heaven have warned the blessed maid against me  and i have also a written safe conduct from the holy sister colette  then i knew that he had fallen into my trap and weak as i was i could have laughed to think of his face when the words i had written came out in place of the words he had bidden me write  for a clerk hath great power beyond the simple and unlettered of the world be they as cunning even as brother thomas  nom dieu this is another story said daulon turning the paper about in his hands and looking doubtfully at me  but i smiled upon him whereby he was the more perplexed  the ink is hardly dry and in some places has run and puddled so that poor clerk as i am i can make little of it and he pored on it in a perplexed sort  tush it is beyond my clerkhood he said at last  you messire saintmesminturning to the physicianmust interpret this  willingly fair sir said the physician moving round to the shutter which he opened while the cordeliers eyes glittered for now there was one man less between him and the halfopen door  i nodded to daulon that he should shut it but he marked me not being wholly in amaze at the written scroll of my confession  the physician himself was no great clerk and he read the paper slowly stumbling over the words as it were while brother thomas clasping his crucifix to his breast listened in triumph as he heard what he himself had bidden me write  i norman leslie ofof peetwhat name is this  peeti cannot utter it  passez outre quoth daulon  i norman leslie being now in the article of deathhere the leech glanced at me shaking his head mournfullydo attest on my hope of salvation and do especially desire madame jeanne la pucelle and all frenchmen and scots loyal to our sovereign lord the dauphin to accept my witness that brother thomas of the order of st francis called noiroufle while of the world has been most truly and righteously accused by me of divers deeds of black treason  at these words the cordeliers hand leaped up from his breast his crucifix dagger glittered bright he tore his frock from daulons grip leaving a rag of it in his hand and smote aiming at the squire where the gorget joins the vambrace  though he missed by an inch yet so terrible was the blow that daulon reeled against the wall while the broken blade jingled on the stone floor  then the frock of the friar whisked through the open door of the chamber we heard the stairs cleared in two leaps and daulon recovering his feet rushed after the false priest  but he was in heavy armour the cordeliers bare legs were doubtless the nimbler and the physician crossing himself could only gape and stare on the paper in his hand  as he gazed with his mouth open his eyes fell on me white as my sheets that were dabbled with the blood from my mouth  nom dieu he stammered nom dieu here is business more to my mind and my trade than chasing after mad cordeliers that stab with crucifixes  then coming to my side he brought water bathed my face and did what his art might do for a man in such deadly extremity as was mine  in which care he was still busy when daulon returned panting having sent a dozen of townsfolk to hunt the friar who had made good his flight over garden walls and was now skulking none knew where  daulon would fain have asked me concerning the mystery of the confession in which brother thomas had placed his hope so unhappily but the physician forbade him to inquire or me to answer saying that it was more than my life was worth but on daulons battered armour there was no deeper dint than that dealt by the murderous crucifix  thus this second time did brother thomas make his way out of our hands the devil aiding him as always for it seemed that ropes could not bind or water drown him  but for my part i lay long in another bout of sore fever sick here at orleans where i was very kindly entreated by the people of the house and notably by the daughter thereof a fair maid and gentle  to her care the maid had commanded me when she left orleans the english refusing battle as later i heard and withdrawing to jargeau and paris  but of the rejoicings in orleans i knew little or nothing and had no great desire for news or meat or drink but only for sleep and peace as is the wont of sick men  now as touches sickness and fever i have written more than sufficient as heaven knows i have had cause enow  a luckless life was mine save for the love of elliot danger and wounds and malady and escape where hope seemed lost were and were yet to be my portion since i sailed forth out of edenmouth  and so hard pressed of sickness was i that not even my outwitting of brother thomas was a cause of comfort to me though to this day i cannot think of it without some mirthful triumph     chapter xvihow sorrow came on norman leslie and joy thereafter   it little concerns any man to know how i slowly recovered my health after certain failings back into the shadow of death  therefore i need not tell how i was physicked and bled and how i drew on from a diet of milk to one of fish and so to a meal of chickens flesh till at last i could sit wrapped up in many cloaks on a seat in the garden below a great mulberry tree  in all this weary time i knew little and for long cared less as to what went on in the world and the wars  but so soon as i could speak it was of elliot that i devised with my kind nurse charlotte boucher the young daughter of jacques boucher the dukes treasurer in whose house i lay  she was a fair lass and merry of mood and greatly hove up my heart to fight with my disease  it chanced that as she tended me when i was at my worst she marked hanging on a silken string about my neck a little case of silver artfully wrought wherein was that portrait of my mistress painted by me before i left chinon being curious like all girls and deeming that the case held some relic she opened it i knowing nothing then of what she did  but when i was well enough to lie abed and devise with her it chanced that i was playing idly with my fingers about the silver case  belike said charlotte that is some holy relic to which maybe you owe your present recovery  surely when you are whole again you have vowed a pilgrimage to the shrine of the saint your friend  here she smiled at me gaily for she was a right merry damsel and a goodly  nay she said i have done more for you than your physician seeing that i or the saint you serve have now brought the red colour into these wan cheeks of yours  is she a scottish saint then perchance st margaret of whom i have read  will you not let me look at the sacred thing  nay said i  methinks from your smiling that you have taken opportunity to see my treasure before today being a daughter of our mother eve  she is very beautiful said charlotte nay show her to me again  with that i pressed the spring and opened the case for there is no lover but longs to hear his lady commended and to converse about her  yet i had spoken no word for my part about her beauty having heard say that he who would be well with one woman does ill to praise another in her presence  beautiful indeed she is said charlotte  never have i seen such eyes and hair like gold and a look so gracious  and for thy pilgrimage to the shrine of this fair saint where does she dwell  i told her at chinon or at tours or commonly wheresoever the court might be for that her father was the kings painter  and you love her very dearly  more than my life i said  and may the saints send you demoiselle as faithful a lover to as fair a lady  nay she said reddening  this is high treason and well you wot that you hold no lady half so fair as your own  are you scots so smoothspoken  you have not that repute  now what would you give to see that lady  all that i have which is little but my service and goodwill  but she knows not where i am nor know i how she fares which irks me more than all my misfortunes  would that i could send a letter to her father and tell him how i do and ask of their tidings  the dauphin is at tours she said and there is much coming and going between tours and this town  for the maid is instant with the dauphin to ride forthwith to reims and there be sacred and crowned but now he listens and believes and anon his counsellors tell him that this is foolhardy and a thing impossible  o they of little faith i said sighing  none the less word has come that the maid has been in her oratory at prayers and a voice from heaven has called to her saying fille de dieu va va va  je serai en ton aide  va 27  the dauphin is much confirmed in his faith by this sign and has vowed that he will indeed march with the maid to reims though his enemies hold all that country which lies between  but first she must take the towns which the english hold on loire side such as jargeau  now on jargeau while you lay knowing nothing the bastard of orleans and xaintrailles and other good knights made an onslaught and won nothing but loss for their pains though they slew messire henry bisset the captain of the town  but if the maid takes jargeau the dauphin will indeed believe in her and follow her  he is hard of heart to believe and would that i were where he should beunder her holy pennon for thereon at least i should see the face painted of my lady  but how does all this bring me nearer the hope of hearing about her and how she fares  there are many messengers coming and going to tours for the dauphin is gathering force under the maid and has set the fair duc dalencon to be her lieutenant with the bastard and la hire and messire florent dilliers  and all are to be here in orleans within few days wherefore now write to the father of thy lady and i will myself write to her with that she gave me paper and pen and i indited a letter to my master telling him how i had lain near to death of my old wound in orleans and that i prayed him of his goodness to let me know how he did and to lay me at the feet of my lady  then charlotte showed me her letter wherein she bade elliot know that i had hardly recovered after winning much fame for so she said and a ransom of gold from an english prisoner which now lay in the hands of her father the dukes treasurer  then she said that a word from elliot not to say the sight of her face the fairest in the world a thing beyond hope would be of more avail for my healing than all the pharaoh powders of the apothecaries  these in truth i had never taken but put them away secretly as doubting whether such medicaments the very dust of the persecuting egyptian and idolatrous race were fit for a christian to swallow with any hope of a blessing thus my kind nurse ended calling herself my ladys sister in the love of france and of the maid and bidding my lady be mindful of so true a lover who lay sick for a token at her hands  these letters she sealed and intrusted to colet de vienne the royal messenger the same who rode from vaucouleurs to chinon in the beginning of the maids mission and who as then was faring to tours with letters from orleans  meanwhile all the town was full of joy in early june because the maid was to visit the city with dalencon and the bastard on her way to besiege jargeau  it was june the ninth in the year of our lord fourteen hundred and twentynine the sun shining warm in a clear blue sky and all the bells of orleans aringing to welcome back the maiden  i myself sat in the window over the doorway alone with charlotte sitting by my side for her father had gone to the hotel de ville with her mother to welcome the captains  below us were hangings of rich carpets to make the house look gay for every house was adorned in the best manner and flags floated in the long street and flowers strewed the road to do honour to our deliverer  thus we waited and presently the sound of music filled the air with fragrance of incense for the priests were walking in front swinging censers and chanting the te deum laudamus  and then came a company of girls strewing flowers and fair boys blowing on trumpets and next on a black horse in white armour with a hucque of scarlet broidered with gold the blessed maid herself unhelmeted glancing every way with her happy eyes while the women ran to touch her armour with their rings as to a saint and the men kissed her mailed feet  to be alive and to feel my life returning in a flood of strength and joy in that sweet air with the gladness of the multitude pulsing through it as a mans heart beats in his body seemed to me like paradise  but out of paradise our first parents were driven long ago as anon i was to be from mine  for as the maid passed i doffed my cap and waved it since to shout noel with the rest i dared not because of my infirmity  now it so fell that glancing around she saw and knew me and bowed to me with a gesture of her hand as queenly as if she a manants child had been a daughter of france  at that moment noting the maids courtesy towards me charlotte stood up from beside me with a handful of red roses which she threw towards her  as it chanced belike because she was proud to be with one whom the maid honoured or to steady herself as she threw she laid her left hand about my neck and so standing cast her flowers and then looked laughing back into my eyes with a happy face  the roses missed the maid whose horse caracoled at that moment as she went by but they lit in the lap of a damsel that rode at her rein on a lyart 28 palfrey and she looking up i saw the face of elliot and elliot saw me and saw charlotte leaning on me and laughing  then elliots face grew deadly pale her lower lip stiff as when she was angered with me at chinon and so wrying her neck suddenly to the left she rode on her way nor ever looked towards us again  who may that proud damsel be and what ails her at my roses quoth charlotte sitting herself down again and still following them with her eyes  methinks i have seen her face before and what ails you she asked looking earnestly on me for you are as white as the last snow ere it melts in spring  i had good reason to be pale for i very well guessed that elliot having ridden in the maidens company to see me and to surprise me with the unlookedfor gladness of her coming had marked charlotte as she so innocently leaned on me and laughed to me and had conceived anger against us both for of a truth charlotte was very fair and of a joyous aspect  yet taken so suddenly as i was between the extreme of delight in looking on my lady beyond hope and the very deep of sorrow that she had so bitterly slighted me i was yet wary of betraying myself  for the girl beside me had in all honest and maidenly service that woman may do for man been kinder to me than a sister and no thought or word of earthly love had ever passed between us  that she should wot of elliots anger and of its cause and so hold my lady lightly ay and triumph over her in her heart as is the nature of a woman her ministry being thus churlishly repaid was more than i could endure  so may the saints forgive me i lied and it is a strange thing but true that howsoever a gentleman may hate the very thought of a lie yet often he finds it hard to tell the truth to a woman  do i look white i said  then it is because i have a sudden pang of sorrow  for one moment i deemed that proud damsel was the lady of my love whom in verity she most strangely favours so that you might think them sisters  but alas she is but the daughter of a good scots knight at chinon whom i have seen there before today and marvelled how much she and my lady favour each other  therefore am i pale because that hope of mine is broken  and you know her face belike from my poor picture of my lady  charlotte looked at me steadily and flushed red but even then one who rode by among the menatarms noted me and waving his arm towards me cried in a loud voice  hail fair son soon will i be with thee and so turning in his saddle to watch me he laughed a loud laugh and rode onwards  he was my master and as my eyes followed him charlotte spoke  and who is that great scot with his scots twang of the tongue who called you son  by the mass she was your lady and yonder wight is her father of whom you have spoken to me more than once for indeed i had told her all the story of my loves  then i was confused for i could no longer deny the truth and not having one word to say i sighed from my heart  o faintspirited manatarms cried charlotte blushing and laughing as if some exquisite jest were abroad  do you so terribly dread your mistresss anger  nay be of good cheer  me she will never forgive while the world stands for have i not been your nurse and won you back to life and to her service  and has she not seen us twain together in one place and happy because of the coming of the maid  she will pardon me never because also for my sake she has been wroth with you and shown you her wrath and all without a cause  therefore she will be ashamed and all the more cruel  nay nor would i forgive her in the same case if it befell me for we women are all alike hearts of wolves when we love  hast thou never marked a cat that had kittens or a brachet that had whelps how they will fly at man or horse that draws near their brood even unwittingly  and so when we love are we all and the best of us are then the worst  verily the friendship of you and me is over and done but for your part be glad not sorry for with all her heart and soul she loves you  else she had not been angered  you must not speak nor i hear such words of my lady i said it is not seemly  such words of your lady and of aymerics lady and of giless lady and of myself were i any mans lady as i am no mans lady i will think and speak said charlotte for my words are true and we maids are at best pretty fools and god willed us to be so for a while and then to be wiser than the rest of you  for were we not pretty would you wed us and were we not fools would we wed you and where would gods world be then  but now you have heard enough of my wisdom for i love no man being very wise or you have heard enough of my folly that my mirth bids me speak as you shall deem it  and now we must consider how this great feud may be closed and the foes set at one again  shall i find out her lodgings and be carried thither straightway in a litter  her heart may be softened when she sees that i cannot walk or mount a horse  now let me think what i should deem if i had ridden by unlooked for and spied my lover with a maid not unfriendly or perchance uncomely sitting smiling in a gallant balcony  would i be appeased when he came straight to seek me borne in a litter  would i  and she mused her finger at her mouth and her brow puckered but with a smile on her lips and in her eyes  then i seeing her so fair yet by me so undesired and beholding her so merry while my heart was amazed with the worst sorrow and considering too that but for her all this would never have been but i sitting happy by my ladys sidethinking on all this i say i turned from her angrily as if i would leave the balcony  nay wait she cried for i must see all the show out and here come the scots guard thy friends and i need time to take counsel with my wisdom on this weighty matter  see they know you and indeed many a man in that gallant array waved his hand to me merrily as they filed past under their bannersthe douglass bloody heart the crescent moon of harden the napiers sheaf of spears the blazons of lindsays and leslies homes and hepburns and stuarts  it was a sight to put life into the dying breast of a scot in a strange country and all were strong men and young ruddy and brown of cheek high of heart and heavy of hand and most beckoned to me and pointed onwards to that way whither they were bound in chase of fame and fortune  all this might have made a sick man whole but my spirit was dead within me so that i could scarce beckon back to them or even remember their faces  would i forgive you said charlotte after she had thrown the remnant of her roses to her friends among the scots if you hurried to me pale and borne in a litter  nay methinks not or not for long and then i should lay it on you never to see her face againshe is i you know for the nonce  but if you waited and did not come then my pride might yield at length and i send for you  but then if so methinks i would hate her that is me more than ever  oh it is a hard case when maids are angry  you speak of yourself how you would do this or that but my lady is other than you and pitiful  did she not come all these leagues at a word from me hearing that i was sick  at a word from you good youth  nay at a word from me  did you speak of me in your letter to her father  nay said i  you did well  and therefore it was that i wrote for i knew she would move heaven and earth and the maid or she would come when she heard of another lass being in your company  nay trust me we women understand each other and she would ask the maid who lodged here with us what manner of lass i was to look upon and the maids answer would bring her  you have been kind i said  and to you and the saints i owe it that i yet live to carry a sore heart and be tormented with your ill tongue  and had you heard that a fair young knight and renowned in arms lay sick at your ladys house she nursing him would you not have cast about for ways of coming to her  to this i answered nothing but with a very sour countenance was rising to go when my name was called in the street  looking down i saw my master who doffed his cap to the daughter of the house and begging leave to come up fastened his horses bridle to the ring in the wall by the door  up he came whom charlotte welcomed very demurely and so left us saying that she must go about her household business but as she departed she cast a look back at me making a moue as the french say with her red lips  well my son cried my master taking my hand why so pale  sure thou hast had a sore bout but thou art mending  i could but stammer my ladys name  elliotshall i see her soon  he scratched his rough head and pulled his russet beard and so laughed shamefacedly  why lad to that very end she came and nowst anthonys fire take me if i well know whyshe will none of it  the maid brought us in her company for as you know she will ever have young lasses with her when she may and as far as orleans the roads are safe  and who so glad as elliot when the maid put this command on her after we got thy letter  i myself was most eager to ride not only for your sake but to see how orleans stood after the long pounding  but when we had come to our lodging and i was now starting off to greet you elliot made no motion of rising  nay when i bade her make haste she said that haste there was none and when i marvelling asked wherefore answered that she was loth to spoil good company and had seen you as i did myself happy enough with the lass who nursed you and who had written to her  and wherefore in heavens name should we not be happy on such a day as this was an hour agone  but now the sun is out of the sky  i see him plainer than ever i did in the merse said my master looking up where the sun was bright in the west  but what would you  women have been thus since eve had a daughter for our father adam i trow had no trouble with other ladies than his wifeand that was trouble enough  but how am i to make my peace and win my pardon being innocent as i am  faith i know not said he and laughed again which angered me some deal for what was there to laugh at  may i let bring a litter for i cannot yet walk and so go back with you to her  indeed i doubt if it were wise said he and so we stood gazing at each other while i could have wept for very helpless anger  i have it i think said he at last  the maid is right busy as needs must be gathering guns and food for her siege of jargeau  but it is not fitting that she should visit orleans without seeing you nor would she wish to be so negligent  yet if she were i would put it in her mind and then when you are with her which elliot shall not know i will see that elliot comes into the chamber and so leave all to you and to her and to the maid  for she hath great power with that silly wench of mine who has no other desire i trow than a good excuse to be rid of her sudden anger  if she loved you less she would be never so fiery  i myself could see no better hope or comfort  then he began to devise with me on other matters and got from me the story of my great peril at the hands of brother thomas  he laughed at the manner of my outwitting that miscreant who had never been taken but was fled none knew whither and my master promised to tell the tale to the maid and warn her against this enemy  and so bidding me be of good cheer he departed but for my part i went into my chamber drew the bolt and cast myself on the bed refusing meat or drink or to see the face of man or woman  i was devoured by a bitter anger considering how my lady had used me and what was most sore of all reflecting that i could no longer hold her for a thing all perfect and almost without touch of mortal infirmity nay she was a woman like another and unjust and to deem thus of her was to me the most cruel torment  we could never forgive each the other so it seemed to me nor be again as we had been  and all the next day no message came for me and i kept myself quiet apart in my chamber  lest they who read mock at me in their hearts and at my lady let them remember how young we both were and how innocent of other experience in love  for the roman says that the angers of lovers are loves renewal as the brief tempests of april bring in the gladness of may  but in my heart it was all white sleet and wind and snow unseasonable and so i lay out of all comfort tossing on my bed  i heard the watchmen call the hours through the night and very early having at length fallen on sleep i was wakened by a messenger from the maid  it was her page louis de coutes most richly attired but still half asleep grumbling and rubbing his eyes  my mistress bids you come with me instantly he said when we had saluted each other and i have brought a litter and men to carry it faith if i lay in it i should be asleep ere ever they had borne me ten paces  what a life it is that i lead  late to bed and up by prime so busy is my mistress and she lives as it were without sleep and feeds on air  here he threw himself down in a great chair and verily by the time i had washed and attired myself i had to shake him by the shoulder to arouse him  thus i was carried to the maids lodging my heart beating like a hammer with hopes and fears  we found her already armed for that day she was to ride to jargeau and none was with her but her confessor  she gave me the best of greetings and bade me eat bread and drink wine  and soon she said if you recover the quicker i trust to give you wine to drink in paris  she herself dipped a crust in wine and water and presently bidding her confessor pasquerel wait for her in the little oratory she asked me how i did and told me what fear she had been in for me as touching brother thomas when she learned who he was yet herself could not return from the field to help me  but now said she smiling with a ravishing sweetness i hear you are in far greater peril from a foe much harder and more cruelma mie elliot  ah how you lovers put yourselves in jeopardy and take me from my trade of war to play the peacemaker  surely i have chosen the safer path in open breach and battle though would that my war was ended and i sitting spinning again beside my dear mother  hereon her face grew more tender and sad than ever i had seen it and there came over me forgetfulness of my private grief as of a little thing and longing to ride at the maidens rein where glory was to be won  would that even now i could march with you i said and she smiling made answer  that shall yet be yea verily and here the fashion of her countenance altered wondrously i know and know not how i know that thou shalt be with me when all have forsaken me and fled  then she fell silent and i also marvelling on her face and on the words which she spoke  there came a light tap at the door and she awoke as it were from a trance which possessed her  she drew her hands over her face with a long sigh she knelt down swiftly and crossed herself making an obeisance for i deem that her saints had been with her wherefore i also crossed myself and prayed  then she rose and cried enter and ere i could speak she had passed into the oratory and i was alone with elliot  elliot gave one low cry and cast her arms about my neck hiding her face on my breast and sobbing as if her heart would break  i have been mad i have been bad she moaned  oh say hard words to me and punish me my love  but i had no word to say only i fell back into a great chair for very weakness holding my lady in my arms  and thus with words few enough but great delight the minutes went past till she lifted her wet face and her fragrant hair and between laughing and crying studied on my face and caressed me touching my thin cheek and wept and laughed again  i was mad she whispered it seemed as if a devil entered into me  but she spoke to me and cast him out and she bade me repent  and do penance i said kissing her till she laughed again saying that i was a hard confessor and that the maid had spoken no word of penances  yet one i must do and suffer she said and it is more difficult to me than these austerities of thine  here her face grew very red and she hid it with her hands  what mean you i asked wondering  i must see her and thank her for all her kindness to thee  the maid i asked  nay that other thyfair nurse  nay forbid me not i have sworn it to myself and i must go  and the maiden told me when i spoke of it that it was no more than right  then she threw her arms about me again in the closest embrace and hid her head  now this resolve of hers gave me no little cause of apprehension as not knowing well how things might pass in such an encounter of two ladies  but even then one touched me on the shoulder from behind and the maid herself stood beside us  o joy she said my peacemaking has been blessed  go you foolish folk and sin no more and peace and happiness be with you long years and glad children at your knees  yet hereof i know nothing from my counsel  and now i must go forth about the dauphins business and to do that for which i was sent  they that brought thee in the litter will carry thee back again so farewell  thus saying she stooped and kissed elliot who leaped up and caught the maid in her arms and they embraced and parted for that time elliot weeping to lose her and at the thought of the dangers of war     chapter xviihow elliot lost her jackanapes   the maids confessor pasquerel stood in the chamber where we had met with his eyes bent on the ground so that elliot and i had no more free speech at that time  therefore i said farewell not daring to ask of her when her mind was to visit my hosts and indeed my trust was that she might leave this undone lest new cause of sorrow should arise  thus we parted with very courtly leavetaking the priest regarding us in his manner and i was carried in the litter through the streets that had been so quiet when i came forth in the morning but now they were full of men and of noise  herds of cattle were being driven for the food of the army marching against jargeau there were trains of carts full of victual and the citizens having lent the maid their great pieces of ordnance the bombard called the shepherdess and the gun montargis these were being dragged along by clamorous companies of apprentices and there were waggons charged with powder and stone balls and boxes of arrows spades and picks for trenching and all manner of munition of war  by reason of the troops of horses and of marching men they that bore me were often compelled to stop  therefore lest any who knew me should speak with me i drew the curtains of the litter for i had much matter to think on and was fain to be private  but this was to be of no avail for i heard loud voices in my own tongue  what fair lady is this who travels so secretly and with this one drew the curtains and there was the face of randal rutherford with others behind him  then he uttered a great cry  faith it is our lady of the linenbasket and no other and leaning within he gave me a rough embrace and a kiss of his bearded lips  why so early astir our sick man he cried  get yourself healed anon and be with us when we take paris town norman for there is booty enough to furnish all scotland  shalt thou be with us yet  if my strength backs my will randal and truly your face is a sight for sair eyne and does me more good than all the powers of the apothecary  then here is to our next merry meeting he cried under paris walls  with that the scots gave a shout and some of them crowding round to press my hand they bade me be of good cheer and all went onward singing in the tune of hey tuttie tattie which the pipers played when we broke the english at bannockburn  so i was borne back to the house of jacques boucher and in the sunny courtyard there stood charlotte looking gay and fair yet warlike as i deemed  she was clad in a long garment of red over a white robe and had sleeves of green so that she wore the springs own colours and she was singing a french ditty concerning a lady who has a lover and vows that she will never be a nun     serayje nonnette oui ou non    serrayje nonnette je croy que non  seeing me she stinted in her singing and in feeding a falcon that was perched on her wrist  you are early astir for a sick man she said  have you been on pilgrimage or whither have you been faring  the maid sent for me right early for today she rides to jargeau and to you she sends a message of her loveas indeed she had done but for the great press of affairs she might not visit you  and mistress elliot hume has she forgiven her lover yet nay i see by your face that you are forgiven  and you go south this very day is it not so  indeed i said if it is your will that we part part we must though i sorrow for it but none has given me the word to march save you my fair nurse and hostess  nay it is not i who shall speed you nevertheless the maid is not the only prophetess in this realm of france and something tells me that we part this day  but you are weary will you get you to your chamber or sit in the garden under the mulberrytree and i shall bring you out a cup of white wine  weary i was indeed and the seat in the garden among the flowers seemed a haven most desirable  so thither i went leaning on her shoulder and she returned to bring the wine but was some while absent and i sat deep in thought  i was marvelling not only as to what my mistress would next do and when i should see her again though that was uppermost in my mind but also concerning the strange words of the maid that i alone should be with her when all forsook her and fled  how might this be and was she not to be ever victorious and drive the english forth of france to my thinking the maid dwelt ever in two worlds with her brethren of paradise and again with sinful men  and i have often considered that she did not always remember in this common life what had befallen her and what she knew when as the apostle says she was out of the body for i have heard her say more than once that she would last but one year or little more and again she would make plans for three years to come or four which is a mystery  so i was pondering when i looked up and saw charlotte standing in the entrance between the court and garden looking at me and smiling as she shaded her eyes with her hand from the sun and then she ran to me lightly as a lapwing  they are coming down the street looking every way for our house your lady and her father she said putting the winecup into my hand  now is it war or peace and she fled back again within the house  my heart stood still for now everything was on the fall of the dice would this mad girl be mocking or meek  would she anger my lady to my ruin with her sharp tongue  for charlotte was of a high temper and wont to rule all the house by reason of her beauty and kind wild ways  nor was elliot the meekest of women as well i knew and a word nay a smile or a glance of mockery might lightly turn her heart from me again for ever  oh the lot of a lover is hard at least if he has set all his heart on the cast as i had done and verily as our scots saw runs women are kittle cattle  it is a strange thing that one who has learned not to blench from a bare blade or in bursting of cannonballs and flight of arrows should so easily be daunted where a weak girl is concerned yet so it was in my case  i know not if i feared more than now when brother thomas had me in the still chamber alone at his mercy  so the minutes went by the sun and shade flickering through the boughs of the mulberrytree and the time seemed long  perchance i thought there had been war as charlotte had said and my lady had departed in anger with her father and i was all undone  yet i dared not go to seek them in the house not knowing how matters were passing and whether i should do good or harm  so i waited and at length charlotte came forth alone  now she walked slowly her eyes bent on the ground and as she drew near i saw that they were red and i guessed that she had been weeping  so i gave up all for lost and my heart turned to water within me  i am sent to bid you come in she said gravely  what has passed i cried  for the saints sake tell me all  this has passed that i have seen such a lady as i never dreamed i should see and she has made me weepfoolish that i am  why what did she  did she speak unkindly then to my kind nurse  for this i could in no manner have endured nor have abased myself to love one that was unjust how dear soever and none could be dearer than elliot  yet unjust she might have been and this thought to me was the greatest torment  speak unkind words  oh i remember my foolish talk how i said that she would never forgive me while the world stands  nay while her father was with mine and with my mother thanking them for what they did for you she led me apart to devise with me and i took her to my chamber and there with tears in her eyes and in the sweetest manner she prayed me to pardon her for that she had been mad for a moment and so looking meek as an angel she awaited my word  and i could not but weep though to weep is never my way and we embraced each the other and i told her how all your converse had ever been of her even when you were beside yourself in your fever and how never was so faithful a lover  nay i bid you be glad for i never deemed that any woman living on earth would so repent and so confess herself to another where she herself had first been wroth but would blame all the world rather and herselfnever  so we women are not all alike as i thought for i would hardly have forgiven if i know myself and yet i am no worse than another  truly she has been much with the maid and has caught from her this to be like her who is alone among women and of the greatest heart  here she ceased to speak very gravely as she had till now done and breaking out into a sweet laughter she cried  nevertheless i am not wholly a false prophetess for today you go with them southward to tours to change the air as the physician counsels and so now we part  o false scot she said laughing again how have you the ill courtesy to look so joyous  nay i shall change your cheer and with that she stooped and kissed my cheek saying go and joy go with you as joy abides with me to see my sick man look so strong again come they are waiting for us and you know we must not tarry  then giving me her arm she led me in and if one of us twain had a shamefaced guise verify it was not charlotte boucher  i yield you back your esquire fair lady she said merrily making obeisance to elliot who stood up very pale to receive us  he has got no ill in the bower of the enchantress said my master whereat elliot seeming some deal confused and blushing charlotte bustled about bringing wine and meat and waiting upon all of us and on her father and mother at table  a merry dinner it was among the elder folk but elliot and i were somewhat silent and a great joy it was to me and a heavy weight off my heart i do confess when dinner being ended and all courtesies done and said my raiment was encased in wallets and we all went through the garden to loire side and so with many farewells took boat and sailed down the river under the bridge of orleans towards blois  but charlotte i never saw again nor did i ever speak of her to elliot nor elliot of her to me from that day forth  but within short space came tidings how that charlotte was wedding a young burgess of orleans with whom as i hear she dwelt happily and still for all i know dwells in peace  as i deem she kept her lord in a merry life yet in great order and obedience  so now there is no more to tell of her save that her picture comes back before mea tall brown girl with black hair and eyes like the hue of hazel boughs glassed in running water clad in white and green and red standing smiling beneath the redandwhite blossoms of an appletree in the green garden of jacques boucher  elliot was silent enough and sat telling her beads in the beginning of our journey down the waterway that is the smoothest and the easiest voyaging for a sick man  she was in the stern of the boat her fingers when her beads were told trailing in the smooth water that was green with the shade of leaves  but her father stood by me asking many questions concerning the siege and gaping at the halfmended arch of the bridge where through we sailed and at the blackened walls of les tourelles and all the ruin that war had wrought  but now masons and carpenters were very busy rebuilding all and the air was full of the tinkling of trowels and hammers  presently we passed the place where i had drawn brother thomas from the water but thereof i said no word for indeed my dreams were haunted by his hooded face like that of the snake which as travellers tell wears a hood in prester johns country and is the most venomous of beasts serpentine  so concerning brother thomas i held my peace and the barque swinging round a corner of the bank soon brought us into a country with no sign of war on it and here the poplar trees had not been felled for planks to make bulwarks but whispered by the riverside  the wide stream carried many a boat and shone with sails white and crimson and brown the boatmen sang or hailed each other from afar there was much traffic stores being carried from blois to the army  some mile or twain above beaugency we were forced to land and i being borne in a litter we took a crosspath away from the stream joining it again two miles below beaugency because the english held that town though not for long  the sun had set yet left all his gold shining on the water when we entered blois and there rested at a hostel for the night  next dayone of the goodliest of my life so soft and clear and warm it was yet with a cool wind on the waterwe voyaged to tours and now elliot was glad enough making all manner of mirth  her desire she said was to meet a friend that she had left at their house in tours one that she had known as long as she knew me my friend he was too yet i had never spoken of him or asked how he did  now i being wrapped up wholly in her and in my joy to see her kind again and so beautiful had no memory of any such friend wherefore she mocked me and rebuked me for a hard heart and ungrateful  this friend of mine she said was the first that made us known each to other  yea but for him the birds might have pecked out your eyne and the ants eaten your bones bare yetwith a sudden anger and tears in her eyes at the words she spokeyou have clean forgotten him  ah you mean the jackanapes  and how is the little champion  like the lads of wamfray aye for ill and never for good said my master but she frowned on him and said  now you ask because i forced you on it but sir i take it very ill that you have so short a memory for a friend  now tell me in all the time since you left us at chinon how often have you thought of him  nigh as often as i thought of you i answered  for when you came into my mind and that was every minute as in a picture thither too came your playfellow climbing and chattering and holding out his little bowl for a comfit  nay then you thought of me seldom or you would have asked how he does  here she turned her face from me half in mock anger  but just as it is with children so it was with elliot for indeed my dear was ever much of a child wherefore her memory is now to me so tender  and as children make pretence to be in this humour or that for sport and will affect to be frighted till they really fear and weep so elliot scarce knew how deep her own humour went and whether she was acting like a player in a mystery or was in good earnest  and if she knew not rightly what her humour was far less could i know so that she was ever a puzzle to me and kept me in a hundred pretty doubts and dreads every day  alas how sorely through all these years have i longed to hear her rebuke me in mirth and put me adread and laugh at me again i for she was as it were wife and child to me at once and i a child with her and as happy as a child  thus nothing would now jump with her humour but to be speaking of her jackanapes and how he would come louting and leaping to welcome her and forsake her old kinswoman who had followed with them to tours  and she had much to report concerning his new tricks how he would leap over a rod for the dauphin or the maid but not if adjured in the name of the english king or the duke of burgundy  also if you held him he would make pretence to bite any that you called englishman or false frenchman moreover he had now been taught to fetch and carry and would climb into elliots window from the garden and bring her little basket of silks or whatsoever she desired or carry it thither as he was commanded  and he wrung the cats neck quoth my master but elliot bade him hold his peace  in such sport the hours passed till we were safely come to tours and so to their house in a street running off the great place where the cathedral stands  it was a goodly dwelling with fair carvedwork on the beams and in the doorway stood the old scots kinswoman smiling wide and toothless to welcome us  elliot kissed her quickly and she fondled elliot and held a hand out over her shoulder to greet me  but where is my jackanapes that should have been here to salute his mistress elliot cried  out and alas said the old wife in our country tongueout and alas for i have ill news  the poor beast is missing these three days past and we fear he is stolen away by some gangrel bodies for the town is full of them  there came two to our door three days agone and one was a blind man and the other a onearmed soldier maimed in the wars and i gave them bite and sup as a christian should do  now they had not been gone but a few minutes and i was in the spence putting away the dishes when i heard a whistle in the street and anon another  i thought little of it and so was about my business for an hour when i missed the jackanapes  and then there was a hue and cry and all the house was searched and the neighbours were called on but since that day there has been no word of the jackanapes  but for the blind man and the armless soldier the town guard saw them leaving by the north gate with a violer woman and her husband an illlooking loon in their company  elliot sat her down and wept sore  they have stolen my little friend she cried and now he that was so fat i called him tremouille will go hungry and lean and be whipped to make him do his tricks and i shall never see him more  then she ran out of the chamber to weep alone as i guessed for she was pitiful and of very tender affection and dumb things came near about her heart as is the manner of many women  but i made no doubt in my mind that the husband of the apes old mistress had stolen him and i too sorrowed for the poor beast that my mistress loved and that in very deed had been the saving of my own life  then i spoke to my master and said that we must strive to buy her a new ape or a little messan dog to be her playfellow  but he shook his head  say nothing more of the beast he muttered unless she speaks of him first and that methinks will be never  for it is not her wont to speak of what lies very deep in her heart and if you talk of the beast it will please her little  and indeed i heard no word more of the jackanapes from elliot save that coming back from the minster next day she whispered i have prayed for him and so fled to her own chamber  as then i deemed it a strange thing and scarcely to be approved by holy church that my lady should pray for a dumb beast who had no soul to be saved  but a faithful loving prayer is not unavailing or unheard of him who made the beasts as well as he made us for whose sin or the sin of our father adam they now suffer silently  and the answer to this prayer was to be known in the end  as the week went on tidings came that made elliot glad again if before she had been sad enough  for this was that great week of wonders which shall never be forgotten while france is france and the lilies bloom  on june the thirteenth the maid took jargeau whence the famed bastard of orleans had been driven some weeks agone and the earl of suffolk yielded him her prisoner saying that she was the most valiant woman in the world  scarce had tidings of this great victory come when messengers followed declaring that the maid had seized the bridge of meun and driven the english into the castle  next she marched against beaugency and at midnight of june the seventeenth the english made terms that they might go forth with their lives but without baggage or arms and with but one mark of silver apiece  next morning came talbot the best knight then on ground and fastolf the wariest of captains with a great army of english  first they made for jargeau but they came too late and then they rode to meun and would have assailed the french in the bridgefort but even then they heard how beaugency had yielded to la pucelle and how the garrison was departed into normandy like pilgrims without swords and staff in hand  thus all the loire and the waterway was in the power of france wherefore the english marched off through the country called la beauce which then lay desert and overgrown with wild wood by reason of the war  and there in a place named coynce near patay the maid overtook the english having with her la hire and xaintrailles and she charged them so rudely that ere the english could array them in order of battle they were already flying for their lives  there were talbot and warwick taken and held to ransom but fastolf fled as fast as his horse could carry him  thus in one week between june the eleventh and june the eighteenth the maid had delivered three strong towns from the english and had utterly routed them in fair field  then at orleans on june the nineteenth the army went to the churches thanking god and the blessed virgin and all the saints for such great signs and marvels wrought through the maid only  sorrow it is to me to write of such things by report and not to have seen them done  but as talbot said to the duc dalencon when they took him at patay it is fortune of war  but as day by day messengers came their horses red with spurring to the cross in the marketplace of tours and as we that gathered round heard of some fresh victory you may consider whether we rejoiced feasted filled the churches with our thanksgivings and deemed that in a few weeks there would be no living englishman on french soil  and of all that were glad my lady was the happiest for she had believed in the maid from the very beginning when her father mocked  and a hard life she now led him with her sallies day by day as more and ever more glad tidings were brought and we could hear elliot singing through the house  yea i found her once dancing in the garden all alone a beautiful sight to look upon as the sun fell on her and the shadow she footing it as if to music but the music was made by her own heart  leaning against an appletree i watched her who waved her hand to me and still danced on this was after we had heard the news of beaugency  as she so swayed and moved dancing daintily came a blast of a trumpet and a gay peal from the minster bells  then forth rushed elliot and through the house and down the street into the marketplace nor did i know where i was till i found myself beside her and heard the maire read a letter to all the folk telling how the english were routed at pathay in open field thereon the whole multitude fell adancing and i for all my malady was fain to dance with them but elliot led me home her head high and blue rays darting from her eyes  from that day my life seemed to come back to me and i was no longer the sick man  so the weeks went by in all delight my master working hard and i helping him in my degree for new banners would be wanted when the dauphin went for his sacring to his good town of reims  as we all deemed this could no longer be delayed and thereafter our armies would fall on paris and so strong grew i that i was in hopes to be with them where at last fortune was to be won  but of this my hope i said little to elliot waiting till i could wear armour and exercising myself thereat privately in the garden before folk had risen in the mornings     chapter xviiihow elliots jackanapes was seen at the kings crowning   the hearts of kings are in his hand says holy scripture and it is of necessity to be believed that the hearts of kings in an especial sense are wisely governed  yet the blindness of our sinful souls we often may not see nor by deep consideration find out the causes wherefore kings often act otherwise and as we might deem less worthily than common men  for it is a truth and must be told that neither before he was anointed with the blessed oil from the holy vessel or ampulla which the angel brought to st remigius nor even after that anointing which is more strange did charles vii king of france bear him kingly as regards the maiden  nay i have many a time thought with sorrow that if xaintrailles or la hire ay or any the meanest esquire in all our army had been born dauphin in three months after the maids victories in june paris would have been ours and not an englishman left to breathe the air of france  for it needed but that the king should obey the maid ride straight to reims and thence on paris town and every city would have opened its gates to him as the walls of jericho fell at the mere sound of the trumpets of israel  this is no foolish fancy of an old man dreaming in a cloister about what might have been  for the regent of the english brother of their king harry the fifth and himself a wise man and brave if cruel was of this same mind  first he left paris and shut himself up in the strong castle of vincennes dreading an uproar among the people and next he wholly withdrew himself to rouen for he had now no force of men to guard the walls of paris  our dauphin had but to mount and ride and all would have been his at one blow ay or without a blow  the maid as we daily heard kept praying him even with tears to do no more than this and from every side came in men free and noble ready to serve at their own charges  the poorest gentlemen who had lost all in the troubles and might not even keep a horse to ride were of goodwill to march as common footsoldiers  but while all france called on her king he was dwelling at sully in the castle of la tremouille a man who had a foot in either camp so that neither english nor burgundians had ever raided on his rich lands when these lay in their power  so what with the selfseeking and sloth and jealousy of la tremouille what with the worldly policy of the archbishop of reims crying peace where there was no peace the maid and the captains were not listened to or if they were heard their plans were wrought out with a faint heart so that at last if it is lawful to say so the will of men prevailed over the will of heaven  never i pray may any prince of my own country be so bestead and so ill served that when he has won battles and gained cities two or three and needs but to ride forward and win all his kingdom he shall be turned back by the little faith of his counsellors  never may such a thing befall a prince of scotland  concerning these matters of state as may be believed we devised much at tours while messengers were coming and going and long weary councils were being held at sully and at gien dalencon we got news was all for striking a blow yet more bold than the march to reims and would have attacked the english where they were strongest and nearest their own shores namely at rouen  the counsellors of the peaceful sort were inclined to waste time in besieging la charite and other little towns on loireside  but her voices had bidden the maid from the first to carry the dauphin to reims that there he might be anointed and known to france for the very king  so at last finding that time was sorely wasted whereas all hope lay in a swift stroke ere the english could muster men and bring over the army lately raised by the cardinal of winchester to go crusading against the miscreants of bohemiathe maid rode out of gien with her own company on june the twentyseventh and lodged in the fields some four leagues away on the road to auxerre  and next day the king and the court followed her perforce with a great army of twelve thousand men thenceforth there came news to us every day in tours and all the news was good  town after town opened its gates at the summons of the maid and notably troyes and chalons in despite of the english garrisons  we were all right glad and could scarce sleep for joy above all when a messenger rode in one thomas scott whom i had encountered before as i have written bidding my master come straightway to reims to join the king and exercise his craft in designing a great picture of the coronation  so with much ado he bestowed his canvases brushes paints and all other gear of his trade in wallets and commending his daughter to his old kinswoman to obey her in all things he set off on horseback with thomas scott  but for myself i was to lodge while he was at reims with a worthy woman of tours for the avoiding of evil tongues and very tardily the time passed with me for that i might not be as before always in the company of elliot  as for my lady she was during most of these days on her knees at the altar in the great minster praying to the saints for the dauphin and the maid and for her father that he might come and go safely on his journey  nor did she pray in vain for no more than two days after the first tidings had arrived that the sacring was done and that all had gone well my master rode to his own door weary but glad at heart and hobbled into his house  one was sent running to bring me this good news and i myself ran for now i was able and found him seated at his meat as well as he could eat it for elliot that often stopped his mouth with kisses  he held forth his hand to me saying all is as well as heart could desire and the maid bids you follow her if you may to the taking of paris for there she says will be your one chance to win your spurs  and now let me eat and drink for the heat is great the ways dusty and i half famished  thereafter ask me what you will and you elliot come not between a hungry man and his meat  so he spoke sitting at his table with his tankard in his hand and his wallets lying about him on the floor  elliot was therefore fain not to be embracing him but rather to carve for him and serve in the best manner that he might sup the quicker and tell us all his tale  this he did at last elliot sitting on his knee with her arm about his neck but as touches the sacring how it was done though many of the peers of france were not there to see and how noble were the manners of the king and the maid who stood there with her banner and of the only reward which she would take namely that her townsfolk should live free of tax and corvee all this is known and written of in chronicles  nor did i see it myself so i pass by  but next to actual beholding of that glorious rite the best thing was to hear my master tell of it taking out his books wherein he had drawn the king and the maid in her harness and many of the great lords  from these pictures a tapestry was afterwards wrought and hung in reims cathedral where it is to this day the maid on horseback beckoning the king onward the scots archers beside him in the most honourable place as was their lawful due and behind all the father of the maid entering reims by another road  by great good fortune and by virtue of being a fellowtraveller with thomas scott the rider of the kings stable my master found lodgings easily enough  so crowded was the town that the weather being warm in mid july many lay in tabernacles of boughs in the great place of reims and there was more singing that night than sleeping  but my master had lain at the hostelry called lasne roye in the parvise opposite to the cathedral where also lay jean darc the father of the maid  thither she herself came to visit him and she gave gifts to such of the people of her own countryside as were gathered at reims  and jeannot do you fear nothing one of them asked her who had known her from a child  i fear nothing but treason my master heard her reply a word that we had afterwards too good cause to remember  and is she proud now that she is so great asked elliot  she proud  no pride has she but sat at meat and spoke friendly with all these manants and it was tu and toy and how is this one and that one till verily i think she had asked for every man woman child and dog in domremy  and that puts me in mind  in mind of what  of nought  faith i remember not what i was going to say for i am well weary  but paris i asked  when march we on paris  my masters face clouded  they should have set forth for paris the very day after the sacring which was the seventeenth of july  but envoys had come in from the duke of burgundy and there were parleys with them as touching peace now peace will never be won save at the point of the lance  but a truce of a fortnight has been made with burgundy and then he is to give up paris to the king  yet ere a fortnight has passed the new troops from england will have come over to fight us and not against the heretics of bohemia though they have taken the cross and the vow  and the king has gone to saint marcoul forsooth seeing that unless he goes there to do his devotions he may not touch the sick and heal the crewels 29 faith they that have the crewels might even wait till the king has come to his own again they have waited long enough to learn patience while he was dauphin  it should be paris first and saint marcoul and the crewels afterwards but anything to waste time and keep out of the brunt of the battle  here he struck his hand on the table so that the vessels leaped  i fear what may come of it he said  for every day that passes is great loss to us and much gain to our enemies of england who will anon garrison paris  faintheart cried elliot plucking his beard  you will never believe in the maid who has never yet failed to help us by the aid of the saints  the saints help them that help themselves he answered  and paris town has walls so strong that once the fresh english are entered in even the saints may find it a hard bargain  but you elliot run up and see if my chamber be ready for i am well weary  she ran forth and my master turning to me said in a low voice i have something for your own ear but i feared to grieve her  in a booth at reims i saw her jackanapes doing his tricks and when he came round questing with his bowl the little beast knew me and jumped up into my arms and wailed as if he had been a christian  then i was for keeping him but i was set on by three or four stout knaves and i being alone and the crowd taking their part i thought it not well to draw sword and so break the kings peace that had just then begun to be king  but my heart was sore for the poor creature and in very truth i bring back no light heart save to see you twain again for i fear me that the worst of the darg 30 is still to do  but here comes elliot so no word of the jackanapes  therewith he went off to his chamber and i to mine with less pleasure than i had looked for  still the thought came into my heart that the longer the delay of the onslaught on paris the better chance i had to take part therein and the harder the work the greater the glory  the boding words of my master proved over true  the king was sacred on july the sixteenth and paris then stood empty of english soldiers being garrisoned by burgundians only  but so soon as he was anointed the king began to parley with burgundy and thus they spun out the time till on july the twentyfifth a strong army of englishmen had entered paris  whether their hearts were high may not be known but on their banner they had hung a distaff and had painted the flag with the words     ores viegne la belle  meaning let the fair maid come and we shall give her wool to spin next we heard and were loth to believe it that a new truce of fifteen days more had been made with burgundy  the maid indeed said openly that she loved not the truce and that she kept it only for the honour of the king which was dearer to her than her life as she proved in the end  then came marchings this way and that all about the isle of france bedford leaving paris to fight the king and then refusing battle though the maid rode up to the english palisades and smote them with her sword defying the english to come out if they were men  so the english betook them back to paris after certain light skirmishes only  meanwhile some of his good towns that had been in the hands of the english yielded to the king or rather to the maid  among these the most notable was compiegne a city as great as orleans  many a time it had been taken and retaken in the wars but now the burgesses swore that they would rather all die with their wives and children than open their gates again to the english  and this oath they kept well as shall be seen in the end     chapter xixhow norman leslie rode again to the wars   tidings of these parleys and marches and surrenders of cities came to us at tours the king sending letters to his good towns by messengers one of these the very thomas scott of whom i have before spoken a man out of rankelburn in ettrick forest brought a letter for me which was from randal rutherford  messjohn urquhart writes for me that am no clerk said randal and to spare his pains as he writes for the most of us i say no more than this come now or come never for the maid will ride to see paris in three days or four let the king follow or not as he will  there was no more but a cross marked opposite the name of randal rutherford and the date of place and day august the nineteenth at compiegne  my face fired for i felt it when i had read this and i made no more ado but covenanting with thomas scott to be with him when he rode forth at dawn i went home put my harness in order and hired a horse from him that kept the hostelry of the hanging sword whither also i sent my harness for that i would sleep there  this was all done in the late evening secretly and after supper i broke the matter to my master and elliot  her face changed to a dead white and she sat silent while my master took the word saying in our country speech that he who will to cupar maun to cupar and therewith he turned and walked out and about in the garden  we were alone and now was the hardest of my work to do to comfort elliot when in faith i sorely needed comfort myself  but honour at once and necessity called me to ride being now fit to bear harness and foreseeing no other chance to gain booty or even perchance my spurs nor could i endure to be a malingerer  she sat there very white her lip quivering but her eyes brave and steadfast  i kneeled beside her and in my hands i took her little hand that was cold as ice  it is for the maid and for you elliot i whispered and she only bent her head on my shoulder but her cold hand gripped mine firmly  she did say that you should come back unharmed of sword whispered elliot looking for what comfort she might  but o my dear you may be taken and when shall i see you again  oh this life is the hardest thing for women who must sit and tremble and pray at home  sure no danger of war is so terrible  ah must you really go  then she clung so closely about me that it seemed as if i could never escape out of her arms and i felt as if my heart must break in twain  how could i look men in the face and how could i ever see the maid again if i go not i said and loosening her grasp she laid her hands on my shoulders and so gazed on me steadfastly as if my picture could be fixed on the tablets of her brain  on your chin is coming a little down at last she said smiling faintly and then gave a sob and her lips met mine and our very souls met but even then we heard my masters steps hobbling to the door and she gave a cry and fled to her chamber  and this was our leavetakingbrief but i would not have had it long  it is ill work parting heaven help us said my master  faith i remember as if it were today how i set forth for verneuil a long time i was gone and came back a maimed man  but it is fortune of war  the saints have you in their keeping my son and chiefly st andrew  come back soon and whole and rich for meseems if i lose one of you i am to lose both  therewith he embraced me and i set forth to the hostel where i was to lie that night  now see how far lighter is life to men than to women for though i left the house with the heaviest heart of any man in tours often looking back at the candleshine in my ladys casement yet when i reached the hanging sword i found thomas scott sitting at his wine and my heart and courage revived within me  he lacked nothing but one to listen and soon was telling tales of the war and of the road and of how this one had taken a rich prisoner and that one had got an arrow in his thigh and of what chances there were to win paris by an onslaught  for in no other can we take it said he save indeed by miracle  for they are richly provisioned and our hope is that if we can make a breach there may be a stir of the common folk who are well weary of the english and the burgundians  now with his talk of adventures and with high hopes i was so heartened up that to my shame my grief fell from me and i went to my bed to dream of trenches and escalades glory and gain  but elliot i fear me passed a weary night and a sorry whereas i had scarce laid my head on my pillow as it seemed when i heard thomas shouting to the grooms and clatter of our horses hoofs in the courtyard  so i leaped up though it was scarce daylight and we rode northwards before the full coming of the dawn  here i must needs write of a shameful thing which i knew not then or i would have ridden with a heavier heart but i was told concerning the matter many years after by messire enguerrand de monstrelet a very learned knight and deep in the counsels of the duke of burgundy  you were all sold he said to me at dijon in the year of our lord fourteen hundred and fortysevenyou were all sold when you marched against paris town  for the maid with dalencon rode from compiegne towards paris on the twentythird of august if i remember well and here he turned about certain written parchments that lay by him  yea on the twentythird she left compiegne but on the twentyeighth of that month the archbishop of reims entered the town and there he met the ambassadors of the good duke of burgundy  there he and they made a compact between them binding your king and the duke that their truce should last till noel but that the duke might use his men in the defence of paris against all that might make onfall  now the archbishop and the king knew well that the maid was in that hour marching on paris  to what purpose make a truce and leave out of the peace the very point where war should be  manifestly the french king never meant to put forth the strength of his army in helping the maid  there was to be truce between france and burgundy but none between england and the maid  so messire enguerrand told me a learned knight and a grave and thus was the counsel of the saints defeated by the very king whom they sought to aid  but of this shameful treaty we menatarms knew nothing and so hazarded our lives against loaded dice     chapter xxconcerning the maid and the birds   we rode northwards first through lands that i had travelled in before to orleans and so into a country then strange to me passing by way of lagny with intent to go to senlis where we deemed the king lay  the whole region being near paris and close under the english power was rich and peaceful of aspect the corn being already reaped and standing in sheaves about the fields whether to feed englishmen or frenchmen none could tell  for the land was in a kind of hush in expectancy and fear no man knowing how things should fall out at paris  natheless the prior of lagny within that very week wherein we came had gone to st denis and yielded his good town into the hands of the duc dalencon for the king  and the fair duke had sent thither messire ambrose de lore a very good knight with messire jehan foucault and many menatarms  to messire ambrose we were brought that we might give and take his news i remember well that i dropped out of the saddle at the door of his lodgings and could scarce stand on my legs so weary was i with the long and swift riding  never had i ridden so far and so fast fresh horses standing saddled and bridled for thomas scott and me at every stage but the beast which i had hired i sent back from the first stage to mine host of the hanging sword  not without labour i climbed the stairs to the chamber of messire ambrose who bade us sit down and called for wine to be given us whereof thomas scott drank well but i dared take none lest my legs should wholly refuse their office  when thomas had told how all the country lay at the kings peace and how our purpose was to ride to the king at senlis the knight bade us rather make what haste we might to st denis  for there by tomorrow or next day the king is like to be and the assault will be delivered on paris come of it what will  with this he bade us good speed but to guess from his countenance was in no high hopes  and at supper whereto we had the company of certain of his menatarms i could well perceive that they were not in the best heart  for now we heard how the maid being sorrowful for the long delays had bidden the duc dalencon ride forth with her from compiegne to see paris closer than yet she had seen it  the duc dalencon who in late days has so strangely forgotten the loyalty of his youth was then fain to march with her for they two were the closest friends that might be  therefore they had passed by way of senlis where they were joined by some force of menatarms and so on the third days march they came to st denis where they were now lying  here it is that the kings of france have been buried for these eight hundred years in the great abbey  nom dieu said one of those who spoke with us  you might deem that our king is nowise pressed to see the place where his forefathers lie for dalencon is riding now and again to senlis to rouse the king and make him march to st denis with the army that the assault may be given  but if they were bidding him to his own funeral instead of to a gentle passage of arms he could not make more excuses  there are skirmishes under paris walls and at the gates day by day and the maid rides here and there considering of the best place for the onslaught but the king tarries and without him and the army they can venture on no great valiance  nevertheless come he must if they bring him bound in a cart  wherefore if you want your part in what is toward you do well to make no long tarrying here  i was of the same mind and as the king was shortly to be looked for at st denis we rode thither early next morning with what speed we might on our left like a cloud was the smoke of paris making me understand what a great city it was much greater than orleans  before us far away were the tall towers of the chapel of st denis to be our guide we heard also the noise of ordnance being fired and therefore made the greater haste and we so rode that about six hours after noon on the eve of the nativity of our blessed lady we reached the gates of the town  here we found great press of folk men coming and going some carrying the wounded for there had been a skirmish that day at one of the paris gates whence came the sound of cannon and culverins and we had won little advantage  at the gates of st denis we asked where the quarters of the scots menat arms might be and were told in the chapel whither we needed no guide but as we went up the street we saw women leaning forth from the windows laughing with the menatarms and beckoning to them and by the tavern doors many were sitting drinking with girls beside them and others were playing dice and many an oath we heard and foul words as is customary in a camp  verily i saw well that this was not the army of men clean confessed and of holy life who had followed the maid from blois to orleans  in place of priests here were harlots and for hymns ribald songs for men had flocked in from every quarter soldiers of the robber companies bretons germans italians spaniards all talking in their own speech rude foul and disorderly  so we took our way as best we knight through the press hearing oaths enough if our horses trod over near any man and seeing daggers drawn  it was a pleasure to come out on the great parvise where the red white and green of our scots were the commonest colours and where the air was less foul and noisome than in the narrow wynds  high above us the great towers of the abbey shone red and golden in the light of the sinking sun while beneath all was brown dusk and dim with smoke  on these towers i could gladly have looked long and not wearied  for they are all carven with the holy company of the martyrs and saints like the angels whom jacob saw ascending by the ladder into heaven even so that blessed company seemed to scale upwards from the filth of the street and the darkness and the din right on towards the golden heights of the city of god  and beneath them lie the sacred bones of all the kings of france from the days of st dagobert even to our own time all laid there to rest where no man shall disturb them till the angels trumpet calls and the day of judgment is at hand  verily it is a solemn place for a christian man to think on and i was gazing thereupon as in a dream when one plucked my sleeve and turning i saw randal rutherford all his teeth showing in a grin  welcome he cried  you have made good speed and the beginning of a fray is better than the end of a feast  and by st boswell tomorrow we shall have it lad  the king came in todaylate is better than neverand tomorrow we go with the maid to give these pockpuddings a taste of scottish steel  and the maid where is she randal  she lodges beyond the paris gate at the windmill wherefrom she drove the english some days agone  wherefore not in the town i asked  mayhap because she likes to be near her work and would that all were of her mind  and mayhap she loves not the sight of the wenches whom she was wont to drive from the camp above all now that she has broken the holy sword of fierbois smiting a lass with the flat of the blade  i like not the omen said i  freits follow them that freits fear said randal in our country speech  and the maid is none of these  well it was said she that i trusted not my life to a blade that breaks so easily and in the next skirmish she took a burgundian with her own hands and now wears his sword which is a good cut and thrust piece  but come he cried if needs you must see the maid you have but to walk to the paris gate and so to the windmill hard by  and your horse i will stable with our own and for quarters we living scots menatarms fare as well as the dead kings of france for tonight we lie in the chapel  i dismounted and he gave me an embrace and holding me at armslength laughed  you never were a tall man norman but you look sound and whole and tough for your inches like a highlandmans dirk  now be off on your errand and when it is done look for me yonder at the sign of the crane pointing across the parvise to a tavern for i keep a word to tell in your lug that few wot of and that it will joy you to hear  to morrow lad we go in foremost  and so smiling he took my horse and went his way whistling hey tuttie tattie  verily his was the gladdest face i had seen and his words put some heart into me whereas of the rest save our own scots i liked neither what i saw nor what i heard  i had but to walk down the street through elbowing throngs of grooms pages menatarms and archers till i found the paris gate whence the windmill was plain to behold  it was such an old place as we see in northern france plain strong with red walls which the yellow mosses stain and with high grey roofs  the maids banner with the holy dove and the sacred name drooped above the gateway and beside the door on the mountingstone sat the boy louis des coutes her page  he was a lad of fifteen years merry enough of his nature and always went gaily clad and wearing his yellow hair long  but now he sat thoughtful on the mountingstone cutting at a bit of wood with his dagger  so you have come to take your part he said when we had saluted each the other  faith i hope you bring good luck with you and more joy to my mistress for we need all that you can bring  why what ails all of you i asked  i have seen never a hopeful face save that of one of my own countrymen  you are not afraid of a crack on your curly pate are you  curly or not my head knows better than to knock itself against paris walls  they are thick and high and the windows of every house on the wall are piled with stones to drop upon us  and i know not well why but things go ill with us  i never saw her and he nodded towards the open gateway so out of comfort  when there is fighting toward she is like herself and she is the first to rise and the last to lie down  but in all our waiting here she has passed many an hour praying in the chapel where the dead kings lie yet her face is not glad when she comes forth  it was wont to shine strangely when she had been praying at the chapel in couldray while we were at chinon  but now it is otherwise moreover we saw paris very close today and there were over many red crosses of st george upon the walls  and tomorrow is the feast of the blessed virgin no day for bloodshed  faint heart said i and indeed after the assault on paris louis des coutes went back and rode no more with the maid  the better the day the better the deed  may i go within  i will go with you he said for she said that you would come and bade me bring you to her  we entered the gateway together and before us lay the square of the farm strewn with litter and from within the byre we heard the milk ring in the pails for the women were milking the cows  and there we both stood astonished for we saw the maid as never yet i had seen her  she was bareheaded but wore the rest of her harness holding in her hand a measure of corn  all the fowls of the air seemed to be about her expecting their meat  but she was not throwing the grain among them for she stood as still as a graven image and wonderful to tell a dove was perched on her shoulder and a mavis was nestling in her breast while many birds flew round her chiefly doves with burnished plumage flitting as it were lovingly and softly brushing her now and again with their wings  many a time had i heard it said that while she was yet a child the wild birds would come and nestle in the bosom of the maid but i had never believed the tale  yet now i saw this thing with mine own eyes a fair sight and a marvellous so beautiful she looked with head unhelmeted and the wild fowl and tame flitting about her and above her the doves crooning sweetly in their soft voices  then her lips moved and she spoke  tres doulx dieu en lonneur de vostre saincte passion je vous requier se vous me aimes que vous me revelez ce que je doy faire demain pour vostre gloire  so she fell silent again and to me it seemed that i must not any longer look upon that holy mystery so crossing myself i laid my hand on the shoulder of the page and we went silently from the place  have you ever seen it in this manner i whispered when we were again without the farmyard  never said he trembling though once i saw a stranger thing  and what may that have been  nay i spoke of it to her and she made me swear that i never would reveal it to living soul save in confession  but she is not as other women  what he had in his mind i know not but i bade him good even and went back into the town where lights were beginning to show in the casements in the space within the gates were many carts gathered full of faggots wherewith to choke up the fosse under paris and tables to throw above the faggots and so cross over to the assault     chapter xxihow a hundred scots set forth to take paris town   entering the tavern of the crane i found the doorways crowded with archers of our guard among whom was randal rutherford  when i had come they walked into a chamber on the ground floor calling for wine and bidding certain french burgesses go forth who needed no second telling  the door was shut two sentinels of ours were posted outside and then randal very carefully sounded all the panels of the room looking heedfully lest there should be any hole whereby what passed among us might be heard in another part of the house but he found nothing of the kind  the room being full some sitting and some standing as we could randal bade father urquhart our chaplain tell us to what end we had been called together  the good father thereupon stood up and spoke in a low voice but so that all could hear for we were all hushed to listen  there is he said within paris a certain carmelite a frenchman and a friend of brother richard the preacher whom as you know the english drove from the town  i saw him at troyes said one where he kneeled before the maid and they seemed very loving  that is the man that is brother richard  now as i was busy tending the wounded in the skirmish three days agone this carmelite was about the same duty for those of his party  he put into my hand a slip of paper wherein brother richard commended him to any scot or frenchman of the kings party as an honest man and a friend of the kings  when i had read this the carmelite spoke with me in latin and in a low voice his matter was this in paris he said there is a strong party of armagnacs who have as we all know a long score to settle with them of burgundy  they are of the common folk and labourers but among them are many rich burgesses  they have banded themselves together by an oath to take our part within the town if once we win a gate  here is a cedule signed by them with their names or marks and this he gave me as a proof of good faith  here he handed a long slip of parchment all covered with writing to randal and it went round among us but few there were clerks save myself  i looked on it and the names many of them attested by seals with coat armour were plain to be read  their counsel is to muster in arms secretly and to convey themselves one by one into certain houses hard by the port st denis where certain of their party dwell  now very early tomorrow morning before dawn the purpose of the english is to send forth a company of a hundred menat arms who will make a sudden onset on the windmill where the maid lies tonight and so will take her if they may  by st bride of douglas said one of us they will get their kail through the reek for our guard is to lie in arms about the windmill and be first in the field tomorrow  the craft is then father urquhart went on that we shall destroy this english company with sword or arrow but with no alarm of culverins or cannon  meanwhile some five score of you will put on tonight the red cross of st george with plain armour so that the english shall mistake you for their own men returning from the sally and some few men in our own colours and coats you will hale with you as prisoners  and if one of you can but attire himself in some gear of the maids with a hucque of hers scarlet and dight with the lilies of france the english gatewards will open to you all the more eagerly  by the bones of st boswell cried randal in his loud voice but the good father put a hand on his mouth  quiet man he said  by the blessed bones of st boswell randal said again as near a whisper as he could attain to the lady of the linenbasket shall come as the maid  we have no man so maidenly  they all shouted laughing and beating the tables with hands and tankards  silence cried robin lindsay  nay the louder we laugh the less will any suspect what is forward said randal rutherford  norman will you play this part in the mumming  i was ashamed to say no though i liked it not over well and i nodded with my head  how maidenly he blushes cried one and there was another clamour till the walls rang  so be it then says father urquhart and now you know all  the honest armagnacs will rise so soon as you are well within the gate  they command both sides of the street that leads to the port st denis and faith if the english want to take it when a hundred scots are within they will have to sally forth by another gate and come from the outside and you are to run up the banner of scotland over the port when once you hold it so the french attack will be thereby  we played the same game before verneuil fight and won it said one will the english have forgotten the trick  by st bride when once they see us haling the maid along they will forget old stratagems of war  this is a new device  oh to see their faces when we cry st andrew and set on  i am not so old as you all in the wars i began  no mademoiselle la lavandiere but you are of the right spirit with your wenchs face  but i said how if the english that are to attack the windmill in the first grey of the morning come not to handstrokes or take to their heels when they find us awake and win back to paris before us  our craft methinks is to hold them in an ambush but what if we catch them not  let but one runaway be swift of foot and we are undone  there is this to be said quoth father urquhart that the english company is to sally forth by the port st denis and it is the port st denis that our armagnacs will be guarding  now i speak as a man of peace for that is my calling  but how would it be if your hundred men and norman set forth in the dark and lay hid not very far from the st denis gate  then some while after the lighting of the balefires from the windmill to be lit when the english set on make straight for the gate and cry st george for england  if you see not the balefires ere daylight you will come back with what speed you may but if you do see them then  father you have not lived long on the highland line for nothing quoth robin lindsay  a very proper stratagem indeed i said but now gentlemen there is one little matter how will sir hugh kennedy take this device of ours  if we try it and fail without his privity we had better never return but die under paris wall  and even if we hold the gate and paris town is taken faith i would rather affront the fire of john the lorrainer than the face of sir hugh  no man spoke there were not two minds on this matter so after some chaffer of words it was agreed to send father urquhart with randal to show the whole scheme to sir hugh while the rest of us should await their coming back with an answer  in no long time they were with us the father very red and shamefaced  he gave the good father the rough side of his tongue quoth randal for speaking first to me and not to him  happily we were over cunning to say aught of our gathering here  but when he had let his bile flow he swore and said that he could spare a hundred dyvour loons of his command on the cast of the dice and now silence all not a word or a cry here he held up his hand we are to take fortune of war  every man grinned gladly on his neighbour in dead stillness  now said randal slip out by threes and fours quietly and to quarters but you norman wait with me     chapter xxiihow norman leslie fared in paris town   norman my lad all our fortunes are made said randal to me when we were left alone  there will be gilt spurs and gold for every one of us and the pick of the plunder  i like it not i answered whereon he caught me rudely by both shoulders looking close into my face so that the fume of the wine he had been drinking reached my nostrils  is a leslie turning recreant he asked in a low voice  a pretty tale to tell in the kingdom of fife  i stood still my heart very hot with anger and said no word while his grip closed on me  leave hold i cried at last and i swore an oath may the saints forgive mei will not go  he loosed his grasp on me and struck one hand hard into the other  that i should see this and have to tell it he said and stepping to the table he drank like one thirsty and then fell to pacing the chamber  he seemed to be thinking slowly as he wiped and plucked at his beard  what is it that ails you he asked  look you this onfall and stratagem of war may not miscarry  perdition take the fool it is safe  have i been seeking safety since you knew me i asked  verily no and therefore i wonder at you the more but you have been long sick and mens minds are changeful  consider the thing nom dieu if there be no two lights shown from the mill we step back silently and all is as it was the english have thought worse of their night onfall or the carmelites message was ruse de guerre  but if we see the two lights then the hundred english are attempting the taking of the mill the st denis gate is open for their return and we are looked for by our armagnacs within paris  we risk but a short tussle with some drowsy pock puddings and then the town is ours  the gate is as strong to hold against an enemy from within as from without  why man run to louis de coutes and beg a cast suit of the maids she has plenty for she is a woman in this that dearly she loves rich attire  randal i said i will go with you and the gladdest lad in france to be going but i will go in my own proper guise as a manatarms  to wear the raiment of the blessed maid a man and a sinner like me i will in nowise consent it is neither seemly nor honourable  take your own way put me under arrest if you will and spoil my fortunes and make me a man disgraced but i will not wear her holy raiment  it is not the deed of a gentleman or of a christian  he plucked at his beard  i am partly with you he said  and yet it were a great bourde to play off on the english and most like to take them and to be told of in ballad and chronicle like one of wallaces onfalls  for seeing the pucelle as they will deem in our hands they will think all safe and welcome us open armed  o norman can we do nothing  stop will you wear another womans short kirtle over your cuisses and taslet  she shall be no saint i warrant you but for a sinner a bonny lass and a merry  as a gentleman i deem this fair stratagem of war  if i were your own brotherthe saints have his soul in their keepingi would still be of this counsel  will you my lad  he looked so sad and yet withal so comical that i held out my hand to him laughing  disguise me as you will i said i have gone mumming as maid marion before now in the robin hood play at st andrews and as i spoke i saw the tall thatched roofs of south street and the priory gates open the budding elms above the garden wall of st leonards and all the may day revel of a year agone pouring out into the good town  you speak like yourself now bless your beardless face  come forth he said taking a long pull at a tankardthat nothing might be wastedand so we went to quarters and randal trudged off soon coming back laughing with the red kirtle  our men had been very busy furbishing up the red cross of st george on their breasts and stripping themselves of any sign of our own colours  as for my busking never had maid such rough tirewomen but by one way or another the apparel was accommodated and they all said that at a little distance of ground the english would be finely fooled and must deem that the maid herself was being led to them captive  it was now in the small hours of morning dark save for the glimmer of stars here and there in a cloudy sky  father urquhart himself went up to the roof of the mill to say his orisons having with him certain faggots of pitchwood for lighting the beaconfires if need were and as it chanced braziers to this end stood ready on the roof as is custom on our own border keeps  we scots a hundred in all in english colours with three or four as prisoners in our own badges fared cautiously and with no word spoken through dewy woods or lurking along in dry ditches where best we might towards the st denis gate of paris  i had never been on a night surprise or bushment before and i marvelled how orderly the others kept as men used to such work whereas i went stumbling and blindlings  at length within sight of the twinkling lights of paris and a hundred yards or thereby off the common way we were halted in a little wood and bidden to lie down no man was so much as to whisper  some slept i know for i heard their snoring but for my part i never was less in love with sleep  when the sky first grew grey so that we could dimly see shapes of things we heard a light noise of marching men on the road  the english whispered he that lay next me  hush breathed randal and so the footsteps went by none of us daring to stir for fear of the rustle in the leaves  the sound soon ceased belike they had struck off into these very fields wherethrough we had just marched  now robin lindsay climb into yonder ashtree and keep your eyes on the mill and the beaconfires said randal  robin scrambled up not easily because of his armour and we waited as it seemed for an endless time  what is that sound whispered one so heavy and so hoarse  it was my own heart beating as if it would burst my side but i said nought and even then robin slid from the tree as lightly as he might he held up two fingers without a word for a sign that the beacons were lighted and nodded  down all whispered randal  give them time give them time  so there we lay as we must but that was the hardest part of the waiting and no sound but of the fowls and wild things arousing and the cry of sentinels from paris walls came to our ears  at length randal said up all and onwards  we arose loosened our swords in their sheaths and so crossed to the road  we could now see paris plainly and were close by the farm of the mathurins while beyond was the level land they call les porcherons with slopes above it and many trees  now norman said randal when we come within clear sight of the gate two of us shall seize you by the arms as prisoner then we all cry st george and set off running towards paris  the quicker the less time for discovery  so having marched orderly and speedily while the banks of the roadway hid us we set off to run randal and robin gripping me when we were full in sight of the moat of the drawbridge which was down and the gate  then our men all cried st george for england  the witch is taken and so running disorderly and fast we made for the port while english menatarms might be plainly seen and heard gazing waving their hands and shouting from the battlements of the two gatetowers  down the road we ran past certain small houses of peasants and past a gibbet with a marauder hanging from it just over the dry ditch  our feet we three leading with some twenty in a clump hard behind us rang loud on the drawbridge over the dry fosse  the bridge planks quivered strangely we were now within the gateway when down fell the portcullis behind us the drawbridge creaking flew up a crowd of angry faces and red crosses were pressing on us and a blow fell on my salade making me reel  i was held in strong arms swords shone out above me i stumbled on a bodyit was robin lindsaysi heard randal give a curse as his blade broke on a helmet and cry i yield me rescue or no rescue  then burst forth a blast of shouts and words of command and yells and english curses  cannonshot roared overhead and my mouth was full of sulphur smoke and dust  they were firing on those of our men who had not set foot on the drawbridge when it flew up  soon the portcullis rose again and the bridge fell to let in a band of english archers through whom our scots were cutting their way back towards st denis  of all this i got glimpses rather than clear sight as the throng within the gateway reeled and shifted crushing me sorely  presently the english from without trooped in laughing and cursing welcomed by their fellows and every man of them prying into my face and gibing  it had been a settled plan we were betrayed it was over clear and now a harsh voice behind making me turn i saw the wolfs face of father thomas under his hood and his yellow fangs  ha fair clerk they that be no clerks themselves may yet hire clerks to work for them  how like you my brother the carmelite  then i knew too well how this stratagem had all been laid by that devil and my heart turned to water within me  randal was led away but round me the crowd gathered in the open space for i was haled into the greater gate tower beyond the wet fosse and from all quarters ran soldiers and men women and children of the town to mock me  behold her cried father thomas climbing on a mountingstone as one who would preach to the people while the soldiers that held me laughed  behold this wonderful wonder of all wonders the miraculous maid of the armagnacs  she boasted that by help of the saints she would be the first within the city and lo she is the first but she has come without her army  she is every way a miracle mark you for she hath a down on her chin such as no common maidens wear and if she would but speak a few words of counsel methinks her tongue would sound strangely scottish for a lorrainer  speak speak shouted the throng  dogs i cried in french dogs and cowards  you shall see the maid closer before nightfall and fly from her as you have fled before  said i not so asked brother thomas  a miracle a miracle the maid hath a scots tongue in her head  therewith stones began to fall but the father holding up his hand bade the multitude refrain  harm her not good brethren for tomorrow this maid shall be tried by the ordeal of fire if that be the will of our governors  then shall we see if she can work miracles or not and so he went on gibing while they grinned horribly upon me  never saw i so many vile faces of the basest people come together from their filthy dens in paris  but as my eyes ran over them with loathing i beheld a face i knew the face of that violer woman who had been in our company before we came to chinon and lo perched on her shoulder chained with a chain fastened round her wrist was elliots jackanapes  to see the poor beast that my lady loved in such ill company seemed as if it would break my heart and my head fell on my breast  ye mark brethren and sisters she likes not the name of the ordeal by fire cried brother thomas whereon i lifted my face again to defy him and i saw the violer woman bend her brows and place her finger as it were by peradventure on her lips wherefore i was silent only gazing on that devil but then rang out a trumpetnote blowing the call to arms and from afar came an answering call from the quarter of st denis  carry him or her or whatever the spy is into the outer gate tower said a captain put him in fetters and manacles lock the door and leave him and then to quarters  and you friar hold your gibing tongue lad or lass he has borne him bravely  six menatarms he chose out to do his bidding and while the gates were cleared of the throng and trumpets were sounding and church bells were rung backwards for an alarm i was dragged with many a kick and blow over the drawbridge up the stairs of the tower and so was thrown into a strong room beneath the battlements  there they put me in bonds gave me of their courtesy a jug of water and a loaf of black bread by me and then taking my dagger my sword and all that was in my pouch they left me with curses  you shall hear how the onfall goes belike they said and tomorrow shall be your judgment  with that the door grated and rang the key was turned in the lock and their iron tread sounded on the stone stairs going upwards  the room was high narrow and lit by a barred and stanchioned window far above my reach even if i had been unbound  i shame to say it but i rolled over on my face and wept  this was the end of my hopes and proud heart that they would burn me despite their threats i scarce believed for i had in nowise offended holy church or in matters of the faith and only for such heretics or wicked dealers in artmagic is lawfully ordained the death by fire  but here was i prisoner all that i had won at orleans would do little more than pay my own ransom from the end of my risk and travail i was now further away than ever  so i mused weeping for very rage but then came a heavy rolling sound overhead as of moving wheeled pieces of ordnance  thereon so near is hope to us in our despair i plucked up some heart  ere nightfall paris might be in the hands of the king and all might be well  the roar and rebound of cannon overhead told me that the fighting had begun and now i prayed with all my heart that the maid as ever might again be victorious  so i lay there listening and heard the great artillery bellow and the roar of guns in answer the shouting of men and clang of church bells  now and again the walls of the tower rang with the shock of a cannonball once an arrow flew through the casement and shattered itself on the wall above my head  i scarce know why but i dragged me to the place where it fell and put the arrowpoint in my bosom  smoke of wood and pitch darkened the light they had come then to close quarters  but once more rang the rattle of guns the whizzing rush of stones the smiting with axe or sword on wooden barrier and steel harness the cries of war mont joye st denis  st george for england and slogans too i heard as bellenden a home a home and then i knew the scots were there fighting in the front  but alas how different was the day when first i heard our own battlecries under orleans walls  then i had my life and my sword in my hands to spend and to strike but now i lay a lonely prisoner helpless and all but hopeless yet even so i clashed my chains and shouted when i heard the slogan  thus with noise and smoke and trumpets blowing the charge or the recall and our pipes shrieking the pibroch high above the din with dust floating and plaster dropping from the walls of my cell till i was wellnigh stifled the day wore on nor could i tell in anywise how the battle went  the main onslaught i knew was not on the gate behind the tower in which i lay though that tower also was smitten of cannonballs  at length well past midday as i deemed by the light came a hush and then a thicker smoke and taste of burning pitchwood and a roar as if all paris had been blown into midair so that my tower shook while heavy beams fell crashing to earth  again came a hush and then one voice clear as a clarion call even the voice of the maid tirez en avant en avant  how my blood thrilled at the sound of it  it must be now i thought or never but the guns only roared the louder the din grew fierce and fiercer till i heard a mighty roar the english shouting aloud as one man for joy for so their manner is  thrice they shouted and my heart sank within me  had they slain the maid  i knew not but for torment of soul there is scarce any greater than so to lie bound and alone seeing nought but guessing at what is befalling  after these shouts it was easy to know that the fighting waned and was less fierce  the day moreover turned to thunder and waxed lowering and of a stifling heat  yet my worst fears were ended for i heard now and again the clear voice of the maid bidding her men fight on for all was theirs  but the voice was weaker now and other than it had been  so the day darkened only once and again a shot was fired and in the dusk the shouts of the english told me over clearly that for today our chance and hope were lost  then the darkness grew deeper and a star shone through my casement and feet went up and down upon the stairs but no man came near me  below there was some faint cackle of mirth and laughter and at last the silence fell  once more came a swift step on the stairs as of one stumbling up in haste  the key rattled in the wards a yellow light shone in a manat arms entered he held a torch to my face looked to my bonds and then gave me a kick while one cried from below come on dickon your meat is cooling  so he turned and went out the door clanging behind him and the key rattling in the wards  in pain and fierce wrath i gnawed my black bread drank some of the water and at last i bethought me of that which should have been first in the thoughts of a christian man and i prayed  remembering the story of michael hamilton which i have already told and other noble and virtuous miracles of madame st catherine of fierbois i commanded me to her that by gods grace she would be pleased to release me from bonds and prison  and i promised that if she would so favour me i would go on pilgrimage to her chapel of fierbois  i looked that my chains should now fall from my limbs but finding no such matter and being very weary for all the last night i had slept none i fell on slumber and forgot my sorrow  belike i had not lain long in that blessed land where trouble seldom comes when i was wakened as it were by a tugging at my clothes  i sat up but the room was dark save for a faint light in the casement high overhead and i thought i had dreamed  howbeit as i lay down again heavy at heart my clothes were again twitched and now i remembered what i had heard but never believed concerning lutins or brownies as we call them which being spirits invisible and reckoned to have no part in our salvation are wont in certain houses to sport with men  curious rather than affrighted i sat up once more and looked around when i saw two bright spots of light in the dark  then deeming that for some reason unknown to me the prison door had been opened while i slept and a cat let in i stretched out my hands towards the lights thence came a sharp faint cry and something soft and furry leaped on to my breast stroking me with little hands  it was elliots jackanapes very meagre as i could feel and all his ribs standing out but he made much of me fondling me after his manner and indeed for my ladys sake i kissed him wondering much how he came there  then he put something into my hands almost as if he had been a christian for it was a wise beast and a kind  even then there shone into my memory the thought of how my lady had prayed for her little friend when he was stolen which i had thought strange and scarcely warranted by our faith and with that hope wakened within me  my eyes being now more accustomed to the darkness i saw that the thing which the jackanapes gave me was a little wallet for he had been taught to fetch and carry and never was such a marvel at climbing  but as i was caressing him i found a string about his neck to which there seemed to be no end  now at length i comprehended what was toward and pulling gently at the string i found after some time that it was attached to something heavy on the outside of the casement  therefore i set about drawing in string from above and more string and more and then appeared a knot and a splice and the end of a thick rope  so i drew and drew till it stopped and i could see a stout bar across the stanchions of the casement  thereon i ceased drawing and opening the little wallet i found two files one very fine the other of sturdier fashion  verily then i blessed the violer woman who at great peril of her own life and by such witty device as doubtless madame st catherine put into her heart had sent the jackanapes up from below and put me in the way of safety  i wasted no time but began filing not at the thick circlet on my wrist but at a link of the chain whereto it was made fast  and such was the temper of the file that soon i got the stouter weapon into the cut and snapped the link and so with the others working long hours and often looking fearfully for the first glimmer of dawn  this had not come in when i was now free of bonds but there was yet the casement to be scaled  with all my strength i dragged and jerked at the rope whereby i meant to climb lest the stanchions should be rusted through and unable to bear my weight but they stood the strain bravely then i cast off my womans kirtle and took from my pouch the arrowpoint and therewith scratched hastily on the plastered wall in great letters norman leslie of pitcullo leaves his malison on the english  next i bound the jackanapes within the bosom of my doublet with a piece of the cord whereto the rope had been knotted for i could not leave the little beast to die the death of a traitor and bring suspicion moreover on the poor violer woman  then commanding myself to the saints and especially thanking madame st catherine i began to climb hauling myself up by the rope whereon i had made knots to this end nor was the climbing more difficult than to scale a branchless beech trunk for a birds nest which like other boys i had often done  so behold me at last with my legs hanging in free air seated on the sill of the casement  happily of the three iron stanchions though together they bore my weight one was loose in the lower socket for lack of lead and this one i displaced easily enough and so passed through  then i put the wooden bar at the ropes end within the room behind the two other stanchions considering that they by themselves would bear my weight but if not rather choosing to trust my soul to the saints than my body to the english  the deep below me was very terrible to look upon and the casement being above the dry ditch i had no water to break my fall if fall i must howbeit i hardened my heart and turning my face to the wall holding first the wooden bar and then shifting my grasp to the rope i let myself down clinging to the rope with my legs and at first not a little helped by the knots i had made to climb to the casement  when i had passed these methought my hands were on fire nevertheless i slid down slowly and with caution till my feet touched ground  i was now in the dry ditch above my head creaked and swung the dead body of the hanged marauder but he did no whit affray me  i ran stooping along the bed of the dry ditch for many yards stumbling over the bodies of men slain in yesterdays fight and then creeping out i found a hollow way between two slopes and thence crawled into a wood where i lay some little space hidden by the boughs  the smell of trees and grass and the keen air were like wine to me i cooled my bleeding hands in the deep dew and presently in the dawn i was stealing towards st denis taking such cover of ditches and hedges as we had sought in our unhappy march of yesterday  and i so sped by favour of the saints that i fell in with no marauders but reaching the windmill right early at first trumpetcall i was hailed by our sentinels for the only man that had won in and out of paris and had carried off moreover a prisoner the jackanapes  to see me scarred with manacles on my wrists and gyves on my ankles weaponless with an ape on my shoulder was such a sight as the scots guard had never beheld before and carrying me to the smiths they first knocked off my irons and gave me wine ere they either asked me for my tale or told me their own which was a heartbreak to bear  for no man could unfold the manner of that which had come to pass if at least there were not strong treason at the root of all  for our part of the onfall the english had made but a feigned attack on the mill wherefore the balefires were lit to our undoing  this was the ruse de guerre of the accursed cordelier brother thomas  for the rest the maid had led on a band to attack the gate st honore with gaucourt in her company a knight that had no great love either of her or of a desperate onslaught  but dalencon whom she loved as a brother was commanded to take another band and wait behind a butte or knowe out of danger of arrowshot  the maid had stormed all day at her gate had taken the boulevard without and burst open and burned the outer port and crossed the dry ditch  but when she had led up her men now few over the slope and to the edge of the wet fosse behold no faggots and bundles of wood were brought up whereby as is manner of war to fill up the fosse and so cross over  as she then stood under the wall shouting for faggots and scalingladders her standardbearer was shot to death and she was sorely wounded by an arbalest bolt  natheless she lay by the wall still crying on her men but nought was ready that should have been many were slain by shafts and cannonshot and in the dusk she weeping and crying still that the place was theirs to take dalencon carried her off by main force set her on her horse and so brought her back to st denis  now my mind was and is to this day that there was treason here and a black stain on the chivalry of france to let a girl go so far and not to follow her  but of us scots many were slain and more wounded while robin lindsay died in paris gate and randal rutherford lay a prisoner in english hands     chapter xxiiihow elliots jackanapes came home   of our blessed lord himself it is said in the gospel of st matthew et non fecit ibi virtutes multas propter incredulitatem illorum  these words i willingly leave in the roman tongue for by the wisdom of holy church it is deemed that many mysteries should not be published abroad in the vulgar speech lest the unlearned hear to their own confusion  but if even he doubtless by the wisdom of his own will did not many great works propter incredulitatem it is the less to be marvelled at that his saints through the person of the blessed maid were of no avail where men utterly disbelieved  and that where infidelity was even she must labour in vain was shown anon even on this very day of my escape out of paris town  for i had scarce taken some food and washed and armed myself when the maids trumpets sounded and she herself armed and on horseback despite her wound rode into st denis to devise with the gentle duc dalencon  together they came forth from the gate and i being in their company heard her cry  by my baton i will never go back till i take that city 31  these words percival de cagny also heard a good knight and maitre dhotel of the house of alencon  thereon arose some dispute dalencon being eager as indeed he always was to follow where the maiden led and some others holding back  now as they were devising together some for some against for menat arms not a few had fallen in the onfall there came the sound of horses hoofs and lo messire de montmorency who had been of the party of the english and with them in paris rode up leading a company of fifty or sixty gentlemen of his house to join the maid  thereat was great joy and new courage in all men of goodwill seeing that within paris itself so many gentlemen deemed ours the better cause and the more hopeful  thus there was an end of all dispute our companies were fairly arrayed and we were marching to revenge ourselves for the losses of yesterday when two knights came spurring after us from st denis  they were the duc de bar and that unhappy charles de bourbon comte de clermont by whose folly or illwill or cowardice the scots were betrayed and deserted at the battle of the herrings where my own brother fell as i have already told  this second time charles de bourbon brought evil fortune for he came on the kings part straitly forbidding dalencon and the maid to march forward another lances length  whereat dalencon swore profane and the maiden weeping rebuked him  so with heavy hearts we turned all the host of us and went back to quarters the maid to pray in the chapel and the menatarms to drink and speak ill of the king  all this was on the ninth of september a weary day to all of us though in the evening word came that we were to march early next morning and attack paris in another quarter crossing the river by a bridge of boats which the duc dalencon had let build to that end  after two wakeful nights i was well weary and early laid me down to sleep rising at dawn with high hopes  and so through the grey light we marched silently to the place appointed but bridge there was none for the king having heard of the maids intent had caused men to work all night long destroying that which the gentle duke had builded  had the king but heard the shouts and curses of our company when they found nought but the bare piles standing the grey water flowing and the boats and planks vanished he might have taken shame to himself of his lack of faith therefore i say it boldly it was because of mens unbelief that the maid at paris wrought no great works save that she put her body in such hazard of war as never did woman nay nor man since the making of the world  i have no heart to speak more of this shameful matter nor of these days of anger and blasphemy  it was said and believed that her voices bade the maid abide at st denis till she should take paris town but the king and charles de bourbon and the archbishop of reims refused to hearken to her  on the thirteenth day of september after dinner the king with all his counsellors rode away from st denis towards gien on the loire  the maiden for her part hung up all her harness that she had worn save the sword of st catherine of fierbois in front of the altar of our lady and the blessed relics of st denis in the chapel thereafter she rode as needs she must and we of her company with her to join the king for so he commanded  and now was the will of the maid and of the duc dalencon broken and broken was all that great army whereof some were free lances out of many lands but more were nobles of france with their men who had served without price or pay for love of france and of the maid  never again were they mustered nay when after some weeks passed the gentle duc dalencon prayed that he might have the maiden with him and burst into normandy where the english were strongest by the marches of maine even this grace was refused to him by the malengin and illwill of la tremouille and the archbishop of reims  and these two fair friends met never more again neither at fray nor feast  may she among the saints so work by her prayers that the late sin and treason of the gentle duke may be washed out and made clean for while she lived there was no man more dear to her nor any that followed her more stoutly in every onfall  now concerning the times that came after this shameful treason at paris i have no joy to write  the kings counsellors as their manner was ever hankered after a peace with burgundy and they stretched the false truce that was to have ended at christmas to easter day pacem clamantes quo non fuit pax  for there was no truce with the english who took st denis again and made booty of the arms which the maid had dedicated to our lady  on our part la hire and xaintrailles plundered for their own hand the lands of the duke of burgundy and indeed on every side there was no fair fighting such as the maid loved but a war of wastry the peasants pillaged and the poor held to ransom  for her part she spent her days in prayer for the poor and the oppressed whom she had come to deliver and who now were in worse case than before the english harrying certain of the good towns that had yielded to king charles  now her voices ever bade the maid go back to the isle of france and assail paris where lay no english garrison and the armagnacs were stirring as much as they might  but paris being at this time under the government of the duke of burgundy was forsooth within the truce  the kings counsellors therefore setting their wisdom against that of the saints bade the maid go against the towns of st pierre le moustier and la charite then held by the english on the loire  this was in november when days were short and the weather bitter cold  the council was held at mehun sur yevre and forthwith the maid glad to be doing rode to bourges where she mustered her men and so marched to st pierre le moustier a small town but a strong with fosses towers and high walls  there we lay some two days or three plying the town with our artillery and freezing in the winter nights  at length having made somewhat of a breach the maid gave the word for the assault and herself leading with her banner in hand we went at it with what force we might  but twice and thrice we were driven back from the fosse and to be plain our men were fled under cover and only the maid stood within arrowshot of the wall with a few of her household of whom i was one for i could not go back while she held her ground  the arrows and bolts from the town rained and whistled about us and in faith i wished myself other where yet she stood waving her banner and crying tirez en avant ils sont a nous as was her way in every onfall  seeing her thus in jeopardy her maitre dhotel daulon though himself wounded in the heel so that he might not set foot to ground mounted a horse and riding up asked her why she abode there alone and did not give ground like the others  at this the maid lifted her helmet from her head and so uncovered her face like marble for whiteness and her eyes shining like steel made answer  i am not alone with me there are of mine fifty thousand  hence i will not give back one step till i have taken the town  then i wotted well that sinful man as i am i was in the company of the hosts of heaven though i saw them not  great heart this knowledge gave me and others and the maid crying in a loud voice aux fagots tout le monde the very runaways heard her and came back with planks and faggots and so filling up the fosse and passing over we ran into the breach smiting and slaying and the town was taken  for my own part i was so favoured that two knights yielded them my prisoners i being the only man of gentle birth among those who beset them in a narrow wynd and with their ransoms i deemed myself wealthy enough as well i might  so now i could look to win my hearts desire if no ill fortune befell  but little good fortune came in our way  from la charite which was beset in the last days of november we had perforce to give back for the king sent us no munitions of war and for lack of more powder and ball we might not make any breach in the walls of that town  and so by reason of the hard winter and the slackness of the king and the false truce we fought no more at that season but went trailing after the court from castle to castle  many feasts were held and much honour was done to the maid as by gifts of coat armour and the ennobling of all her kith and kin but these things she regarded not nor did she ever bear on her shield the sword supporting the crown between the lilies of france  if these were ill days for the maid i shame to confess that they were merry days with me  there are worse places than a kings court when a man is young and light of heart full of hope and with money in his purse  i looked that we should take the field again in the spring and having gained some gold and even some good words as one not backward where swordstrokes were going i know not what dreams i had of high renown ay and the constables staff to end withal  for many a poor scot has come to great place in france and germany who began with no better fortune than a mind to put his body in peril  moreover the winning of elliot herself for my wife seemed now a thing almost within my reach  therefore as i say i kept a merry yule at jargeau going bravely clad and dancing all night long with the merriest  only the wan face of the maid that in time of war had been so gallant and glad came between me and my pleasures  not that she was wilfully and wantonly sad yet now and again we could mark in her face the great and loving pity that possessed her for france  now i would be half angered with her but again far more wroth with myself who could thus lightly think of that passion of hers  but when she might she was ever at her prayers or in company of children or seeking out such as were poor and needy to whom she was abundantly lavish of her gifts so that wheresoever the court went the people blessed her  in these months i had tidings of elliot now and again and as occasion served i wrote to her with messages of my love and with a gift as of a ring or a jewel  but concerning the manner of my escape from paris i had told elliot nothing for this cause  my desire was when soonest i had an occasion to surprise her with the gift of her jackanapes anew knowing well that nothing could make her greater joy save my own coming or a victory of the maid  the little creature had been my comrade wheresoever we went as at sully gien and bourges only i took him not to the leaguers of st pierre le moustier and la charite but left him with a fair lady of the court  he had waxed fat again for as meagre as he was when he came to me in prison and he was full of new tricks warming himself at the great fire in hall like a man  now in the middle of the month of january in the year of grace fourteen hundred and thirty the maid told us of her household that she would journey to orleans to abide for some space with certain ladies of her friends namely madame de st mesmin and madame de mouchy who loved her dearly  to the most of us she gave holiday to see our own friends  the maid knew surely that in france my friends were few and well she guessed whither i was bound  therefore she sent for me and bidding me carry her love to elliot she put into my hands a gift to her friend  it was a ring of silvergilt fashioned like that which her own father and mother had given her  at this ring she had a custom of looking often so that the english conceived it to be an unholy talisman though it bore the name that is above all names  that ring i now wear in my bosom  so saying farewell with many kind words on her part i rode towards tours where elliot and her father as then dwelt in that same house where i had been with them to be healed of my malady after the leaguer of orleans to tours i rode telling them not of my coming and carrying the jackanapes well wrapped up in furs of the best  the weather was frosty and folk were sliding on the ice of the flooded fields near tours when i came within sight of the great minster  the roads rang hard on the smooth ice the low sun was making paths of gold and i sang as i rode putting up my horse at the sign of the hanging sword i took the ape under my great furred surcoat and stole like a thief through the alleys towards my masters house  the night was falling and all the casement of the great chamber was glowing with the colour and light of a leaping fire within  there came a sound of music too as one touched the virginals to a tune of my own country  my heart was beating for joy as it had beaten in the bushment outside paris town  i opened the outer door secretly for i knew the trick of it and i saw from the thin thread of light on the wall of the passage that the chamber door was a little ajar  the jackanapes was now fretting and struggling within my surcoat so opening the coat i put him down by the chamber door  he gave a little scratch as was his custom for he was a very mannerly little beast and the sound of the virginals ceased  then pushing the door with his little hands he ran in with a kind of cry of joy  in our ladys name what is this came the voice of elliot  my dear dear little friend what make you here  then i could withhold myself no longer but entered and my lady ran to me the jackanapes clinging about her neck with his arms  but mine were round her too and what words we said and what cheer we made each the other i may not write commending me to all true lovers whose hearts shall tell them that whereof i am silent  much was i rebuked for that i did not write to warn them of my coming which was yet the more joyful that they were not warned  and then the good woman elliots kinswoman must be called though in sooth not at the very first and then a great fire must be lit in my old chamber and next my master came in from a tavern where he had been devising with some scots of his friends and all the while the jackanapes kept such a merry coil and played so many of his tricks and got so many kisses from his mistress that it was marvel but of all that had befallen me in the wars and of how the maiden did concerning which elliot had questioned me first of all i would tell them little till supper was brought  and then indeed out came all my tale and they heard of what had been my fortune in paris and how the jackanapes had delivered me from durance whereon never surely was any beast of his kind so caressed since our father adam gave all the creatures their names  but as touching the maid i told how she had borne herself at st pierre le moustier and of all the honours that had been granted to her and i bade them be of good heart and hope for that her banner would be on the wind in spring after easter day  all the good news that might be truly told i did tell as how la hire had taken louviers town and harried the english up to the very gates of rouen  and i gave to elliot the ring which the maid had sent to her fashioned like that she herself wore but of silver gilt whereas the maids was of base metal and it bore the holy names mari ihs  thereon elliot kissed it humbly and avowed herself to be that night the gladdest damsel in all france  for i have gotten you mon ami and my little friend that i had lost beyond all hope and i have a kind word and a token from her la fille de dieu whereat her speech faltered and her eyes swam in tears  but some trick of her jackanapes brought back her mirth and so the hours passed as happy as any in my life  truly the memory of these things tells me how glad this world might be wherein god has placed us were it not troubled by the inordinate desires of men  in my masters house of tours then my days of holiday went merrily by save for one matter and that of the utmost moment  for my master would in no manner permit me to wed his daughter while this war endured and elliot herself blushing like any rose told me that while the maid had need of me with the maid i must abide at my duty and that she herself had no mind for happiness while her friend was yet labouring in the cause of france  howbeit i delivered me of my vow by pilgrimage to the chapel in fierbois 32     chapter xxivhow the maid heard ill tidings from her voices and of the silence of the birds   eastertide came at last and that early easter day falling on march the twentyseventh  our king kept his paques at sully with great festival but his deadly foe the duke of burgundy lay at the town of peronne  so soon as eastertide was over the duke drew all the force he had to montdidier a town which lies some eight leagues to the north and west of compiegne  hence he so wrought that he made a pact with the captain of the french in gournay a town some four leagues north and west of compiegne whereby the garrison there promised to lie idle and make no onslaught against them of burgundy unless the king brought them a rescue  therefore the duke went back to noyon on the oise some eight leagues north and east of compiegne while his captain jean de luxembourg led half his army west towards beauvais  there he took the castle of provenlieu an old castle and ruinous that the english had repaired and held  and there he hanged certain english who were used to pillage all the country about montdidier  thence jean de luxembourg came back to the duke at noyon and took and razed choisy which was held for france  now all these marchings and takings of towns were designed to one end namely that the duke might have free passage over the river oise so that his men and his victual might safely come and go from the east  for manifestly it was his purpose to besiege and take the good town of compiegne which lies on the river oise some fifteen leagues north and east of paris  this town had come in and yielded to the maid some weeks before the onfall of paris and it was especially dear to her for the people had sworn that they would all die and see their wives and children dead rather than yield to england or burgundy  moreover whosoever held compiegne was like in no long time to be master of paris  but as now guillaume de flavy commanded in compiegne for the king a very good knight and skilled captain but a man who robbed and ravished wheresoever he had power  his brother louis de flavy also joined him after choisy fell as i have told  all this i have written that men may clearly know how the maid came by her end  for so soon as eastertide was over and the truce ended she made no tarrying nor even said farewell to the king who might have held her back but drew out all her company and rode northward whither she knew that battle was to be  her mind was to take some strong place on the oise as pont leveque near noyon that she might cut off them of burgundy from all the country eastward of oise and so put them out of the power to besiege compiegne and might destroy all their host at montdidier and in the beauvais country  for the maid was not only the first of captains in leading a desperate onslaught but also by miracle for otherwise it might not be she best knew how to devise deep schemes and subtle stratagem of war  setting forth therefore early in april on the fifteenth day of the month she came to melun a town some seven leagues south of paris that had lately yielded to the king  bidding me walk with her she went afoot about the walls considering what they lacked of strength and how they might best be repaired and bidding me write down all in a little book now we two and no other were walking by the dry fosse of melun the day being very fair and warm for that season the flowers blossoming and the birds singing so sweet and loud as never i heard them before or since that day  the maid stood still to listen holding up her hand to me for silence when lo in one moment in the midst of merry music the birds hushed suddenly  as i marvelled for there was not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of cold wind i beheld the maid standing as i had seen her stand in the farmyard of the mill by st denis  her head was bare and her face was white as snow  so she stood while one might count a hundred and if ever any could say that he had seen the maid under fear it was now  as i watched and wondered she fell on her knees like one in prayer and with her eyes set and straining and with clasped hands she said these wordstell me of that day and that hour or grant me of your grace that in the same hour i may die  then she was silent for short space and then having drawn herself upon her knees for three paces or four she very reverently bowed down and kissed the ground  thereafter she arose and beholding me wan i doubt not she gently laid her hand upon my shoulder and smiling most sweetly she said  i know not what thou hast seen or heard but promise on thine honour that thou wilt speak no word to any man save in confession only while i bear arms for france  then humbly and with tears i vowed as she had bidden me whereto she only said  come we loiter and i have much to do for the day is short  but whether the birds sang again or stinted i know not for i marked it not  but she set herself as before to consider the walls and the fosses bidding me write down in my little book what things were needful  nor was her countenance altered in any fashion nor was her wit less clear but when we had seen all that was to be looked to she bade me call the chief men of the town to her house after vespers and herself went into the church of st michael to pray  though i pondered much on this strange matter which i laid up in my heart i never knew what belike the import was till nigh a year thereafter at rouen  but there one told me how the maid before her judges had said that at melun by the fosse her saints had told her how she should be made prisoner before the feast of st john  and she had prayed them to warn her of that hour or in that hour might she die but they bade her endure all things patiently and with a willing mind  at that coming then of the saints i was present though being a sinful man i knew not that the holy ones were there  but the birds knew and stinted in their singing  now that the maid knowing by inspiration her hour to be even at the doors and wotting well what the end of her captivity was like to be yet had the heart to put herself in jeopardy day by day this i deem the most valiant deed ever done by man or woman since the making of the world  for scarce even wallace wight would have stood to his standard had he known by teaching of them who cannot lie what end awaited him beyond all hope nay he would have betaken him to france as once he did in time of less danger  now i pray you consider who she was that showed this courage and high heart  she was but the daughter of a manant a girl of eighteen years of age  remember then what manner of creature such a girl is of her nature how weak and fearful how she is discomfited and abashed by the company of even one gentleman or lady of noble birth how ignorant she is of war how fond to sport and play with wenches of her own degree how easily set on fire of love and how eager to be in the society of young men amorous  pondering all these things in your hearts judge ye whether this maid the bravest leader in breach the wisest captain having foreknowledge of things hidden and of things to come the most courteous lady who ever with knights sat in hall not knowing carnal love nor bodily fear was aught but a thing miraculous and a sister of the saints     chapter xxvof the onfall at pont leveque and how norman leslie was hurt   i have now shown wherefore the fighting in this spring was to be up and down the water of oise whence the villagers had withdrawn themselves of necessity into the good towns  for the desire of the duke of burgundy was to hold the oise and so take compiegne the better to hold paris and on our side the skill was to cut his army in two so that from east of the water of oise neither men nor victual might come to him  having this subtle device of war in her mind the maid rode north from melun by the kings good towns till she came to compiegne that was not yet beleaguered  there they did her all the honour that might be and thither came to her standard messire jacques de chabennes messire rigault de fontaines messire poton de xaintrailles the best knight then on ground and many other gentlemen some four hundred lances in all 33  with these lances the maid consorted to attack pont leveque by a night onfall  this is a small but very strong hold on the oise some six leagues from compiegne as you go up the river and it lies near the town of noyon which was held by the english  in pont leveque there was a garrison of a hundred lances of the english and our skill was to break on them in the grey of dawn when men least fear a surprise and are most easily taken  by this very device la hire had seized compiegne but six years agone wherefore our hope was the higher  about five of the clock on an april day we rode out of compiegne a great companytoo great perchance for that we had to do  for our army was nigh a league in length as it went on the way nor could we move swiftly for there were waggons with us and carts drawing guns and couleuvrines and powder fascines wherewith to fill the fosses and ladders and double ladders for scaling the walls  so the captains ordered it to be for ever since that day by melun fosse when the saints foretold her captivity the maid submitted herself in all things to the captains which was never her manner before  as we rode slowly she was now at the head of the line now in the midst now at the rear wherever was need and as i rode at her rein i took heart to say  madame it is not thus that we have taken great keeps and holds in my country from our enemies of england  nay said she checking her horse to a walk and smiling on me in the dusk with her kind eyes  then tell me how you order it in your country  madame i said it was with a little force and lightly moving that messire thomas randolph scaled the castle rock and took edinburgh castle out of the hands of the english a keep so strong and set on a cliff so perilous that no man might deem to win it by sudden onfall  and in like manner the good messire james douglas took his own castle more than once or twice by crafty stratagem of war so that the english named it castle perilous  but in every such onfall few men fought for us of such as could move secretly and swiftly not with long trains of waggons that cover a league of road and by their noise and number give warning to an enemy  my mind is yours she said with a sigh and so i would have made this onslaught  but i submitted me to the will of the captains  through the night we pushed our way slowly for in such a march none may go swifter than the slowest namely the carts and the waggons  thus it befell that the maid and the captains were in more thoughts than one to draw back to compiegne for the night was clear and the dawn would be bright  and indeed after stumbling and wandering long and doubting of the way we did at last see the church towers and walls of pont leveque stand out against the clear sky of morning a light mist girdling the basement of the walls  had we been a smaller and swifter company we should have arrived an hour before the first greyness shows the shapes of things  but now alas we no sooner saw the town than we heard the bells and trumpets calling the townsfolk and menatarms to be on their ward  the great guns of the keep roared at us so soon as we were in reach of shot nevertheless pothon and the maid set companies to carry the double ladders for the walls were high and others were told off to bring up the fascines and so leaving our main battle to wait out of shot and come on as they were needed the maid and pothon ran up the first rampart she waving her standard and crying that all was ours  as we ran for i must needs be by her side the din of bells and guns was worse than i had heard at orleans and on the top of the church towers were menatarms waving flags as if for a signal  howbeit we sprang into the fosse under shield wary of stones cast from above and presently three ladders were set against the wall and we went up the maid leading the way  now of what befell i know but little save that i had so climbed that i looked down over the wall when the ladder whereon i stood was wholly overthrown by two great english knights and one of them by his coat armour was messire de montgomery himself who commanded in pont leveque  of all that came after i remember no more than a flight through air and the dead stroke of a fall on earth with a stone above me  for such is the fortune of war whereof a man knows but his own share for the most part and even that dimly  the eyes are often blinded with swift running to be at the wall and what with a helm that rings to swordblows and what with smoke and dust and crying and clamour and roar of guns it is but little that many a manatarms can tell concerning the frays wherein may be he has borne himself not unmanly  this was my lot at pont leveque and i knew but little of what passed till i found myself in very great anguish  for i had been laid in one of the carts and so was borne along the way we had come and at every turn of the wheels a new pang ran through me  for my life i could not choose but groan as others groaned that were in the same cart with me  for my right leg was broken also my right arm and my head was stounding as if it would burst  it was late and nigh sunset or ever we won the gates of compiegne having lost indeed but thirty men slain but having wholly failed in our onfall  for i heard in the monastery whither i was borne that when the maid and xaintrailles and their men had won their way within the walls and had slain certain of the english and were pushing the others hard behold our main battle was fallen upon in the rear by the english from noyon some two miles distant from pont leveque therefore there was no help for it but retreat we must driving back the english to noyon while our wounded and all our munitions of war were carried orderly away  as to the pains i bore in that monastery of the jacobins when my broken bones were set by a very good surgeon there is no need that i should write  my fortune in war was like that of most menatarms or better than that of many who are slain outright in their first skirmish  some good fortune i had as at st pierre and again bad fortune of which this was the worst that i could not be with the maid nay never again did i ride under her banner  she for her part was not idle but after tarrying certain days in compiegne with guillaume de flavy she rode to lagny for there she said were men that warred well against the english namely a company of our scots  and among them as later i heard in my bed was randal rutherford who had ransomed himself out of the hands of the french in paris whereat i was right glad  at lagny with her own men and the scots the maid fought and took one franquet darras a burgundian routier or knight of the road who plundered that country without mercy  him the maid would have exchanged for an armagnac of paris the host of the bear inn then held in duresse by the english for his share in a plot to yield paris to the king  but this burgess died in the hands of the english and the echevins 34 of lagny claiming franquet darras as a common thief traitor and murderer tried him and on his confession put him to death  this was counted a crime in the maid by the english and burgundian robbers nay even by french and scots  for said they if a gentleman is to be judged like a manant or a fat burgess by burgesses there is no more profit or glory in war  nay i have heard gentlemen of france cry out that as the maid gave up franquet to such judges as would surely condemn him so she was rightly punished when jean de luxembourg sold her into the hands of unjust judges  but i answer that the maid did not sell franquet darras as i say de luxembourg sold her not a livre did she take from the folk of lagny  and as for the slaying of robbers this very jean de luxembourg had but just slain many english of his own party for that they burned and pillaged in the beauvais country  yet men murmured against the maid not only in their hearts but openly and many menatarms ceased to love her cause both for the slaying of franquet darras and because she was for putting away the leaguerlasses and when she might would suffer no plundering  whether she was right or wrong it behoves me not to judge but this i know that the kings men fought best when she was best obeyed  and like him who sent her she was ever of the part of the poor and the oppressed against strong knights who rob and ravish and burn and torture and hold to ransom  therefore the archbishop of reims who was never a friend of the maid said openly in a letter to the reims folk that she did her own will rather than obeyed the commandments of god  but that god commands knights and gentlemen to rob the poor and needy though indeed he has set a great gulf between a manant and a gentleman born i can in nowise believe  for my part when i have been where gentlemen and captains lamented the slaying of franquet darras and justified the dealings of the english with the maid i have seemed to hear the clamour of the cruel jews tolle hunc et dimitte nobis barabbam 35 for barabbas was a robber  howbeit on this matter as on all i humbly submit me to the judgment of my superiors and to holy church  meantime the maid rode from lagny now to soissons now to senlis now to crepyenvalois and in crepy she was when that befell which i am about to relate     chapter xxvihow and by whose device the maid was taken at compiegne   verily and indeed the maid is of wonderful excellence quoth father francois to me in my chamber at the jacobins where i was healing of my hurts  any man may know that who is in your company the father went on speaking  and how good father i asked him sure i have caught none of her saintliness  a saint i do not call you but i scarce call you a scot  for you are a clerk  the maid taught me none of my clergy father nor have i taught her any of mine  she needs it not  but you are peaceful and gentle you brawl not nor drink nor curse      nay father with whom am i to brawl or how should i curse in your good company  find you scots so froward  but now pretending to be our friends a band of them is harrying the sologne country      they will be johnstons and jardines and wild wood folk of galloway i said  these we scarce reckon scots but rather picts and half heathen and the johnstons and jardines are here belike because they have made scotland over hot to hold them  we are a poor folk but honest let by the clans of the land debatable and of ettrick forest and the border freebooters and the galloway picts and maxwells and glendinnings and the redshanked jabbering highlanders and islesmen and some certain of the angus folk and maybe a wild crew in strathclyde  yours then is a very large country  about the bigness of france or may be not so big  and the main part of it and the most lawful and learned is by itself in a sort a separate kingdom namely fife whence i come myself  the lothians too and the shire of ayr if you except carrick are well known for the lands of peaceful and sober men  whence comes your great captain sir hugh kennedy  there you name an honourable manatarms i said the glory of scotland and to show you i was right he is none of your marchmen or highlanders but has lands in ayrshire and comes of a very honourable house  it is sir hugh that hath just held to ransom the kings good town of tours where is that gracious lady the mother of the kings wife the queen of sicily  hereat i waxed red as fire  he will be in arrears of his pay no doubt i made answer  it is very like said father francois but considering all that you tell me i crave your pardon if i still think that the blessed maid has won you from the common ways of your countrymen  to which in faith i had no answer to make but that my fortune was like to be the happier in this world and the next  much need have all men of her goodness and we of her valour said the father and he sighed  this is now the fourth siege of compiegne i have seen and twice have the leads from our roofs and the metal of our bells been made into munition of war  absit omen domine  and now they say the duke of burgundy has sworn to slay all and spare neither woman nor child  a vaunt of war father  call they not him the good duke  when we lay before paris the english put about a like lying tale concerning us as if we should sack and slay all  i pray that you speak sooth said father francois  on the next day being may the twentieth he came to me again with a wan face  burgundians are in claroix said he across the river and yet others with jean de luxembourg at margny scarce a mile away at the end of the causeway through the water meadows beyond the bridge  and the duke is at coudun a league off to the right of claroix and i have clomb the towertop and thence seen the english at venette on the left hand of the causeway  all is undone  nay father be of better cheer  our fort at the bridge end is stronger than les tourelles were at orleans  the english shot can scarce cross the river  bridge the enemy has none and northward and eastward all is open  be of better heart heaven helps france  we have sent to summon the maid said he from crepyenvalois  in her is all my hope but you speak lightly for you are young and war is your trade  and praying is yours father wherefore you should be bolder than i  but he shook his head  so two days passed and nothing great befell but in the grey dawn of may the twentythird i was held awake by clatter of horsemen riding down the street under the window of my chamber  and after matins came father francois his face very joyful with the tidings that the maid and a company of some three hundred lances of hers had ridden in from crepyen valois she making her profit of the darkness to avoid the burgundians  then i deemed that the enemy would soon have news of her and all that day i heard the bells ring merry peals and the trumpets sounding  about three hours after noonday father francois came again and told me that the maid would make a sally and cut the burgundians in twain and now nothing would serve me but i must be borne in a litter to the walls and see her banner once more on the wind  so by the goodwill of father francois some lay brethren bore me forth from the convent which is but a stonesthrow from the bridge  they carried me across the oise to a mill hard by the boulevard of the bridge fort whence from a window i beheld all that chanced  no man sitting in the gallery of a knights hall to see jongleurs play and sing could have had a better stance or have seen more clearly all the mischief that befell  the town of compiegne lies on the river oise as orleans on the loire but on the left not the right hand of the water  the bridge is strongly guarded as is custom by a tower at the further end and in front of that tower a boulevard  all the water was gay to look on being covered with boats as if for a holiday but these were manned by archers whom guillaume de flavy had set to shoot at the enemy if they drove us back and to rescue such of our men as might give ground if they could not win into the boulevard at the bridge end  beyond the boulevard forth to the open country lay a wide plain and behind it closing it in a long low wall of steep hills  on the left a mile and a half away father francois showed me the church tower of venette where the english camped to the right a league off was the tower of clairoix and at the end of a long raised causeway that ran from the bridge across the plain because of the winter floods i saw the tower and the village of margny  all these towns and spires looked peaceful but all were held by the burgundians  menatarms were thick on the crest of our boulevard and on the gatekeep all looking across the river towards the town whence the maid should sally by way of the bridge  so there i lay on a couch in the window and waited having no fear but great joy  nay never have i felt my spirit lighter within me so that i laughed and chattered like a fey man  the fresh air after my long lying in a chamber stirred me like wine  the may sun shone warm yet cooled with a sweet wind of the west  the room was full of women and maids all waiting to throw flowers before the maid whom they dearly loved everything had a look of holiday and all was to end in joy and great victory  so i laughed with the girls and listened to a strange tale how the maid had but of late brought back to life a dead child at lagny so that he got his rights of baptism and anon died again  so we fleeted the time till about the fifth hour after noon when we heard the clatter of horses on the bridge and some women waxed pale  my own heart leaped up  the noise drew nearer and presently she rode across and forth carrying her banner in the noblest manner mounted on a grey horse and clad in a rich hucque of cramoisie she smiled and bowed like a queen to the people who cried noel  noel  beside her rode pothon le bourgignon not pothon de xaintrailles as some have falsely said her confessor pasquerel on a palfrey her brother pierre du lys with his new arms bravely blazoned and her maitre dhotel daulon  but of the captains in compiegne no one rode with her  she had but her own company and a great rude throng of footmen of the town that would not be said nay  they carried clubs and they looked as i heard for no less than to take prisoner the duke of burgundy himself  certain of these men also bore spades and picks and other tools for the maid as i deem intended no more than to take and hold margny that so she might cut the burgundians in twain and sunder from them the english at venette  now as the night was not far off then at nightfall would the english be in sore straits as not knowing the country and the country roads and not having the power to join them of burgundy at clairoix  this one told me afterwards was the device of the maid  be this as it may and a captain of hers barthelemy barrette told me the tale the maid rode gallantly forth flowers raining on her while my heart longed to be riding at her rein  she waved her hand to guillaume de flavy who sat on his horse by the gate of the boulevard and so having arrayed her men she cried tirez avant and made towards margny the footsoldiers following with what speed they might while i and father francois and others in the chamber strained our eyes after them  all the windows and roofs of the houses and watermills on the bridge were crowded with men and women gazing and it came into my mind that flavy had done ill to leave these mills and houses standing  they wrought otherwise at orleans  this was but a passing thought for my heart was in my eyes straining towards margny  thence now arose a great din and clamour of trumpets and cries of menatarms and we could see tumult blown dust and stir of men and so it went for it may be half of an hour  then that dusty cloud of men and horses drove forward ever out of our sight  the sun was now red and sinking above the low wall of the western hills and the air was thicker than it had been and confused with a yellow light  despite the great multitude of men and women on the city walls there came scarcely a sound of a voice to us across the wide river so still they kept and the archers in the boats beneath us were silent nay though the chamber wherein i lay was thronged with the people of the house pressing to see through the open casement yet there was silence here save when the father prayed  a stronger wind rising out of the west now blew towards us with a sweet burden of scent from flowers and grass fragrant upon our faces  so we waited our hearts beating with hope and fear  then i whose eyes were keen saw blown usward from margny a cloud of flying dust that in scotland we call stour  the dust rolled white along the causeway towards compiegne and then alas forth from it broke little knots of our men footsoldiers all running for their lives behind them came more of our men and more all running and then mounted menatarms spurring hard and still more and more of these and ever the footmen ran till many riders and some runners had crossed the drawbridge and were within the boulevard of the bridge  there they stayed sobbing and panting and a few were bleeding  but though the foremost runaways thus won their lives we saw others roll over and fall as they ran tumbling down the sides of the causeway and why they fell i knew not  but now in the midst of the causeway between us and margny our flying horsemen rallied under the maidens banner and for the last time of all i heard that clear girls voice crying tirez en avant en avant  anon her horsemen charged back furiously and drove the picards and burgundians who pursued over a third part of the raised roadway  but now forth from margny trooped burgundian menatarms without end or number the banner of the maid waved wildly now up now down in the mad mellay and ever they of burgundy pressed on and still our men being few and outnumbered gave back  yet still some of the many clubmen of the townsfolk tumbled over as they ran and the drawbridge was choked with men flying thrusting and thronging wild and blind with the fear of death  then rose on our left one great cry such as the english give when they rejoice or when they charge and lo forth from a little wood that had hidden them came galloping and running across the heavy wet meadowland between us and venette the menatarms and the archers of england  then we nigh gave up all for lost and fain i would have turned my eyes away but i might not  now and again the english archers paused and loosed a flight of clothyard shafts against the stream of our runaways on the bridge therefore it was that some fell as they ran  but the little company of our horsemen were now driven back so near us that i could plainly see the maid coming last of all her body swung round in the saddle as she looked back at the foremost foemen who were within a lances length of her  and daulon and pierre du lys gripping each at her reins were spurring forward  but through the press of our clubmen and flying horsemen they might not win and now i saw what never man saw before the sword of the maid bare in battle  she smote on a knights shield her sword shivered in that stroke she caught her steel sperthe into her hand and struck and hewed amain and there were empty saddles round her  and now the english in the meadow were within four lances lengths of the causeway between her and safety  say it i must nor cannonball nor arrowflight availed to turn these english  still the drawbridge and the inlet of the boulevard were choked with the press and men were leaping from bank and bridge into the boats or into the water while so mixed were friends and foes that flavy in a great voice bade archers and artillerymen hold their hands  townsfolk too were mingled in the throng men who had come but to gape as curious fools and among them i saw the hood of a cordelier as i glanced from the fight to mark how the maid might force her way within still she smote and daulon and pierre du lys smote manfully and anon they gained a little way backing their horses while our archers dared not shoot so mixed were french english and burgundians  flavy who worked like a man possessed had turned about to give an order to the archers above him his back i swear was to the press of flying men to the inlet of the boulevard and to the drawbridge when his own voice as all deemed who heard it cried aloud up drawbridge close gates down portcullis  the men whose duty it was were standing ready at the cranks and pulleys their tools in hand and instantly groaning the drawbridge flew up casting into the water them that were flying across down came the portcullis and slew two men while the gates of the inlet of the boulevard were swung to and barred all as it might he said in the twinkling of an eye  flavy turned in wrath and great amaze in gods name who cried he shouted  down drawbridge up portcullis open gates  to the front men atarms lances forward  for most of the mounted men who had fled were now safe and on foot within the boulevard  all this i heard and saw in a glance while my eyes were fixed on the maid and the few with her  they were lost from our sight now and again in a throng of picards englishmen burgundians for all have their part in this glory  swords and axes fell and rose steeds countered and reeled and then they say for this thing i myself did not see a picard archer slipping under the weapons and among the horses hoofs tore the maid from saddle by the long skirts of her hucque and they were all upon her  this befell within half a stonesthrow of the drawbridge  while flavy himself toiled with his hands and tore at the cranks and chains the maid was taken under the eyes of us who could not stir to help her now was the day and the hour whereof the saints told her not though she implored them with tears  now in the throng below i heard a laugh like the sound of a saw on stone and one struck him that laughed on the mouth  it was the laugh of that accursed brother thomas  i had laid my face on my hands being so weak and was weeping for very rage at that which my unhappy eyes had seen when i heard the laugh and lifting my head and looking forth i beheld the hood of the cordelier  seize him i cried to father francois pointing down at the cordelier seize that franciscan he has betrayed her  run man it was he who cried in flavys voice bidding them raise drawbridge and let fall portcullis  the devil gave him that craft to counterfeit mens voices  i know the man  run father francois run  you are distraught with very grief said the good father the tears running down his own cheeks that is brother thomas the best artilleryman in france and flavys chief trust with the couleuvrine  he came in but four days agone and there was great joy of his coming  thus was the maid taken by art and device of the devil and brother thomas and in no otherwise  they who tell that flavy sold her closing the gates in her face do him wrong he was an ill man but loyal to france as was seen by the very defence he made at compiegne for there was none like it in this war  but of what avail was that to us who loved the maid  rather many times would i have died in that hour than have seen what i saw  for our enemies made no more tarrying nor any onslaught on the boulevard but rode swiftly back with the prize they had taken with her whom they feared more than any knight or captain of france  this page whereon i work in a hand feeble and old and weary with much writing is blotted with tears that will not be held in  but we must bow humbly to the will of god and of his saints  dominus dedit et dominus abstulit benedictum sit nomen domini  wherefore should i say more  they carried me back in litter over the bridge through the growing darkness  every church was full of women weeping and praying for her that was the friend of them and the playmate of their children for all children she dearly loved  concerning flavy it was said by them who loved him not that he showed no sign of sorrow  but when his own brother louis fell later in the siege a brother whom he dearly loved none saw him weep or alter the fashion of his countenance nay he bade musicians play music before him  i besought the prior when i was borne home that i might be carried to flavy and tell him that i knew  but he forbade me saying that in very truth i knew nought or nothing that could be brought against a churchman and one in a place of trust  for i had not seen the lips of the cordelier move when that command was givennay at the moment i saw him not at all  nor could i even prove to others that he had this devilish art there being but my oath against his and assuredly he would deny the thing  and though i might be assured and certain within myself yet other witness i had none at all nor were any of my friends there who could speak with me  for daulon and pasquerel and pierre du lys had all been taken with the maid  it was long indeed before pierre du lys was free for he had no money to ransom himself withal  therefore flavy knowing me only for a wounded scot of the maids would think me a brain sick man and as like as not give me more of oise river to drink than i craved  with these reasonings it behoved me to content myself  the night i passed in prayers for the maid and for myself that i might yet do justice on that devil or at least might see justice done  but how these orisons were answered shall be seen in the end whereto i now hasten     chapter xxviihow norman leslie fared in compiegne with the end ofthat leaguer   about all that befell in the besieged city of compiegne after that wicked day of destiny when the maid was taken i heard for long only from the jacobin brothers and from one barthelemy barrette  he was a picardy man more loyal than most of his country who had joined the maid after the fray at paris  now he commanded a hundred of her company who did not scatter after she was taken and he was the best friend i then had  the burgesses are no whit dismayed said he coming into my chamber after the day of the ascension which was the second after the capture of the maid  they have sent a messenger to the king and expect succour  they sue for grace at a graceless face said i in the country proverb for my heart was hot against king charles  that is to be seen said be  but assuredly the duke of burgundy is more keen about his own business  how fare the burgundians i asked for indeed i have heard the guns speak since dawn but none of the good fathers cares to go even on to the roof of the church tower and bring me tidings for fear of a stray cannon ball  for holy men they are wondrous chary of their lives said barthelemy laughing  were i a monk i would welcome death that should unfrock me and let me go awandering in paradise among these fair lady saints we see in the pictures  it is written barthelemy that there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage  faith the more i am fain of it said barthelemy and may be i might take the wrong track and get into the paradise of mahound which i have heard is no ill place for a manatarms  this man had no more faith than a paynim but none the less was a stout carl in war  but that minds me quoth he of the very thing i came hither to tell you  one priest there is in compiegne who takes no keep of his life a cordelier  what ails you man does your leg give a twinge  ay a shrewd twinge enough  truly you look pale enough  it is gone i said  tell me of that cordelier  do you see this little rod he asked putting in my hand a wand of dark wood carven with the head of a strange beast in a cowl  i see it  how many notches are cut in it  five i said  but why spoil you your rod  five men of england or burgundy that cordelier shot this day from the creneaux of the boulevard where the maid crossing himself was taken a fell man he is strong and tall with a long hooked nose and as black as sathanas  how comes he in arms i asked  flavy called him in from valenciennes where he was about some business of his own for there is no greater master of the culverin  and faith as he says he has had rare sport and will have for long  was there an onfall of the enemy  nay they are over wary  he shot them as they dug behind pavises 36 for the duke has moved his quarters to venette where the english lay hard by the town  and right in the middle of the causeway to margny two arrowshots from our bridge end he is letting build a great bastille and digging a trench wherein men may go to and fro  the cordelier was as glad of that as a man who has stalked a covey of partridges  keep my tally for me he said to myself cut a notch for every man i slay and here said barthelemy waving his staff is his first days reckoning  now i well saw what chance i had of bringing that devil to justice for who would believe so strange a tale as mine against one so serviceable in the war  nor was daulon here to speak for me the enemy having taken him when they took the maid  thinking thus i groaned and barthelemy fearing that he had wearied me said farewell and went out  every evening after sunset he would come in and partly cheer me by telling how hardily our people bore them partly break my heart with fresh tidings of that devil brother thomas  things go not ill had we but hope of succour he said  the dukes bastille is rising indeed and the duke is building taudis 37 of oaken beams and earth between the bastille and our boulevard  the skill is to draw nearer us and nearer till he can mine beneath our feet  heard you any new noise of war this day  i heard such a roar and clatter as never was in my ears whether at orleans or paris  and well you might  this convent is in the very line of the fire  they have four great bombards placed every one of them with a devilish netherland name of its own  there is houpembierethat means the beer barrel i take itand la rouge bombarde and remeswalle and quincequin every one shooting stone balls thirty inches in girth  the houses on the bridge are a heap of stones the mills are battered down and we must grind our meal in the city in a cellar for what i can tell  nom dieu when they take the boulevard we lose the river and if once they bar our gates to the east whence shall viands come  is there no good tidings from the messenger  the king answers ever like a drawer in a tavern anon anon sir  he will come himself presently always presently with all his host  he will never come i said  he is a      he is my king said barthelemy  curse your own king of scots if you will  scots by the blood of iscariot traitors are they well i crave your pardon i spake in haste and anger  know you nichole cammet  i have heard of the man i said  a towns messenger is he not  the same  but a week agone cammet was sent on a swift horse to chateau thierry  the good town craved of pothon de xaintrailles who commands there to send them what saltpetre he could spare for making gunpowder the saltpetre came in this day by the pierrefonds gate and cammet with it but on another horse a jade  well and what have the scots to do with that  no more than this  a parcel of them routiers and brigands have crept into an old castle on the road and hold it for their own hands  thence they sallied forth after cammet and so chased him that his horse fell down dead under him in the gateway of chateau thierry  they would be men of the land debatable i cried elliots and armstrongs they never do a better deed being corrupted by dwelling nigh our enemies of england  fain would i pay for that horse see here and i took forth my purse from under my pillow take that to the attournes and say a scot atones for what scots have done  norman i take back my word i crave your pardon and i am shamed to have spoken so to a sick man of his own countryfolk  but for your purse i am ill at carrying purses i have no skill in that art and the dice draw me when i hear the rattle of them  but look at the cordeliers tally four men today three yesterday faith he thins them  indeed to shorten a long story by the end of barthelemys count there were two hundred and thirtynine notches on the rod  that he kept a true score till he stinted and reckoned no more i know having proof from the other side  for twelve years thereafter i falling into discourse with messire georges chastellain an esquire of the duke of burgundy and a maker both of verse and prose he told me the same tale to a man three hundred men  and i make no doubt but that he has written it in his book of the praise of his prince and of these wars to witness if i lie  consider then what hope i had of being listened to by flavy or by the attournes or as we say bailies of the good town if being recovered from my broken limbs i brought my witness to their ears  none the less the enemy battered at us every day with their engines destroying as barthelemy had said the houses on the bridge and the mills so that they could no longer grind the corn  and now came the earls of huntingdon and arundel with two thousand englishmen while to us appeared no succour  so at length being smitten by balls from above and ruined by mines dug under earth from below our company that held the boulevard at the bridge end were surprised in the night and some were taken some drowned in the river oise  wherefore was great sorrow and fear the more for that the duke of burgundy let build a bridge of wood from venette to come and go across oise whereby we were now assailed on both hands for hitherto we had been free to come and go on the landward side and through all the forest of pierrefonds we had but one gate unbeleaguered the chapel gate leading to choisy and the northeast  now were we straitened for provender notably for fresh meat and men were driven as in a city beleaguered to eat the flesh of dead horses and even of rats and dogs whereof i have partaken and it is ill food  none the less we endured despite the murmuring of the commons so strong are mens hearts moreover all france lay staked on this one cast of the dice no less than at orleans in the year before  somewhat we were kept in heart by tidings otherwise bitter  for word came that the maid being in ward at beaurevoir a strong place of jean de luxembourg had leaped in the night from the top of the tower and had next morning been taken up all unhurt as by miracle but astounded and bereft of her senses  for this there was much sorrow but would to god that he had taken her to himself in that hour  nevertheless when she was come to herself again she declared by inspiration of the saints that compiegne should be delivered before the season of martinmas  whence i for one drew great comfort nor ever again despaired and many were filled with courage when this tidings came to our ears hoping for some miracle as at orleans  now too god began to take pity upon us for on august the fifteenth the eightyfifth day of the siege came news to the duke of burgundy that philip duke of brabant was dead and he must go to make sure of that great heritage  the duke having departed the english earls had far less heart for the leaguer i know not well wherefore but now at least was seen the truth of that proverb concerning the eye of the master  the bastille too which our enemies had made to prevent us from going out by our pierrefonds gate on the landward side was negligently built and of no great strength  all this gave us some heart so much that my hosts the good jacobins and the holy sisters of the convent of st john stripped the lead from their roofs and bestowed it on the town for munition of war  and when i was in case to walk upon the walls and above the river i might see men and boys diving in the water and searching for english cannonballs which we shot back at the english  it chanced one day that i was sitting and sunning myself in the warm september weather on a settle in a secure place hard by the chapel gate with me was barthelemy barrette for it was the day of our ladys feast that very day whereon we had failed before paris last year and there was truce for the sacred season  we fell to devising of what had befallen that day year and without thought i told barthelemy of my escape from prison and so little by little i opened my heart to him concerning brother thomas and all his treasons  never was man more astounded than barthelemy and he bade me swear by the blessed trinity that all this tale was true  mayhap you were fevered he said when you lay in the casement seat and saw the maid taken by device of the cordelier  i was no more fevered than i am now and i swear by what oath you will and by the bones of st andrew which these sinful hands have handled that flavys face was set the other way when that cry came down portcullis up drawbridge close gates  and now that i have told you the very truth what should i do  brother thomas should burn for this quoth barthelemy but not while the siege endures  he carries too many english lives in his munition box  nor can you slay him in single combat or at unawares for the man is a priest  nor would flavy who knows you not listen to such a story  so there he sat frowning and plucking at his beard  i have it he said daulon is no further off than beaulieu where jean de luxembourg holds him till he pays his ransom  when the siege is raised if ever we are to have succour then purchase safeconduct to daulon take his testimony and bring it to flavy  as he spoke some stir in the still air made me look up and suddenly throw my body aside and it was well for a sword swept down from the low parapet above our heads and smote into the back of that settle whereon we were sitting  ere i well knew what had chanced barthelemy was on his feet his whinger flew from his hand and he leaping up on to the parapet was following after him who smote at me  in the same moment a loud grating voice cried  the maid shall burn and not the man and a flash of light went past me the whinger flying over my head and clipping into the water of the moat below  rising as i best might but heedfully i spied over the parapet and there was barthelemy coming back his naked sword in his hand  the devil turned a sharp corner and vanished he said  and now where are we  we have a worse foe within than all the men of burgundy without there goes the devils tally he cried and threw the little carven rod far from him into the moat where it fell and floated  no man saw this that could bear witness most are in church where you and i should have been i said  then we looked on each other with blank faces  my post is far from his and my harness is good said barthelemy but for you beware  thenceforth if i saw any cowl of a cordelier as i walked i even turned and went the other way  i was of no avail against this wolf whom all men praised so serviceable was he to the town  once an arbalest bolt struck my staff from my hand as i walked and i was fain to take shelter of a corner yet saw not whence the shot came  once a great stone fell from a turret and broke into dust at my feet and it is not my mind that a cannonball had loosened it  thus my life went by in dread and watchfulness  no more bitter penance may man dree than was mine to be near this devil and have no power to avenge my deadly quarrel  there were many heavy hearts in the town for once it was taken what man could deem his life safe or what woman her honour  but though they lay down and rose up in fear and were devoured by desire of revenge theirs was no such thirst as mine  so the days went on and darkened towards the promised season of martinmas but there dawned no light of hope  now on the wednesday before all saints i had clambered up into the tower of the church of the jacobins on the northeast of the city whence there was a prospect far and wide  with me were only two of the youngest of the fathers  i looked down into the great forest of pierrefonds and up and down oise and beheld the army of our enemies moving in divers ways  the banners of the english and their long array were crossing the duke of burgundys new bridge of wood that he had builded from venette and with them the men of jean de luxembourg trooped towards royaulieu  on the crest of their bastille over against our pierrefonds gate matches were lighted and men were watching in double guard and the same on the other side of the water at the gate margny  plainly our foes expected a rescue sent to us of compiegne by our party  but the forest five hundred yards from our wall lay silent and peaceable a sea of brown and yellow leaves  then while the english and burgundian menatarms that had marched south and east were drawn up in order of battle away to the right between wood and water behold trumpets sounded faint enough being far off  then there was a glitter of the pale sun on long lines of lance points under the banners of french captains issuing out from the forest over against the enemy  we who stood on the tower gazed long at these two armies which were marshalled orderly with no more than a bowshot and a half between them and every moment we looked to see them charge upon each other with the lance  much we prayed to the saints for now all our hope was on this one cast  they of burgundy and of england dismounted from their horses for the english ever fight best on foot and they deemed that the knights of france would ride in upon them and fall beneath the english bows as at azincour and crecy  we too looked for nought else but the french array never stirred though here and there a knight would gallop forth to do a valiance  seldom has man seen a stranger sight in war for the english and burgundians could not charge being heavyarmed men on foot and the french would not move against them we knew not wherefore  all this spectacle lay far off to the south and we could not be satisfied with wondering at it nor turn away our eyes when on the left a trumpet rang out joyously  then all of us wheeling round as one man we saw the most blessed sight whereto our backs had been turned for into the chapel gatethat is far to the left of the pierrefonds gate on the northeastwere streaming cattle sheep and kine pricked on and hastened by a company of a hundred menatarms  they had come by forest paths from choisy way and anon all our guns on the boulevard of the pierrefonds gate burst forth at once against the english bastille over against it  now this bastille as i have said had never been strongly builded and in some sort was not wholly finished  after one great volley of guns against the bastille we looking down into our boulevard of the pierrefonds gate saw the portcullis raised the drawbridge lowered and a great array of menatarms carrying ladders rush out and charge upon the bastille  then through the smoke and fire they strove to scale the works and for the space of half an hour all was roar of guns but at length our men came back leaving many slain and the running libbards grinned on the flag of england  i might endure no longer but clambering down the tower stairs as best i might for i was still lame i limped to my lodgings at the jacobins did on my harness and taking a horse from the stable i mounted and rode to the pierrefonds gate  for brother thomas and his murderous ways i had now no care at all  never sure saw any man such a sight  our boulevard was full not only of menatarms but of all who could carry clubs burgesses armed old men boys yea women and children some with rusty swords some with carpenters axes some bearing cudgels some with hammers spits and knives all clamouring for the portcullis to rise and let them forth their faces were lean and fierce their eyes were like eyes of wolves for now they cried was the hour and the prophecy of the maid should be fulfilled  verily though she lay in bonds her spirit was with us on that day  but still our portcullis was down and the long tail of angry people stretched inwards from the inner mouth of the boulevard along the street surging like a swollen loch against its barrier  on the crest of the boulevard was flavy baton in hand looking forth across field and forest watching for i knew not what while still the people clamoured to be let go  but he stood like the statue of a manat arms and from the bastille of the burgundians the arrows rained around him who always watched and was still  now the guards of the gate had hard work to keep the angry people back who leaped and tore at the men atarms arrayed in front of them and yelled for eagerness to issue forth and fight  suddenly on the crest of the boulevard flavy threw up his arm and gave one cry  xaintrailles  then he roared to draw up portcullis and open gates the menatarms charged forth the multitude trampled over each other to be first in field i was swept on and along with them through the gate and over the drawbridge like a straw on a wave and lo a little on our left was the banner of pothon de xaintrailles his foremost men dismounting the rearguard just riding out from the forest  the two bands joined we from compiegne the four hundred of xaintrailles from the wood and like two swollen streams that meet we raced towards the bastille under a rain of arrows and balls  nothing could stay us a boy fell by my side with an arrow thrilling in his breast but his brother never once looked round  i knew not that i could run but run i did though not so fast as many and before i reached the bastille our ladders were up and the throng was clambering falling rising again and flowing furiously into the fort the townsfolk had no thought but to slay and slay five or six would be at the throat of one burgundian manatarms hammers and axes were breaking up armour knives were scratching and searching for a crevice women lifting great stone balls would stagger up to dash them on the heads of the fallen  of the whole garrison onehalf a hundred and sixty menatarms were put to the sword  only pothon de xaintrailles and the gentlemen with him as knowing the manner of war saved and held to ransom certain knights as messire jacques de brimeu the seigneur de crepy and others while for my own part seeing a knight assailed by a knot of clubmen i struck in on his part for gentle blood must ever aid gentle blood and so not without shrewd blows on my salade i took to ransom messire collart de bertancourt  thereafter very late and in the twilight of october the twentyfifth we turned back to compiegne leaving the enemies bastille in a flame behind us while in front were blazing the bonfires of the people of the good town  and in compiegne we heard how the english and the main army of burgundians had turned late in the day and crossed by the duke of burgundys bridge leaving men to keep guard there  so our victory was great and wise had been the prudence of the french captains subtlety being the mother of victory for without a blow struck they had kept jean de luxembourg and the earls of huntingdon and arundel waiting idle all day while their great bastille was taken by xaintrailles and the townsfolk and food was brought into compiegne  thus for the second time i passed a night of joy in a beleaguered town for there was music in every street the churches full of people praising god for this great deliverance men and maids dancing around bonfires yet good watch was kept at the gates and on the towers  next day we expected battle but our spies brought in tidings that burgundians and english had decamped in the dawn their men deserting  that day was not less joyful than the night had been for at royaulieu in the abbey where jean de luxembourg had lain the townsfolk found all manner of meat and of wine great plenty so right good cheer we made for it cost us nothing     chapter xxviiihow the burgundians hunted hares with the end of that hunting   tell me what tidings of him barthelemy barrette asked me on the day after that unbought feast at royaulieu  he was sitting in the noonday sun on the bridge of compiegne and strange it was to see the place so battered yet so peaceful after five months of war  the oise sliding by and rippling on the piers was not more quiet than this bridge of many battles yet black in places with driedup blood of men slain  tidings can i find none i answered  he who saw the cordelier last was on guard in the boulevard during the great charge  he marked brother thomas level his couleuvrine now and again as we ran for the bastille and cried out to him to aim higher for that the ball would go amongst us  you were his target i make no doubt said barthelemy but by reason of the throng he had no certain aim  after we broke into the bastille i can find no man who has set eyes on him and i cursed the cordelier for very rage  he is well away if he stays away you and i need scarce any longer pray for eyes in the backs of our heads  but what make we next  i have but one thought i said to pluck the maid out of the hands of the english for now men say that she is sold to them by jean of luxembourg  they mean to take her to arras and so by crotoy at the mouth of seine and across normandy to rouen  save her france must for the honour of france  my mind is the same he said and fell into a muse  hence the straight road and the shortest he said at last is by beauvais on to rouen where she will lie in chains and drawing his dagger he scratched lines on the bridge parapet with its point  here is compiegne there far to the west is the sea and here is rouen  that straight line which he scratched goes to rouen from compiegne  here midway is beauvais whereof we spoke which town we hold  but there between us and beauvais is clermont held by crevecoeur for the burgundians and here midway between beauvais and rouen is gournay where kyriel and the lord huntingdon lie with a great force of english  do you comprehend  we must first take clermont ere we can ride to rescue the maid at rouen  the king should help us i said  for what is the army that has delivered compiegne but a set of private bands under this gentlemans flag or that some with boussac some with xaintrailles some with a dozen others and victuals are hard to come by  ay many a peaceful man sits by the fire and tells how great captains should have done this and marched there never thinking that men fight on their bellies  and the king should help us and march with dalencon through normandy from the south while our companies take clermont if we may and drive back the english and burgundians  but you know the king and men say that the archbishop of reims openly declares that the maid is rightly punished for her pride  he has set up a mad shepherdboy to take her place heaven help him who can fight as well as that stone can swim and he dropped a loose stone over the bridge into the water  whoever stays at home we take the field i said let us seek counsel of xaintrailles  we rose and went to the jacobins where xaintrailles was lodged and there found him at his dejeuner  he was a tall young knight straight as a lance lean as a greyhound for all his days his sword had won his meat and he was hardy keen and bright with eyes of steel in a scarred face and his brow was already worn bald with the helmet  when he walked his legs somewhat straggled apart by reason of his much riding  xaintrailles received us in the best manner we telling him that we had ridden with the maid that i was of her own household and that to save her we were willing to go far and well knew that under no banner could we be so forward as under his  i would all my company were as honest as i take you twain to be he said and i gladly receive you under my colours with any men you can bring  messire i have a handful of horse of the maids company said barthelemy hardily but when do we march for today is better than to morrow  as soon as may be said the knight the marechal de boussac leads us against clermont  that town we cannot leave behind us when we set forth from beauvais  but with these great bombards which we have won from the burgundians we may have reason of clermont and then clapping his hands together and looking up then for rouen  we shall burst the cage and free the bird god willing  he stood like one in prayer crossing himself and our hearts turned to him in loyalty  if but the king will send a force to join hands with la hire in louviers the english shall have news of you messire i made bold to say  ay if quoth xaintrailles and his face grew darker but we must make good speedy for the midwinter draws nigh  therewith we left him and in few days were marching on clermont dragging with long trains of horses the great bombards of the burgundians  to our summons messire de crevecoeur answered knightly that clermont he would hold till death or rescue so we set to battering his house about his ears  but alas after four days a sentinel of ours saw too late an english knight with nine men slip through the vines under cover of darkness and win a postern gate in the town wall  soon we heard a joy fire of guns within clermont town and foreboded the worst  at midnight came a peasant to xaintrailles with tidings that a rescue was riding to clermont and next morning it was boots and saddles and away so hastily that we left behind us the great bombards of the burgundians  on this they made much mirth but they laugh best who laugh last as shall he seen  and the cause of our going was that the earl of huntingdon had ridden out of gournay in normandy with a great force of english to deliver clermont  against foes within the town and foes without the town the captains judged that we were of no avail  so we departed heavy at heart  now the companies scattered and barthelemy and i sorry enough rode behind xaintrailles due north to guermigny whence we threatened amiens  at guermigny then for a short season lay xaintrailles gathering all the force he might along the picardy marches for the duke of burgundy was in peronne full of wrath and sorrow so many evils had befallen him for ourselves we were in no gentler temper having lost our hope of pushing on to rouen  i was glad therefore when xaintrailles himself rode one day to the door of our lodging in guermigny strode clanging into our chamber and asked if we were alone  we telling him that none was within earshot he sat him down on the table playing with his dagger hilt and with his hawks eye on barthelemy asked you know this land well  i have ridden over it in war or peace since i was a boy  how far to lihons  a matter of two leagues  what manner of country lies between  chiefly plain rude and untilled because of the distresses of these times  there is much heath and long grasses a great country for hares  know you any covert nigh the road  there runs a brook that the road crosses by a bridge midway between guermigny and lihons  the banks are steep and well wooded with such trees and undergrowth as love water  you can guide me thither  there is no missing the road  god could not have made this land better for me if he had asked my counsel said xaintrailles  you can keep your own  nom dieu yea said barthelemy  and your scots friend i can trust  a goodday to you and thanks many  thereupon he went forth  what has he in his mind i asked barthelemy  belike an ambush  the duke of burgundy lies at peronne and has mustered a great force  lihons is midway between us and peronne and is in the hands of burgundy  i deem xaintrailles has tidings that they intend to ride from peronne to lihons tonight and thence make early onfall on us tomorrow  being heavypated men of war and bemused with their strong wine they know not belike that we have more with us than the small garrison of guermigny  and we are to await them on the road i doubt not  you shall see men that wear your cross of st andrew but not of your colour  i shame not to say that of bushments in the cold dawn i had seen as much as i had stomach for under paris  but if any captain was wary in war and knew how to discover whatsoever his enemy designed that captain was xaintrailles  none the less i hoped in my heart that his secret tidings of the burgundian onfall had not come through a priest and namely a cordelier  dawn found us mounted and riding at a footspace through the great plain which lies rough and untilled between guermigny and lihons  all grey and still it was save for a cock crowing from a farmstead here and there on the wide wold broken only by a line of trees that ran across the way  under these trees which were mainly poplars and thick undergrowth of alders about the steep banks of a little brook we were halted and here took cover our men lying down  let no man stir or speak save when i speak to him whatever befalls on peril of his life said xaintrailles when we were all disposed in hiding  then touching me on the shoulder that i should rise he said  you are young enough to climb a tree are your eyes good  i commonly was the first that saw the hare in her form when we went coursing at home sir  then up this tree with you keep outlook along the road and hide yourself as best you may in the boughs  throw this russet cloak over your harness  it was shrewdly chill in the grey november morning a hoarfrost lying white on the fields  i took the cloak gladly and bestowed myself in the tree so that i had a wide view down lihons way whence we expected our enemies the road running plain to see for leagues like a ribbon when once the low sun had scattered the mists  it was a long watch and a weary my hands being half frozen in my steel gauntlets  many of our men slept if ever a wayfarer crossed the bridge hard by he was stopped gagged and trussed in a ropes end  but wayfarers were few and all were wandering afoot  i was sorry for two lasses who crossed on some business of their farm but there was no remedy  these diversions passed the time till nigh noon when i whispered to xaintrailles that i saw clouds of dust the roads being very dry a league away  he sent barthelemy and another to waken any that slept and bade all be ready at a word  now there came shouts on the wind cries of venerie loud laughter and snatches of songs  and now up in my perch i myself broke into a laugh at that i saw  silence fool whispered xaintrailles  why laugh you in the name of behemoth  the burgundians are hunting hares i whispered they are riding all disorderly some on the road some here and there about the plain  one man has no lance another is unhelmeted many have left their harness behind with the baggage  even as i spoke rose up a great hunting cry and a point of the chase was blown on a trumpet  the foremost burgundians were spurring like madmen after some beast throwing at it with their lances and soon i saw a fox making our way for its very life  to horse cried xaintrailles and leaving thirty men to hold the bridge the whole of our company with spears in rest drove down on these harehunters of burgundy  two hundred picked men in all fully armed were we and we scattered the foremost riders as they had scattered the hares  saddles were emptied archers were cut down or speared ere they could draw bows the burgundians were spurring for their lives many cried mercy and were taken to ransom of whom i had my share as i shall tell  but a few men made a right good end  thomas kyriel a knight of england stood to his banner his archers rallied about it with three or four knights of burgundy  there unhelmeted for the most part they chose the way of honour but they were of no avail where so many lances were levelled and so many swords were hewing at so few  there was a great slaughter but geoffrey de thoisy nephew to the bishop of tournay plucked from danger fortune for he so bore him that he being fully armed we took him for messire antoine de vienne a very good knight  for his courage we spared him but antoine being unhelmeted and unknown was smitten on the head by barthelemy barrette with a blow of a cassetete  for this barthelemy made much sorrow not only that so good a knight was slain but that he had lost a great ransom whereby he should have been a rich man  yet such is the fortune of war  which that day was strangely seen for a knight having yielded to me because his horse threw him and he lost for a moment all sense with the fall and found my boot on his neck when he came to himself who should he be but messire robert heron the same whom i took at orleans  who when he knew me took off his salade for greater ease and sitting down on a rock by the way swore as never i heard man swear french english spaniard or scot and at length laughed and said it was fortune of war and so was content  this skirmish being thus ended we returned blithe and rich men every one of us what with prisoners horses arms and all manner of treasure taken with the baggage  that night we slept little in guermigny but feasted and drank deep  for my own part i know not well where i did sleep or how i won to what bed which shames me some deal after all these years  on the morrow we left guermigny to the garrison of the place for their illfortune and rode back towards compiegne  and this was the sport that the burgundians had in harehunting  this battle of the hares was the merriest passage of arms for our party and bourdes were made on it and songs sung as by the english on that other battle of the herrings  now moreover i might be called rich what with ransoms what with my share of the plunder in horses rings chains of gold jewels silver dishes and rich cloths out of the baggage of the enemy  verily lack of wealth could no more sunder elliot and me  for pothon was as open of hand as he was high of heart and was no greedy captain wherefore men followed him the more gladly     chapter xxixshoweth how very noble was the duke of burgundy   all this was well but we were no nearer rouen and the freeing of the maid on this twentieth of november than we had been when the siege of compiegne broke up on the twentysixth of october  the duke of burgundy we learned was like a man mad when he heard of the battle of the hares  nothing would serve him that day but to lead all his host to guermigny from peronne whence he would have got little comfort of vengeance for we were in a place of safety  but jean de luxembourg told him that he must not venture his nobility among routiers like us wherein he pleased the duke but spoke foolishly  for no man be he duke or prince can be of better blood than we of the house of rothes not to speak of xaintrailles and many other gentlemen of our company  the duke then put not his noble person in any jeopardy but more wisely he sent messengers after my lord of huntingdon that he should bring up the english to aid the burgundian harehunters  but huntingdon had departed to rouen where then lay henry king of england a boy on whom and on whose house god has avenged the maid with terrible judgments and will yet the more avenge her blessed be his name  the duke of burgundy comforted himself after his kind for when he did pluck up heart to go against guermigny he finding us departed sacked the place and razed it to the very ground and so withdrew to roye and there waited for what help england would send him  now roye is some sixteen leagues due north of compiegne  so the days went by for messire lefebvre saintremy the pursuivant was hunting for my lord of huntingdon all up and down normandy and at last came to rouen and to the presence of the duke of bedford the uncle of the english king  all this i myself heard from messire saintremy who is still a pursuivant and a learned man and a maker of books  bedford then who was busy hounding that devil cauchon sometime bishop of beauvais against the maid sent the comte de perche and messire loys robsart to bid the duke of burgundy be of what courage he might for succour of england he should have  wherein bedford was no true prophet  of all this we in compiegne knew so much as that it was wiser to strike the duke at roye before he could add english talbots to his burgundian harriers  therefore all the captains of companies as boussac xaintrailles alain giron amadee de vignolles and loys de naucourt mustered their several companies to the number of some five thousand men atarms  we had news of six hundred english marching to join the duke and on them we fell at couty hard by amiens and there slew loys robsart a good knight of the order of the garter and drove the english that fled into the castle of couty and we took all their horses leaving them shamed for they kept no guard  thence we rode to within a league of roye and thence sent a herald in all due form to challenge the duke to open battle for his honours sake this we did because we had no store of victual and must fight or ride home  the duke received the herald and made as if he would hear him as beseems a gentleman under challenge  but his wise counsellors forbade him because he was so noble  we were but routiers they said and had no prince in all our company so we must even tarry till the morrow and then the duke would fight  in truth he expected the english who were footing it to castle couty  i stood by xaintrailles when the pursuivant bore back this message  pothon spat on the ground  shall we be more noble tomorrow than today or tomorrow can this huxter of maids the duke be less noble than he is every day that he soils knighthood  thereon he sent the herald back to say that the duke should have battle at his gates if he gave no better answer for that wait for his pleasure we could not for want of victuals  and so we drew half a league nearer to roye  the duke sent back our herald with word that of victuals he would give us half his own store for he had read as i deem the romance of richard lionheart another manner of man than himself  we said nought to this not choosing to dine in such high company but rode up under the walls of roye defying the duke with open ribaldry such as no manant could bear but he would take cudgel in hand to defend his honour  our intent was if the duke accepted battle to fight with none but him if perchance we might take him and hold him as hostage for the maids life  howbeit so very noble was the duke this day that he did not put lance in rest as belike he would have done on the morrow but drawing up his men on foot behind certain mosses and marshes all in firm array he kept himself coy behind them and not too far from the gate of roye  to cross these mosses and marshes was beyond our cunning nor could we fast all that night and see if the duke would feel himself less noble and more warlike on the morrow  so with curses and cries of shame we turned bridle and for that we could not hold together being in lack of meat the companies broke up and went each to his own hold  i have heard messire georges chastellain tell in times that were still to come how fiercely the duke of burgundy bore him in council that night after that we had all gone and how he blamed his people who would not let him fight  but after he had well supped he even let this adventure slip by as being ordained by the will of god who doubtless holds in very high honour men of birth princely and such above all as let sell young virgins to the tormentors  and thus ended our hope to save the maid by taking captive the duke of burgundy     chapter xxxhow norman leslie took service with the english   what make we now i asked of barthelemy barrette one day after the companies had scattered as i have said and we had gone back into compiegne  what stroke may france now strike for the maid  he hung his head and plucked at his beard ere he spoke  to be as plain with you as my heart is with myself norman he answered at last deliverance or hope of deliverance see i none  the english have the bird in the cage and rouen is not a strength that can be taken by sudden onslaught  and were it so where is our force in midwinter i rather put my faith that can scarce move mountains in some subtle means if any man might devise them  we cannot sit idle here i said  and for three long months there will be no moving of armies in open field  and in three months these dogs of false french doctors of paris will have tried and condemned the maid  for my part i ride with my handful of spears to the loire  perchance there is yet some hope in the king  then i ride with you granted your goodwill for i must needs to tours and i have overmuch treasure in my wallet to ride alone  indeed i was now a rich man more by luck than by valour and though i said nought of it i hoped that my long wooing might now come to a happy end  barthelemy clasped hands gladly on that offer and not to make a long tale he and his men were my escort to tours and thence he rode to sully to see the king  i had no heart for glad surprises this time but having sent on a letter to my master by a kings messenger who rode from compiegne ere we did i was expected and welcomed by elliot and my master with all the joy that might be after our long severance  and in my masters hands i laid my newly gotten gear and heard privily from him that with his goodwill i and his daughter might wed so soon as she would  for she is pining with grief and prayer and fasting and marriage is the best remede for such maladies  of this grace i was right glad yet christmas went by and i dared not speak for elliot seemed set on far other things than mirth and was ever and early in the churches above all when service and prayer were offered up for the maid  she was very willing to hear all the tale of the long siege and her face that was thin and wan unlike her bright countenance of old flushed scarlet when she heard how we had bearded and shamed the noble duke of burgundy and what words xaintrailles had spoken concerning his nobleness  there is one true knight left in france she said and fell silent again  then we being alone in the chamber i tried to take her hand but she drew it away  my dear love she said i know all that is in your heart and all my love that is in mine you know well  but in mine there is no care for happiness and joy and to speak as plain as a maiden may i have now no will to marry  while the sister of the saints lies in duresse or if she be unjustly slain i have set up my rest to abide unwed for ever as the bride of heaven  and if the last evil befall her as well i deem it must i shall withdraw me from the world into the sisterhood of the clarisses  had the great midbeam of the roof fallen and smitten me i could not have been stricken more dumb and dead  my face showed what was in my mind belike for looking fearfully and tenderly on me she took my hand between hers and cherished it  my love i said at last you see in what case i am that can scarce speak for sorrow after all i have ventured and laboured and won for you and for the maid  and i she answered being but a girl can venture and give nothing but my poor prayers and if she now perish then i must pray the more continually for the good rest of her soul and the forgiveness of her enemies and false friends  sure she hath already the certain promise of paradise and even in this world her life is with the saints  and if men slay her body we need her prayers more than she needs ours  but elliot said no word being very wilful  consider what manner of friend the maid is i said who desires nothing but joy and happy life to all whom she loves as she loves you verily i am right well assured that could she see us in this hour she would bid you be happy with me and not choose penance for love of her  if she herself bids me do as you desire said elliot at last then i would not be disobedient to that daughter of god  here i took some comfort for now a thought came into my mind  but said elliot as we read of the rich man and lazarus between her and us is a great gulf fixed and none may come from her to us or from us to her  elliot i said if either the maid be delivered or if she sends you sure and certain tidings under her own hand that she wills you to put off this humour will you then be persuaded and make no more delay  indeed if either of these miracles befall or both right gladly will i obey both you and her  but now her saints methinks have left her wearied by the wickedness of france  i ask no more i answered for elliot either the maid shall be free or she shall send you this command or you shall see my face no more  my purpose was now clear before me even as i executed it as shall be seen  indeed if my vow must be kept never may i again behold you for oh my love my heart would surely break in twain being already weak with grief and fasting and weary with prayer  whereon she laid her kind arms about my neck and despite my manhood i wept no less than she  for holy writ says well that hope deferred maketh the heart sick and mine was sick unto death  of my resolve i spoke no word more to elliot lest her counsel should change when she knew the jeopardy whereinto i was firmly minded to go and to my master i said no more than that i was minded to ride to the court and for that end i turned into money a part of my treasure for money i should need more than arms  one matter in especial which i deemed should stand me in the greatest stead i purchased for gold of the pottinger at tours the same who had nursed me after my wound  this draught i bestowed in a silver phial graven with strange signs and i kept it ever close and secret for it was my chief mainstay  secretly as i wrought yet i deem that my master had some understanding of what was in my mind though i told him nothing of the words between me and elliot  for i was in no way without hope that when the bitterness of her grief was overpast elliot might change her counsel  and again i would not have him devise and dispute with her as now whereby i very well knew that she would be but the more unhappy and the more set on taking her own wilful way  i therefore said no more than that it behoved me to see such captains as were about the king  thereafter i bade them farewell nor am i disposed to write concerning what passed at the parting of elliot and me  for thrice ere now i had left her to pass into the mouth of war but now i went into other peril and with fainter hope  i did indeed ride to the court which was at sully and there i met as i desired barthelemy barrette  he greeted me well and was richly clad and prosperous to behold  but it gave me greater joy that he spoke of some secret enterprise which should shortly be put in hand when the spring came  for i have good intelligence he said that the bastard of orleans will ride privily to louviers with menatarms  now louviers where la hire lies in garrison is but seven leagues from rouen town and what secret enterprise can he purpose there save to break the cage and set free the bird  in this hope i tarried long intending to ride with the spears of barthelemy and placing my trust on two knights so good and skilled in war as la hire and the bastard the maids old companions in fight  but the days waxed long and it was march the thirteenth ere we rode north and already the doctors had begun to entrap the maid with their questions whereof there could be but one end  without adventure very notable riding much at night through forests and byways we came to louviers where they received us joyfully  for it was very well known that the english were minded to besiege this town that braved them so near their gates at rouen and that they only held back till they had slain the maid  while she lived they dared not stir against us knowing well that their men feared to follow their flag  now indeed i was in good hope but alas there were long counsels of the captains there was much harrying of normandy and some outlying bands of english were trapped and prisoners were taken  but of an assault on rouen we heard no word and indeed the adventure was desperate though for the honour of france i marvel yet that it was not put to the touch  there is nought to be done barthelemy said to me i cannot take rouen with a handful of spears and the captains will not stir  then said i farewell for under the lilies i fight never again  one chance remains and i go to prove it  man you are mad he answered me  what desperate peril are you minded to run  i am minded to end this matter i said  my honour and my very life stand upon it  ask me not why and swear that you will keep this secret from all men if you would do the last service to me and to her whom we both love  i tell you that help me or hinder me i have no choice but this yet so much i will say to you that i put myself in this jeopardy for my honour and the honour of scotland and for my lady  the days are past for the old chivalry he said but no more words  i swear by st ouen to keep your counsel and if more i can do without mere madness and risk out of all hope i will do it  this you can do without risk  let me have the accoutrements of one of the englishmen who lie in ward and let me ride with your band at daybreak tomorrow  it is easy to tell some feigned tale when you ride back without me  you will not ride into rouen in english guise  they will straightway hang you for a spy and therein is little honour  my purpose is some deal subtler i said with a laugh but let me keep my own counsel  so be it said he a wilful man must have his way  and now i drink to your better wisdom and may you escape that rope on which your heart seems to be set  i grasped his hand on it and by point of day we were riding out seawards  we made an onslaught on a village burned a house or twain and seized certain wains of hay so in the confusion i slipped forward and rode alone into a little wood  there i clad myself in english guise having carried the gear in a wallet on my saddlebow and so pushed on till at nightfall i came to a certain little fishingvillage  there under cover of the dark i covenanted with a fisherman to set me across the channel i feigning to be a deserter who was fleeing from the english army for fear of the maid  i would well that i had to carry all the sort of you said the boat master for i had offered him my horse and a great reward in money part down and the other part to be paid when i set foot in england  nor did he make any tarrying but taking his nets on board as if he would be about his lawful business set sail with his two sons for a crew  the east wind served us to a miracle and after as fair a passage as might be they landed me under cloud of night not far from the great port of winchelsea  that night i slept none but walking fast and warily under cover of a fog i fetched a compass about and ended by walking into the town of rye by the road from the north  here i went straight to the best inn of the place and calling aloud for breakfast i bade the drawer bring mine host to me instantly  for at louviers we were so well served by spies the country siding with us rather than with the english that i knew how a company of the earl of warwicks men was looked for in winchelsea to sail when they had a fair wind for rouen  mine host came to me in a servile english fashion and asked me what i would  first a horse said i for mine dropped dead last night ten miles hence on the north road in your marshes god damn them and you may see by my rusty spur and miry boot that i have walked far  here i cried pulling off my boots and flinging them down on the rushes of the floor bid one of your varlets clean them  next breakfast and a pot of your ale and then i shall see what manner of horses you keep for i must needs ride to winchelsea  you would join the men under the banner of sir thomas grey of falloden i make no doubt he answered  your speech smacks of the northern parts and the good knight comes from no long way south of the border his men rode through our town but few days agone  and me they left behind on the way i answered so evil is my luck in horseflesh  but for this blessed wind out of the east that hinders them my honour were undone  my tale was not too hard of belief and before noon i was on my way to winchelsea a stout nag enough between my legs  the first manatarms whom i met i hailed bidding him lead me straight to sir thomas grey of falloden  what you would take service he asked in a cumberland burr that i knew well for indeed it came ready enough on my own tongue  yea by st cuthbert i answered for on the marches nothing stirs moreover i have slain a man and fled my own country  with that he bade god damn his soul if i were not a good fellow and so led me straight to the lodgings of the knight under whose colours he served  to him i told the same tale adding that i had heard late of his levying of his men otherwise i had ridden to join him at his setting forth  you have seen war he asked  only a wardens raid or twain on the mosstrooping scots of liddesdale branxholme i have seen in a blaze and have faced fire at the castle of the hermitage  you speak the tongue of the northern parts he said are you noble  a poor cousin of the storeys of netherby i answered which was true enough and when he questioned me about my kin i showed him that i knew every name and scutcheon of the line my mother having instructed me in all such lore of her family 38  and wherefore come you here alone and in such plight  by reason of a swordstroke at stainishawbank fair i answered boldly  faith then i see no cause why as your will is so good you should not soon have your bellyful of swordstrokes  for when once we have burned that limb of the devil the puzel for so the english call the maid we shall shortly drive these forsworn dogs the french back beyond the loire  i felt my face reddening at these ill words so i stooped as if to clear my spur of mire  shortly shall she taste the tarbarrel i answered whereat he swore and laughed then calling a clerk bade him write my indenture as is the english manner  thus thanks to my northern english tongue for which i was sore beaten by the other boys when i was a boy myself behold me a manatarms of king henry and so much of my enterprise was achieved  i make no boast of valour and indeed i greatly feared for my neck both now and later  for my risk was that some one of the menatarms in rouen whither we were bound should have seen my face either at orleans at paris where i was unhelmeted or in the taking of the bastille at compiegne  yet my visor was down both at orleans and compiegne and of those few who marked me in girls gear in paris none might chance to meet me at rouen or to remember me in changed garments  so i put a bold brow on it for better might not be  none cursed the puzel more loudly than i and without feigning none longed so sorely as i for a fair wind to france wherefore i was ever going about winchelsea with my head in the air gazing at the weathercocks  and as fortune would have it the wind went about and we on board and with no long delay were at rouen town     chapter xxxihow norman leslie saw the maid in her prison   on arriving in the town of rouen three things were my chief care whereof the second helped me in the third  the first was to be lodged as near as i might to the castle wherein the maid lay being chained so fell was the cruelty of the english to her bed  the next matter was to purvey me three horses of the fleetest  here my fortune served me well for the young esquires and pages would ever be riding races outside of the gates they being in no fear of war and the time till the maid was burned hung heavy on their hands  i therefore following the manner of the english marchmen thrust myself forward in these sports and would change horses giving money to boot for any that outran my own  my money i spent with a very free hand both in wagers and in feasting men atarms so that i was taken to be a good fellow and i willingly let many make their profit of me  in the end i had three horses that with a light rider in the saddle could be caught by none in the whole garrison of rouen  thirdly i was most sedulous in all duty and so won the favour of sir thomas grey the rather that he counted cousins with me and reckoned that we were of some faroff kindred wherein he spoke the truth  thus partly for our common blood partly for that i was ever ready at call and forward to do his will and partly because none could carry a message swifter or adventure further to spy out any bands of the french he kept me close to him and trusted me as his galloper  nay he gave me on occasion his signet to open the town gates whensoever he would send me on any errand  moreover the man noble by birth but base by breeding who had the chief charge and custody of the maid was the brothers son of sir thomas  he had to name john grey and was an esquire of the body of the english king henry then a boy  this miscreant it was often my fortune to meet at his uncles table and to hear his pitiless and cruel speech  yet making friends as scripture commands us of the mammon of unrighteousness i set myself to win the affection of john grey by laughing at his jests and doing him what service i might  once or twice i dropped to him a word of my great desire to see the famed puzel for the trials that had been held in open hall were now done in the dungeon where only the bishop the doctors of law and the notaries might hear them  her noble bearing indeed and wise answers which were plainly put into her mouth by the saints for she was simple and ignorant had gained mens hearts  one day they told me an english lord had criedthe brave lass pity she is not english  for to the english all the rest of gods earth is as nazareth out of which can come no good thing  thus none might see the maid and once and again i let fall a word in john greys ear concerning my desire to look on her in prison  i dared make no show of eagerness though now the month of may had come which was both her good and ill month  for in may she first went to vaucouleurs and prophesied in may she delivered orleans and in may she was taken at compiegne wherefore i deemed as men will that in may she should escape her prison or in may should die  moreover on the first day of march they had asked her mocking her  shalt thou be delivered  and she had answered  ask me on this day three months and i shall declare it to you  the english knowing this made all haste to end her ere may ended wherefore i had the more occasion for speed  now on a certain day being may the eighth the heart of john grey was merry within him  he had well drunk and i had let him win of me at the dice that one of my three horses which most he coveted  he then struck me in friendly fashion on the back and cried  an unlucky day for thee and for england  this very day two years agone that limb of the devil drove us by her sorceries from before orleans  but tomorrow and he laughed grossly in his beard  storey you are a good fellow though a fool at the dice  faith i have met my master i said  but the lesson you gave me was worth bay salkeld for so i had named my horse after a great english house on the border who dwell at the castle of corby  i will do thee a good turn he said  you crave to see this puzel ere they put on her the high witchs cap for her hellward journey  i should like it not ill i said it were something to tell my grandchildren when all france is english land  then you shall see her for this is your last chance to see her whole  what mean you fair sir i asked while my heart gave a turn in my body and i put out my hand to a great tankard of wine  tomorrow the charity of the church hath resolved that she shall be had into the torturechamber  i set my lips to the tankard and drank long to hide my face and for that i was nigh swooning with a passion of fear and wrath  thanks to st george i said the end is nigh  the end of the tankard quoth he looking into it hath already come you drink like a man of the land debatable  yet i was in such case that though by custom i drink little the great draught touched not my brain and did but give me heart  you might challenge at skinking that great danish knight who was with us under orleans sir andrew haggard was his name and his bearings were     39  so he was running on for he himself had drunk more than his share when i brought him back to my matter  but as touching this puzel how may i have my view of her that you graciously offered me  my men change guard at curfew he said five come out and five go in and i shall bid them seek you here at your lodgings  so now farewell and your revenge with the dice you shall have when so you will  nay pardon me one moment when relieve you the guard that enters at curfew  an hour after point of day  but now i bethink me you scarce will care to pass all the night in the puzels company  hast thou paper or parchment  i set paper and ink before him who said  nay write yourself i am no great clerk yet i can sign and seal  therewith at his wording i set down an order to the castle porter to let me forth as early in the night as i would  this pass he signed with his name and sealed with his ring bearing his arms  so i wish you joy of this tryst and bonne fortune he said and departed  i had two hours before me ere curfew rang and the time was more than i needed  therefore i went first to the church of st ouen which is very great and fair and there clean confessed me and made my orisons that if it were gods will this enterprise might turn to his honour and to the salvation of the maid  and pitifully i besought madame st catherine of fierbois that as she had delivered me a sinner she would deliver the sister of the saints  next i went back to my lodgings and there bade the hostler to have my two best steeds saddled and bridled in stall by point of day for a council was being held that night in the castle and i and another of sir thomass company might be sent early with a message to the bishop of avranches  this holy man as then was a cause of trouble and delay to the regent and pierre cauchon bishop of beauvais because he was just and fell not in with their treasons  next i clad myself in double raiment doublet above doublet and hose over hose my doublets bearing the red cross of st george  over all i threw a great mantle falling to the feet as if i feared the night chills  thereafter i made a fair copy of my own writing in the pass given to me by john grey and copied his signature also and feigned his seal with a seal of clay for it might chance that two passes proved better than one  then i put in a little wallet hanging to my girdle the signet of sir thomas grey and the pass given to me by john grey also an inkhorn with pen and paper and in my hand secretly i held that phial which i had bought of the apothecary in tours  all my gold and jewels i hid about my body i sharpened my sword and dagger and then had no more to do but wait till curfew rang  this was the weariest part of all for what i thought if john grey had forgotten his promise the wine being about his wits  therefore i walked hither and thither in my chamber in much misdoubt but at the chime of curfew i heard rude voices below and a heavy step on the stairs  it was a manatarms of the basest sort who lurching with his shoulder against my door came in and said that he and his fellows waited my pleasure thereon i showed him the best countenance and bade my host fill a pannier with meat and cakes and wine to pass the hours in the prison merrily  i myself ran down into the hosts cellar and was very busy in tasting wine for i would have the best  and in making my choice while the host stooped over a cask to draw a fresh tankard i poured all the drugs of my phial into a large pewter vessel with a lid filled it with wine and tasting it swore it would serve my turn  this flagon such as we call a tappit hen in my country but far greater i bore with me up the cellar stairs and gave it to one of the guard bidding him spill not a drop or he should go thirsty  the lourdaud that was their captain carried the pannier and laughing we crossed the street and the moat giving the word bedford  to the porter i showed my pass telling him that though i was loath to disturb him i counted not to watch all night in the cell wherefore i gave him a gold piece for the trouble he might have in letting me go forth at an hour untimely  herewith he was well content and so passing the word to the sentinel at each post we entered  and now indeed my heart beat so that my body seemed to shake with hope and fear as i walked  at the door of the chamber wherein the maid lay we met her guards coming forth who cried roughly bidding her good even and to think well of what waited her meaning the torments  they tumbled down the stairs laughing while we went in and i last  it was a dark vaulted chamber with one window near the roof narrow and heavily barred in the recess by the window was a brazier burning and casting as much shadow as light by reason of the smoke  here also was a rude table stained with foul circles of potrims and there were five or six stools on a weighty oaken bed lay one in mans raiment black in hue her face downwards and her arms spread over her neck  it could scarce be that she slept but she lay like one dead only shuddering when the lourdaud the captain of the guard smote her on the shoulder asking in english how she did  here she is sir surly as ever and poor company for christian men  see you how cunningly all her limbs are gyved and chained to the iron bolts of the bed  what would my lady jeanne give me for this little master key  here he showed a slender key hung on a steel chain about his neck  never a saint of the three michael margaret and catherine can take this from me nay nor the devils who wear their forms  have you seen this fair company of hers i whispered in english crossing myself  no more than she saw the white lady that goes with that other witch catherine of la rochelle  but sir she is sullen it is her manner with your good leave shall we sup  this was my own desire so putting the pannier on the table i carved the meat with my dagger and poured out the wine in cups and they fell to being hungry as englishmen are at all times  they roared over their meat eating like wolves and drinking like fishes and one would sing a lewd song and the others strike in with the overword but drinking was their main avail  this is better stuff says the lourdaud than our english ale  faith tis strong my lads  wake up jenkin wake up hal and then he roared a snatch but stopped looking drowsily about him  o brothers in christ who hear this tale remember ye that for now four months and more the cleanest soul in christenty and the chastest lady and of manners the noblest had endured this company by night and by day  nay wake up i cried ye are dull revellers what say ye to the dice  therewith i set out my tablier and the dice  then i filled up the cup afresh pretending to drink and laid on the foul table a great shining heap of gold  their dull eyes shone like the metal when i said  myself will be judge and umpire play ye honest fellows for i crave no gains from you  only a cup for luck  they camped at the table all the five of them and some while their greed kept them wakeful and they called the mains but their drought kept them drinking  and one by one their heads fell heavy on the table or they sprawled on their stools and so sank on to the floor so potent were the poppy and mandragora of the leech in tours  at last they were all sound on sleep one mans hand yet clutching a pile of my gold that now and again would slip forth and jingle on the stone floor  now all this time she had never stirred but lay as she had lain her face downwards her arms above her neck  stealthily i took the chain and the key from about the neck of the sleeping lourdaud and then drew near her on tiptoe  i listened and from her breathing i believe that she slept as extreme labour and weariness and sorrow do sometimes bring their own remede  then a thought came into my mind how i should best awake her and stooping i said in her ear  fille de  instantly she turned about and sitting up folded her hands as one in prayer deeming belike that she was aroused by the voices of her saints  i kneeled down beside the bed and whisperedmadame jeanne look on my face  she gazed on me and now i saw her brave face weary and thin and white and greater than of old the great grey eyes  i said once came her sweet voice that thou alone shouldst stand by me when all had forsaken me  fair saints do i dream but a dream  nay madame i said thou wakest and dost not dream  one has sent me who loves thee even my lady elliot and now listen for the time is short  see here i have the masterkey and when i have unlocked thy bonds      thou hast not slain these men she asked  that were deadly sin  nay they do but sleep and will waken belike ere the fresh guard comes wherefore we must make haste  when i have freed thee do on thy body above thy raiment this doublet of mine for it carries the cross of england and i being of little stature you may well pass for me  moreover this cloak and its hood which i wore when i came in will cover thee  then when thou goest forth give the word bedford to the sentinels and to the porter in the gate show this written pass of john greys  he knows it already having seen it this night  next when thou art without the castle fare to the hostelry called the rose and apple which is nearest the castle gate and so straight into the stable where stand two steeds saddled and bridled  choose the black he is the swifter  if the hostler be awake he expects me and will take thee for me mount with no word and ride to the eastern port  there show to the gate ward this signet of sir thomas grey and he will up with portcullis and down with drawbridge for he has often done no less for me and that signet  then madame ride for louviers and you shall break your fast with the bastard and la hire  her white face changed to red like the morning light as on that day at orleans before she took les tourelles  then the flush faded and she grew ashen pale while she said  but thou how shalt thou get forth  madame i said fear not for me  i will follow after thee and shame the sleepy porter to believe that he has dreamed a dream  and i have written this other pass on seeing which he will needs credit me being adrowse and moreover i will pay him well  and i shall be at the stable as soon almost as thou and i have told the hostler that belike i shall ride with a friend carrying a message to the bishop of avranches for i have beguiled the english to believe me of their party as madame judith wrought to the tyrant holofernes  nay she answered simply this may not be  even if the porter were to be bought or beguiled thou couldst not pass the sentinels  it may not be  the sentinels belike are sleeping or wellnigh sleeping and i have a dagger  o madame for the sake of the fortune of france and the honour of the kingfor this i knew was my surest hopedelay not nor reck at all of me  i have but one life and it is thine freely  they will burn thee or slay thee with other torments  not so i said i shall not be taken alive  that were deadly sin she answered  i shall not go and leave thee to die for me  then were my honour lost and i could not endure to live entreat me not for i will not go forth as now  nay more i tell thee as i have told my judges that which the saints have spoken to me  bear this thy martyrdom gently they say tu ten viendras en royaume du paradis  moreover this i know that i am to be delivered with great victory  here she clasped her hands looking upwards and her face was as the face of an angel  fair victory it were to leave thee in my place and so make liars of my brethren of paradise  then alas i knew that i was of no more avail to move her yet one last art i tried  madame i said i have prayed you in the name of the fortune of france and the honour of the king which is tarnished for ever if you escape not  i shall be delivered she answered  i pray you in the dear name of your lady mother madame du lys  i shall be delivered she said and with great victory  now i pray thee in my own name and in that of thy first friend my lady  she has made a vow to give her virginity to heaven unless either thou art set free or she have tidings from thee that thou willest her to wed me without whom i have no desire to live but far rather this very night to perish  for i am clean confessed within these six hours knowing that i was like to be in some jeopardy  then she said smiling sweetly and signing that i should take her handthen live norman leslie for this is to me an easy thing and a joyous  thou art a clerk hast thou wherewithal to write  yes madame here in my wallet  then write as i tell thee     jhesu maria     i jehanne la pucelle send from prison here in rouen my tidings of    love to elliot hume my first friend among women and bid her for my    sake wed him who loves her norman leslie of pitcullo my faithful    servant praying that all happiness may go with them  in witness    whereto my hand being guided to write i set my name jehanne la    pucelle this ninth day of may in the year fourteen hundred and    thirtyone  so guide my hand she said taking the pen from my fingers and thus guided while my tears fell on her hand she wrote jehanne la pucelle  now quoth she smiling as of old we must seal this missive  cut off one lock of my hair with your dagger for my last gift to my first friend and make the seal all orderly  i did as she bade and bringing a lighted stick from the brazier i melted wax  then when it was smooth she laid on it two hairs from the little sundered lock as was sometimes her custom and bade me seal with my own signet and put the brief in my wallet  now all is done she said  nay nay i said to die for thee is more to me than to live in love ah nay go forth i beseech thee  with victory shall i go forth and now i lay my last commands on the last of all my servants  if in aught i have ever offended thee in word or deed forgive me  i could but bow my head for i was weeping though her eyes were dry  and so farewell she said  as thou art leal and true begone it is my order and make no tarrying tomorrow i have much to do and needs must i sleep while these men are quiet  say to thy lady that i love her dearly and bid her hope as i also hope  farewell  she moved her thin hand which i kissed kneeling  again she said farewell and turned her back on me as if she would sleep  then i hung the chain and key again on the neck of the lourdaud i put some of the fallen coins in the mens pouches but bestowed the dice and tablier in my wallet  i opened the door and went forth not looking back and so from the castle showing my pass and giving the porter another coin  then i went home in the sweet dawn of may and casting myself on my bed i wept bitterly for today she should be tormented        of the rest i have no mind to tell though they had not the heart to torture the maid for it puts me out of charity with a people who have a name to be christians and it is my desire if i may to forgive all men before i die  at rouen i endured to abide even until the day of unjust doom and my reason was that i ever hoped for some miracle even as her saints had promised  but it was their will that she should be made perfect through suffering and being set free through the gate of fire should win her victory over unfaith and mortal fear  wherefore i stood afar off at the end seeing nothing of what befell yet i clearly heard as did all men there the last word of her sweet voice and the cry of jhesus  then i passed through the streets where men and women and the very english were weeping and saddling my swiftest horse i rode to the east port  when the gate had closed behind me i turned and lifting my hand i tore the cross of st george from my doublet  dogs i cried ye have burned a saint  a curse on cruel english and coward french  st andrew for scotland  the shafts and bolts hailed past me as i wheeled about there was mounting of steeds and a clatter of hoofs behind me but the sound died away ere i rode into louviers  there i told them the tale which was their shame and so betook me to tours and to my lady     chapter xxxiithe end of this chronicle   it serves not to speak of my later fortunes being those of a private man nor have i the heart to recall old sorrows  we were wedded when elliots grief had in some sort abated and for one year we were happier than god has willed that sinful men should long be in this world  then that befell which has befallen many  i may not write of it suffice it that god took from me both her and her child  then after certain weeks and days of which i am blessed enough to keep little memory i forswore arms and served in the household of the lady margaret of scotland who married the dauphin on an unhappy day  i have known much of courts and of the learned i have seen the wicked man exalted and brother thomas noiroufle in great honour with charles vii king of france and offering before him with his murderous hands the blessed sacrifice of the mass  the death of the lady margaret slain by lying tongues and the sudden sight of that evil man brother thomas raised to power and place drove me from france and i was certain years with the kings ambassadors at the courts of italy  there i heard how the holy inquisition had reversed that false judgment of the english and false french at rouen which made me some joy  and then finding old age come upon me i withdrew to my own country where i have lived in religion somewhile in the abbey of dunfermline and this year gone in our cell of pluscardine where i now write and where i hope to die and be buried  here ends my tale in my latin chronicle left untold of how a scots monk was with the maid both in her victories and recoveries of towns and even till her death  for myself i now grow old and the earthly time to come is short and there remaineth a rest for all souls christian  miscreants i have heard of men misbelieving and heretics who deny that the spirit abides after the death of the body for in the long years say they the spirit with the flesh wanes and at last dies with the bodily death  wherein they not only make holy church a liar but are visibly confounded by this truth which i know and feel namely that while my flesh wastes hourly towards old age and of many things my memory is weakened yet of that day in chinon i mind me as clearly and see my love as well and hear her sweet voice as plain as if she had but now left the room  herein my memory does not fail nor does love faint growing stronger with the years like the stream as it races to the fall  wherefore being more strong than time love shall be more strong than death  the river of my life speeds yearly swifter the years like months go by the months like weeks the weeks like days  even so fleet on o time till i rest beside her feet  nay never being young did i more desire my loves presence when we were apart than today i desire it the memory of her filling all my heart as fragrance of flowers fills a room till it seems as if she were not far away but near me as i write of her  and foolish that i am i look up as if i might see her by my side  i know not if this be so with all men for indeed i have asked none nor spoken to any of the matter save in confession  for i have loved this once and no more wherefore i deem me happier than most and more certain of a good end to my love where the blessed dwell in the rose of paradise beholding the beatific vision  to this end i implore the prayers of all christian souls who read this book and of all the saints and of that sister of the saints whom while i might i served in my degree  venerabilis johanna  ora pro nobis     appendix anormans miracle
