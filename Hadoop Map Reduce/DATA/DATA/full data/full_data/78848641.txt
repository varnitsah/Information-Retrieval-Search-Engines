78848641	eclectic english classics  the spy  a tale of the neutral ground  by james fenimore cooper  edited by  nathaniel waring barnes  professor of english composition in de pauw university greencastle indiana     james fenimore cooper  i believe i could write a better story myself with these words since become famous james fenimore cooper laid aside the english novel which he was reading aloud to his wife a few days later he submitted several pages of manuscript for her approval and then settled down to the task of making good his boast in november 1820 he gave the public a novel in two volumes entitled precaution but it was published anonymously and dealt with english society in so much the same way as the average british novel of the time that its author was thought by many to be an englishman it had no originality and no real merit of any kind yet it was the means of inciting cooper to another attempt and this second novel made him famous  when precaution appeared some of coopers friends protested against his weak dependence on british models their arguments stirred his patriotism and he determined to write another novel using thoroughly american material accordingly he turned to westchester county where he was then living a county which had been the scene of much stirring action during a good part of the revolutionary war and composed the spya tale of the neutral ground this novel was published in 1821 and was immediately popular both in this country and in england soon it was translated into french then into other foreign languages until it was read more widely than any other tale of the century cooper had written the first american novel he had also struck an original literary vein and he had gained confidence in himself as a writer  following this pronounced success in authorship cooper set to work on a third book and continued for the remainder of his life to devote most of his time to writing altogether he wrote over thirty novels and as many more works of a miscellaneous character but much of this writing has no interest for us at the present time especially that which was occasioned by the many controversies in which the rather belligerent cooper involved himself his work of permanent value after the spy falls into two groups the tales of wilderness life and the sea tales both these groups grew directly out of his experiences in early life  cooper was born on september 15 1789 in burlington new jersey but while still very young he was taken to cooperstown on the shores of otsego lake in central new york his father owned many thousand acres of primeval forest about this village and so through the years of a free boyhood the young cooper came to love the wilderness and to know the characters of border life when the village school was no longer adequate he went to study privately in albany and later entered yale college but he was not interested in the study of books when as a junior he was expelled from college he turned to a career in the navy accordingly in the fall of 1806 he sailed on a merchant ship the sterling and for the next eleven months saw hard service before the mast soon after this apprenticeship he received a commission as a midshipman in the united states navy although it was a time of peace and he saw no actual fighting he gained considerable knowledge from his service on lake ontario and lake champlain that he put to good use later shortly before his resignation in may 1811 he had married and for several years thereafter he lived along in a pleasant leisurely fashion part of the time in cooperstown and part of the time in westchester county until almost accidentally he broke into the writing of his first novel aside from the publication of his books coopers later life was essentially uneventful he died at cooperstown on september 14 1851  the connection of coopers best writing with the life he knew at first hand is thus perfectly plain in his novels dealing with the wilderness popularly known as the leatherstocking tales he drew directly on his knowledge of the backwoods and backwoodsmen as he gained it about cooperstown in the pioneers 1823 he dealt with the scenes of his boyhood scenes which lay very close to his heart and in the other volumes of this series the last of the mohicans 1826 the prairie 1827 the pathfinder 1840 and the deerslayer 1841 he continued to write of the trappers and frontiersmen and outpost garrisons and indians who made up the forest life he knew so well similarly in the sea tales which began with the pilot1823 and included the red rover1828 the two admirals 1842 and the wingandwing1842 he made full use of his experiences before the mast and in the navy the nautical accuracy of these tales of the sea could scarcely have been attained by a landlubber it has much practical significance then that cooper chose material which he knew intimately and which gripped his own interest his success came like thackerays and stevensons and mark twainswithout his having to reach to the other side of the world after his material  in considering coopers work as a novelist nothing is more marked than his originality in these days we take novels based on american history and novels of the sea for granted but at the time when cooper published the spy and the pilot neither an american novel nor a saltwater novel had ever been written so far as americans before cooper had written fiction at all washington irving had been the only one to cease from a timid imitation of british models but irvings material was local rather than national it was cooper who first told the story of the conquest of the american continent he caught the poetry and the romantic thrill of both the american forest and the sea he dared to break away from literary conventions his reward was an immediate and widespread success together with a secure place in the history of his countrys literature  there was probably a twofold reason for the success which coopers novels won at home and abroad in the first place cooper could invent a good story and tell it well he was a master of rapid stirring narrative and his tales were elemental not deep or subtle secondly he created interesting characters who had the restless energy the passion for adventure the rugged confidence of our american pioneers first among these great characters came harvey birch in the spy but coopers real triumph was natty bumppo who appears in all five of the leatherstocking tales this skilled trapper faithful guide brave fighter and homely philosopher was the first real american in fiction an important contribution to the worlds literature in addition cooper created the indian of literatureperhaps a little too noble to be entirely true to lifeand various simple strong seamen his chingachgook and uncas and long tom coffin justly brought him added fame in these narrative gifts as well as in the robustness of his own character cooper was not unlike sir walter scott he once modestly referred to himself as a chip from scotts block and has frequently been called the american scott  but of course cooper had limitations and faults when he stepped outside the definite boundaries of the life he knew he was unable to handle character effectively his women are practically failures and like his military officers essentially interchangeable his humor is almost invariably labored and tedious he occasionally allowed long passages of description or long speeches by some minor character to clog the progress of his action now and then in inventing his plots he strained his readers credulity somewhat finally as a result of his rapid writing his work is uneven and without style in the sense that a careful craftsman or a sensitive artist achieves it he is even guilty of an occasional error in grammar or word use which the young pupil in the schools can detect yet his literary powers easily outweigh all these weaknesses he is unquestionably one of americas great novelists and one of the worlds great romancers  there is abundant reason therefore why americans of the present day should know james fenimore cooper he has many a good story of the wilderness and the sea to tell to those who enjoy tales of adventure he gives a vivid but faithful picture of american frontier life for those who can know its stirring events and its hardy characters only at second hand he holds a peculiarly important place in the history of american literature and has done much to extend the reputation of american fiction among foreigners     authors introduction  the author has often been asked if there were any foundation in real life for the delineation of the principal character in this book he can give no clearer answer to the question than by laying before his readers a simple statement of the facts connected with its original publication  many years since the writer of this volume was at the residence of an illustrious man who had been employed in various situations of high trust during the darkest days of the american revolution the discourse turned upon the effects which great political excitement produces on character and the purifying consequences of a love of country when that sentiment is powerfully and generally awakened in a people he who from his years his services and his knowledge of men was best qualified to take the lead in such a conversation was the principal speaker after dwelling on the marked manner in which the great struggle of the nation during the war of 1775 had given a new and honorable direction to the thoughts and practices of multitudes whose time had formerly been engrossed by the most vulgar concerns of life he illustrated his opinions by relating an anecdote the truth of which he could attest as a personal witness  the dispute between england and the united states of america though not strictly a family quarrel had many of the features of a civil war the people of the latter were never properly and constitutionally subject to the people of the former but the inhabitants of both countries owed allegiance to a common king the americans as a nation disavowed this allegiance and the english choosing to support their sovereign in the attempt to regain his power most of the feelings of an internal struggle were involved in the conflict a large proportion of the emigrants from europe then established in the colonies took part with the crown and there were many districts in which their influence united to that of the americans who refused to lay aside their allegiance gave a decided preponderance to the royal cause america was then too young and too much in need of every heart and hand to regard these partial divisions small as they were in actual amount with indifference the evil was greatly increased by the activity of the english in profiting by these internal dissensions and it became doubly serious when it was found that attempts were made to raise various corps of provincial troops who were to be banded with those from europe to reduce the young republic to subjection congress named an especial and a secret committee therefore for the express purpose of defeating this object of this committee mr the narrator of the anecdote was chairman  in the discharge of the novel duties which now devolved on him mr had occasion to employ an agent whose services differed but little from those of a common spy this man as will easily be understood belonged to a condition in life which rendered him the least reluctant to appear in so equivocal a character he was poor ignorant so far as the usual instruction was concerned but cool shrewd and fearless by nature it was his office to learn in what part of the country the agents of the crown were making their efforts to embody men to repair to the place enlist appear zealous in the cause he affected to serve and otherwise to get possession of as many of the secrets of the enemy as possible the last he of course communicated to his employers who took all the means in their power to counteract the plans of the english and frequently with success  it will readily be conceived that a service like this was attended with great personal hazard in addition to the danger of discovery there was the daily risk of falling into the hands of the americans themselves who invariably visited sins of this nature more severely on the natives of the country than on the europeans who fell into their hands in fact the agent of mr  was several times arrested by the local authorities and in one instance he was actually condemned by his exasperated countrymen to the gallows speedy and private orders to the jailer alone saved him from an ignominious death he was permitted to escape and this seeming and indeed actual peril was of great aid in supporting his assumed character among the english by the americans in his little sphere he was denounced as a bold and inveterate tory in this manner he continued to serve his country in secret during the early years of the struggle hourly environed by danger and the constant subject of unmerited opprobrium  in the year  mr  was named to a high and honorable employment at a european court before vacating his seat in congress he reported to that body an outline of the circumstances related necessarily suppressing the name of his agent and demanding an appropriation in behalf of a man who had been of so much use at so great risk a suitable sum was voted and its delivery was confided to the chairman of the secret committee  mr  took the necessary means to summon his agent to a personal interview they met in a wood at midnight here mr  complimented his companion on his fidelity and adroitness explained the necessity of their communications being closed and finally tendered the money the other drew back and declined receiving it the country has need of all its means he said as for myself i can work or gain a livelihood in various ways persuasion was useless for patriotism was uppermost in the heart of this remarkable individual and mr  departed bearing with him the gold he had brought and a deep respect for the man who had so long hazarded his life unrequited for the cause they served in common  the writer is under an impression that at a later day the agent of mr  consented to receive a remuneration for what he had done but it was not until his country was entirely in a condition to bestow it  it is scarcely necessary to add that an anecdote like this simply but forcibly told by one of its principal actors made a deep impression on all who heard it many years later circumstances which it is unnecessary to relate and of an entirely adventitious nature induced the writer to publish a novel which proved to be what he little foresaw at the time the first of a tolerably long series the same adventitious causes which gave birth to the book determined its scene and its general character the former was laid in a foreign country and the latter embraced a crude effort to describe foreign manners when this tale was published it became matter of reproach among the authors friends that he an american in heart as in birth should give to the world a work which aided perhaps in some slight degree to feed the imaginations of the young and unpracticed among his own countrymen by pictures drawn from a state of society so different from that to which he belonged the writer while he knew how much of what he had done was purely accidental felt the reproach to be one that in a measure was just as the only atonement in his power he determined to inflict a second book whose subject should admit of no cavil not only on the world but on himself he chose patriotism for his theme and to those who read this introduction and the book itself it is scarcely necessary to add that he took the hero of the anecdote just related as the best illustration of his subject  since the original publication of the spy there have appeared several accounts of different persons who are supposed to have been in the authors mind while writing the book as mr  did not mention the name of his agent the writer never knew any more of his identity with this or that individual than has been here explained both washington and sir henry clinton had an unusual number of secret emissaries in a war that partook so much of a domestic character and in which the contending parties were people of the same blood and language it could scarcely be otherwise  the style of the book has been revised by the author in this edition in this respect he has endeavored to make it more worthy of the favor with which it has been received though he is compelled to admit there are faults so interwoven with the structure of the tale that as in the case of a decayed edifice it would cost perhaps less to reconstruct than to repair fiveandtwenty years have been as ages with most things connected with america among other advantages that of her literature has not been the least so little was expected from the publication of an original work of this description at the time it was written that the first volume of the spy was actually printed several months before the author felt a sufficient inducement to write a line of the second the efforts expended on a hopeless task are rarely worthy of him who makes them however low it may be necessary to rate the standard of his general merit  one other anecdote connected with the history of this book may give the reader some idea of the hopes of an american author in the first quarter of the present century as the second volume was slowly printing from manuscript that was barely dry when it went into the compositors hands the publisher intimated that the work might grow to a length that would consume the profits to set his mind at rest the last chapter was actually written printed and paged several weeks before the chapters which precede it were even thought of this circumstance while it cannot excuse may serve to explain the manner in which the actors are hurried off the scene  a great change has come over the country since this book was originally written the nation is passing from the gristle into the bone and the common mind is beginning to keep even pace with the growth of the body politic the march from vera cruz to mexico was made under the orders of that gallant soldier who a quarter of a century before was mentioned with honor in the last chapter of this very book glorious as was that march and brilliant as were its results in a military point of view a stride was then made by the nation in a moral sense that has hastened it by an age in its progress toward real independence and high political influence the guns that filled the valley of the aztecs with their thunder have been heard in echoes on the other side of the atlantic producing equally hope or apprehension  there is now no enemy to fear but the one that resides within by accustoming ourselves to regard even the people as erring beings and by using the restraints that wisdom has adduced from experience there is much reason to hope that the same providence which has so well aided us in our infancy may continue to smile on our manhood  cooperstown march 29 1849  illustration map to

close of the year 1780 that a solitary traveler was seen pursuing his way through one of the numerous little valleys of westchester footnote as each state of the american union has its own counties it often happens that there are several which bear the same name the scene of this tale is in new york whose county of westchester is the nearest adjoining to the city the easterly wind with its chilling dampness and increasing violence gave unerring notice of the approach of a storm which as usual might be expected to continue for several days and the experienced eye of the traveler was turned in vain through the darkness of the evening in quest of some convenient shelter in which for the term of his confinement by the rain that already began to mix with the atmosphere in a thick mist he might obtain such accommodations as his purposes required nothing whatever offered but the small and inconvenient tenements of the lower order of the inhabitants with whom in that immediate neighborhood he did not think it either safe or politic to trust himself  the county of westchester after the british had obtained possession of the island of new york footnote the city of new york is situated on an island called manhattan but it is at one point separated from the county of westchester by a creek of only a few feet in width the bridge at this spot is called kings bridge it was the scene of many skirmishes during the war and is alluded to in this tale every manhattanese knows the difference between manhattan island and the island of manhattan the first is applied to a small district in the vicinity of corlaers hook while the last embraces the whole island or the city and county of new york as it is termed in the laws became common ground in which both parties continued to act for the remainder of the war of the revolution a large proportion of its inhabitants either restrained by their attachments or influenced by their fears affected a neutrality they did not feel the lower towns were of course more particularly under the dominion of the crown while the upper finding a security from the vicinity of the continental troops were bold in asserting their revolutionary opinions and their right to govern themselves great numbers however wore masks which even to this day have not been thrown aside and many an individual has gone down to the tomb stigmatized as a foe to the rights of his countrymen while in secret he has been the useful agent of the leaders of the revolution and on the other hand could the hidden repositories of divers flaming patriots have been opened to the light of day royal protections would have been discovered concealed under piles of british gold  at the sound of the tread of the noble horse ridden by the traveler the mistress of the farmhouse he was passing at the time might be seen cautiously opening the door of the building to examine the stranger and perhaps with an averted face communicating the result of her observations to her husband who in the rear of the building was prepared to seek if necessary his ordinary place of concealment in the adjacent woods the valley was situated about midway in the length of the county and was sufficiently near to both armies to make the restitution of stolen goods no uncommon occurrence in that vicinity it is true the same articles were not always regained but a summary substitute was generally resorted to in the absence of legal justice which restored to the loser the amount of his loss and frequently with no inconsiderable addition for the temporary use of his property in short the law was momentarily extinct in that particular district and justice was administered subject to the bias of personal interests and the passions of the strongest  the passage of a stranger with an appearance of somewhat doubtful character and mounted on an animal which although unfurnished with any of the ordinary trappings of war partook largely of the bold and upright carriage that distinguished his rider gave rise to many surmises among the gazing inmates of the different habitations and in some instances where conscience was more than ordinarily awake to no little alarm  tired with the exercise of a day of unusual fatigue and anxious to obtain a speedy shelter from the increasing violence of the storm that now began to change its character to large drops of driving rain the traveler determined as a matter of necessity to make an application for admission to the next dwelling that offered an opportunity was not long wanting and riding through a pair of neglected bars he knocked loudly at the outer door of a building of a very humble exterior without quitting his saddle a female of middle age with an outward bearing but little more prepossessing than that of her dwelling appeared to answer the summons the startled woman half closed her door again in affright as she saw by the glare of a large wood fire a mounted man so unexpectedly near its threshold and an expression of terror mingled with her natural curiosity as she required his pleasure  although the door was too nearly closed to admit of a minute scrutiny of the accommodations within enough had been seen to cause the horseman to endeavor once more to penetrate the gloom with longing eyes in search of a more promising roof before with an illconcealed reluctance he stated his necessities and wishes his request was listened to with evident unwillingness and while yet unfinished it was eagerly interrupted by the reply  i cant say i like to give lodgings to a stranger in these ticklish times said the female in a pert sharp key im nothing but a forlorn lone body or whats the same thing theres nobody but the old gentleman at home but a half mile farther up the road is a house where you can get entertainment and that for nothing i am sure twill be much convenienter to them and more agreeable to mebecause as i said before harvey is away i wish hed take advice and leave off wandering hes well to do in the world by this time and he ought to leave off his uncertain courses and settle himself handsomely in life like other men of his years and property but harvey birch will have his own way and die vagabond after all  the horseman did not wait to hear more than the advice to pursue his course up the road but he had slowly turned his horse towards the bars and was gathering the folds of an ample cloak around his manly form preparatory to facing the storm again when something in the speech of the female suddenly arrested the movement  is this then the dwelling of harvey birch he inquired in an involuntary manner apparently checking himself as he was about to utter more  why one can hardly say it is his dwelling replied the other drawing a hurried breath like one eager to answer he is never in it or so seldom that i hardly remember his face when he does think it worth his while to show it to his poor old father and me but it matters little to me im sure if he ever comes back again or notturn in the first gate on your leftno i care but little for my part whether harvey ever shows his face again or notnot iand she closed the door abruptly on the horseman who gladly extended his ride a half mile farther to obtain lodgings which promised both more comfort and greater security  sufficient light yet remained to enable the traveler to distinguish the improvements footnote improvements is used by the americans to express every degree of change in converting land from its state of wilderness to that of cultivation in this meaning of the word it is an improvement to fell the trees and it is valued precisely by the supposed amount of the cost which had been made in the cultivation and in the general appearance of the grounds around the building to which he was now approaching the house was of stone long low and with a small wing at each extremity a piazza extending along the front with neatly turned pillars of wood together with the good order and preservation of the fences and outbuildings gave the place an air altogether superior to the common farmhouses of the country after leading his horse behind an angle of the wall where it was in some degree protected from the wind and rain the traveler threw his valise over his arm and knocked loudly at the entrance of the building for admission an aged black soon appeared and without seeming to think it necessary under the circumstances to consult his superiorsfirst taking one prying look at the applicant by the light of the candle in his handhe acceded to the request for accommodations the traveler was shown into an extremely neat parlor where a fire had been lighted to cheer the dullness of an easterly storm and an october evening after giving the valise into the keeping of his civil attendant and politely repeating his request to the old gentleman who arose to receive him and paying his compliments to the three ladies who were seated at work with their needles the stranger commenced laying aside some of the outer garments which he had worn in his ride  on taking an extra handkerchief from his neck and removing a cloak of blue cloth with a surtout of the same material he exhibited to the scrutiny of the observant family party a tall and extremely graceful person of apparently fifty years of age his countenance evinced a settled composure and dignity his nose was straight and approaching to grecian his eye of a gray color was quiet thoughtful and rather melancholy the mouth and lower part of his face being expressive of decision and much character his dress being suited to the road was simple and plain but such as was worn by the higher class of his countrymen he wore his own hair dressed in a manner that gave a military air to his appearance and which was rather heightened by his erect and conspicuously graceful carriage his whole appearance was so impressive and so decidedly that of a gentleman that as he finished laying aside the garments the ladies arose from their seats and together with the master of the house they received anew and returned the complimentary greetings which were again offered  the host was by several years the senior of the traveler and by his manner dress and everything around him showed he had seen much of life and the best society the ladies were a maiden of forty and two much younger who did not seem indeed to have reached half those years the bloom of the elder of these ladies had vanished but her eyes and fine hair gave an extremely agreeable expression to her countenance and there was a softness and an affability in her deportment that added a charm many more juvenile faces do not possess the sisters for such the resemblance between the younger females denoted them to be were in all the pride of youth and the roses so eminently the property of the westchester fair glowed on their cheeks and lighted their deep blue eyes with that luster which gives so much pleasure to the beholder and which indicates so much internal innocence and peace there was much of that feminine delicacy in the appearance of the three which distinguishes the sex in this country and like the gentleman their demeanor proved them to be women of the higher order of life  after handing a glass of excellent madeira to his guest mr wharton for so was the owner of this retired estate called resumed his seat by the fire with another in his own hand for a moment he paused as if debating with his politeness but at length threw an inquiring glance on the stranger as he inquired  to whose health am i to have the honor of drinking  the traveler had also seated himself and he sat unconsciously gazing on the fire while mr wharton spoke turning his eyes slowly on his host with a look of close observation he replied while a faint tinge gathered on his features  mr harper  mr harper resumed the other with the formal precision of that day i have the honor to drink your health and to hope you will sustain no injury from the rain to which you have been exposed  mr harper bowed in silence to the compliment and he soon resumed the meditations from which he had been interrupted and for which the long ride he had that day made in the wind might seem a very natural apology  the young ladies had again taken their seats beside the workstand while their aunt miss jeanette peyton withdrew to superintend the preparations necessary to appease the hunger of their unexpected visitor a short silence prevailed during which mr harper was apparently enjoying the change in his situation when mr wharton again broke it by inquiring whether smoke was disagreeable to his companion to which receiving an answer in the negative he immediately resumed the pipe which had been laid aside at the entrance of the traveler  there was an evident desire on the part of the host to enter into conversation but either from an apprehension of treading on dangerous ground or an unwillingness to intrude upon the rather studied taciturnity of his guest he several times hesitated before he could venture to make any further remark at length a movement from mr harper as he raised his eyes to the party in the room encouraged him to proceed  i find it very difficult said mr wharton cautiously avoiding at first such subjects as he wished to introduce to procure that quality of tobacco for my evenings amusement to which i have been accustomed  i should think the shops in new york might furnish the best in the country calmly rejoined the other  whyyes returned the host in rather a hesitating manner lifting his eyes to the face of harper and lowering them quickly under his steady look there must be plenty in town but the war has made communication with the city however innocent too dangerous to be risked for so trifling an article as tobacco  the box from which mr wharton had just taken a supply for his pipe was lying open within a few inches of the elbow of harper who took a small quantity from its contents and applied it to his tongue in a manner perfectly natural but one that filled his companion with alarm without however observing that the quality was of the most approved kind the traveler relieved his host by relapsing again into his meditations mr wharton now felt unwilling to lose the advantage he had gained and making an effort of more than usual vigor he continued  i wish from the bottom of my heart this unnatural struggle was over that we might again meet our friends and relatives in peace and love  it is much to be desired said harper emphatically again raising his eyes to the countenance of his host  i hear of no movement of consequence since the arrival of our new allies said mr wharton shaking the ashes from his pipe and turning his back to the other under the pretense of receiving a coal from his youngest daughter  none have yet reached the public i believe  is it thought any important steps are about to be taken continued mr wharton still occupied with his daughter yet suspending his employment in expectation of a reply  is it intimated any are in agitation  oh nothing in particular but it is natural to expect some new enterprise from so powerful a force as that under rochambeau  harper made an assenting inclination with his head but no other reply to this remark while mr wharton after lighting his pipe resumed the subject  they appear more active in the south gates and cornwallis seem willing to bring the war to an issue there  the brow of harper contracted and a deeper shade of melancholy crossed his features his eye kindled with a transient beam of fire that spoke a latent source of deep feeling the admiring gaze of the younger of the sisters had barely time to read its expression before it passed away leaving in its room the acquired composure which marked the countenance of the stranger and that impressive dignity which so conspicuously denotes the empire of reason  the elder sister made one or two movements in her chair before she ventured to say in a tone which partook in no small measure of triumph  general gates has been less fortunate with the earl than with general burgoyne  but general gates is an englishman sarah cried the younger lady with quickness then coloring to the eyes at her own boldness she employed herself in tumbling over the contents of her work basket silently hoping the remark would be unnoticed  the traveler had turned his face from one sister to the other as they had spoken in succession and an almost imperceptible movement of the muscles of his mouth betrayed a new emotion as he playfully inquired of the younger  may i venture to ask what inference you would draw from that fact  frances blushed yet deeper at this direct appeal to her opinions upon a subject on which she had incautiously spoken in the presence of a stranger but finding an answer necessary after some little hesitation and with a good deal of stammering in her manner she replied  onlyonlysirmy sister and myself sometimes differ in our opinions of the prowess of the british a smile of much meaning played on a face of infantile innocency as she concluded  on what particular points of their prowess do you differ continued harper meeting her look of animation with a smile of almost paternal softness  sarah thinks the british are never beaten while i do not put so much faith in their invincibility  the traveler listened to her with that pleased indulgence with which virtuous age loves to contemplate the ardor of youthful innocence but making no reply he turned to the fire and continued for some time gazing on its embers in silence  mr wharton had in vain endeavored to pierce the disguise of his guests political feelings but while there was nothing forbidding in his countenance there was nothing communicative on the contrary it was strikingly reserved and the master of the house arose in profound ignorance of what in those days was the most material point in the character of his guest to lead the way into another room and to the supper table mr harper offered his hand to sarah wharton and they entered the room together while frances followed greatly at a loss to know whether she had not wounded the feelings of her fathers inmate  the storm began to rage with great violence without and the dashing rain on the sides of the building awakened that silent sense of enjoyment which is excited by such sounds in a room of quiet comfort and warmth when a loud summons at the outer door again called the faithful black to the portal in a minute the servant returned and informed his master that another traveler overtaken by the storm desired to be admitted to the house for a shelter through the night  at the first sounds of the impatient summons of this new applicant mr wharton had risen from his seat in evident uneasiness and with eyes glancing with quickness from his guest to the door of the room he seemed to be expecting something to proceed from this second interruption connected with the stranger who had occasioned the first he scarcely had time to bid the black with a faint voice to show this second comer in before the door was thrown hastily open and the stranger himself entered the apartment he paused a moment as the person of harper met his view and then in a more formal manner repeated the request he had before made through the servant mr wharton and his family disliked the appearance of this new visitor excessively but the inclemency of the weather and the uncertainty of the consequences if he were refused the desired lodgings compelled the old gentleman to give a reluctant acquiescence  some of the dishes were replaced by the orders of miss peyton and the weatherbeaten intruder was invited to partake of the remains of the repast from which the party had just risen throwing aside a rough greatcoat he very composedly took the offered chair and unceremoniously proceeded to allay the cravings of an appetite which appeared by no means delicate but at every mouthful he would turn an unquiet eye on harper who studied his appearance with a closeness of investigation that was very embarrassing to its subject at length pouring out a glass of wine the newcomer nodded significantly to his examiner previously to swallowing the liquor and said with something of bitterness in his manner  i drink to our better acquaintance sir i believe this is the first time we have met though your attention would seem to say otherwise  the quality of the wine seemed greatly to his fancy for on replacing the glass upon the table he gave his lips a smack that resounded through the room and taking up the bottle he held it between himself and the light for a moment in silent contemplation of its clear and brilliant color  i think we have never met before sir replied harper with a slight smile on his features as he observed the move ments of the other but appearing satisfied with his scrutiny he turned to sarah wharton who sat next him and carelessly remarked  you doubtless find your present abode solitary after being accustomed to the gayeties of the city  oh excessively so said sarah hastily i do wish with my father that this cruel war was at an end that we might return to our friends once more  and you miss frances do you long as ardently for peace as your sister  on many accounts i certainly do returned the other venturing to steal a timid glance at her interrogator and meeting the same benevolent expression of feeling as before she continued as her own face lighted into one of its animated and bright smiles of intelligence but not at the expense of the rights of my countrymen  rights repeated her sister impatiently whose rights can be stronger than those of a sovereign and what duty is clearer than to obey those who have a natural right to command  none certainly said frances laughing with great pleasantry and taking the hand of her sister affectionately within both of her own she added with a smile directed towards harper  i gave you to understand that my sister and myself differed in our political opinions but we have an impartial umpire in my father who loves his own countrymen and he loves the britishso he takes sides with neither  yes said mr wharton in a little alarm eying first one guest and then the other i have near friends in both armies and i dread a victory by either as a source of certain private misfortune  i take it you have little reason to apprehend much from the yankees in that way interrupted the guest at the table coolly helping himself to another glass from the bottle he had admired  his majesty may have more experienced troops than the continentals answered the host fearfully but the americans have met with distinguished success  harper disregarded the observations of both and rising he desired to be shown to his place of rest a small boy was directed to guide him to his room and wishing a courteous goodnight to the whole party the traveler withdrew the knife and fork fell from the hands of the unwelcome intruder as the door closed on the retiring figure of harper he arose slowly from his seat listening attentively he approached the door of the roomopened itseemed to attend to the retreating footsteps of the otherand amidst the panic and astonishment of his companions he closed it again in an instant the red wig which concealed his black locks the large patch which hid half his face from observation the stoop that had made him appear fifty years of age disappeared  my fathermy dear fathercried the handsome young man and you my dearest sisters and aunthave i at last met you again  heaven bless you my henry my son exclaimed the astonished but delighted parent while his sisters sank on his shoulders dissolved in tears  the faithful old black who had been reared from infancy in the house of his master and who as if in mockery of his degraded state had been complimented with the name of caesar was the only other witness of this unexpected discovery of the son of mr wharton after receiving the extended hand of his young master and imprinting on it a fervent kiss caesar withdrew the boy did not reenter the room and the black himself after some time returned just as the young british captain was exclaiming  but who is this mr harperis he likely to betray me  no no no massa harry cried the negro shaking his gray head confidently i been to seemassa harper on he kneepray to godno gemman who pray to god tell of good son come to see old faderskinner do thatno christian  this poor opinion of the skinners was not confined to mr caesar thompson as he called himselfbut caesar wharton as he was styled by the little world to which he was known the convenience and perhaps the necessities of the leaders of the american arms in the neighborhood of new york had induced them to employ certain subordinate agents of extremely irregular habits in executing their lesser plans of annoying the enemy it was not a moment for fastidious inquiries into abuses of any description and oppression and injustice were the natural consequences of the possession of a military power that was uncurbed by the restraints of civil authority in time a distinct order of the community was formed whose sole occupation appears to have been that of relieving their fellow citizens from any little excess of temporal prosperity they might be thought to enjoy under the pretense of patriotism and the love of liberty  occasionally the aid of military authority was not wanting in enforcing these arbitrary distributions of worldly goods and a petty holder of a commission in the state militia was to be seen giving the sanction of something like legality to acts of the most unlicensed robbery and not infrequently of bloodshed  on the part of the british the stimulus of loyalty was by no means suffered to sleep where so fruitful a field offered on which it might be expended but their freebooters were enrolled and their efforts more systematized long experience had taught their leaders the efficacy of concentrated force and unless tradition does great injustice to their exploits the result did no little credit to their foresight the corpswe presume from their known affection to that useful animalhad received the quaint appellation of cowboys  caesar was however far too loyal to associate men who held the commission of george iii with the irregular warriors whose excesses he had so often witnessed and from whose rapacity neither his poverty nor his bondage had suffered even him to escape uninjured the cowboys therefore did not receive their proper portion of the blacks censure when he said no christian nothing but a skinner could betray a pious child while honoring his father with a visit so full of peril     chapter ii        and many a halcyon day he lived to see      unbroken but by one misfortune dire      when fate had reft his mutual heartbut she      was goneand gertrude climbed a widowed fathers knee                                      gertrude of wyoming  the father of mr wharton was a native of england and of a family whose parliamentary interest had enabled them to provide for a younger son in the colony of new york the young man like hundreds of others in this situation had settled permanently in the country he married and the sole issue of his connection had been sent early in life to receive the benefits of the english schools after taking his degrees at one of the universities of the mother country the youth had been suffered to acquire a knowledge of life with the advantages of european society but the death of his father recalled him after passing two years in this manner to the possession of an honorable name and a very ample estate  it was much the fashion of that day to place the youth of certain families in the army and navy of england as the regular steppingstones to preferment most of the higher offices in the colonies were filled by men who had made arms their profession and it was even no uncommon sight to see a veteran warrior laying aside the sword to assume the ermine on the benches of the highest judicial authority  in conformity with this system the senior mr wharton had intended his son for a soldier but a natural imbecility of character in his child interfered with his wishes  a twelvemonth had been spent by the young man in weighing the comparative advantages of the different classes of troops when the death of his father occurred the ease of his situation and the attentions lavished upon a youth in the actual enjoyment of one of the largest estates in the colonies interfered greatly with his ambitious projects love decided the matter and mr wharton in becoming a husband ceased to think of becoming a soldier for many years he continued happy in his family and sufficiently respected by his countrymen as a man of integrity and consequence when all his enjoyments vanished as it were at a blow his only son the youth introduced in the preceding chapter had entered the army and had arrived in his native country but a short time before the commencement of hostilities with the reinforcements the ministry had thought it prudent to throw into the disaffected parts of north america his daughters were just growing into life and their education required all the advantages the city could afford his wife had been for some years in declining health and had barely time to fold her son to her bosom and rejoice in the reunion of her family before the revolution burst forth in a continued blaze from georgia to massachusetts the shock was too much for the feeble condition of the mother who saw her child called to the field to combat against the members of her own family in the south and she sank under the blow  there was no part of the continent where the manners of england and its aristocratical notions of blood and alliances prevailed with more force than in a certain circle immediately around the metropolis of new york the customs of the early dutch inhabitants had indeed blended in some measures with the english manners but still the latter prevailed this attachment to great britain was increased by the frequent intermarriages of the officers of the mother country with the wealthier and most powerful families of the vicinity until at the commencement of hostilities their united influence had very nearly thrown the colony into the scale on the side of the crown a few however of the leading families espoused the cause of the people and a sufficient stand was made against the efforts of the ministerial party to organize and aided by the army of the confederation to maintain an independent republican form of government  the city of new york and the adjacent territory were alone exempted from the rule of the new commonwealth while the royal authority extended no further than its dignity could be supported by the presence of an army in this condition of things the loyalists of influence adopted such measures as best accorded with their different characters and situations many bore arms in support of the crown and by their bravery and exertions endeavored to secure what they deemed to be the rights of their prince and their own estates from the effects of the law of attainder others left the country seeking in that place they emphatically called home an asylum as they fondly hoped for a season only against the confusion and dangers of war a third and a more wary portion remained in the place of their nativity with a prudent regard to their ample possessions and perhaps influenced by their attachments to the scenes of their youth mr wharton was of this description after making a provision against future contingencies by secretly transmitting the whole of his money to the british funds this gentleman determined to continue in the theater of strife and to maintain so strict a neutrality as to insure the safety of his large estate whichever party succeeded he was apparently engrossed in the education of his daughters when a relation high in office in the new state intimated that a residence in what was now a british camp differed but little in the eyes of his countrymen from a residence in the british capital mr wharton soon saw this was an unpardonable offense in the existing state of things and he instantly determined to remove the difficulty by retiring to the country he possessed a residence in the county of westchester and having been for many years in the habit of withdrawing thither during the heats of the summer months it was kept furnished and ready for his accommodation his eldest daughter was already admitted into the society of women but frances the younger required a year or two more of the usual cultivation to appear with proper éclat at least so thought miss jeanette peyton and as this lady a younger sister of their deceased mother had left her paternal home in the colony of virginia with the devotedness and affection peculiar to her sex to superintend the welfare of her orphan nieces mr wharton felt that her opinions were entitled to respect in conformity to her advice therefore the feelings of the parent were made to yield to the welfare of his children  mr wharton withdrew to the locusts with a heart rent with the pain of separating from all that was left him of a wife he had adored but in obedience to a constitutional prudence that pleaded loudly in behalf of his worldly goods his handsome town residence was inhabited in the meanwhile by his daughters and their aunt the regiment to which captain wharton belonged formed part of the permanent garrison of the city and the knowledge of the presence of his son was no little relief to the father in his unceasing meditations on his absent daughters but captain wharton was a young man and a soldier his estimate of character was not always the wisest and his propensities led him to imagine that a red coat never concealed a dishonorable heart  the house of mr wharton became a fashionable lounge to the officers of the royal army as did that of every other family that was thought worthy of their notice the consequences of this association were to some few of the visited fortunate to more injurious by exciting expectations which were never to be realized and unhappily to no small number ruinous the known wealth of the father and possibly the presence of a highspirited brother forbade any apprehension of the latter danger to the young ladies but it was impossible that all the admiration bestowed on the fine figure and lovely face of sarah wharton should be thrown away her person was formed with the early maturity of the climate and a strict cultivation of the graces had made her decidedly the belle of the city no one promised to dispute with her this female sovereignty unless it might be her younger sister frances however wanted some months to the charmed age of sixteen and the idea of competition was far from the minds of either of the affectionate girls indeed next to the conversation of colonel wellmere the greatest pleasure of sarah was in contemplating the budding beauties of the little hebe who played around her with all the innocency of youth with all the enthusiasm of her ardent temper and with no little of the archness of her native humor whether or not it was owing to the fact that frances received none of the compliments which fell to the lot of her elder sister in the often repeated discussions on the merits of the war between the military beaux who frequented the house it is certain their effects on the sisters were exactly opposite it was much the fashion then for the british officers to speak slightingly of their enemies and sarah took all the idle vaporing of her danglers to be truths the first political opinions which reached the ears of frances were coupled with sneers on the conduct of her countrymen at first she believed them but there was occasionally a general who was obliged to do justice to his enemy in order to obtain justice for himself and frances became somewhat skeptical on the subject of the inefficiency of her countrymen colonel wellmere was among those who delighted most in expending his wit on the unfortunate americans and in time frances began to listen to his eloquence with great suspicion and sometimes with resentment  it was on a hot sultry day that the three were in the parlor of mr whartons house the colonel and sarah seated on a sofa engaged in a combat of the eyes aided by the usual flow of small talk and frances was occupied at her tambouring frame in an opposite corner of the room when the gentleman suddenly exclaimed  how gay the arrival of the army under general burgoyne will make the city miss wharton  oh how pleasant it must be said the thoughtless sarah in reply i am told there are many charming women with that army as you say it will make us all life and gayety  frances shook back the abundance of her golden hair and raised her eyes dancing with the ardor of national feeling then laughing with a concealed humor she asked  is it so certain that general burgoyne will be permitted to reach the city  permitted echoed the colonel who is there to prevent it my pretty miss fanny  frances was precisely at that age when young people are most jealous of their station in society neither quite a woman nor yet a child the pretty miss fanny was too familiar to be relished and she dropped her eyes on her work again with cheeks that glowed like crimson  general stark took the germans into custody she answered compressing her lip may not general gates think the british too dangerous to go at large  oh they were germans as you say cried the colonel excessively vexed at the necessity of explaining at all mere mercenary troops but when the really british regiments come in question you will see a very different result  of that there is no doubt cried sarah without in the least partaking of the resentment of the colonel to her sister but hailing already in her heart the triumph of the british  pray colonel wellmere said frances recovering her good humor and raising her joyous eyes once more to the face of the gentleman was the lord percy of lexington a kinsman of him who fought at chevy chase  why miss fanny you are becoming a rebel said the colonel endeavoring to laugh away the anger he felt what you are pleased to insinuate was a chase at lexington was nothing more than a judicious retreatakind of  running fight interrupted the goodhumored girl laying a great emphasis on the first word  positively young ladycolonel wellmere was interrupted by a laugh from a person who had hitherto been unnoticed  there was a small family apartment adjoining the room occupied by the trio and the air had blown open the door communicating between the two a fine young man was now seen sitting near the entrance who by his smiling countenance was evidently a pleased listener to the conversation he rose instantly and coming through the door with his hat in his hand appeared a tall graceful youth of dark complexion and sparkling eyes of black from which the mirth had not entirely vanished as he made his bow to the ladies  mr dunwoodie cried sarah in surprise i was ignorant of your being in the house you will find a cooler seat in this room  i thank you replied the young man but i must go and seek your brother who placed me there in ambuscade as he called it with a promise of returning an hour ago without making any further explanation the youth bowed politely to the young women distantly and with hauteur to the gentleman and withdrew frances followed him into the hall and blushing richly inquired in a hurried voice  but whywhy do you leave us mr dunwoodie henry must soon return  the gentleman caught one of her hands in his own and the stern expression of his countenance gave place to a look of admiration as he replied  you managed him famously my dear little kinswoman neverno never forget the land of your birth remember if you are the granddaughter of an englishman you are also the granddaughter of a peyton  oh returned the laughing girl it would be difficult to forget that with the constant lectures on genealogy before us with which we are favored by aunt jeanette but why do you go  i am on the wing for virginia and have much to do he pressed her hand as he spoke and looking back while in the act of closing the door exclaimed be true to your countrybe american the ardent girl kissed her hand to him as he retired and then instantly applying it with its beautiful fellow to her burning cheeks ran into her own apartment to hide her confusion  between the open sarcasm of frances and the illconcealed disdain of the young man colonel wellmere had felt himself placed in an awkward predicament but ashamed to resent such trifles in the presence of his mistress he satisfied himself with observing superciliously as dunwoodie left the room  quite a liberty for a youth in his situation a shop boy with a bundle i fancy  the idea of picturing the graceful peyton dunwoodie as a shop boy could never enter the mind of sarah and she looked around her in surprise when the colonel continued  this mr dundun  dunwoodie oh nohe is a relation of my aunt cried the young lady and an intimate friend of my brother they were at school together and only separated in england when one went into the army and the other to a french military academy  his money appears to have been thrown away observed the colonel betraying the spleen he was unsuccessfully striving to conceal  we ought to hope so added sarah with a smile for it is said he intends joining the rebel army he was brought in here in a french ship and has just been exchanged you may soon meet him in arms  well let himi wish washington plenty of such heroes and he turned to a more pleasant subject by changing the discourse to themselves  a few weeks after this scene occurred the army of burgoyne laid down their arms mr wharton beginning to think the result of the contest doubtful resolved to conciliate his countrymen and gratify himself by calling his daughters into his own abode miss peyton consented to be their companion and from that time until the period at which we commenced our narrative they had formed one family  whenever the main army made any movements captain wharton had of course accompanied it and once or twice under the protection of strong parties acting in the neighborhood of the locusts he had enjoyed rapid and stolen interviews with his friends a twelvemonth had however passed without his seeing them and the impatient henry had adopted the disguise we have mentioned and unfortunately arrived on the very evening that an unknown and rather suspicious guest was an inmate of the house which seldom contained any other than its regular inhabitants  but do you think he suspects me asked the captain with anxiety after pausing to listen to caesars opinion of the skinners  how should he cried sarah when your sisters and father could not penetrate your disguise  there is something mysterious in his manner his looks are too prying for an indifferent observer continued young wharton thoughtfully and his face seems familiar to me the recent fate of andré has created much irritation on both sides sir henry threatens retaliation for his death and washington is as firm as if half the world were at his command the rebels would think me a fit subject for their plans just now should i be so unlucky as to fall into their hands  but my son cried his father in great alarm you are not a spy you are not within the rebelthat is the american lines there is nothing here to spy  that might be disputed rejoined the young man musing their pickets were as low as the white plains when i passed through in disguise it is true my purposes are innocent but how is it to appear my visit to you would seem a cloak to other designs remember sir the treatment you received not a year since for sending me a supply of fruit for the winter  that proceeded from the misrepresentations of my kind neighbors said mr wharton who hoped by getting my estate confiscated to purchase good farms at low prices peyton dunwoodie however soon obtained our discharge we were detained but a month  we repeated the son in amazement did they take my sisters also fanny you wrote me nothing of this  i believe said frances coloring highly i mentioned the kind treatment we received from your old friend major dunwoodie and that he procured my fathers release  true but were you with him in the rebel camp  yes said the father kindly fanny would not suffer me to go alone jeanette and sarah took charge of the locusts and this little girl was my companion in captivity  and fanny returned from such a scene a greater rebel than ever cried sarah indignantly one would think the hardships her father suffered would have cured her of such whims  what say you to the charge my pretty sister cried the captain gayly did peyton strive to make you hate your king more than he does himself  peyton dunwoodie hates no one said frances quickly then blushing at her own ardor she added immediately he loves you henry i know for he has told me so again and again  young wharton tapped his sister on the cheek with a smile as he asked her in an affected whisper did he tell you also that he loved my little sister fanny  nonsense said frances and the remnants of the suppertable soon disappeared under her superintendence     chapter iii        twas when the fields were swept of autumns store      and growing winds the fading foliage tore      behind the lowmon hill the shortlived light      descending slowly ushered in the night      when from the noisy town with mournful look      his lonely way the meager peddler took                                                wilson  a storm below the highlands of the hudson if it be introduced with an easterly wind seldom lasts less than two days accordingly as the inmates of the locusts assembled on the following morning around their early breakfast the driving rain was seen to strike in nearly horizontal lines against the windows of the building and forbade the idea of exposing either man or beast to the tempest harper was the last to appear after taking a view of the state of the weather he apologized to mr wharton for the necessity that existed for his trespassing on his goodness for a longer time to appearances the reply was as courteous as the excuse yet harper wore a resignation in his deportment that was widely different from the uneasy manner of the father henry wharton had resumed his disguise with a reluctance amounting to disgust but in obedience to the commands of his parent no communications passed between him and the stranger after the first salutations of the morning had been paid by harper to him in common with the rest of the family frances had indeed thought there was something like a smile passing over the features of the traveler when on entering the room he first confronted her brother but it was confined to the eyes seeming to want power to affect the muscles of the face and was soon lost in the settled and benevolent expression which reigned in his countenance with a sway but seldom interrupted the eyes of the affectionate sister were turned in anxiety for a moment on her brother and glancing again on their unknown guest met his look as he offered her with marked attention one of the little civilities of the table and the heart of the girl which had begun to throb with violence regained a pulsation as tempered as youth health and buoyant spirits could allow while yet seated at the table caesar entered and laying a small parcel in silence by the side of his master modestly retired behind his chair where placing one hand on its back he continued in an attitude half familiar half respectful a listener  what is this caesar inquired mr wharton turning the bundle over to examine its envelope and eying it rather suspiciously  the baccy sir harvey birch he got home and he bring you a little good baccy from york  harvey birch rejoined the master with great deliberation stealing a look at his guest i do not remember desiring him to purchase any tobacco for me but as he has brought it he must be paid for his trouble  for an instant only as the negro spoke did harper suspend his silent meal his eye moved slowly from the servant to the master and again all remained in impenetrable reserve  to sarah wharton this intelligence gave unexpected pleasure rising from her seat with impatience she bade the black show birch into the apartment when suddenly recollecting herself she turned to the traveler with an apologizing look and added if mr harper will excuse the presence of a peddler  the indulgent benevolence expressed in the countenance of the stranger as he bowed a silent acquiescence spoke more eloquently than the nicest framed period and the young lady repeated her order with a confidence in its truth that removed all embarrassment  in the deep recesses of the windows of the cottage were seats of paneled work and the rich damask curtains that had ornamented the parlor in queen street footnote the americans changed the names of many towns and streets at the revolution as has since been done in france thus in the city of new york crown street has become liberty street king street pine street and queen street then one of the most fashionable quarters of the town pearl street pearl street is now chiefly occupied by the auction dealers and the wholesale drygoods merchants for warehouses and countingrooms had been transferred to the locusts and gave to the room that indescribable air of comfort which so gratefully announces the approach of a domestic winter into one of these recesses captain wharton now threw himself drawing the curtain before him in such a manner as to conceal most of his person from observation while his younger sister losing her natural frankness of manner in an air of artificial constraint silently took possession of the other  harvey birch had been a peddler from his youth at least so he frequently asserted and his skill in the occupation went far to prove the truth of the declaration he was a native of one of the eastern colonies and from something of superior intelligence which belonged to his father it was thought they had known better fortune in the land of their nativity harvey possessed however the common manners of the country and was in no way distinguished from men of his class but by his acuteness and the mystery which enveloped his movements ten years before they had arrived together in the vale and purchasing the humble dwelling at which harper had made his unsuccessful application continued ever since peaceful inhabitants but little noticed and but little known until age and infirmities had prevented the father devoted himself to the cultivation of the small spot of ground belonging to his purchase while the son pursued with avidity his humble barter their orderly quietude had soon given them so much consideration in the neighborhood as to induce a maiden of fiveandthirty to forget the punctilio of her sex and to accept the office of presiding over their domestic comforts the roses had long before vanished from the cheeks of katy haynes and she had seen in succession both her male and female acquaintances forming the union so desirable to her sex with but little or no hope left for herself when with views of her own she entered the family of the birches necessity is a hard master and for the want of a better companion the father and son were induced to accept her services but still katy was not wanting in some qualities which made her a very tolerable housekeeper on the one hand she was neat industrious honest and a good manager on the other she was talkative selfish superstitious and inquisitive by dint of using the latter quality with consummate industry she had not lived in the family five years when she triumphantly declared that she had heard or rather overheard sufficient to enable her to say what had been the former fate of her associates could katy have possessed enough of divination to pronounce upon their future lot her task would have been accomplished from the private conversations of the parent and child she learned that a fire had reduced them from competence to poverty and at the same time diminished the number of their family to two there was a tremulousness in the voice of the father as he touched lightly on the event which affected even the heart of katy but no barrier is sufficient to repel vulgar curiosity she persevered until a very direct intimation from harvey by threatening to supply her place with a female a few years younger than herself gave her awful warning that there were bounds beyond which she was not to pass from that period the curiosity of the housekeeper had been held in such salutary restraint that although no opportunity of listening was ever neglected she had been able to add but little to her stock of knowledge there was however one piece of intelligence and that of no little interest to herself which she had succeeded in obtaining and from the moment of its acquisition she directed her energies to the accomplishment of one object aided by the double stimulus of love and avarice  harvey was in the frequent habit of paying mysterious visits in the depth of the night to the fireplace of the apartment that served for both kitchen and parlor here he was observed by katy and availing herself of his absence and the occupations of the father by removing one of the hearthstones she discovered an iron pot glittering with a metal that seldom fails to soften the hardest heart katy succeeded in replacing the stone without discovery and never dared to trust herself with another visit from that moment however the heart of the virgin lost its obduracy and nothing interposed between harvey and his happiness but his own want of observation  the war did not interfere with the traffic of the peddler who seized on the golden opportunity which the interruption of the regular trade afforded and appeared absorbed in the one grand object of amassing money for a year or two his employment was uninterrupted and his success proportionate but at length dark and threatening hints began to throw suspicion around his movements and the civil authority thought it incumbent on them to examine narrowly into his mode of life his imprisonments though frequent were not long and his escapes from the guardians of the law easy compared to what he endured from the persecution of the military still birch survived and still he continued his trade though compelled to be very guarded in his movements especially whenever he approached the northern boundaries of the county or in other words the neighborhood of the american lines his visits to the locusts had become less frequent and his appearance at his own abode so seldom as to draw forth from the disappointed katy in the fullness of her heart the complaint we have related in her reply to harper nothing however seemed to interfere with the pursuits of this indefatigable trader who with a view to dispose of certain articles for which he could only find purchasers in the very wealthiest families of the county had now braved the fury of the tempest and ventured to cross the half mile between his own residence and the house of mr wharton  in a few minutes after receiving the commands of his young mistress caesar reappeared ushering into the apartment the subject of the foregoing digression in person the peddler was a man above the middle height spare but full of bone and muscle at first sight his strength seemed unequal to manage the unwieldy burden of his pack yet he threw it on and off with great dexterity and with as much apparent ease as if it had been filled with feathers his eyes were gray sunken restless and for the flitting moments that they dwelt on the countenance of those with whom he conversed they seemed to read the very soul they possessed however two distinct expressions which in a great measure characterized the whole man when engaged in traffic the intelligence of his face appeared lively active and flexible though uncommonly acute if the conversation turned on the ordinary transactions of life his air became abstracted and restless but if by chance the revolution and the country were the topic his whole system seemed alteredall his faculties were concentrated he would listen for a great length of time without speaking and then would break silence by some light and jocular remark that was too much at variance with his former manner not to be affectation but of the war and of his father he seldom spoke and always from some very obvious necessity  to a superficial observer avarice would seem his ruling passionand all things considered he was as unfit a subject for the plans of katy haynes as can be readily imagined on entering the room the peddler relieved himself from his burden which as it stood on the floor reached nearly to his shoulders and saluted the family with modest civility to harper he made a silent bow without lifting his eyes from the carpet but the curtain prevented any notice of the presence of captain wharton sarah gave but little time for the usual salutations before she commenced her survey of the contents of the pack and for several minutes the two were engaged in bringing to light the various articles it contained the tables chairs and floor were soon covered with silks crapes gloves muslins and all the stock of an itinerant trader caesar was employed to hold open the mouth of the pack as its hoards were discharged and occasionally he aided his young lady by directing her admiration to some article of finery which from its deeper contrast in colors he thought more worthy of her notice at length sarah having selected several articles and satisfactorily arranged the prices observed in a cheerful voice  but harvey you have told us no news has lord cornwallis beaten the rebels again  the question could not have been heard for the peddler burying his body in the pack brought forth a quantity of lace of exquisite fineness and holding it up to view he required the admiration of the young lady miss peyton dropped the cup she was engaged in washing from her hand and frances exhibited the whole of that lovely face which had hitherto only suffered one of its joyous eyes to be seen beaming with a color that shamed the damask which enviously concealed her figure  the aunt quitted her employment and birch soon disposed of a large portion of his valuable article the praises of the ladies had drawn the whole person of the younger sister into view and frances was slowly rising from the window as sarah repeated her question with an exultation in her voice that proceeded more from pleasure in her purchase than her political feelings the younger sister resumed her seat apparently examining the state of the clouds while the peddler finding a reply was expected answered  there is some talk below about tarleton having defeated general sumter on the tiger river  captain wharton now involuntarily thrust his head between the opening of the curtains into the room and frances turning her ear in breathless silence noticed the quiet eyes of harper looking at the peddler over the book he was affecting to read with an expression that denoted him to be a listener of no ordinary interest  indeed cried the exulting sarah sumtersumterwho is he ill not buy even a pin until you tell me all the news she continued laughing and throwing down a muslin she had been examining  for a moment the peddler hesitated his eye glanced towards harper who was yet gazing at him with settled meaning and the whole manner of birch was altered approaching the fire he took from his mouth a large allowance of the virginian weed and depositing it with the superabundance of its juices without mercy to miss peytons shining andirons he returned to his goods  he lives somewhere among the niggers to the south answered the peddler abruptly  no more nigger than be yourself mister birch interrupted caesar tartly dropping at the same time the covering of the goods in high displeasure  hush caesarhush never mind it now said sarah wharton soothingly impatient to hear further  a black man so good as white miss sally continued the offended negro so long as he behave heself  and frequently he is much better rejoined his mistress but harvey who is this mr sumter  a slight indication of humor showed itself on the face of the peddler but it disappeared and he continued as if the discourse had met with no interruption from the sensitiveness of the domestic  as i was saying he lives among the colored people in the southcaesar resumed his occupationand he has lately had a scrimmage with this colonel tarleton  who defeated him of course cried sarah with confidence  so say the troops at morrisania  but what do you say mr wharton ventured to inquire yet speaking in a low tone  i repeat but what i hear said birch offering a piece of cloth to the inspection of sarah who rejected it in silence evidently determined to hear more before she made another purchase  they say however at the plains the peddler continued first throwing his eyes again around the room and letting them rest for an instant on harper that sumter and one or two more were all that were hurt and that the riglars were all cut to pieces for the militia were fixed snugly in a log barn  not very probable said sarah contemptuously though i make no doubt the rebels got behind the logs  i think said the peddler coolly again offering the silk its quite ingenious to get a log between one and a gun instead of getting between a gun and a log  the eyes of harper dropped quietly on the pages of the volume in his hand while frances rising came forward with a smile in her face as she inquired in a tone of affability that the peddler had never witnessed from her  have you more of the lace mr birch  the desired article was immediately produced and frances became a purchaser also by her order a glass of liquor was offered to the trader who took it with thanks and having paid his compliments to the master of the house and the ladies drank the beverage  so it is thought that colonel tarleton has worsted general sumter said mr wharton affecting to be employed in mending the cup that was broken by the eagerness of his sisterinlaw  i believe they think so at morrisania said birch dryly  have you any other news friend asked captain wharton venturing to thrust his face without the curtains  have you heard that major andre has been hanged  captain wharton started and for a moment glances of great significance were exchanged between him and the trader when he observed with affected indifference that must have been some weeks ago  does his execution make much noise asked the father striving to make the broken china unite  people will talk you know squire  is there any probability of movements below my friend that will make traveling dangerous asked harper looking steadily at the other in expectation of his reply  some bunches of ribbons fell from the hands of birch his countenance changed instantly losing its keen expression in intent meaning as he answered slowly it is some time since the riglar cavalry were out and i saw some of de lanceys men cleaning their arms as i passed their quarters it would be no wonder if they took the scent soon for the virginia horse are low in the county  are they in much force asked mr wharton suspending all employment in anxiety  i did not count them  frances was the only observer of the change in the manner of birch and on turning to harper he had resumed his book in silence she took some of the ribbons in her handlaid them down againand bending over the goods so that her hair falling in rich curls shaded her face she observed blushing with a color that suffused her neck  i thought the southern horse had marched towards the delaware  it may be so said birch i passed the troops at a distance  caesar had now selected a piece of calico in which the gaudy colors of yellow and red were contrasted on a white ground and after admiring it for several minutes he laid it down with a sigh as he exclaimed berry pretty calico  that said sarah yes that would make a proper gown for your wife caesar  yes miss sally cried the delighted black it make old dinah heart leap for joyso berry genteel  yes added the peddler quaintly that is only wanting to make dinah look like a rainbow  caesar eyed his young mistress eagerly until she inquired of harvey the price of the article  why much as i light of chaps said the peddler  how much demanded sarah in surprise  according to my luck in finding purchasers for my friend dinah you may have it at four shillings  it is too much said sarah turning to some goods for herself  monstrous price for coarse calico mister birch grumbled caesar dropping the opening of the pack again  we will say three then added the peddler if you like that better  be sure he like em better said caesar smiling goodhumoredly and reopening the pack miss sally like a tree shilling when she give and a four shilling when she take  the bargain was immediately concluded but in measuring the cloth wanted a little of the wellknown ten yards required by the dimensions of dinah by dint of a strong arm however it grew to the desired length under the experienced eye of the peddler who conscientiously added a ribbon of corresponding brilliancy with the calico and caesar hastily withdrew to communicate the joyful intelligence to his aged partner  during the movements created by the conclusion of the purchase captain wharton had ventured to draw aside the curtain so as to admit a view of his person and he now inquired of the peddler who had begun to collect the scattered goods at what time he had left the city  at early twilight was the answer  so lately cried the other in surprise then correcting his manner by assuming a more guarded air he continued could you pass the pickets at so late an hour  i did was the laconic reply  you must be well known by this time harvey to the officers of the british army cried sarah smiling knowingly on the peddler  i know some of them by sight said birch glancing his eyes round the apartment taking in their course captain wharton and resting for an instant on the countenance of harper  mr wharton had listened intently to each speaker in succession and had so far lost the affectation of indifference as to be crushing in his hand the pieces of china on which he had expended so much labor in endeavoring to mend it when observing the peddler tying the last knot in his pack he asked abruptly  are we about to be disturbed again with the enemy  who do you call the enemy said the peddler raising himself erect and giving the other a look before which the eyes of mr wharton sank in instant confusion  all are enemies who disturb our peace said miss peyton observing that her brother was unable to speak but are the royal troops out from below  tis quite likely they soon may be returned birch raising his pack from the floor and preparing to leave the room  and the continentals continued miss peyton mildly are the continentals in the county  harvey was about to utter something in reply when the door opened and caesar made his appearance attended by his delighted spouse  the race of blacks of which caesar was a favorable specimen is becoming very rare the old family servant who born and reared in the dwelling of his master identified himself with the welfare of those whom it was his lot to serve is giving place in every direction to that vagrant class which has sprung up within the last thirty years and whose members roam through the country unfettered by principles and uninfluenced by attachments for it is one of the curses of slavery that its victims become incompetent to the attributes of a freeman the short curly hair of caesar had acquired from age a coloring of gray that added greatly to the venerable cast of his appearance long and indefatigable applications of the comb had straightened the close curls of his forehead until they stood erect in a stiff and formal brush that gave at least two inches to his stature the shining black of his youth had lost its glistening hue and it had been succeeded by a dingy brown his eyes which stood at a most formidable distance from each other were small and characterized by an expression of good feeling occasionally interrupted by the petulance of an indulged servant they however now danced with inward delight his nose possessed in an eminent manner all the requisites for smelling but with the most modest unobtrusiveness the nostrils being abundantly capacious without thrusting themselves in the way of their neighbors his mouth was capacious to a fault and was only tolerated on account of the double row of pearls it contained in person caesar was short and we should say square had not all the angles and curves of his figure bid defiance to anything like mathematical symmetry his arms were long and muscular and terminated by two bony hands that exhibited on one side a coloring of blackish gray and on the other a faded pink but it was in his legs that nature had indulged her most capricious humor there was an abundance of material injudiciously used the calves were neither before nor behind but rather on the outer side of the limb inclining forward and so close to the knee as to render the free use of that joint a subject of doubt in the foot considering it as a base on which the body was to rest caesar had no cause of complaint unless indeed it might be that the leg was placed so near the center as to make it sometimes a matter of dispute whether he was not walking backwards but whatever might be the faults a statuary could discover in his person the heart of caesar thompson was in the right place and we doubt not of very just dimensions  accompanied by his ancient companion caesar now advanced and paid his tribute of gratitude in words sarah received them with great complacency and made a few compliments to the taste of the husband and the probable appearance of the wife frances with a face beaming with a look of pleasure that corresponded to the smiling countenances of the blacks offered the service of her needle in fitting the admired calico to its future uses the offer was humbly and gratefully accepted  as caesar followed his wife and the peddler from the apartment and was in the act of closing the door he indulged himself in a grateful soliloquy by saying aloud  good little ladymiss fannytake care of he faderlove to make a gown for old dinah too what else his feelings might have induced him to utter is unknown but the sound of his voice was heard some time after the distance rendered his words indistinct  harper had dropped his book and he sat an admiring witness of the scene and frances enjoyed a double satisfaction as she received an approving smile from a face which concealed under the traces of deep thought and engrossing care the benevolent expression which characterizes all the best feelings of the human heart     chapter iv       it is the form the eye the word     the bearing of that stranger lord     his stature manly bold and tall     built like a castles battled wall     yet molded in such just degrees     his giant strength seems lightsome ease     weather and war their rougher trace     have left on that majestic face     but tis his dignity of eye     there if a suppliant would i fly     secure mid danger wrongs and grief     of sympathy redress relief     that glance if guilty would i dread     more than the doom that spoke me dead     enough enough the princess cried     tis scotlands hope her joy her pride                                           walter scott  the party sat in silence for many minutes after the peddler had withdrawn mr wharton had heard enough to increase his uneasiness without in the least removing his apprehensions on behalf of his son the captain was impatiently wishing harper in any other place than the one foe occupied with such apparent composure while miss peyton completed the disposal of her breakfast equipage with the mild complacency of her nature aided a little by an inward satisfaction at possessing so large a portion of the traders lace sarah was busily occupied in arranging her purchases and frances was kindly assisting in the occupation disregarding her own neglected bargains when the stranger suddenly broke the silence by saying  if any apprehensions of me induce captain wharton to maintain his disguise i wish him to be undeceived had i motives for betraying him they could not operate under present circumstances  the younger sister sank into her seat colorless and astonished miss peyton dropped the tea tray she was lifting from the table and sarah sat with her purchases unheeded in her lap in speechless surprise mr wharton was stupefied but the captain hesitating a moment from astonishment sprang into the middle of the room and exclaimed as he tore off the instruments of his disguise  i believe you from my soul and this tiresome imposition shall continue no longer yet i am at a loss to conceive in what manner you should know me  you really look so much better in your proper person captain wharton said harper with a slight smile i would advise you never to conceal it in future there is enough to betray you if other sources of detection were wanting as he spoke he pointed to a picture suspended over the mantel piece which exhibited the british officer in his regimentals  i had flattered myself cried young wharton with a laugh that i looked better on the canvas than in a masquerade you must be a close observer sir  necessity has made me one said harper rising from his seat  frances met him as he was about to withdraw and taking his hand between both her own said with earnestness her cheeks mantling with their richest vermilion you cannotyou will not betray my brother  for an instant harper paused in silent admiration of the lovely pleader and then folding her hands on his breast he replied solemnly i cannot and i will not he released her hands and laying his own on her head gently continued if the blessing of a stranger can profit you receive it he turned and bowing low retired with a delicacy that was duly appreciated by those he quitted to his own apartment  the whole party were deeply impressed with the ingenuous and solemn manner of the traveler and all but the father found immediate relief in his declaration some of the castoff clothes of the captain which had been removed with the goods from the city were produced and young wharton released from the uneasiness of his disguise began at last to enjoy a visit which had been undertaken at so much personal risk to himself mr wharton retiring to his apartment in pursuance of his regular engagements the ladies with the young man were left to an uninterrupted communication on such subjects as were most agreeable even miss peyton was affected with the spirits of her young relatives and they sat for an hour enjoying in heedless confidence the pleasures of an unrestrained conversation without reflecting on any danger which might be impending over them the city and their acquaintances were not long neglected for miss peyton who had never forgotten the many agreeable hours of her residence within its boundaries soon inquired among others after their old acquaintance colonel wellmere  oh cried the captain gayly he yet continues there as handsome and as gallant as ever  although a woman be not actually in love she seldom hears without a blush the name of a man whom she might love and who has been connected with herself by idle gossips in the amatory rumor of the day such had been the case with sarah and she dropped her eyes on the carpet with a smile that aided by the blush which suffused her cheek in no degree detracted from her native charms  captain wharton without heeding this display of interest in his sister immediately continued at times he is melancholywe tell him it must be love sarah raised her eyes to the face of her brother and was consciously turning them on the rest of the party when she met those of her sister laughing with good humor and high spirits as she cried poor man does he despair  why noone would think he could not the eldest son of a man of wealth so handsome and a colonel  strong reasons indeed why he should prevail said sarah endeavoring to laugh more particularly the latter  let me tell you replied the captain gravely a lieutenant colonelcy in the guards is a very pretty thing  and colonel wellmere a very pretty man added frances  nay frances returned her sister colonel wellmere was never a favorite of yours he is too loyal to his king to be agreeable to your taste  frances quickly answered and is not henry loyal to his king  come come said miss peyton no difference of opinion about the colonelhe is a favorite of mine  fanny likes majors better cried the brother pulling her upon his knee  nonsense said the blushing girl as she endeavored to extricate herself from the grasp of her laughing brother  it surprises me continued the captain that peyton when he procured the release of my father did not endeavor to detain my sister in the rebel camp  that might have endangered his own liberty said the smiling girl resuming her seat you know it is liberty for which major dunwoodie is fighting  liberty exclaimed sarah very pretty liberty which exchanges one master for fifty  the privilege of changing masters at all is a liberty  and one you ladies would sometimes be glad to exercise cried the captain  we like i believe to have the liberty of choosing who they shall be in the first place said the laughing girl dont we aunt jeanette  me cried miss peyton starting what do i know of such things child you must ask someone else if you wish to learn such matters  ah you would have us think you were never young but what am i to believe of all the tales i have heard about the handsome miss jeanette peyton  nonsense my dear nonsense said the aunt endeavoring to suppress a smile it is very silly to believe all you hear  nonsense do you call it cried the captain gayly to this hour general montrose toasts miss peyton i heard him within the week at sir henrys table  why henry you are as saucy as your sister and to break in upon your folly i must take you to see my new homemade manufactures which i will be bold enough to put in contrast with the finery of birch  the young people rose to follow their aunt in perfect good humor with each other and the world on ascending the stairs to the place of deposit for miss peytons articles of domestic economy she availed herself however of an opportunity to inquire of her nephew whether general montrose suffered as much from the gout as he had done when she knew him  it is a painful discovery we make as we advance in life that even those we most love are not exempt from its frailties when the heart is fresh and the view of the future unsullied by the blemishes which have been gathered from the experience of the past our feelings are most holy we love to identify with the persons of our natural friends all those qualities to which we ourselves aspire and all those virtues we have been taught to revere the confidence with which we esteem seems a part of our nature and there is a purity thrown around the affections which tie us to our kindred that after life can seldom hope to see uninjured the family of mr wharton continued to enjoy for the remainder of the day a happiness to which they had long been strangers and one that sprang in its younger members from the delights of the most confident affection and the exchange of the most disinterested endearments  harper appeared only at the dinner table and he retired with the cloth under the pretense of some engagement in his own room notwithstanding the confidence created by his manner the family felt his absence a relief for the visit of captain wharton was necessarily to be confined to a very few days both from the limitation of his leave of absence and the danger of a discovery  all dread of consequences however was lost in the pleasure of the meeting once or twice during the day mr wharton had suggested a doubt as to the character of his unknown guest and the possibility of the detection of his son proceeding in some manner from his information but the idea was earnestly opposed by all his children even sarah uniting with her brother and sister in pleading warmly in favor of the sincerity expressed in the outward appearance of the traveler  such appearances my children replied the desponding parent are but too often deceitful when men like major andre lend themselves to the purposes of fraud it is idle to reason from qualities much less externals  fraud cried his son quickly surely sir you forget that major andre was serving his king and that the usages of war justified the measure  and did not the usages of war justify his death henry inquired frances speaking in a low voice unwilling to abandon what she thought the cause of her country and yet unable to suppress her feelings for the man  never exclaimed the young man springing from his seat and pacing the floor rapidly frances you shock me suppose it should be my fate even now to fall into the power of the rebels you would vindicate my executionperhaps exult in the cruelty of washington  henry said frances solemnly quivering with emotion and with a face pale as death you little know my heart  pardon me my sistermy little fanny cried the repentant youth pressing her to his bosom and kissing off the tears which had burst spite of her resolution from her eyes  it is very foolish to regard your hasty words i know said frances extricating herself from his arms and raising her yet humid eyes to his face with a smile but reproach from those we love is most severe henry particularlywhere wewe thinkwe knowher paleness gradually gave place to the color of the rose as she concluded in a low voice with her eyes directed to the carpet we are undeserving of it  miss peyton moved from her own seat to the one next her niece and kindly taking her hand observed you should not suffer the impetuosity of your brother to affect you so much boys you know are proverbially ungovernable  and from my conduct you might add cruel said the captain seating himself on the other side of his sister but on the subject of the death of andre we are all of us uncommonly sensitive you did not know him he was all that was bravethat was accomplishedthat was estimable frances smiled faintly and shook her head but made no reply her brother observing the marks of incredulity in her countenance continued you doubt it and justify his death  i do not doubt his worth replied the maid mildly nor his being deserving of a more happy fate but i cannot doubt the propriety of washingtons conduct i know but little of the customs of war and wish to know less but with what hopes of success could the americans contend if they yielded all the principles which long usage had established to the exclusive purposes of the british  why contend at all cried sarah impatiently besides being rebels all their acts are illegal  women are but mirrors which reflect the images before them cried the captain goodnaturedly in frances i see the picture of major dunwoodie and in sarah  colonel wellmere interrupted the younger sister laughing and blushing crimson i must confess i am indebted to the major for my reasoningam i not aunt jeanette  i believe it is something like his logic indeed child  i plead guilty and you sarah have not forgotten the learned discussions of colonel wellmere  i trust i never forget the right said sarah emulating her sister in color and rising under the pretense of avoiding the heat of the fire  nothing occurred of any moment during the rest of the day but in the evening caesar reported that he had overheard voices in the room of harper conversing in a low tone the apartment occupied by the traveler was the wing at the extremity of the building opposite to the parlor in which the family ordinarily assembled and it seems that caesar had established a regular system of espionage with a view to the safety of his young master this intelligence gave some uneasiness to all the members of the family but the entrance of harper himself with the air of benevolence and sincerity which shone through his reserve soon removed the doubts from the breast of all but mr wharton his children and sister believed caesar to have been mistaken and the evening passed off without any additional alarm  on the afternoon of the succeeding day the party were assembled in the parlor around the tea table of miss peyton when a change in the weather occurred the thin scud that apparently floated but a short distance above the tops of the hills began to drive from the west towards the east in astonishing rapidity the rain yet continued to beat against the eastern windows of the house with fury in that direction the heavens were dark and gloomy frances was gazing at the scene with the desire of youth to escape from the tedium of confinement when as if by magic all was still the rushing winds had ceased the pelting of the storm was over and springing to the window with delight pictured in her face she saw a glorious ray of sunshine lighting the opposite wood the foliage glittered with the checkered beauties of the october leaf reflecting back from the moistened boughs the richest luster of an american autumn in an instant the piazza which opened to the south was thronged with the inmates of the cottage the air was mild balmy and refreshing in the east clouds which might be likened to the retreating masses of a discomfited army hung around the horizon in awful and increasing darkness at a little elevation above the cottage the thin vapor was still rushing towards the east with amazing velocity while in the west the sun had broken forth and shed his parting radiance on the scene below aided by the fullest richness of a clear atmosphere and a freshened herbage such moments belong only to the climate of america and are enjoyed in a degree proportioned to the suddenness of the contrast and the pleasure we experience in escaping from the turbulence of the elements to the quiet of a peaceful evening and an air still as the softest mornings in june  what a magnificent scene said harper in a low tone how grand how awfully sublimemay such a quiet speedily await the struggle in which my country is engaged and such a glorious evening follow the day of her adversity  frances who stood next to him alone heard the voice turning in amazement from the view to the speaker she saw him standing bareheaded erect and with his eyes lifted to heaven there was no longer the quiet which had seemed their characteristic but they were lighted into something like enthusiasm and a slight flush passed over his features  there can be no danger apprehended from such a man thought frances such feelings belong only to the virtuous  the musings of the party were now interrupted by the sudden appearance of the peddler he had taken advantage of the first gleam of sunshine to hasten to the cottage heedless of wet or dry as it lay in his path with arms swinging to and fro and with his head bent forward of his body several inches harvey birch approached the piazza with a gait peculiarly his own it was the quick lengthened pace of an itinerant vender of goods  fine evening said the peddler saluting the party without raising his eyes quite warm and agreeable for the season  mr wharton assented to the remark and inquired kindly after the health of his father harvey heard him and continued standing for some time in moody silence but the question being repeated he answered with a slight tremor in his voice  he fails fast old age and hardships will do their work the peddler turned his face from the view of most of the family but frances noticed his glistening eyes and quivering lip and for the second time harvey rose in her estimation  the valley in which the residence of mr wharton stood ran in a direction from northwest to southeast and the house was placed on the side of a hill which terminated its length in the former direction a small opening occasioned by the receding of the opposite hill and the fall of the land to the level of the tide water afforded a view of the sound footnote an island more than forty leagues in length lies opposite the coasts of new york and connecticut the arm of the sea which separates it from the main is technically called a sound and in that part of the country par excellence the sound this sheet of water varies in its breadth from five to thirty miles over the tops of the distant woods on its margin the surface of the water which had so lately been lashing the shores with boisterous fury was already losing its ruffled darkness in the long and regular undulations that succeeded a tempest while the light air from the southwest was gently touching their summits lending its feeble aid in stilling the waters some dark spots were now to be distinguished occasionally rising into view and again sinking behind the lengthened waves which interposed themselves to the sight they were unnoticed by all but the peddler he had seated himself on the piazza at a distance from harper and appeared to have forgotten the object of his visit his roving eye however soon caught a glimpse of these new objects in the view and he sprang up with alacrity gazing intently towards the water he changed his place glanced his eye with marked uneasiness on harper and then said with great emphasis  the riglars must be out from below  why do you think so inquired captain wharton eagerly god send it may be true i want their escort in again  them ten whaleboats would not move so fast unless they were better manned than common  perhaps cried mr wharton in alarm they arethey are continentals returning from the island  they look like riglars said the peddler with meaning  look repeated the captain there is nothing but spots to be seen  harvey disregarded his observation but seemed to be soliloquizing as he said in an undertone they came out before the galehave laid on the island these two dayshorse are on the roadthere will soon be fighting near us during this speech birch several times glanced his eye towards harper with evident uneasiness but no corresponding emotion betrayed any interest of that gentleman in the scene he stood in silent contemplation of the view and seemed enjoying the change in the air as birch concluded however harper turned to his host and mentioned that his business would not admit of unnecessary delay he would therefore avail himself of the fine evening to ride a few miles on his journey mr wharton made many professions of regret at losing so agreeable an inmate but was too mindful of his duty not to speed the parting guest and orders were instantly given to that effect  the uneasiness of the peddler increased in a manner for which nothing apparent could account his eye was constantly wandering towards the lower end of the vale as if in expectation of some interruption from that quarter at length caesar appeared leading the noble beast which was to bear the weight of the traveler the peddler officiously assisted to tighten the girths and fasten the blue cloak and valise to the mailstraps  every precaution being completed harper proceeded to take his leave to sarah and her aunt he paid his compliments with ease and kindness but when he came to frances he paused a moment while his face assumed an expression of more than ordinary benignity his eye repeated the blessing which had before fallen from his lips and the girl felt her cheeks glow and her heart beat with a quicker pulsation as he spoke his adieus there was a mutual exchange of polite courtesy between the host and his parting guest but as harper frankly offered his hand to captain wharton he remarked in a manner of great solemnity  the step you have undertaken is one of much danger and disagreeable consequences to yourself may result from it in such a case i may have it in my power to prove the gratitude i owe your family for its kindness  surely sir cried the father losing sight of delicacy in apprehension for his child you will keep secret the discovery which your being in my house has enabled you to make  harper turned quickly to the speaker and then losing the sternness which had begun to gather on his countenance he answered mildly i have learned nothing in your family sir of which i was ignorant before but your son is safer from my knowledge of his visit than he would be without it  he bowed to the whole party and without taking any notice of the peddler other than by simply thanking him for his attentions mounted his horse and riding steadily and gracefully through the little gate was soon lost behind the hill which sheltered the valley to the northward  the eyes of the peddler followed the retiring figure of the horseman so long as it continued within view and as it disappeared from his sight he drew a long and heavy sigh as if relieved from a load of apprehension the whartons had meditated in silence on the character and visit of their unknown guest for the same period when the father approached birch and observed  i am yet your debtor harvey for the tobacco you were so kind as to bring me from the city  if it should not prove so good as the first replied the peddler fixing a last and lingering look in the direction of harpers route it is owing to the scarcity of the article  i like it much continued the other but you have forgotten to name the price  the countenance of the trader changed and losing its expression of deep care in a natural acuteness he answered  it is hard to say what ought to be the price i believe i must leave it to your own generosity  mr wharton had taken a hand well filled with the images of carolus iii from his pocket and now extended it towards birch with three of the pieces between his finger and thumb harveys eyes twinkled as he contemplated the reward and rolling over in his mouth a large quantity of the article in question coolly stretched forth his hand into which the dollars fell with a most agreeable sound but not satisfied with the transient music of their fall the peddler gave each piece in succession a ring on the steppingstone of the piazza before he consigned it to the safekeeping of a huge deerskin purse which vanished from the sight of the spectators so dexterously that not one of them could have told about what part of his person it was secreted  this very material point in his business so satisfactorily completed the peddler rose from his seat on the floor of the piazza and approached to where captain wharton stood supporting his sisters on either arm as they listened with the lively interest of affection to his conversation  the agitation of the preceding incidents had caused such an expenditure of the juices which had become necessary to the mouth of the peddler that a new supply of the weed was required before he could turn his attention to business of lesser moment this done he asked abruptly  captain wharton do you go in tonight  no said the captain laconically and looking at his lovely burdens with great affection mr birch would you have me leave such company so soon when i may never enjoy it again  brother said frances jesting on such a subject is cruel  i rather guess continued the peddler coolly now the storm is over the skinners may be moving you had better shorten your visit captain wharton  oh cried the british officer a few guineas will buy off those rascals at any time should i meet them no no mr birch here i stay until morning  money could not liberate major andre said the peddler dryly  both the sisters now turned to the captain in alarm and the elder observed  you had better take the advice of harvey rest assured his opinion in such matters ought not to be disregarded  yes added the younger if as i suspect mr birch assisted you to come here your safety our happiness dear henry requires you to listen to him now  i brought myself out and can take myself in said the captain positively our bargain went no further than to procure my disguise and to let me know when the coast was clear and in the latter particular you were mistaken mr birch  i was said the peddler with some interest and the greater is the reason why you should get back tonight the pass i gave you will serve but once  cannot you forge another  the pale cheek of the trader showed an unusual color but he continued silent with his eyes fixed on the ground until the young man added with great positiveness here i stay this night come what will  captain wharton said the peddler with great deliberation and marked emphasis beware a tall virginian with huge whiskers he is below you to my knowledge the devil cant deceive him i never could but once  let him beware of me said wharton haughtily but mr birch i exonerate you from further responsibility  will you give me that in writing asked the cautious birch  oh cheerfully cried the captain with a laugh caesar pen ink and paper while i write a discharge for my trusty attendant harvey birch peddler etc etc  the implements for writing were produced and the captain with great gayety wrote the desired acknowledgment in language of his own which the peddler took and carefully depositing it by the side of the image of his catholic majesty made a sweeping bow to the whole family and departed as he had approached he was soon seen at a distance stealing into the door of his own humble dwelling  the father and sisters of the captain were too much rejoiced in retaining the young man to express or even entertain the apprehensions his situation might reasonably excite but on retiring to their evening repast a cooler reflection induced the captain to think of changing his mind unwilling to trust himself out of the protection of his fathers domains the young man dispatched caesar to desire another interview with harvey the black soon returned with the unwelcome intelligence that it was now too late katy had told him that harvey must be miles on his road to the northward having left home at early candlelight with his pack nothing now remained to the captain but patience until the morning should afford further opportunity of deciding on the best course for him to pursue  this harvey birch with his knowing looks and portentous warnings gives me more uneasiness than i am willing to own said captain wharton rousing himself from a fit of musing in which the danger of his situation made no small part of his meditations  how is it that he is able to travel to and fro in these difficult times without molestation inquired miss peyton  why the rebels suffer him to escape so easily is more than i can answer returned the other but sir henry would not permit a hair of his head to be injured  indeed cried frances with interest is he then known to sir henry clinton  at least he ought to be  do you think my son asked mr wharton there is no danger of his betraying you  whyno i reflected on that before i trusted myself to his power said the captain thoughtfully he seems to be faithful in matters of business the danger to himself should he return to the city would prevent such an act of villainy  i think said frances adopting the manner of her brother harvey birch is not without good feelings at least he has the appearance of them at times  oh cried his sister exulting he has loyalty and that with me is a cardinal virtue  i am afraid said her brother laughing love of money is a stronger passion than love of his king  then said the father you cannot be safe while in his powerfor no love will withstand the temptations of money when offered to avarice  surely sir cried the youth recovering his gayety there must be one love that can resist anythingis there not fanny  here is your candle you keep your father up beyond his usual hour     chapter v        through solway sands through taross moss      blindfold he knew the paths to cross      by wily turns by desperate bounds      had baffled percys best bloodhounds      in eske or liddel fords were none      but he would ride them one by one      alike to him was time or tide      decembers snow or julys pride      alike to him was tide or time      moonless midnight or matin prime                                     walter scott  all the members of the wharton family laid their heads on their pillows that night with a foreboding of some interruption to their ordinary quiet uneasiness kept the sisters from enjoying their usual repose and they rose from their beds on the following morning unrefreshed and almost without having closed their eyes  on taking an eager and hasty survey of the valley from the windows of their room nothing however but its usual serenity was to be seen it was glittering with the opening brilliancy of one of those lovely mild days which occur about the time of the falling of the leaf and which by their frequency class the american autumn with the most delightful seasons of other countries we have no spring vegetation seems to leap into existence instead of creeping as in the same latitudes of the old world but how gracefully it retires september october even november and december compose the season for enjoyment in the open air they have their storms but they are distinct and not of long continuance leaving a clear atmosphere and a cloudless sky  as nothing could be seen likely to interrupt the enjoyments and harmony of such a day the sisters descended to the parlor with a returning confidence in their brothers security and their own happiness  the family were early in assembling around the breakfast table and miss peyton with a little of that minute precision which creeps into the habits of single life had pleasantly insisted that the absence of her nephew should in no manner interfere with the regular hours she had established consequently the party were already seated when the captain made his appearance though the untasted coffee sufficiently proved that by none of his relatives was his absence disregarded  i think i did much better he cried taking a chair between his sisters and receiving their offered salutes to secure a good bed and such a plentiful breakfast instead of trusting to the hospitality of that renowned corps the cowboys  if you could sleep said sarah you were more fortunate than frances and myself every murmur of the night air sounded to me like the approach of the rebel army  why said the captain laughing i do acknowledge a little inquietude myselfbut how was it with you turning to his younger and evidently favorite sister and tapping her cheek did you see banners in the clouds and mistake miss peytons aeolian harp for rebellious music  nay henry rejoined the maid looking at him affectionately much as i love my own country the approach of her troops just now would give me great pain  the brother made no reply but returning the fondness expressed in her eye by a look of fraternal tenderness he gently pressed her hand in silence when caesar who had participated largely in the anxiety of the family and who had risen with the dawn and kept a vigilant watch on the surrounding objects as he stood gazing from one of the windows exclaimed with a face that approached to something like the hues of a white man  runmassa harryrunif he love old caesar runhere come a rebel horse  run repeated the british officer gathering himself up in military pride no mr caesar running is not my trade while speaking he walked deliberately to the window where the family were already collected in the greatest consternation  at the distance of more than a mile about fifty dragoons were to be seen winding down one of the lateral entrances of the valley in advance with an officer was a man attired in the dress of a countryman who pointed in the direction of the cottage a small party now left the main body and moved rapidly towards the object of their destination  on reaching the road which led through the bottom of the valley they turned their horses heads to the north  the whartons continued chained in breathless silence to the spot watching their movements when the party having reached the dwelling of birch made a rapid circle around his grounds and in an instant his house was surrounded by a dozen sentinels  two or three of the dragoons now dismounted and disappeared in a few minutes however they returned to the yard followed by katy from whose violent gesticulations it was evident that matters of no trifling concern were on the carpet a short communication with the loquacious housekeeper followed the arrival of the main body of the troop and the advance party remounting the whole moved towards the locusts with great speed  as yet none of the family had sufficient presence of mind to devise any means of security for captain wharton but the danger now became too pressing to admit of longer delay and various means of secreting him were hastily proposed but they were all haughtily rejected by the young man as unworthy of his character it was too late to retreat to the woods in the rear of the cottage for he would unavoidably be seen and followed by a troop of horse as inevitably taken  at length his sisters with trembling hands replaced his original disguise the instruments of which had been carefully kept at hand by caesar in expectation of some sudden emergency  this arrangement was hastily and imperfectly completed as the dragoons entered the lawn and orchard of the locusts riding with the rapidity of the wind and in their turn the whartons were surrounded  nothing remained now but to meet the impending examination with as much indifference as the family could assume the leader of the horse dismounted and followed by a couple of his men he approached the outer door of the building which was slowly and reluctantly opened for his admission by caesar the heavy tread of the trooper as he followed the black to the door of the parlor rang in the ears of the females as it approached nearer and nearer and drove the blood from their faces to their hearts with a chill that nearly annihilated feeling  a man whose colossal stature manifested the possession of vast strength entered the room and removing his cap he saluted the family with a mildness his appearance did not indicate as belonging to his nature his dark hair hung around his brow in profusion though stained with powder which was worn at that day and his face was nearly hid in the whiskers by which it was disfigured still the expression of his eye though piercing was not bad and his voice though deep and powerful was far from unpleasant frances ventured to throw a timid glance at his figure as he entered and saw at once the man from whose scrutiny harvey birch had warned them there was so much to be apprehended  you have no cause for alarm ladies said the officer pausing a moment and contemplating the pale faces around him my business will be confined to a few questions which if freely answered will instantly remove us from your dwelling  and what may they be sir stammered mr wharton rising from his chair and waiting anxiously for the reply  has there been a strange gentleman staying with you during the storm continued the dragoon speaking with interest and in some degree sharing in the evident anxiety of the father  this gentlemanherefavored us with his company during the rain and has not yet departed  this gentleman repeated the other turning to captain wharton and contemplating his figure for a moment until the anxiety of his countenance gave place to a lurking smile he approached the youth with an air of comic gravity and with a low bow continued i am sorry for the severe cold you have in your head sir  i exclaimed the captain in surprise i have no cold in my head  i fancied it then from seeing you had covered such handsome black locks with that ugly old wig it was my mistake you will please to pardon it  mr wharton groaned aloud but the ladies ignorant of the extent of their visitors knowledge remained in trembling yet rigid silence the captain himself moved his hand involuntarily to his head and discovered that the trepidation of his sisters had left some of his natural hair exposed the dragoon watched the movement with a continued smile when seeming to recollect himself turning to the father he proceeded  then sir i am to understand there has not been a mr harper here within the week  mr harper echoed the other feeling a load removed from his heart yes i had forgotten but he is gone and if there be anything wrong in his character we are in entire ignorance of it to me he was a total stranger  you have but little to apprehend from his character answered the dragoon dryly but he is gonehowwhenand whither  he departed as he arrived said mr wharton gathering renewed confidence from the manner of the trooper on horseback last evening and he took the northern road  the officer listened to him with intense interest his countenance gradually lighting into a smile of pleasure and the instant mr wharton concluded his laconic reply he turned on his heel and left the apartment the whartons judging from his manner thought he was about to proceed in quest of the object of his inquiries they observed the dragoon on gaining the lawn in earnest and apparently pleased conversation with his two subalterns in a few moments orders were given to some of the troops and horsemen left the valley at full speed by its various roads  the suspense of the party within who were all highly interested witnesses of this scene was shortly terminated for the heavy tread of the dragoon soon announced his second approach he bowed again politely as he reentered the room and walking up to captain wharton said with comic gravity  now sir my principal business being done may i beg to examine the quality of that wig  the british officer imitated the manner of the other as he deliberately uncovered his head and handing him the wig observed i hope sir it is to your liking  i cannot without violating the truth say it is returned the dragoon i prefer your ebony hair from which you seem to have combed the powder with great industry but that must have been a sad hurt you have received under this enormous black patch  you appear so close an observer of things i should like your opinion of it sir said henry removing the silk and exhibiting the cheek free from blemish  upon my word you improve most rapidly in externals added the trooper preserving his muscles in inflexible gravity if i could but persuade you to exchange this old surtout for that handsome blue coat by your side i think i never could witness a more agreeable metamorphosis since i was changed myself from a lieutenant to a captain  young wharton very composedly did as was required and stood an extremely handsome welldressed young man the dragoon looked at him for a minute with the drollery that characterized his manner and then continued  this is a newcomer in the scene it is usual you know for strangers to be introduced i am captain lawton of the virginia horse  and i sir am captain wharton of his majestys 60th regiment of foot returned henry bowing stiffly and recovering his natural manner  the countenance of lawton changed instantly and his assumed quaintness vanished he viewed the figure of captain wharton as he stood proudly swelling with a pride that disdained further concealment and exclaimed with great earnestness  captain wharton from my soul i pity you  oh then cried the father in agony if you pity him dear sir why molest him he is not a spy nothing but a desire to see his friends prompted him to venture so far from the regular army in disguise leave him with us there is no reward no sum which i will not cheerfully pay  sir your anxiety for your friend excuses your language said lawton haughtily but you forget i am a virginian and a gentleman turning to the young man he continued were you ignorant captain wharton that our pickets have been below you for several days  i did not know it until i reached them and it was then too late to retreat said wharton sullenly i came out as my father has mentioned to see my friends understanding your parties to be at peekskill and near the highlands or surely i would not have ventured  all this may be very true but the affair of andre has made us on the alert when treason reaches the grade of general officers captain wharton it behooves the friends of liberty to be vigilant  henry bowed to this remark in distant silence but sarah ventured to urge something in behalf of her brother the dragoon heard her politely and apparently with commiseration but willing to avoid useless and embarrassing petitions he answered mildly  i am not the commander of the party madam major dunwoodie will decide what must be done with your brother at all events he will receive nothing but kind and gentle treatment  dunwoodie exclaimed frances with a face in which the roses contended for the mastery with the paleness of apprehension thank god then henry is safe  lawton regarded her with a mingled expression of pity and admiration then shaking his head doubtingly he continued  i hope so and with your permission we will leave the matter for his decision  the color of frances changed from the paleness of fear to the glow of hope her dread on behalf of her brother was certainly greatly diminished yet her form shook her breathing became short and irregular and her whole frame gave tokens of extraordinary agitation her eyes rose from the floor to the dragoon and were again fixed immovably on the carpetshe evidently wished to utter something but was unequal to the effort miss peyton was a close observer of these movements of her niece and advancing with an air of feminine dignity inquired  then sir we may expect the pleasure of major dunwoodies company shortly  immediately madam answered the dragoon withdrawing his admiring gaze from the person of frances expresses are already on the road to announce to him our situation and the intelligence will speedily bring him to this valley unless indeed some private reasons may exist to make a visit particularly unpleasant  we shall always be happy to see major dunwoodie  oh doubtless he is a general favorite may i presume on it so far as to ask leave to dismount and refresh my men who compose a part of his squadron  there was a manner about the trooper that would have made the omission of such a request easily forgiven by mr wharton but he was fairly entrapped by his own eagerness to conciliate and it was useless to withhold a consent which he thought would probably be extorted he therefore made the most of necessity and gave such orders as would facilitate the wishes of captain lawton  the officers were invited to take their mornings repast at the family breakfast table and having made their arrangements without the invitation was frankly accepted none of the watchfulness which was so necessary to their situation was neglected by the wary partisan patrols were seen on the distant hills taking their protecting circuit around their comrades who were enjoying in the midst of danger a security that can only spring from the watchfulness of discipline and the indifference of habit  the addition to the party at mr whartons table was only three and they were all of them men who under the rough exterior induced by actual and arduous service concealed the manners of gentlemen consequently the interruption to the domestic privacy of the family was marked by the observance of strict decorum the ladies left the table to their guests who proceeded without much superfluous diffidence to do proper honors to the hospitality of mr wharton  at length captain lawton suspended for a moment his violent attacks on the buckwheat cakes to inquire of the master of the house if there was not a peddler of the name of birch who lived in the valley at times  at times only i believe sir replied mr wharton cautiously he is seldom here i may say i never see him  that is strange too said the trooper looking at the disconcerted host intently considering he is your next neighbor he must be quite domestic sir and to the ladies it must be somewhat inconvenient i doubt not that that muslin in the window seat cost twice as much as he would have asked them for it  mr wharton turned in consternation and saw some of the recent purchases scattered about the room  the two subalterns struggled to conceal their smiles but the captain resumed his breakfast with an eagerness that created a doubt whether he ever expected to enjoy another the necessity of a supply from the dominion of dinah soon however afforded another respite of which lawton availed himself  i had a wish to break this mr birch of his unsocial habits and gave him a call this morning he said had i found him within i should have placed him where he would enjoy life in the midst of society for a short time at least  and where might that be sir asked mr wharton conceiving it necessary to say something  the guardroom said the trooper dryly  what is the offense of poor birch asked miss peyton handing the dragoon a fourth dish of coffee  poor cried the captain if he is poor king george is a bad paymaster  yes indeed said one of the subalterns his majesty owes him a dukedom  and congress a halter continued the commanding officer commencing anew on a fresh supply of the cakes  i am sorry said mr wharton that any neighbor of mine should incur the displeasure of our rulers  if i catch him cried the dragoon while buttering another cake he will dangle from the limbs of one of his namesakes  he would make no bad ornament suspended from one of those locusts before his own door added the lieutenant  never mind continued the captain i will have him yet before im a major  as the language of the officers appeared to be sincere and such as disappointed men in their rough occupations are but too apt to use the whartons thought it prudent to discontinue the subject it was no new intelligence to any of the family that harvey birch was distrusted and greatly harassed by the american army his escapes from their hands no less than his imprisonments had been the conversation of the country in too many instances and under circumstances of too great mystery to be easily forgotten in fact no small part of the bitterness expressed by captain lawton against the peddler arose from the unaccountable disappearance of the latter when intrusted to the custody of two of his most faithful dragoons  a twelvemonth had not yet elapsed since birch had been seen lingering near the headquarters of the commander in chief and at a time when important movements were expected hourly to occur so soon as the information of this fact was communicated to the officer whose duty it was to guard the avenues of the american camp he dispatched captain lawton in pursuit of the peddler  acquainted with all the passes of the hills and indefatigable in the discharge of his duty the trooper had with much trouble and toil succeeded in effecting his object the party had halted at a farmhouse for the purposes of refreshment and the prisoner was placed in a room by himself but under the keeping of the two men before mentioned all that was known subsequently is that a woman was seen busily engaged in the employments of the household near the sentinels and was particularly attentive to the wants of the captain until he was deeply engaged in the employments of the supper table  afterwards neither woman nor peddler was to be found the pack indeed was discovered open and nearly empty and a small door communicating with a room adjoining to the one in which the peddler had been secured was ajar  captain lawton never could forgive the deception his antipathies to his enemies were not very moderate but this was adding an insult to his penetration that rankled deeply he sat in portentous silence brooding over the exploit of his prisoner yet mechanically pursuing the business before him until after sufficient time had passed to make a very comfortable meal a trumpet suddenly broke on the ears of the party sending its martial tones up the valley in startling melody the trooper rose instantly from the table exclaiming  quick gentlemen to your horses there comes dunwoodie and followed by his officers he precipitately left the room  with the exception of the sentinels left to guard captain wharton the dragoons mounted and marched out to meet their comrades  none of the watchfulness necessary in a war in which similarity of language appearance and customs rendered prudence doubly necessary was omitted by the cautious leader on getting sufficiently near however to a body of horse of more than double his own number to distinguish countenances lawton plunged his rowels into his charger and in a moment he was by the side of his commander  the ground in front of the cottage was again occupied by the horse and observing the same precautions as before the newly arrived troops hastened to participate in the cheer prepared for their comrades     chapter vi                          and let conquerors boast      their fields of famehe who in virtue arms      a young warm spirit against beautys charms      who feels her brightness yet defies her thrall      is the best bravest conqueror of them all                                              moore  the ladies of the wharton family had collected about a window deeply interested in the scene we have related  sarah viewed the approach of her countrymen with a smile of contemptuous indifference for she even undervalued the personal appearance of men whom she thought arrayed in the unholy cause of rebellion miss peyton looked on the gallant show with an exulting pride which arose in the reflection that the warriors before her were the chosen troops of her native colony while frances gazed with a singleness of interest that absorbed all other considerations  the two parties had not yet joined before her quick eye distinguished one horseman in particular from those around him to her it appeared that even the steed of this youthful soldier seemed to be conscious that he sustained the weight of no common man his hoofs but lightly touched the earth and his airy tread was the curbed motion of a blooded charger  the dragoon sat in the saddle with a firmness and ease that showed him master of himself and horsehis figure uniting the just proportions of strength and activity being tall round and muscular to this officer lawton made his report and side by side they rode into the field opposite to the cottage  the heart of frances beat with a pulsation nearly stifling as he paused for a moment and took a survey of the building with an eye whose dark and sparkling glance could be seen notwithstanding the distance her color changed and for an instant as she saw the youth throw himself from the saddle she was compelled to seek relief for her trembling limbs in a chair  the officer gave a few hasty orders to his second in command walked rapidly into the lawn and approached the cottage frances rose from her seat and vanished from the apartment the dragoon ascended the steps of the piazza and had barely time to touch the outer door when it opened to his admission  the youth of frances when she left the city had prevented her sacrificing in conformity to the customs of that day all her native beauties on the altar of fashion her hair which was of a golden richness of color was left untortured to fall in the natural ringlets of infancy and it shaded a face which was glowing with the united charms of health youth and artlessness her eyes spoke volumes but her tongue was silent her hands were interlocked before her and aided by her taper form bending forward in an attitude of expectation gave a loveliness and an interest to her appearance that for a moment chained her lover in silence to the spot  frances silently led the way into a vacant parlor opposite to the one in which the family were assembled and turning to the soldier frankly placing both her hands in his own exclaimed  ah dunwoodie how happy on many accounts i am to see you i have brought you in here to prepare you to meet an unexpected friend in the opposite room  to whatever cause it may be owing cried the youth pressing her hands to his lips i too am happy in being able to see you alone frances the probation you have decreed is cruel war and distance may separate us forever  we must submit to the necessity which governs us but it is not love speeches i would hear now i have other and more important matter for your attention  what can be of more importance than to make you mine by a tie that will be indissoluble frances you are cold to memefrom whose mind days of service and nights of alarm have never been able to banish your image for a single moment  dear dunwoodie said frances softening nearly to tears and again extending her hand to him as the richness of her color gradually returned you know my sentimentsthis war once ended and you may take that hand foreverbut i can never consent to tie myself to you by any closer union than already exists so long as you are arrayed in arms against my only brother even now that brother is awaiting your decision to restore him to liberty or to conduct him to a probable death  your brother cried dunwoodie starting and turning pale your brother explain yourselfwhat dreadful meaning is concealed in your words  has not captain lawton told you of the arrest of henry by himself this very morning continued frances in a voice barely audible and fixing on her lover a look of the deepest concern  he told me of arresting a captain of the 60th in disguise but without mentioning where or whom replied the major in a similar tone and dropping his head between his hands he endeavored to conceal his feelings from his companion  dunwoodie dunwoodie exclaimed frances losing all her former confidence in the most fearful apprehensions what means this agitation as the major slowly raised his face in which was pictured the most expressive concern she continued surely surely you will not betray your friendmy brotheryour brotherto an ignominious death  frances exclaimed the young man in agony what can i do  do she repeated gazing at him wildly would major dunwoodie yield his friend to his enemiesthe brother of his betrothed wife  oh speak not so unkindly to me dearest miss whartonmy own frances i would this moment die for youfor henrybut i cannot forget my dutycannot forfeit my honor you yourself would be the first to despise me if i did  peyton dunwoodie said frances solemnly and with a face of ashy paleness you have told meyou have sworn that you love me  i do interrupted the soldier with fervor but motioning for silence she continued in a voice that trembled with her fears  do you think i can throw myself into the arms of a man whose hands are stained with the blood of my only brother  frances you wring my very heart then pausing to struggle with his feelings he endeavored to force a smile as he added but after all we may be torturing ourselves with unnecessary fears and henry when i know the circumstances may be nothing more than a prisoner of war in which case i can liberate him on parole  there is no more delusive passion than hope and it seems to be the happy privilege of youth to cull all the pleasures that can be gathered from its indulgence it is when we are most worthy of confidence ourselves that we are least apt to distrust others and what we think ought to be we are prone to think will be  the halfformed expectations of the young soldier were communicated to the desponding sister more by the eye than the voice and the blood rushed again to her cheek as she cried  oh there can be no just grounds to doubt it i knowi knewdunwoodie you would never desert us in the hour of our greatest need the violence of her feelings prevailed and the agitated girl found relief in a flood of tears  the office of consoling those we love is one of the dearest prerogatives of affection and major dunwoodie although but little encouraged by his own momentary suggestion of relief could not undeceive the lovely girl who leaned on his shoulder as he wiped the traces of her feeling from her face with a trembling but reviving confidence in the safety of her brother and the protection of her lover  frances having sufficiently recovered her recollection to command herself now eagerly led the way to the opposite room to communicate to her family the pleasing intelligence which she already conceived so certain  dunwoodie followed her reluctantly and with forebodings of the result but a few moments brought him into the presence of his relatives and he summoned all his resolution to meet the trial with firmness  the salutations of the young men were cordial and frank and on the part of henry wharton as collected as if nothing had occurred to disturb his selfpossession  the abhorrence of being in any manner auxiliary to the arrest of his friend the danger to the life of captain wharton and the heartbreaking declarations of frances had however created an uneasiness in the bosom of major dunwoodie which all his efforts could not conceal his reception by the rest of the family was kind and sincere both from old regard and a remembrance of former obligations heightened by the anticipations they could not fail to read in the expressive eyes of the blushing girl by his side after exchanging greetings with every member of the family major dunwoodie beckoned to the sentinel whom the wary prudence of captain lawton had left in charge of the prisoner to leave the room turning to captain wharton he inquired mildly  tell me henry the circumstances of this disguise in which captain lawton reports you to have been found and rememberremembercaptain whartonyour answers are entirely voluntary  the disguise was used by me major dunwoodie replied the english officer gravely to enable me to visit my friends without incurring the danger of becoming a prisoner of war  but you did not wear it until you saw the troop of lawton approaching  oh no interrupted frances eagerly forgetting all the circumstances in her anxiety for her brother sarah and myself placed them on him when the dragoons appeared and it was our awkwardness that has led to the discovery  the countenance of dunwoodie brightened as turning his eyes in fondness on the speaker he listened to her explanation  probably some articles of your own he continued which were at hand and were used on the spur of the moment  no said wharton with dignity the clothes were worn by me from the city they were procured for the purpose to which they were applied and i intended to use them in my return this very day  the appalled frances shrank back from between her brother and lover where her ardent feelings had carried her as the whole truth glanced over her mind and she sank into a seat gazing wildly on the young men  but the picketsthe party at the plains added dunwoodie turning pale  i passed them too in disguise i made use of this pass for which i paid and as it bears the name of washington i presume it is forged  dunwoodie caught the paper from his hand eagerly and stood gazing on the signature for some time in silence during which the soldier gradually prevailed over the man when he turned to the prisoner with a searching look as he asked  captain wharton whence did you procure this paper  this is a question i conceive major dunwoodie has no right to ask  your pardon sir my feelings may have led me into an impropriety  mr wharton who had been a deeply interested auditor now so far conquered his feelings as to say surely major dunwoodie the paper cannot be material such artifices are used daily in war  this name is no counterfeit said the dragoon studying the characters and speaking in a low voice is treason yet among us undiscovered the confidence of washington has been abused for the fictitious name is in a different hand from the pass captain wharton my duty will not suffer me to grant you a parole you must accompany me to the highlands  i did not expect otherwise major dunwoodie  dunwoodie turned slowly towards the sisters when the figure of frances once more arrested his gaze she had risen from her seat and stood again with her hands clasped before him in an attitude of petition feeling himself unable to contend longer with his feelings he made a hurried excuse for a temporary absence and left the room frances followed him and obedient to the direction of her eye the soldier reentered the apartment in which had been their first interview  major dunwoodie said frances in a voice barely audible as she beckoned to him to be seated her cheek which had been of a chilling whiteness was flushed with a suffusion that crimsoned her whole countenance she struggled with herself for a moment and continued i have already acknowledged to you my esteem even now when you most painfully distress me i wish not to conceal it believe me henry is innocent of everything but imprudence our country can sustain no wrong again she paused and almost gasped for breath her color changed rapidly from red to white until the blood rushed into her face covering her features with the brightest vermilion and she added hastily in an undertone i have promised dunwoodie when peace shall be restored to our country to become your wife give to my brother his liberty on parole and i will this day go with you to the altar follow you to the camp and in becoming a soldiers bride learn to endure a soldiers privations  dunwoodie seized the hand which the blushing girl in her ardor had extended towards him and pressed it for a moment to his bosom then rising from his seat he paced the room in excessive agitation  frances say no more i conjure you unless you wish to break my heart  you then reject my offered hand she said rising with dignity though her pale cheek and quivering lip plainly showed the conflicting passions within  reject it have i not sought it with entreatieswith tears has it not been the goal of all my earthly wishes but to take it under such conditions would be to dishonor both we will hope for better things henry must be acquitted perhaps not tried no intercession of mine shall be wanting you must well know and believe me frances i am not without favor with washington  that very paper that abuse of his confidence to which you alluded will steel him to my brothers case if threats or entreaties could move his stern sense of justice would andre have suffered as frances uttered these words she fled from the room in despair  dunwoodie remained for a minute nearly stupefied and then he followed with a view to vindicate himself and to relieve her apprehensions on entering the hall that divided the two parlors he was met by a small ragged boy who looked one moment at his dress and placing a piece of paper in his hands immediately vanished through the outer door of the building the bewildered state of his mind and the suddenness of the occurrence gave the major barely time to observe the messenger to be a country lad meanly attired and that he held in his hand one of those toys which are to be bought in cities and which he now apparently contemplated with the conscious pleasure of having fairly purchased by the performance of the service required the soldier turned his eyes to the subject of the note it was written on a piece of torn and soiled paper and in a hand barely legible but after some little labor he was able to make out as follows  the riglars are at hand horse and foot footnote there died a few years since in bedford westchester a yeoman named elisha h this person was employed by washington as one of his most confidential spies by the conditions of their bargain h was never to be required to deal with third parties since his risks were too imminent he was allowed to enter also into the service of sir henry clinton and so much confidence had washington in his love of country and discretion that he was often intrusted with the minor military movements in order that he might enhance his value with the english general by communicating them in this manner h had continued to serve for a long period when chance brought him into the city then held by the british at a moment when an expedition was about to quit it to go against a small post established at bedford his native village where the americans had a depot of provisions h easily ascertained the force and destination of the detachment ordered on this service but he was at a loss in what manner to communicate his information to the officer in command at bedford without betraying his own true character to a third person there was not time to reach washington and under the circumstances he finally resolved to hazard a short note to the american commandant stating the danger and naming the time when the attack might be expected to this note he even ventured to affix his own initials e h though he had disguised the hand under a belief that as he knew himself to be suspected by his countrymen it might serve to give more weight to his warning his family being at bedford the note was transmitted with facility and arrived in good season h himself remaining in new york the american commandant did what every sensible officer in a similar case would have done he sent a courier with the note to washington demanding orders while he prepared his little party to make the best defense in his power the headquarters of the american army were at that time in the highlands fortunately the express met washington on a tour of observation near their entrance the note was given to him and he read it in the saddle adding in pencil believe all that e h tells you george washington he returned it to the courier with an injunction to ride for life or death the courier reached bedford after the british had made their attack the commandant read the reply and put it in his pocket the americans were defeated and their leader killed the note of h with the line written on it by washington was found on his person the following day h was summoned to the presence of sir henry clinton after the latter had put several general questions he suddenly gave the note to the spy and asked if he knew the handwriting and demanded who the e h was it is elijah hadden the spy you hanged yesterday at powles hook the readiness of this answer connected with the fact that a spy having the same initials had been executed the day before and the coolness of h saved him sir henry clinton allowed him to quit his presence and he never saw him afterwards  dunwoodie started and forgetting everything but the duties of a soldier he precipitately left the house while walking rapidly towards the troops he noticed on a distant hill a vidette riding with speed several pistols were fired in quick succession and the next instant the trumpets of the corps rang in his ears with the enlivening strain of to arms by the time he had reached the ground occupied by his squadron the major saw that every man was in active motion lawton was already in the saddle eying the opposite extremity of the valley with the eagerness of expectation and crying to the musicians in tones but little lower than their own  sound away my lads and let these englishmen know that the virginia horse are between them and the end of their journey  the videttes and patrols now came pouring in each making in succession his hasty report to the commanding officer who gave his orders coolly and with a promptitude that made obedience certain once only as he wheeled his horse to ride over the ground in front did dunwoodie trust himself with a look at the cottage and his heart beat with unusual rapidity as he saw a female figure standing with clasped hands at a window of the room in which he had met frances the distance was too great to distinguish her features but the soldier could not doubt that it was his mistress the paleness of his cheek and the languor of his eye endured but for a moment longer as he rode towards the intended battle ground a flush of ardor began to show itself on his sunburnt features and his dragoons who studied the face of their leader as the best index to their own fate saw again the wonted flashing of the eyes and the cheerful animation which they had so often witnessed on the eve of battle by the additions of the videttes and parties that had been out and which now had all joined the whole number of the horse was increased to nearly two hundred there was also a small body of men whose ordinary duties were those of guides but who in cases of emergency were embodied and did duty as foot soldiers these were dismounted and proceeded by the order of dunwoodie to level the few fences which might interfere with the intended movements of the cavalry the neglect of husbandry which had been occasioned by the war left this task comparatively easy those long lines of heavy and durable walls which now sweep through every part of the country forty years ago were unknown the slight and tottering fences of stone were then used more to clear the land for the purposes of cultivation than as permanent barriers and required the constant attention of the husbandman to preserve them against the fury of the tempests and the frosts of winter some few of them had been built with more care immediately around the dwelling of mr wharton but those which had intersected the vale below were now generally a pile of ruins over which the horses of the virginians would bound with the fleetness of the wind occasionally a short line yet preserved its erect appearance but as none of those crossed the ground on which dunwoodie intended to act there remained only the slighter fences of rails to be thrown down their duty was hastily but effectually performed and the guides withdrew to the post assigned to them for the approaching fight  major dunwoodie had received from his scouts all the intelligence concerning his foe which was necessary to enable him to make his arrangements the bottom of the valley was an even plain that fell with a slight inclination from the foot of the hills on either side to the level of a natural meadow that wound through the country on the banks of a small stream by whose waters it was often inundated and fertilized this brook was easily forded in any part of its course and the only impediment it offered to the movements of the horse was in a place where it changed its bed from the western to the eastern side of the valley and where its banks were more steep and difficult of access than common here the highway crossed it by a rough wooden bridge as it did again at the distance of half a mile above the locusts  the hills on the eastern side of the valley were abrupt and frequently obtruded themselves in rocky prominences into its bosom lessening the width to half the usual dimensions one of these projections was but a short distance in the rear of the squadron of dragoons and dunwoodie directed captain lawton to withdraw with two troops behind its cover the officer obeyed with a kind of surly reluctance that was however somewhat lessened by the anticipations of the effect his sudden appearance would make on the enemy dunwoodie knew his man and had selected the captain for this service both because he feared his precipitation in the field and knew when needed his support would never fail to appear it was only in front of the enemy that captain lawton was hasty at all other times his discernment and selfpossession were consummately preserved but he sometimes forgot them in his eagerness to engage on the left of the ground on which dunwoodie intended to meet his foe was a close wood which skirted that side of the valley for the distance of a mile into this then the guides retired and took their station near its edge in such a manner as would enable them to maintain a scattering but effectual fire on the advancing column of the enemy  it cannot be supposed that all these preparations were made unheeded by the inmates of the cottage on the contrary every feeling which can agitate the human breast in witnessing such a scene was actively alive mr wharton alone saw no hopes to himself in the termination of the conflict if the british should prevail his son would be liberated but what would then be his own fate he had hitherto preserved his neutral character in the midst of trying circumstances the fact of his having a son in the royal or as it was called the regular army had very nearly brought his estates to the hammer nothing had obviated this result but the powerful interest of the relation who held a high political rank in the state and his own vigilant prudence in his heart he was a devoted loyalist and when the blushing frances had communicated to him the wishes of her lover on their return from the american camp the preceding spring the consent he had given to her future union with a rebel was as much extracted by the increasing necessity which existed for his obtaining republican support as by any considerations for the happiness of his child should his son now be rescued he would in the public mind be united with him as a plotter against the freedom of the states and should he remain a captive and undergo the impending trial the consequences might be still more dreadful much as he loved his wealth mr wharton loved his children better and he sat gazing on the movements without with a listless vacancy in his countenance that fully denoted his imbecility of character far different were the feelings of the son captain wharton had been left in the keeping of two dragoons one of whom marched to and fro on the piazza with a measured tread and the other had been directed to continue in the same apartment with his prisoner the young man had witnessed all the movements of dunwoodie with admiration mingled with fearful anticipations of the consequences to friends he particularly disliked the ambush of the detachment under lawton who could be distinctly seen from the windows of the cottage cooling his impatience by pacing on foot the ground in front of his men henry wharton threw several hasty and inquiring glances around to see if no means of liberation would offer but invariably found the eyes of his sentinel fixed on him with the watchfulness of an argus he longed with the ardor of youth to join in the glorious fray but was compelled to remain a dissatisfied spectator of a scene in which he would so cheerfully have been an actor miss peyton and sarah continued gazing on the preparations with varied emotions in which concern for the fate of the captain formed the most prominent feeling until the moment of shedding of blood seemed approaching when with the timidity of their sex they sought the retirement of an inner room not so frances she returned to the apartment where she had left dunwoodie and from one of its windows had been a deeply interested spectator of all his movements the wheelings of the troops the deadly preparations had all been unnoticed she saw her lover only and with mingled emotions of admiration and dread that nearly chilled her at one moment the blood rushed to her heart as she saw the young warrior riding through his ranks giving life and courage to all whom he addressed and the next it curdled with the thought that the very gallantry she so much valued might prove the means of placing the grave between her and the object of her regard frances gazed until she could look no longer  in a field on the left of the cottage and at a short distance in the rear of the troops was a small group whose occupation seemed to differ from that of all around them they were in number only three being two men and a mulatto boy the principal personage of this party was a man whose leanness made his really tall stature appear excessive he wore spectacleswas unarmed had dismounted and seemed to be dividing his attention between a cigar a book and the incidents of the field before him to this party frances determined to send a note directed to dunwoodie she wrote hastily with a pencil come to me peyton if it be but for a moment and caesar emerged from the cellar kitchen taking the precaution to go by the rear of the building to avoid the sentinel on the piazza who had very cavalierly ordered all the family to remain housed the black delivered the note to the gentleman with a request that it might be forwarded to major dunwoodie it was the surgeon of the horse to whom caesar addressed himself and the teeth of the african chattered as he saw displayed upon the ground the several instruments which were in preparation for the anticipated operations the doctor himself seemed to view the arrangement with great satisfaction as he deliberately raised his eyes from his book to order the boy to convey the note to his commanding officer and then dropping them quietly on the page he continued his occupation caesar was slowly retiring as the third personage who by his dress might be an inferior assistant of the surgical department coolly inquired if he would have a leg taken off this question seemed to remind the black of the existence of those limbs for he made such use of them as to reach the piazza at the same instant that major dunwoodie rode up at half speed the brawny sentinel squared himself and poised his sword with military precision as he stood on his post while his officer passed but no sooner had the door closed than turning to the negro he said sharply  harkee blackee if you quit the house again without my knowledge i shall turn barber and shave off one of those ebony ears with this razor  thus assailed in another member caesar hastily retreated into his kitchen muttering something in which the words skinner and rebel rascal formed a principal part of speech  major dunwoodie said frances to her lover as he entered i may have done you injustice if i have appeared harsh  the emotions of the agitated girl prevailed and she burst into tears  frances cried the soldier with warmth you are never harsh never unjust but when you doubt my love  ah dunwoodie added the sobbing girl you are about to risk your life in battle remember that there is one heart whose happiness is built on your safety brave i know you are be prudent  for your sake inquired the delighted youth  for my sake replied frances in a voice barely audible and dropping on his bosom  dunwoodie folded her to his heart and was about to speak as a trumpet sounded in the southern end of the vale imprinting one long kiss of affection on her unresisting lips the soldier tore himself from his mistress and hastened to the scene of strife  frances threw herself on a sofa buried her head under its cushion and with her shawl drawn over her face to exclude as much of sound as possible continued there until the shouts of the combatants the rattling of the firearms and the thundering tread of the horses had ceased     chapter vii       the games afoot     follow your spirit                      shakespeare  the rough and unimproved face of the country the frequency of covers together with the great distance from their own country and the facilities afforded them for rapid movements to the different points of the war by the undisputed command of the ocean had united to deter the english from employing a heavy force in cavalry in their early efforts to subdue the revolted colonies  only one regiment of regular horse was sent from the mother country during the struggle but legions and independent corps were formed in different places as it best accorded with the views of the royal commanders or suited the exigency of the times these were not unfrequently composed of men raised in the colonies and at other times drafts were had from the regiments of the line and the soldiers were made to lay aside the musket and bayonet and taught to wield the saber and carbine one particular body of the subsidiary troops was included in this arrange ment and the hessian yagers were transformed into a corps of heavy and inactive horse  opposed to them were the hardiest spirits of america most of the cavalry regiments of the continental army were led and officered by gentlemen from the south the high and haughty courage of the commanders had communicated itself to the privates who were men selected with care and great attention to the service they were intended to perform  while the british were confined to their empty conquests in the possession of a few of the larger towns or marched through counties that were swept of everything like military supplies the light troops of their enemies had the range of the whole interior  the sufferings of the line of the american army were great beyond example but possessing the power and feeling themselves engaged in a cause which justified severity the cavalry officers were vigilant in providing for their wants and the horse were well mounted well fed and consequently eminently effective perhaps the world could not furnish more brave enterprising and resistless corps of light cavalry than a few that were in the continental service at the time of which we write  dunwoodies men had often tried their prowess against the enemy and they now sat panting to be led once more against foes whom they seldom charged in vain their wishes were soon to be gratified for their commander had scarcely time to regain his seat in the saddle before a body of the enemy came sweeping round the base of the hill which intersected the view to the south a few minutes enabled the major to distinguish their character in one troop he saw the green coats of the cowboys and in the other the leathern helmets and wooden saddles of the yagers their numbers were about equal to the body under his immediate orders  on reaching the open space near the cottage of harvey birch the enemy halted and drew up his men in line evi dently making preparations for a charge at this moment a column of foot appeared in the vale and pressed forward to the bank of the brook we have already mentioned  major dunwoodie was not less distinguished by coolness and judgment than where occasion offered by his dauntless intrepidity he at once saw his advantage and determined to profit by it the column he led began slowly to retire from the field when the youthful german who commanded the enemys horse fearful of missing an easy conquest gave the word to charge few troops were more hardy than the cowboys they sprang eagerly forward in the pursuit with a confidence created by the retiring foe and the column in their rear the hessians followed more slowly but in better order the trumpets of the virginians now sounded long and lively they were answered by a strain from the party in ambush that went to the hearts of their enemies the column of dunwoodie wheeled in perfect order opened and as the word to charge was given the troops of lawton emerged from their cover with their leader in advance waving his saber over his head and shouting in a voice that was heard above the clangor of the martial music  the charge threatened too much for the refugee troop they scattered in every direction flying from the field as fast as their horses the chosen beasts of westchester could carry them only a few were hurt but such as did meet the arms of their avenging countrymen never survived the blow to tell who struck it it was upon the poor vassals of the german tyrant that the shock fell disciplined to the most exact obedience these illfated men met the charge bravely but they were swept before the mettled horses and nervous arms of their antagonists like chaff before the wind many of them were literally ridden down and dunwoodie soon saw the field without an opposing foe the proximity of the infantry prevented pursuit and behind its column the few hessians who escaped unhurt sought protection  the more cunning refugees dispersed in small bands taking various and devious routes back to their old station in front of harlem many was the sufferer in cattle furniture and person that was created by this rout for the dispersion of a troop of cowboys was only the extension of an evil  such a scene could not be expected to be acted so near them and the inmates of the cottage take no interest in the result in truth the feelings it excited pervaded every bosom from the kitchen to the parlor terror and horror had prevented the ladies from being spectators but they did not feel the less frances continued lying in the posture we have mentioned offering up fervent and incoherent petitions for the safety of her countrymen although in her inmost heart she had personified her nation by the graceful image of peyton dunwoodie her aunt and sister were less exclusive in their devotions but sarah began to feel as the horrors of war were thus brought home to her senses less pleasure in her anticipated triumphs  the inmates of mr whartons kitchen were four namely caesar and his spouse their granddaughter a jetblack damsel of twenty and the boy before alluded to the blacks were the remnants of a race of negroes which had been entailed on his estate from mr whartons maternal ancestors who were descended from the early dutch colonists time depravity and death had reduced them to this small number and the boy who was white had been added by miss peyton to the establishment as an assistant to perform the ordinary services of a footman caesar after first using the precaution to place himself under the cover of an angle in the wall for a screen against any roving bullet which might be traversing the air became an amused spectator of the skirmish the sentinel on the piazza was at the distance of but a few feet from him and he entered into the spirit of the chase with all the ardor of a tried bloodhound he noticed the approach of the black and his judicious position with a smile of contempt as he squared himself towards the enemy offering his unprotected breast to any dangers which might come  after considering the arrangement of caesar for a moment with ineffable disdain the dragoon said with great coolness  you seem very careful of that beautiful person of yours mr blueskin  a bullet hurt a colored man as much as a white muttered the black surlily casting a glance of much satisfaction at his rampart  suppose i make the experiment returned the sentinel as he spoke he deliberately drew a pistol from his belt and leveled it at the black caesars teeth chattered at the appearance of the dragoon although he believed nothing serious was intended at this moment the column of dunwoodie began to retire and the royal cavalry commenced their charge  there mister lighthorseman said caesar eagerly who believed the americans were retiring in earnest why you rebels dont fightseesee how king georges men make major dunwoodie run good gentleman too but he dont like to fight a riglar  damn your regulars cried the other fiercely wait a minute blackey and youll see captain jack lawton come out from behind yonder hill and scatter these cowboys like wild geese whove lost their leader  caesar supposed the party under lawton to have sought the shelter of the hill from motives similar to that which had induced him to place the wall between himself and the battle ground but the fact soon verified the troopers prophecy and the black witnessed with consternation the total rout of the royal horse  the sentinel manifested his exultation at the success of his comrades with loud shouts which soon brought his companion who had been left in the more immediate charge of henry wharton to the open window of the parlor  see tom see cried the delighted trooper how captain lawton makes that hessians leather cap fly and now the major has killed the officers horsezounds why didnt he kill the dutchman and save the horse  a few pistols were discharged at the flying cowboys and a spent bullet broke a pane of glass within a few feet of caesar imitating the posture of the great tempter of our race the black sought the protection of the inside of the building and immediately ascended to the parlor  the lawn in front of the locusts was hidden from the view of the road by a close line of shrubbery and the horses of the two dragoons had been left linked together under its shelter to await the movements of their masters  at this moment two cowboys who had been cut off from a retreat to their own party rode furiously through the gate with an intention of escaping to the open wood in the rear of the cottage  the victorious americans pressed the retreating germans until they had driven them under the protection of the fire of the infantry and feeling themselves in the privacy of the lawn relieved from any immediate danger the predatory warriors yielded to a temptation that few of the corps were ever known to resistopportunity and horseflesh with a hardihood and presence of mind that could only exist from long practice in similar scenes they made towards their intended prizes by an almost spontaneous movement they were busily engaged in separating the fastenings of the horses when the trooper on the piazza discharged his pistols and rushed sword in hand to the rescue  the entrance of caesar into the parlor had induced the wary dragoon within to turn his attention more closely on his prisoner but this new interruption drew him again to the window he threw his body out of the building and with dreadful imprecations endeavored by his threats and appearance to frighten the marauders from their prey the moment was enticing three hundred of his comrades were within a mile of the cottage unridden horses were running at large in every direction and henry wharton seized the unconscious sentinel by his legs and threw him headlong into the lawn caesar vanished from the room and drew a bolt of the outer door  the fall of the soldier was not great and recovering his feet he turned his fury for a moment on his prisoner to scale the window in the face of such an enemy was however impossible and on trial he found the main entrance barred  his comrade now called loudly upon him for aid and forgetful of everything else the discomfited trooper rushed to his assistance one horse was instantly liberated but the other was already fastened to the saddle of a cowboy and the four retired behind the building cutting furiously at each other with their sabers and making the air resound with their imprecations caesar threw the outer door open and pointing to the remaining horse that was quietly biting the faded herbage of the lawn he exclaimed  runnowrunmassa harry run  yes cried the youth as he vaulted into the saddle now indeed my honest fellow is the time to run he beckoned hastily to his father who stood at the window in speechless anxiety with his hands extended towards his child in the attitude of benediction and adding god bless you caesar salute the girls he dashed through the gate with the rapidity of lightning  the african watched him with anxiety as he gained the highway saw him incline to the right and riding furiously under the brow of some rocks which on that side rose perpendicularly disappear behind a projection which soon hid him from view  the delighted caesar closed the door pushing bolt after bolt and turning the key until it would turn no more soliloquizing the whole time on the happy escape of his young master  how well he rideteach him good deal myselfsalute a young ladymiss fanny wouldnt let old colored man kiss a red cheek  when the fortune of the day was decided and the time arrived for the burial of the dead two cowboys and a virginian were found in the rear of the locusts to be included in the number  happily for henry wharton the searching eyes of his captors were examining through a pocket glass the column of infantry that still held its position on the bank of the stream while the remnants of the hessian yagers were seeking its friendly protection his horse was of the best blood of virginia and carried him with the swiftness of the wind along the valley and the heart of the youth was already beating tumultuously with pleasure at his deliverance when a wellknown voice reached his startled ear crying aloud  bravely done captain dont spare the whip and turn to your left before you cross the brook  wharton turned his head in surprise and saw sitting on the point of a jutting rock that commanded a birdseye view of the valley his former guide harvey birch his pack much diminished in size lay at the feet of the peddler who waved his hat to the youth exultingly as the latter flew by him the english captain took the advice of this mysterious being and finding a good road which led to the highway that intersected the valley turned down its direction and was soon opposite to his friends the next minute he crossed the bridge and stopped his charger before his old acquaintance colonel wellmere  captain wharton exclaimed the astonished commander of the english troops dressed in mohair and mounted on a rebel dragoon horse are you from the clouds in this attire and in such a style  thank god cried the youth recovering his breath i am safe and have escaped from the hands of my enemies but five minutes since and i was a prisoner and threatened with the gallows  the gallows captain wharton surely those traitors to the king would never dare to commit another murder in cold blood is it not enough that they took the life of andre wherefore did they threaten you with a similar fate  under the pretense of a similar offense said the captain briefly explaining to the group of listeners the manner of his capture the grounds of his personal apprehensions and the method of his escape by the time he had concluded his narration the fugitive germans were collected in the rear of the column of infantry and colonel wellmere cried aloud  from my soul i congratulate you my brave friend mercy is a quality with which these traitors are unacquainted and you are doubly fortunate in escaping from their hands uninjured prepare yourself to grant me your assistance and i will soon afford you a noble revenge  i do not think there was danger of personal outrage to any man colonel wellmere from a party that major dunwoodie commands returned young wharton with a slight glow on his face his character is above the imputation of such an offense neither do i think it altogether prudent to cross this brook into the open plain in the face of those virginian horse flushed as they must be with the success they have just obtained  do you call the rout of those irregulars and these sluggish hessians a deed to boast of said the other with a contemptuous smile you speak of the affair captain wharton as if your boasted mr dunwoodie for major he is none had discomfited the bodyguards of your king  and i must be allowed to say colonel wellmere that if the bodyguards of my king were in yon field they would meet a foe that it would be dangerous to despise sir my boasted mr dunwoodie is the pride of washingtons army as a cavalry officer cried henry with warmth  dunwoodie dunwoodie repeated the colonel slowly surely i have met the gentleman before  i have been told you once saw him for a moment at the town residence of my sisters replied wharton with a lurking smile  ah i do remember me of such a youth and does the most potent congress of these rebellious colonies intrust their soldiers to the leading of such a warrior  ask the commander of yon hessian horse whether he thinks major dunwoodie worthy of the confidence  colonel wellmere was far from wanting that kind of pride which makes a man bear himself bravely in the presence of his enemies he had served in america a long time without ever meeting with any but new raised levies or the militia of the country these would sometimes fight and that fearlessly but they as often chose to run away without pulling a trigger he was too apt to judge from externals and thought it impossible for men whose gaiters were so clean whose tread so regular and who wheeled with so much accuracy to be beaten in addition to all these they were englishmen and their success was certain colonel wellmere had never been kept much in the field or these notions which he had brought with him from home and which had been greatly increased by the vaporing of a garrisoned town would have long since vanished he listened to the warm reply of captain wharton with a supercilious smile and then inquired  you would not have us retire sir before these boasted horsemen without doing something that may deprive them of part of the glory which you appear to think they have gained  i would have you advised colonel wellmere of the danger you are about to encounter  danger is but an unseemly word for a soldier continued the british commander with a sneer  and one as little dreaded by the 60th as any corps who wear the royal livery cried henry wharton fiercely give but the word to charge and let our actions speak  now again i know my young friend cried wellmere soothingly but if you have anything to say before we fight that can in any manner help us in our attack well listen you know the force of the rebels are there more of them in ambush  yes replied the youth chafing still under the others sneers in the skirt of this wood on our right are a small party of foot their horse are all before you  where they will not continue long cried wellmere turning to the few officers around him gentlemen we will cross the stream in column and deploy on the plain beyond or else we shall not be able to entice these valiant yankees within the reach of our muskets captain wharton i claim your assistance as an aiddecamp  the youth shook his head in disapprobation of a movement which his good sense taught him was rash but prepared with alacrity to perform his duty in the impending trial  during this conversation which was held at a small distance in advance of the british column and in full view of the americans dunwoodie had been collecting his scattered troops securing his few prisoners and retiring to the ground where he had been posted at the first appearance of his enemy satisfied with the success he had already obtained and believing the english too wary to give him an opportunity of harassing them further he was about to withdraw the guides and leaving a strong party on the ground to watch the movements of the regulars to fall back a few miles to a favorable place for taking up his quarters for the night captain lawton was reluctantly listening to the reasoning of his commander and had brought out his favorite glass to see if no opening could be found for an advantageous attack when he suddenly exclaimed  hows this a bluecoat among those scarlet gentry as i hope to live to see old virginia it is my masquerading friend of the 6oth the handsome captain wharton escaped from two of my best men  he had not done speaking when the survivor of these heroes joined his troop bringing with him his own horse and those of the cowboys he reported the death of his comrade and the escape of his prisoner as the deceased was the immediate sentinel over the person of young wharton and the other was not to be blamed for defending the horses which were more particularly under his care his captain heard him with uneasiness but without anger  this intelligence made an entire change in the views of major dunwoodie he saw at once that his own reputation was involved in the escape of his prisoner the order to recall the guides was countermanded and he now joined his second in command watching as eagerly as the impetuous lawton himself for some opening to assail his foe to advantage  but two hours before and dunwoodie had felt the chance which made henry wharton his captive as the severest blow he had ever sustained now he panted for an opportunity in which by risking his own life he might recapture his friend all other considerations were lost in the goadings of a wounded spirit and he might have soon emulated lawton in hardihood had not wellmere and his troops at this moment crossed the brook into the open plain  there cried the delighted captain as he pointed out the movement with his finger there comes john bull into the mousetrap and with eyes wide open  surely said dunwoodie eagerly he will not deploy his column on that flat wharton must tell him of the ambush but if he does  we will not leave him a dozen sound skins in his battalion interrupted the other springing into his saddle  the truth was soon apparent for the english column after advancing for a short distance on the level land deployed with an accuracy that would have done them honor on a field day in their own hyde park  prepare to mountmount cried dunwoodie the last word being repeated by lawton in a tone that rang in the ears of caesar who stood at the open window of the cottage the black recoiled in dismay having lost all his confidence in captain lawtons timidity for he thought he yet saw him emerging from his cover and waving his sword on high  as the british line advanced slowly and in exact order the guides opened a galling fire it began to annoy that part of the royal troops which was nearest to them wellmere listened to the advice of the veteran who was next to him in rank and ordered two companies to dislodge the american foot from their hiding place the movement created a slight confusion and dunwoodie seized the opportunity to charge no ground could be more favorable for the maneuvers of horse and the attack of the virginians was irresistible it was aimed chiefly at the bank opposite to the wood in order to clear the americans from the fire of their friends who were concealed and it was completely successful wellmere who was on the left of his line was overthrown by the impetuous fury of his assailants dunwoodie was in time to save him from the impending blow of one of his men and raised him from the ground had him placed on a horse and delivered to the custody of his orderly the officer who had suggested the attack upon the guides had been intrusted with its execution but the menace was sufficient for these irregulars in fact their duty was performed and they retired along the skirt of the wood with intent to regain their horses which had been left under a guard at the upper end of the valley  the left of the british line was outflanked by the americans who doubled in their rear and thus made the rout in that quarter total but the second in command perceiving how the battle went promptly wheeled his party and threw in a heavy fire on the dragoons as they passed him to the charge with this party was henry wharton who had volunteered to assist in dispersing the guides a ball struck his bridle arm and compelled him to change hands as the dragoons dashed by them rending the air with their shouts and with trumpets sounding a lively strain the charger ridden by the youth became ungovernablehe plunged reared and his rider being unable with his wounded arm to manage the impatient animal henry wharton found himself in less than a minute unwillingly riding by the side of captain lawton the dragoon comprehended at a glance the ludicrous situation of his new comrade but had only time to cry aloud before they plunged into the english line  the horse knows the righteous cause better than his rider captain wharton you are welcome to the ranks of freedom  no time was lost however by lawton after the charge was completed in securing his prisoner again and perceiving him to be hurt he directed him to be conveyed to the rear  the virginian troopers dealt out their favors with no gentle hands on that part of the royal foot who were thus left in a great measure at their mercy dunwoodie observing that the remnant of the hessians had again ventured on the plain led on in pursuit and easily overtaking their light and halffed horses soon destroyed the remainder of the detachment  in the meanwhile great numbers of the english taking advantage of the smoke and confusion in the field were enabled to get in the rear of the body of their countrymen which still preserved its order in a line parallel to the wood but which had been obliged to hold its fire from the fear of injuring friends as well as foes the fugitives were directed to form a second line within the wood itself and under cover of the trees this arrangement was not yet completed when captain lawton called to a youth who commanded the other troop left with that part of the force which remained on the ground and proposed charging the unbroken line of the british the proposal was as promptly accepted as it had been made and the troops were arrayed for the purpose the eagerness of their leader prevented the preparations necessary to insure success and the horse receiving a destructive fire as they advanced were thrown into additional confusion both lawton and his more juvenile comrade fell at this discharge fortunately for the credit of the virginians major dunwoodie reentered the field at this critical instant he saw his troops in disorder at his feet lay weltering in blood george singleton a youth endeared to him by numberless virtues and lawton was unhorsed and stretched on the plain the eye of the youthful warrior flashed fire riding between this squadron and the enemy in a voice that reached the hearts of his dragoons he recalled them to their duty his presence and word acted like magic the clamor of voices ceased the line was formed promptly and with exactitude the charge sounded and led on by their commander the virginians swept across the plain with an impetuosity that nothing could withstand and the field was instantly cleared of the enemy those who were not destroyed sought a shelter in the woods dunwoodie slowly withdrew from the fire of the english who were covered by the trees and commenced the painful duty of collecting his dead and wounded  the sergeant charged with conducting henry wharton to a place where he might procure surgical aid set about performing his duty with alacrity in order to return as soon as possible to the scene of strife they had not reached the middle of the plain before the captain noticed a man whose appearance and occupation forcibly arrested his attention his head was bald and bare but a wellpowdered wig was to be seen halfconcealed in the pocket of his breeches his coat was off and his arms were naked to the elbow blood had disfigured much of his dress and his hands and even face bore this mark of his profession in his mouth was a cigar in his right hand some instruments of strange formation and in his left the remnants of an apple with which he occasionally relieved the duty of the beforementioned cigar he was standing lost in the contemplation of a hessian who lay breathless before him at a little distance were three or four of the guides leaning on their muskets and straining their eyes in the direction of the combatants and at his elbow stood a man who from the implements in his hand seemed an assistant  there sir is the doctor said the attendant of henry very coolly he will patch up your arm in the twinkling of an eye and beckoning to the guides to approach he whispered and pointed to his prisoner and then galloped furiously towards his comrades  wharton advanced to the side of this strange figure and observing himself to be unnoticed was about to request his assistance when the other broke silence in a soliloquy  now i know this man to have been killed by captain lawton as well as if i had seen him strike the blow how often have i strove to teach him the manner in which he can disable his adversary without destroying life it is cruel thus unnecessarily to cut off the human race and furthermore such blows as these render professional assistance unnecessary it is in a measure treating the lights of science with disrespect  if sir your leisure will admit said henry wharton i must beg your attention to a slight hurt  ah cried the other starting and examining him from head to foot you are from the field below is there much business there sir  indeed answered henry accepting the offer of the surgeon to assist in removing his coat tis a stirring time  stirring repeated the surgeon busily employed with his dressings you give me great pleasure sir for so long as they can stir there must be life and while there is life you know there is hope but here my art is of no use i did put in the brains of one patient but i rather think the man must have been dead before i saw him it is a curious case sir i will take you to see itonly across the fence there where you may perceive so many bodies together ah the ball has glanced around the bone without shattering it you are fortunate in falling into the hands of an old practitioner or you might have lost this limb  indeed said henry with a slight uneasiness i did not apprehend the injury to be so serious  oh the hurt is not bad but you have such a pretty arm for an operation the pleasure of the thing might have tempted a novice  the devil cried the captain can there be any pleasure in mutilating a fellow creature  sir said the surgeon with gravity a scientific amputation is a very pretty operation and doubtless might tempt a younger man in the hurry of business to overlook all the particulars of the case  further conversation was interrupted by the appearance of the dragoons slowly marching towards their former halting place and new applications from the slightly wounded soldiers who now came riding in making hasty demands on the skill of the doctor  the guides took charge of wharton and with a heavy heart the young man retraced his steps to his fathers cottage  the english had lost in the several charges about one third of their foot but the remainder were rallied in the wood and dunwoodie perceiving them to be too strongly posted to assail had left a strong party with captain lawton with orders to watch their motions and to seize every opportunity to harass them before they reëmbarked  intelligence had reached the major of another party being out by the way of the hudson and his duty required that he should hold himself in readiness to defeat the intentions of these also captain lawton received his orders with strong injunctions to make no assault on the foe unless a favorable chance should offer  the injury received by this officer was in the head being stunned by a glancing bullet and parting with a laughing declaration from the major that if he again forgot himself they should all think him more materially hurt each took his own course  the british were a light party without baggage that had been sent out to destroy certain stores understood to be collecting for the use of the american army they now retired through the woods to the heights and keeping the route along their summits in places unassailable by cavalry commenced a retreat to their boats     chapter viii        with fire and sword the country round        was wasted far and wide      and many a childing mother then        and newborn infant died      but things like these you know must be        at every famous victory                                             southey  the last sounds of the combat died on the ears of the anxious listeners in the cottage and were succeeded by the stillness of suspense frances had continued by herself striving to exclude the uproar and vainly endeavoring to summon resolution to meet the dreaded result the ground where the charge on the foot had taken place was but a short mile from the locusts and in the intervals of the musketry the cries of the soldiers had even reached the ears of its inhabitants after witnessing the escape of his son mr wharton had joined his sister and eldest daughter in their retreat and the three continued fearfully waiting for news from the field unable longer to remain under the painful uncertainty of her situation frances soon added herself to the uneasy group and caesar was directed to examine into the state of things without and report on whose banners victory had alighted the father now briefly related to his astonished children the circumstance and manner of their brothers escape they were yet in the freshness of their surprise when the door opened and captain wharton attended by a couple of the guides and followed by the black stood before them  henrymy son my son cried the agitated parent stretching out his arms yet unable to rise from his seat what is it i see are you again a captive and in danger of your life  the better fortune of these rebels has prevailed said the youth endeavoring to force a cheerful smile and taking a hand of each of his distressed sisters i strove nobly for my liberty but the perverse spirit of rebellion has even lighted on their horses the steed i mounted carried me greatly against my will i acknowledge into the very center of dunwoodies men  and you were again captured continued the father casting a fearful glance on the armed attendants who had entered the room  that sir you may safely say this mr lawton who sees so far had me in custody again immediately  why you no hold em in massa henry cried caesar pettishly  that said wharton smiling was a thing easier said than done mr caesar especially as these gentlemen glancing his eyes at the guides had seen proper to deprive me of the use of my better arm  wounded exclaimed both sisters in a breath  a mere scratch but disabling me at a most critical moment continued the brother kindly and stretching out the injured limb to manifest the truth of his declaration caesar threw a look of bitter animosity on the irregular warriors who were thought to have had an agency in the deed and left the room a few more words sufficed to explain all that captain wharton knew relative to the fortune of the day the result he thought yet doubtful for when he left the ground the virginians were retiring from the field of battle  they had treed the squirrel said one of the sentinels abruptly and didnt quit the ground without leaving a good hound for the chase when he comes down  aye added his comrade dryly im thinking captain lawton will count the noses of what are left before they see their whaleboats  frances had stood supporting herself by the back of a chair during this dialogue catching in breathless anxiety every syllable as it was uttered her color changed rapidly her limbs shook under her until with desperate resolution she inquired  is any officer hurt ontheon either side  yes answered the man cavalierly these southern youths are so full of mettle that its seldom we fight but one or two gets knocked over one of the wounded who came up before the troops told me that captain singleton was killed and major dunwoodie  frances heard no more but fell lifeless in the chair behind her the attention of her friends soon revived her when the captain turning to the man said fearfully  surely major dunwoodie is unhurt  never fear him added the guide disregarding the agitation of the family they say a man who is born to be hanged will never be drowned if a bullet could kill the major he would have been dead long ago i was going to say that the major is in a sad taking because of the captains being killed but had i known how much store the lady set by him i wouldnt have been so plainspoken  frances now rose quickly from her seat with cheeks glowing with confusion and leaning on her aunt was about to retire when dunwoodie himself appeared the first emotion of the agitated girl was unalloyed happiness in the next instant she shrank back appalled from the unusual expression that reigned in his countenance the sternness of battle yet sat on his brow his eye was fixed and severe the smile of affection that used to lighten his dark features on meeting his mistress was supplanted by the lowering look of care his whole soul seemed to be absorbed in one engrossing emotion and he proceeded at once to his object  mr wharton he earnestly began in times like these we need not stand on idle ceremony one of my officers i am afraid is hurt mortally and presuming on your hospitality i have brought him to your door  i am happy sir that you have done so said mr wharton at once perceiving the importance of conciliating the american troops the necessitous are always welcome and doubly so in being the friend of major dunwoodie  sir i thank you for myself and in behalf of him who is unable to render you his thanks returned the other hastily if you please we will have him conducted where the surgeon may see and report upon his case without delay to this there could be no objection and frances felt a chill at her heart as her lover withdrew without casting a solitary look on herself  there is a devotedness in female love that admits of no rivalry all the tenderness of the heart all the powers of the imagination are enlisted in behalf of the tyrant passion and where all is given much is looked for in return frances had spent hours of anguish of torture on account of dunwoodie and he now met her without a smile and left her without a greeting the ardor of her feelings was unabated but the elasticity of her hopes was weakened as the supporters of the nearly lifeless body of dunwoodies friend passed her in their way to the apartment prepared for his reception she caught a view of this seeming rival  his pale and ghastly countenance sunken eye and difficult breathing gave her a glimpse of death in its most fearful form dunwoodie was by his side and held his hand giving frequent and stern injunctions to the men to proceed with care and in short manifesting all the solicitude that the most tender friendship could on such an occasion inspire frances moved lightly before them and with an averted face she held open the door for their passage to the bed it was only as the major touched her garments on entering the room that she ventured to raise her mild blue eyes to his face but the glance was unreturned and frances unconsciously sighed as she sought the solitude of her own apartment  captain wharton voluntarily gave a pledge to his keepers not to attempt again escaping and then proceeded to execute those duties on behalf of his father which were thought necessary in a host on entering the passage for that purpose he met the operator who had so dexterously dressed his arm advancing to the room of the wounded officer  ah cried the disciple of aesculapius i see you are doing well but stop have you a pin no here i have one you must keep the cold air from your hurt or some of the youngsters will be at work at you yet  god forbid muttered the captain in an undertone attentively adjusting the bandages when dunwoodie appeared at the door impatiently crying aloud  hasten sitgreaves hasten or george singleton will die from loss of blood  what singleton god forbid bless meis it georgepoor little george exclaimed the surgeon as he quickened his pace with evident concern and hastened to the side of the bed he is alive though and while there is life there is hope this is the first serious case i have had today where the patient was not already dead captain lawton teaches his men to strike with so little discretionpoor georgebless me it is a musket bullet  the youthful sufferer turned his eyes on the man of science and with a faint smile endeavored to stretch forth his hand there was an appeal in the look and action that touched the heart of the operator the surgeon removed his spectacles to wipe an unusual moisture from his eyes and proceeded carefully to the discharge of his duty while the previous arrangements were however making he gave vent in some measure to his feelings by saying  when it is only a bullet i have always some hopes there is a chance that it hits nothing vital but bless me captain lawtons men cut so at randomgenerally sever the jugular or the carotid artery or let out the brains and all are so difficult to remedythe patient mostly dying before one can get at him i never had success but once in replacing a mans brains although i have tried three this very day it is easy to tell where lawtons troops charge in a battle they cut so at random  the group around the bed of captain singleton were too much accustomed to the manner of their surgeon to regard or to reply to his soliloquy but they quietly awaited the moment when he was to commence his examination this now took place and dunwoodie stood looking the operator in the face with an expression that seemed to read his soul the patient shrank from the application of the probe and a smile stole over the features of the surgeon as he muttered  there has been nothing before it in that quarter he now applied himself in earnest to his work took off his spectacles and threw aside his wig all this time dunwoodie stood in feverish silence holding one of the hands of the sufferer in both his own watching the countenance of doctor sitgreaves at length singleton gave a slight groan and the surgeon rose with alacrity and said aloud  ah there is some pleasure in following a bullet it may be said to meander through the human body injuring nothing vital but as for captain lawtons men  speak interrupted dunwoodie is there hopecan you find the ball  its no difficult matter to find that which one has in his hand major dunwoodie replied the surgeon coolly preparing his dressings it took what that literal fellow captain lawton calls a circumbendibus a route never taken by the swords of his men notwithstanding the multiplied pains i have been at to teach him how to cut scientifically now i saw a horse this day with his head half severed from his body  that said dunwoodie as the blood rushed to his cheeks again and his dark eyes sparkled with the rays of hope was some of my handiwork i killed that horse myself  you exclaimed the surgeon dropping his dressings in surprise you but you knew it was a horse  i had such suspicions i own said the major smiling and holding a beverage to the lips of his friend  such blows alighting on the human frame are fatal continued the doctor pursuing his business they set at naught the benefits which flow from the lights of science they are useless in a battle for disabling your foe is all that is required i have sat major dunwoodie many a cold hour while captain lawton has been engaged and after all my expectation not a single case worth recording has occurredall scratches or death wounds ah the saber is a sad weapon in unskillful hands yes major dunwoodie many are the hours i have thrown away in endeavoring to impress this truth on captain john lawton  the impatient major pointed silently to his friend and the surgeon quickened his movements  ah poor george it is a narrow chance buthe was interrupted by a messenger requiring the presence of the commanding officer in the field dunwoodie pressed the hand of his friend and beckoned the doctor to follow him as he withdrew  what think you he whispered on reaching the passage will he live  he will  thank god cried the youth hastening below  dunwoodie for a moment joined the family who were now collecting in the ordinary parlor his face was no longer wanting in smiles and his salutations though hasty were cordial he took no notice of the escape and capture of henry wharton but seemed to think the young man had continued where he had left him before the encounter on the ground they had not met the english officer withdrew in haughty silence to a window leaving the major uninterrupted to make his communications  the excitement produced by the events of the day in the youthful feelings of the sisters had been succeeded by a languor that kept them both silent and dunwoodie held his discourse with miss peyton  is there any hope my cousin that your friend can survive his wound said the lady advancing towards her kinsman with a smile of benevolent regard  everything my dear madam everything answered the soldier cheerfully sitgreaves says he will live and he has never deceived me  your pleasure is not much greater than my own at this intelligence one so dear to major dunwoodie cannot fail to excite an interest in the bosom of his friends  say one so deservedly dear madam returned the major with warmth he is the beneficent spirit of the corps equally beloved by us all so mild so equal so just so generous with the meekness of a lamb and the fondness of a doveit is only in the hour of battle that singleton is a lion  you speak of him as if he were your mistress major dunwoodie observed the smiling spinster glancing her eye at her niece who sat pale and listening in a corner of the room  i love him as one cried the excited youth but he requires care and nursing all now depends on the attention he receives  trust me sir he will want for nothing under this roof  pardon me dear madam you are all that is benevolent but singleton requires a care which many men would feel to be irksome it is at moments like these and in sufferings like this that the soldier most finds the want of female tenderness as he spoke he turned his eyes on frances with an expression that again thrilled to the heart of his mistress she rose from her seat with burning cheeks and said  all the attention that can with propriety be given to a stranger will be cheerfully bestowed on your friend  ah cried the major shaking his head that cold word propriety will kill him he must be fostered cherished soothed  these are offices for a sister or a wife  a sister repeated the soldier the blood rushing to his own face tumultuously a sister he has a sister and one that might be here with tomorrows sun he paused mused in silence glanced his eyes uneasily at frances and muttered in an undertone singleton requires it and it must be done  the ladies had watched his varying countenance in some surprise and miss peyton now observed that  if there were a sister of captain singleton near them her presence would be gladly requested both by herself and nieces  it must be madam it cannot well be otherwise replied dunwoodie with a hesitation that but ill agreed with his former declarations she shall be sent for express this very night and then as if willing to change the subject he approached captain wharton and continued mildly  henry wharton to me honor is dearer than life but in your hands i know it can safely be confided remain here unwatched until we leave the county which will not be for some days  the distance in the manner of the english officer vanished and taking the offered hand of the other he replied with warmth your generous confidence peyton will not be abused even though the gibbet on which your washington hung andre be ready for my own execution  henry henry wharton said dunwoodie reproachfully you little know the man who leads our armies or you would have spared him that reproach but duty calls me without i leave you where i could wish to stay myself and where you cannot be wholly unhappy  in passing frances she received another of those smiling looks of affection she so much prized and for a season the impression made by his appearance after the battle was forgotten  among the veterans that had been impelled by the times to abandon the quiet of age for the service of their country was colonel singleton he was a native of georgia and had been for the earlier years of his life a soldier by profession when the struggle for liberty commenced he offered his services to his country and from respect to his character they had been accepted his years and health had however prevented his discharging the active duties of the field and he had been kept in command of different posts of trust where his country might receive the benefits of his vigilance and fidelity without inconvenience to himself for the last year he had been intrusted with the passes into the highlands and was now quartered with his daughter but a short days march above the valley where dunwoodie had met the enemy his only other child was the wounded officer we have mentioned thither then the major prepared to dispatch a messenger with the unhappy news of the captains situation and charged with such an invitation from the ladies as he did not doubt would speedily bring the sister to the couch of her brother  this duty performed though with an unwillingness that only could make his former anxiety more perplexing dunwoodie proceeded to the field where his troops had halted the remnant of the english were already to be seen over the tops of the trees marching along the heights towards their boats in compact order and with great watchfulness the detachment of the dragoons under lawton were a short distance on their flank eagerly awaiting a favorable moment to strike a blow in this manner both parties were soon lost to view  a short distance above the locusts was a small hamlet where several roads intersected each other and from which consequently access to the surrounding country was easy it was a favorite halting place of the horse and frequently held by the light parties of the american army during their excursions below dunwoodie had been the first to discover its advantages and as it was necessary for him to remain in the county until further orders from above it cannot be supposed he overlooked them now to this place the troops were directed to retire carrying with them their wounded parties were already employed in the sad duty of interring the dead in making these arrangements a new object of embarrassment presented itself to our young soldier in moving through the field he was struck with the appearance of colonel wellmere seated by himself brooding over his misfortunes uninterrupted by anything but the passing civilities of the american officers his anxiety on behalf of singleton had hitherto banished the recollection of his captive from the mind of dunwoodie and he now approached him with apologies for his neglect the englishman received his courtesies with coolness and complained of being injured by what he affected to think was the accidental stumbling of his horse dunwoodie who had seen one of his own men ride him down and that with very little ceremony slightly smiled as he offered him surgical assistance this could only be procured at the cottage and thither they both proceeded  colonel wellmere cried young wharton in astonishment as they entered has the fortune of war been thus cruel to you also but you are welcome to the house of my father although i could wish the introduction to have taken place under more happy circumstances  mr wharton received this new guest with the guarded caution that distinguished his manner and dunwoodie left the room to seek the bedside of his friend everything here looked propitious and he acquainted the surgeon that another patient waited his skill in the room below the sound of the word was enough to set the doctor in motion and seizing his implements of office he went in quest of this new applicant at the door of the parlor he was met by the ladies who were retiring miss peyton detained him for a moment to inquire into the welfare of captain singleton frances smiled with something of natural archness of manner as she contemplated the grotesque appearance of the baldheaded practitioner but sarah was too much agitated with the surprise of the unexpected interview with the british colonel to observe him it has already been intimated that colonel wellmere was an old acquaintance of the family sarah had been so long absent from the city that she had in some measure been banished from the remembrance of the gentleman but the recollections of sarah were more vivid there is a period in the life of every woman when she may be said to be predisposed to love it is at the happy age when infancy is lost in opening maturitywhen the guileless heart beats with those anticipations of life which the truth can never realizeand when the imagination forms images of perfection that are copied after its own unsullied visions at this happy age sarah left the city and she had brought with her a picture of futurity faintly impressed it is true but which gained durability from her solitude and in which wellmere had been placed in the foreground the surprise of the meeting had in some measure overpowered her and after receiving the salutations of the colonel she had risen in compliance with a signal from her observant aunt to withdraw  then sir observed miss peyton after listening to the surgeons account of his young patient we may be flattered with the expectation that he will recover  tis certain madam returned the doctor endeavoring out of respect to the ladies to replace his wig tis certain with care and good nursing  in those he shall not be wanting said the spinster mildly everything we have he can command and major dunwoodie has dispatched an express for his sister  his sister echoed the practitioner with a meaning look if the major has sent for her she will come  her brothers danger would induce her one would imagine  no doubt madam continued the doctor laconically bowing low and giving room to the ladies to pass the words and the manner were not lost on the younger sister in whose presence the name of dunwoodie was never mentioned unheeded  sir cried dr sitgreaves on entering the parlor addressing himself to the only coat of scarlet in the room i am advised you are in want of my aid god send tis not captain lawton with whom you came in contact in which case i may be too late  there must be some mistake sir said wellmere haughtily it was a surgeon that major dunwoodie was to send me and not an old woman  tis dr sitgreaves said henry wharton quickly though with difficulty suppressing a laugh the multitude of his engagements today has prevented his usual attention to his attire  your pardon sir added wellmere very ungraciously proceeding to lay aside his coat and exhibit what he called a wounded arm  if sir said the surgeon dryly the degrees of edinburghwalking your london hospitalsamputating some hundreds of limbsoperating on the human frame in every shape that is warranted by the lights of science a clear conscience and the commission of the continental congress can make a surgeon i am one  your pardon sir repeated the colonel stiffly captain wharton has accounted for my error  for which i thank captain wharton said the surgeon proceeding coolly to arrange his amputating instruments with a formality that made the colonels blood run cold where are you hurt sir what is it then this scratch in your shoulder in what manner might you have received this wound sir  from the sword of a rebel dragoon said the colonel with emphasis  never even the gentle george singleton would not have breathed on you so harmlessly he took a piece of sticking plaster from his pocket and applied it to the part there sir that will answer your purpose and i am certain it is all that is required of me  what do you take to be my purpose then sir  to report yourself wounded in your dispatches replied the doctor with great steadiness and you may say that an old woman dressed your hurtsfor if one did not one easily might  very extraordinary language muttered the englishman  here captain wharton interfered and by explaining the mistake of colonel wellmere to proceed from his irritated mind and pain of body he in part succeeded in mollifying the insulted practitioner who consented to look further into the hurts of the other they were chiefly bruises from his fall to which sitgreaves made some hasty applications and withdrew  the horse having taken their required refreshment prepared to fall back to their intended position and it became incumbent on dunwoodie to arrange the disposal of his prisoners sitgreaves he determined to leave in the cottage of mr wharton in attendance on captain singleton henry came to him with a request that colonel wellmere might also be left behind under his parole until the troops marched higher into the country to this the major cheerfully assented and as all the rest of the prisoners were of the vulgar herd they were speedily collected and under the care of a strong guard ordered to the interior the dragoons soon after marched and the guides separating in small parties accompanied by patrols from the horse spread themselves across the country in such a manner as to make a chain of sentinels from the waters of the sound to those of the hudson footnote the scene of this tale is between these two waters which are but a few miles from each other  dunwoodie had lingered in front of the cottage after he paid his parting compliments with an unwillingness to return that he thought proceeded from his solicitude for his wounded friends the heart which has not become callous soon sickens with the glory that has been purchased with a waste of human life peyton dunwoodie left to himself and no longer excited by the visions which youthful ardor had kept before him throughout the day began to feel there were other ties than those which bound the soldier within the rigid rules of honor he did not waver in his duty yet he felt how strong was the temptation his blood had ceased to flow with the impulse created by the battle the stern expression of his eye gradually gave place to a look of softness and his reflections on the victory brought with them no satisfaction that compensated for the sacrifices by which it had been purchased while turning his last lingering gaze on the locusts he remembered only that it contained all that he most valued the friend of his youth was a prisoner under circumstances that endangered both life and honor the gentle companion of his toils who could throw around the rude enjoyments of a soldier the graceful mildness of peace lay a bleeding victim to his success the image of the maid who had held during the day a disputed sovereignty in his bosom again rose to his view with a loveliness that banished her rival glory from his mind  the last lagging trooper of the corps had already disappeared behind the northern hill and the major unwillingly turned his horse in the same direction frances impelled by a restless inquietude now timidly ventured on the piazza of the cottage the day had been mild and clear and the sun was shining brightly in a cloudless sky the tumult which so lately disturbed the valley was succeeded by the stillness of death and the fair scene before her looked as if it had never been marred by the passions of men one solitary cloud the collected smoke of the contest hung over the field and this was gradually dispersing leaving no vestige of the conflict above the peaceful graves of its victims all the conflicting feelings all the tumultuous circumstances of the eventful day appeared like the deceptions of a troubled vision frances turned and caught a glimpse of the retreating figure of him who had been so conspicuous an actor in the scene and the illusion vanished she recognized her lover and with the truth came other recollections that drove her to the room with a heart as sad as that which dunwoodie himself bore from the valley     chapter ix        a moment gazed adown the dale      a moment snuffed the tainted gale      a moment listened to the cry      that thickened as the chase drew nigh      then as the headmost foe appeared      with one brave bound the copse he cleared      and stretching forward free and far      sought the wild heaths of uamvar                                lady of the lake  the party under captain lawton had watched the retiring foe to his boats with the most unremitting vigilance without finding any fit opening for a charge the experienced successor of colonel wellmere knew too well the power of his enemy to leave the uneven surface of the heights until compelled to descend to the level of the water before he attempted this hazardous movement he threw his men into a compact square with its outer edges bristling with bayonets in this position the impatient trooper well understood that brave men could never be assailed by cavalry with success and he was reluctantly obliged to hover near them without seeing any opportunity of stopping their slow but steady march to the beach a small schooner which had been their convoy from the city lay with her guns bearing on the place of embarkation against this combination of force and discipline lawton had sufficient prudence to see it would be folly to contend and the english were suffered to embark without molestation the dragoons lingered on the shore till the last moment and then they reluctantly commenced their own retreat back to the main body of the corps  the gathering mists of the evening had begun to darken the valley as the detachment of lawton made its reappearance at its southern extremity the march of the troops was slow and their line extended for the benefit of ease in the front rode the captain side by side with his senior subaltern apparently engaged in close conference while the rear was brought up by a young cornet humming an air and thinking of the sweets of a straw bed after the fatigues of a hard days duty  then it struck you too said the captain the instant i placed my eyes on her i remembered the face it is one not easily forgotten by my faith tom the girl does no discredit to the majors taste  she would do honor to the corps replied the lieutenant with some warmth those blue eyes might easily win a man to gentler employments than this trade of ours in sober truth i can easily imagine such a girl might tempt even me to quit the broadsword and saddle for a darningneedle and pillion  mutiny sir mutiny cried the other laughing what you tom mason dare to rival the gay admired and withal rich major dunwoodie in his love you a lieutenant of cavalry with but one horse and he none of the best whose captain is as tough as a pepperidge log and has as many lives as a cat  faith said the subaltern smiling in his turn the log may yet be split and grimalkin lose his lives if you often charge as madly as you did this morning what think you of many raps from such a beetle as laid you on your back today  ah dont mention it my good tom the thought makes my head ache replied the other shrugging up his shoulders it is what i call forestalling night  the night of death  no sir the night that follows day i saw myriads of stars things which should hide their faces in the presence of the lordly sun i do think nothing but this thick cap saved me for your comfort a little longer mauger the cats lives  i have much reason to be obliged to the cap said mason dryly that or the skull must have had a reasonable portion of thickness i admit  come come tom you are a licensed joker so ill not feign anger with you returned the captain goodhumoredly but singletons lieutenant i am fearful will fare better than yourself for this days service  i believe both of us will be spared the pain of receiving promotion purchased by the death of a comrade and friend observed mason kindly it was reported that sitgreaves said he would live  from my soul i hope so exclaimed lawton for a beardless face that boy carries the stoutest heart i have ever met with it surprises me however that as we both fell at the same instant the men behaved so well  for the compliment i might thank you cried the lieutenant with a laugh but modesty forbids i did my best to stop them but without success  stop them roared the captain would you stop men in the middle of a charge  i thought they were going the wrong way answered the subaltern  ah our fall drove them to the right about  it was either your fall or apprehensions of their own until the major rallied us we were in admirable disorder  dunwoodie the major was on the crupper of the dutchman  ah but he managed to get off the crupper of the dutchman he came in at half speed with the other two troops and riding between us and the enemy with that imperative way he has when roused brought us in line in the twinkling of an eye then it was added the lieutenant with animation that we sent john bull to the bushes oh it was a sweet chargeheads and tails until we were upon them  the devil what a sight i missed  you slept through it all  yes returned the other with a sigh it was all lost to me and poor george singleton but tom what will georges sister say to this fairhaired maiden in yonder white building  hang herself in her garters said the subaltern i owe a proper respect to my superiors but two such angels are more than justly falls to the share of one man unless he be a turk or a hindoo  yes yes said the captain quickly the major is ever preaching morality to the youngsters but he is a sly fellow in the main do you observe how fond he is of the cross roads above this valley now if i were to halt the troops twice in the same place you would all swear there was a petticoat in the wind  you are well known to the corps  well tom a slanderous propensity is incurablebut stretching forward his body in the direction he was gazing as if to aid him in distinguishing objects through the darkness what animal is moving through the field on our right  tis a man said mason looking intently at the suspicious object  by his hump tis a dromedary added the captain eying it keenly wheeling his horse suddenly from the highway he exclaimed harvey birchtake him dead or alive  mason and a few of the leading dragoons only understood the sudden cry but it was heard throughout the line a dozen of the men with the lieutenant at their head followed the impetuous lawton and their speed threatened the pursued with a sudden termination of the race  birch prudently kept his position on the rock where he had been seen by the passing glance of henry wharton until evening had begun to shroud the surrounding objects in darkness from this height he had seen all the events of the day as they occurred he had watched with a beating heart the departure of the troops under dunwoodie and with difficulty had curbed his impatience until the obscurity of night should render his moving free from danger he had not however completed a fourth of his way to his own residence when his quick ear distinguished the tread of the approaching horse trusting to the increasing darkness he determined to persevere by crouching and moving quickly along the surface of the ground he hoped yet to escape unseen captain lawton was too much engrossed with the foregoing conversation to suffer his eyes to indulge in their usual wandering and the peddler perceiving by the voices that the enemy he most feared had passed yielded to his impatience and stood erect in order to make greater progress the moment his body arose above the shadow of the ground it was seen and the chase commenced for a single instant birch was helpless his blood curdling in his veins at the imminence of the danger and his legs refusing their natural and necessary office but it was only for a moment casting his pack where he stood and instinctively tightening the belt he wore the peddler betook himself to flight he knew that by bringing himself in a line with his pursuers and the wood his form would be lost to sight this he soon effected and he was straining every nerve to gain the wood itself when several horsemen rode by him but a short distance on his left and cut him off from this place of refuge the peddler threw himself on the ground as they came near him and was passed unseen but delay now became too dangerous for him to remain in that position he accordingly rose and still keeping in the shadow of the wood along the skirts of which he heard voices crying to each other to be watchful he ran with incredible speed in a parallel line but in an opposite direction to the march of the dragoons  the confusion of the chase had been heard by the whole of the men though none distinctly understood the order of lawton but those who followed the remainder were lost in doubt as to the duty that was required of them and the aforesaid cornet was making eager inquiries of the trooper near him on the subject when a man at a short distance in his rear crossed the road at a single bound at the same instant the stentorian voice of lawton rang through the valley shouting  harvey birchtake him dead or alive  fifty pistols lighted the scene and the bullets whistled in every direction round the head of the devoted peddler a feeling of despair seized his heart and in the bitterness of that moment he exclaimed  hunted like a beast of the forest  he felt life and its accompaniments to be a burden and was about to yield himself to his enemies nature however prevailed if taken there was great reason to apprehend that he would not be honored with the forms of a trial but that most probably the morning sun would witness his ignominious execution for he had already been condemned to death and had only escaped that fate by stratagem these considerations with the approaching footsteps of his pursuers roused him to new exertions he again fled before them a fragment of a wall that had withstood the ravages made by war in the adjoining fences of wood fortunately crossed his path he hardly had time to throw his exhausted limbs over this barrier before twenty of his enemies reached its opposite side their horses refused to take the leap in the dark and amid the confusion of the rearing chargers and the execrations of their riders birch was enabled to gain a sight of the base of the hill on whose summit was a place of perfect security the heart of the peddler now beat high with hope when the voice of captain lawton again rang in his ears shouting to his men to make room the order was obeyed and the fearless trooper rode at the wall at the top of his horses speed plunged the rowels in his charger and flew over the obstacle in safety the triumphant hurrahs of the men and the thundering tread of the horse too plainly assured the peddler of the emergency of his danger he was nearly exhausted and his fate no longer seemed doubtful  stop or die was uttered above his head and in fearful proximity to his ears  harvey stole a glance over his shoulder and saw within a bound of him the man he most dreaded by the light of the stars he beheld the uplifted arm and the threatening saber fear exhaustion and despair seized his heart and the intended victim fell at the feet of the dragoon the horse of lawton struck the prostrate peddler and both steed and rider came violently to the earth  as quick as thought birch was on his feet again with the sword of the discomfited dragoon in his hand vengeance seems but too natural to human passions there are few who have not felt the seductive pleasure of making our injuries recoil on their authors and yet there are some who know how much sweeter it is to return good for evil  all the wrongs of the peddler shone on his brain with a dazzling brightness for a moment the demon within him prevailed and birch brandished the powerful weapon in the air in the next it fell harmless on the reviving but helpless trooper the peddler vanished up the side of the friendly rock  help captain lawton there cried mason as he rode up followed by a dozen of his men and some of you dismount with me and search these rocks the villain lies here concealed  hold roared the discomfited captain raising himself with difficulty on his feet if one of you dismount he dies tom my good fellow you will help me to straddle roanoke again  the astonished subaltern complied in silence while the wondering dragoons remained as fixed in their saddles as if they composed part of the animals they rode  you are much hurt i fear said mason with something of condolence in his manner as they reentered the highway biting off the end of a cigar for the want of a better quality of tobacco  something so i do believe replied the captain catching his breath and speaking with difficulty i wish our bonesetter was at hand to examine into the state of my ribs  sitgreaves is left in attendance on captain singleton at the house of mr wharton  then there i halt for the night tom these rude times must abridge ceremony besides you may remember the old gentleman professed a kinsmans regard for the corps i can never think of passing so good a friend without a halt  and i will lead the troop to the four corners if we all halt there we shall breed a famine in the land  a condition i never desire to be placed in the idea of that graceful spinsters cakes is no bad solace for twentyfour hours in the hospital  oh you wont die if you can think of eating said mason with a laugh  i should surely die if i could not observed the captain gravely  captain lawton said the orderly of his troop riding to the side of his commanding officer we are now passing the house of the peddler spy is it your pleasure that we burn it  no roared the captain in a voice that startled the disappointed sergeant are you an incendiary would you burn a house in cold blood let but a spark approach and the hand that carries it will never light another  zounds muttered the sleepy cornet in the rear as he was nodding on his horse there is life in the captain notwithstanding his tumble  lawton and mason rode on in silence the latter ruminating on the wonderful change produced in his commander by his fall when they arrived opposite to the gate before the residence of mr wharton the troop continued its march but the captain and his lieutenant dismounted and followed by the servant of the former they proceeded slowly to the door of the cottage  colonel wellmere had already sought a retreat in his own room mr wharton and his son were closeted by themselves and the ladies were administering the refreshments of the tea table to the surgeon of the dragoons who had seen one of his patients in his bed and the other happily enjoying the comforts of a sweet sleep a few natural inquiries from miss peyton had opened the soul of the doctor who knew every individual of her extensive family connection in virginia and who even thought it possible that he had seen the lady herself the amiable spinster smiled as she felt it to be improbable that she should ever have met her new acquaintance before and not remember his singularities it however greatly relieved the embarrassment of their situation and something like a discourse was maintained between them the nieces were only listeners nor could the aunt be said to be much more  as i was observing miss peyton it was merely the noxious vapors of the lowlands that rendered the plantation of your brother an unfit residence for man but quadrupeds were  bless me whats that said miss peyton turning pale at the report of the pistols fired at birch  it sounds prodigiously like the concussion on the atmosphere made by the explosion of firearms said the surgeon sipping his tea with great indifference i should imagine it to be the troop of captain lawton returning did i not know the captain never uses the pistol and that he dreadfully abuses the saber  merciful providence exclaimed the agitated maiden he would not injure one with it certainly  injure repeated the other quickly it is certain death madam the most random blows imaginable all that i can say to him will have no effect  but captain lawton is the officer we saw this morning and is surely your friend said frances hastily observing her aunt to be seriously alarmed  i find no fault with his want of friendship the man is well enough if he would learn to cut scientifically all trades madam ought to be allowed to live but what is to become of a surgeon if his patients are dead before he sees them  the doctor continued haranguing on the probability and improbability of its being the returning troop until a loud knock at the door gave new alarm to the ladies instinctively laying his hand on a small saw that had been his companion for the whole day in the vain expectation of an amputation the surgeon coolly assuring the ladies that he would stand between them and danger proceeded in person to answer the summons  captain lawton exclaimed the surgeon as he beheld the trooper leaning on the arm of his subaltern and with difficulty crossing the threshold  ah my dear bonesetter is it you you are here very fortunately to inspect my carcass but do lay aside that rascally saw  a few words from mason explained the nature and manner of his captains hurts and miss peyton cheerfully accorded the required accommodations while the room intended for the trooper was getting ready and the doctor was giving certain portentous orders the captain was invited to rest himself in the parlor on the table was a dish of more substantial food than ordinarily adorned the afternoons repast and it soon caught the attention of the dragoons miss peyton recollecting that they had probably made their only meal that day at her own table kindly invited them to close it with another the offer required no pressing and in a few minutes the two were comfortably seated and engaged in an employment that was only interrupted by an occasional wry face from the captain who moved his body in evident pain these interruptions however interfered but little with the principal business in hand and the captain had got happily through with this important duty before the surgeon returned to announce all things ready for his accommodation in the room above stairs  eating cried the astonished physician captain lawton do you wish to die  i have no particular ambition that way said the trooper rising and bowing good night to the ladies and therefore have been providing materials necessary to preserve life  the surgeon muttered his dissatisfaction while he followed mason and the captain from the apartment  every house in america had at that day what was emphatically called its best room and this had been allotted by the unseen influence of sarah to colonel wellmere the down counterpane which a clear frosty night would render extremely grateful over bruised limbs decked the english officers bed a massive silver tankard richly embossed with the wharton arms held the beverage he was to drink during the night while beautiful vessels of china performed the same office for the two american captains sarah was certainly unconscious of the silent preference she had been giving to the english officer and it is equally certain that but for his hurts bed tankard and everything but the beverage would have been matters of indifference to captain lawton half of whose nights were spent in his clothes and not a few of them in the saddle after taking possession however of a small but very comfortable room doctor sitgreaves proceeded to inquire into the state of his injuries he had begun to pass his hand over the body of his patient when the latter cried impatiently  sitgreaves do me the favor to lay that rascally saw aside or i shall have recourse to my saber in selfdefense the sight of it makes my blood cold  captain lawton for a man who has so often exposed life and limb you are unaccountably afraid of a very useful instrument  heaven keep me from its use said the trooper with a shrug  you would not despise the lights of science nor refuse surgical aid because this saw might be necessary  i would  you would  yes you shall never joint me like a quarter of beef while i have life to defend myself cried the resolute dragoon but i grow sleepy are any of my ribs broken  no  any of my bones  no  tom ill thank you for that pitcher as he ended his draft he very deliberately turned his back on his companions and goodnaturedly cried good night mason good night galen  captain lawton entertained a profound respect for the surgical abilities of his comrade but he was very skeptical on the subject of administering internally for the ailings of the human frame with a full stomach a stout heart and a clear conscience he often maintained that a man might bid defiance to the world and its vicissitudes nature provided him with the second and to say the truth he strove manfully himself to keep up the other two requisites in his creed it was a favorite maxim with him that the last thing death assailed was the eyes and next to the last the jaws this he interpreted to be a clear expression of the intention of nature that every man might regulate by his own volition whatever was to be admitted into the sanctuary of his mouth consequently if the guest proved unpalatable he had no one to blame but himself the surgeon who was well acquainted with these views of his patient beheld him as he cavalierly turned his back on mason and himself with a commiserating contempt replaced in their leathern repository the phials he had exhibited with a species of care that was allied to veneration gave the saw as he concluded a whirl of triumph and departed without condescending to notice the compliment of the trooper mason finding by the breathing of the captain that his own good night would be unheard hastened to pay his respects to the ladiesafter which he mounted and followed the troop at the top of his horses speed     chapter x        on some fond breast the parting soul relies      some pious drops the closing eye requires      een from the tomb the voice of nature cries      een in our ashes live their wonted fires                                                 gray  the possessions of mr wharton extended to some distance on each side of the house in which he dwelt and most of his land was unoccupied a few scattered dwellings were to be seen in different parts of his domains but they were fast falling to decay and were untenanted the proximity of the country to the contending armies had nearly banished the pursuits of agriculture from the land it was useless for the husbandman to devote his time and the labor of his hands to obtain overflowing garners that the first foraging party would empty none tilled the earth with any other view than to provide the scanty means of subsistence except those who were placed so near to one of the adverse parties as to be safe from the inroads of the light troops of the other to these the war offered a golden harvest more especially to such as enjoyed the benefits of an access to the royal army mr wharton did not require the use of his lands for the purposes of subsistence and he willingly adopted the guarded practice of the day limiting his attention to such articles as were soon to be consumed within his own walls or could be easily secreted from the prying eyes of the foragers in consequence the ground on which the action was fought had not a single inhabited building besides the one belonging to the father of harvey birch this house stood between the place where the cavalry had met and that where the charge had been made on the party of wellmere  to katy haynes it had been a day fruitful of incidents the prudent housekeeper had kept her political feelings in a state of rigid neutrality her own friends had espoused the cause of the country but the maiden herself never lost sight of that important moment when like females of more illustrious hopes she might be required to sacrifice her love of country on the altar of domestic harmony and yet notwithstanding all her sagacity there were moments when the good woman had grievous doubts into which scale she ought to throw the weight of her eloquence in order to be certain of supporting the cause favored by the peddler there was so much that was equivocal in his movements and manner that often when in the privacy of their household she was about to offer a philippic on washington and his followers discretion sealed her mouth and distrust beset her mind in short the whole conduct of the mysterious being she studied was of a character to distract the opinions of one who took a more enlarged view of men and life than came within the competency of his housekeeper  the battle of the plains had taught the cautious washington the advantages his enemy possessed in organization arms and discipline these were difficulties to be mastered by his own vigilance and care drawing off his troops to the heights in the northern part of the county he had bidden defiance to the attacks of the royal army and sir william howe fell back to the enjoyment of his barren conquesta deserted city never afterwards did the opposing armies make the trial of strength within the limits of westchester yet hardly a day passed that the partisans did not make their inroads or a sun rise that the inhabitants were spared the relation of excesses which the preceding darkness had served to conceal most of the movements of the peddler were made at the hours which others allotted to repose the evening sun would frequently leave him at one extremity of the county and the morning find him at the other his pack was his neverfailing companion and there were those who closely studied him in his moments of traffic and thought his only purpose was the accumulation of gold he would be often seen near the highlands with a body bending under its load and again near the harlem river traveling with lighter steps with his face towards the setting sun but these glances at him were uncertain and fleeting the intermediate time no eye could penetrate for months he disappeared and no traces of his course were ever known  strong parties held the heights of harlem and the northern end of manhattan island was bristling with the bayonets of the english sentinels yet the peddler glided among them unnoticed and uninjured his approaches to the american lines were also frequent but generally so conducted as to baffle pursuit many a sentinel placed in the gorges of the mountains spoke of a strange figure that had been seen gliding by them in the mists of the evening these stories reached the ears of the officers and as we have related in two instances the trader had fallen into the hands of the americans the first time he had escaped from lawton shortly after his arrest but the second he was condemned to die on the morning of his intended execution the cage was opened but the bird had flown this extraordinary escape had been made from the custody of a favorite officer of washington and sentinels who had been thought worthy to guard the person of the commander in chief bribery and treason could not be imputed to men so well esteemed and the opinion gained ground among the common soldiery that the peddler had dealings with the dark one katy however always repelled this opinion with indignation for within the recesses of her own bosom the housekeeper in ruminating on the events concluded that the evil spirit did not pay in gold nor continued the wary spinster in her cogitations does washington paper and promises were all that the leader of the american troops could dispense to his servants after the alliance with france when silver became more abundant in the country although the scrutinizing eyes of katy never let any opportunity of examining into the deerskin purse pass unimproved she was never able to detect the image of louis intruding into the presence of the wellknown countenance of george iii in short the secret hoard of harvey sufficiently showed in its contents that all its contributions had been received from the british  the house of birch had been watched at different times by the americans with a view to his arrest but never with success the reputed spy possessing a secret means of intelligence that invariably defeated their schemes once when a strong body of the continental army held the four corners for a whole summer orders had been received from washington himself never to leave the door of harvey birch unwatched the command was rigidly obeyed and during this long period the peddler was unseen the detachment was withdrawn and the following night birch reentered his dwelling the father of harvey had been greatly molested in consequence of the suspicious character of the son but notwithstanding the most minute scrutiny into the conduct of the old man no fact could be substantiated against him to his injury and his property was too small to keep alive the zeal of patriots by profession its confiscation and purchase would not have rewarded their trouble age and sorrow were now about to spare him further molestation for the lamp of life had been drained of its oil the recent separation of the father and son had been painful but they had submitted in obedience to what both thought a duty the old man had kept his dying situation a secret from the neighborhood in the hope that he might still have the company of his child in his last moments the confusion of the day and his increasing dread that harvey might be too late helped to hasten the event he would fain arrest for a little while as night set in his illness increased to such a degree that the dismayed housekeeper sent a truant boy who had shut up himself with them during the combat to the locusts in quest of a companion to cheer her solitude caesar alone could be spared and loaded with eatables and cordials by the kindhearted miss peyton the black had been dispatched on his duty the dying man was past the use of medicines and his chief anxiety seemed to center in a meeting with his child the noise of the chase had been heard by the group in the house but its cause was not understood and as both the black and katy were apprised of the detachment of american horse being below them they supposed it to proceed from the return of that party they heard the dragoons as they moved slowly by the building but in compliance with the prudent injunction of the black the housekeeper forbore to indulge her curiosity the old man had closed his eyes and his attendants believed him to be asleep the house contained two large rooms and as many small ones one of the former served for kitchen and sitting room in the other lay the father of birch of the latter one was the sanctuary of the vestal and the other contained the stock of provisions a huge chimney of stone rose in the center serving of itself for a partition between the larger rooms and fireplaces of corresponding dimensions were in each apartment a bright flame was burning in that of the common room and within the very jambs of its monstrous jaws sat caesar and katy at the time of which we write the african was impressing his caution on the housekeeper and commenting on the general danger of indulging an idle curiosity  best nebber tempt a satan said caesar rolling up his eyes till the whites glistened by the glare of the fire i berry like heself to lose an ear for carrying a little bit of a letter dere much mischief come of curiosity if dere had nebber been a man curious to see africa dere would be no color people out of dere own country but i wish harvey get back  it is very disregardful in him to be away at such a time said katy imposingly suppose now his father wanted to make his last will in the testament who is there to do so solemn and awful an act for him harvey is a very wasteful and very disregardful man  perhap he make him afore  it would not be a wonderment if he had returned the housekeeper he is whole days looking into the bible  then he read a berry good book said the black solemnly miss fanny read in him to dinah now and den  you are right caesar the bible is the best of books and one that reads it as often as harveys father should have the best of reasons for so doing this is no more than common sense  she rose from her seat and stealing softly to a chest of drawers in the room of the sick man she took from it a large bible heavily bound and secured with strong clasps of brass with which she returned to the negro the volume was eagerly opened and they proceeded instantly to examine its pages katy was far from an expert scholar and to caesar the characters were absolutely strangers for some time the housekeeper was occupied in finding out the word matthew in which she had no sooner succeeded than she pointed out the word with great complacency to the attentive caesar  berry well now look him trough said the black peeping over the housekeepers shoulder as he held a long lank candle of yellow tallow in such a manner as to throw its feeble light on the volume  yes but i must begin with the very beginning of the book replied the other turning the leaves carefully back until moving two at once she lighted upon a page covered with writing here said the housekeeper shaking with the eagerness of expectation here are the very words themselves now i would give the world itself to know whom he has left the big silver shoe buckles to  read em said caesar laconically  and the black walnut drawers for harvey could never want furniture of that quality as long as he is a bachelor  why he no want em as well as he fader  and the six silver tablespoons harvey always uses the iron  prap he say without so much talk returned the sententious black pointing one of his crooked and dingy fingers at the open volume  thus repeatedly advised and impelled by her own curiosity katy began to read anxious to come to the part which most interested herself she dipped at once into the center of the subject  chester birch born september 1st 1755read the spinster with a deliberation that did no great honor to her scholarship  well what he gib him  abigail birch born july 12th 1757 continued the housekeeper in the same tone  i tink he ought to gib her e spoon  june 1st 1760 on this awful day the judgment of an offended god lighted on my house a heavy groan from the adjoining room made the spinster instinctively close the volume and caesar for a moment shook with fear neither possessed sufficient resolution to go and examine the condition of the sufferer but his heavy breathing continued as usual katy dared not however reopen the bible and carefully securing its clasps it was laid on the table in silence caesar took his chair again and after looking timidly round the room remarked  i tought he time war come  no said katy solemnly he will live till the tide is out or the first cock crows in the morning  poor man continued the black nestling still farther into the chimney corner i hope he lay quiet after he die  twould be no astonishment to me if he didnt for they say an unquiet life makes an uneasy grave  johnny birch a berry good man in he way all mankind cant be a minister for if he do who would be a congregation  ah caesar he is good only who does good can you tell me why honestly gotten gold should be hidden in the bowels of the earth  grachi tink it must be to keep te skinner from findin him if he know where he be why dont he dig him up  there may be reasons not comprehensible to you said katy moving her chair so that her clothes covered the charmed stone underneath which lay the secret treasures of the peddler unable to refrain from speaking of what she would have been very unwilling to reveal but a rough outside often holds a smooth inside caesar stared around the building unable to fathom the hidden meaning of his companion when his roving eyes suddenly became fixed and his teeth chattered with affright the change in the countenance of the black was instantly perceived by katy and turning her face she saw the peddler himself standing within the door of the room  is he alive asked birch tremulously and seemingly afraid to receive the answer  surely said katy rising hastily and officiously offering her chair he must live till day or till the tide is down  disregarding all but the fact that his father still lived the peddler stole gently into the room of his dying parent the tie which bound the father and son was of no ordinary kind in the wide world they were all to each other had katy but read a few lines further in the record she would have seen the sad tale of their misfortunes at one blow competence and kindred had been swept from them and from that day to the present hour persecution and distress had followed their wandering steps approaching the bedside harvey leaned his body forward and in a voice nearly choked by his feelings he whispered near the ear of the sick  father do you know me  the parent slowly opened his eyes and a smile of satisfaction passed over his pallid features leaving behind it the impression of death more awful by the contrast the peddler gave a restorative he had brought with him to the parched lips of the sick man and for a few minutes new vigor seemed imparted to his frame he spoke but slowly and with difficulty curiosity kept katy silent awe had the same effect on caesar and harvey seemed hardly to breathe as he listened to the language of the departing spirit  my son said the father in a hollow voice god is as merciful as he is just if i threw the cup of salvation from my lips when a youth he graciously offers it to me in mine age he has chastised to purify and i go to join the spirits of our lost family in a little while my child you will be alone i know you too well not to foresee you will be a pilgrim through life the bruised reed may endure but it will never rise you have that within you harvey that will guide you aright persevere as you have begun for the duties of life are never to be neglected anda noise in the adjoining room interrupted the dying man and the impatient peddler hastened to learn the cause followed by katy and the black the first glance of his eye on the figure in the doorway told the trader but too well his errand and the fate that probably awaited himself the intruder was a man still young in years but his lineaments bespoke a mind long agitated by evil passions his dress was of the meanest materials and so ragged and unseemly as to give him the appearance of studied poverty his hair was prematurely whitened and his sunken lowering eye avoided the bold forward look of innocence there was a restlessness in his movements and an agitation in his manner that proceeded from the workings of the foul spirit within him and which was not less offensive to others than distressing to himself this man was a wellknown leader of one of those gangs of marauders who infested the county with a semblance of patriotism and who were guilty of every grade of offense from simple theft up to murder behind him stood several other figures clad in a similar manner but whose countenances expressed nothing more than the indifference of brutal insensibility they were well armed with muskets and bayonets and provided with the usual implements of foot soldiers harvey knew resistance to be vain and quietly submitted to their directions in the twinkling of an eye both he and caesar were stripped of their decent garments and made to exchange clothes with two of the filthiest of the band they were then placed in separate corners of the room and under the muzzles of the muskets required faithfully to answer such interrogatories as were put to them  where is your pack was the first question to the peddler  hear me said birch trembling with agitation in the next room is my father now in the agonies of death let me go to him receive his blessing and close his eyes and you shall have allaye all  answer me as i put the questions or this musket shall send you to keep the old driveler company where is your pack  i will tell you nothing unless you let me go to my father said the peddler resolutely  his persecutor raised his arm with a malicious sneer and was about to execute his threat when one of his companions checked him  what would you do he said you surely forget the reward tell us where are your goods and you shall go to your father  birch complied instantly and a man was dispatched in quest of the booty he soon returned throwing the bundle on the floor swearing it was as light as feathers  aye cried the leader there must be gold somewhere for what it did contain give us your gold mr birch we know you have it you will not take continental not you  you break your faith said harvey  give us your gold exclaimed the other furiously pricking the peddler with his bayonet until the blood followed his pushes in streams at this instant a slight movement was heard in the adjoining room and harvey cried  let melet me go to my father and you shall have all  i swear you shall go then said the skinner  here take the trash cried birch as he threw aside the purse which he had contrived to conceal notwithstanding the change in his garments  the robber raised it from the floor with a hellish laugh  aye but it shall be to your father in heaven  monster have you no feeling no faith no honesty  to hear him one would think there was not a rope around his neck already said the other laughing there is no necessity for your being uneasy mr birch if the old man gets a few hours the start of you in the journey you will be sure to follow him before noon tomorrow  this unfeeling communication had no effect on the peddler who listened with gasping breath to every sound from the room of his parent until he heard his own name spoken in the hollow sepulchral tones of death birch could endure no more but shrieking out  father hushfather i comei come he darted by his keeper and was the next moment pinned to the wall by the bayonet of another of the band fortunately his quick motion had caused him to escape a thrust aimed at his life and it was by his clothes only that he was confined  no mr birch said the skinner we know you too well to trust you out of sightyour gold your gold  you have it said the peddler writhing with agony  aye we have the purse but you have more purses king george is a prompt paymaster and you have done him many a piece of good service where is your hoard without it you will never see your father  remove the stone underneath the woman cried the peddler eagerlyremove the stone  he raves he raves said katy instinctively moving her position to a different stone from the one on which she had been standing in a moment it was torn from its bed and nothing but earth was seen beneath  he raves you have driven him from his right mind continued the trembling spinster would any man in his senses keep gold under a hearth  peace babbling fool cried harvey lift the corner stone and you will find that which will make you rich and me a beggar  and then you will be despisable said the housekeeper bitterly a peddler without goods and without money is sure to be despisable  there will be enough left to pay for his halter cried the skinner who was not slow to follow the instructions of harvey soon lighting upon a store of english guineas the money was quickly transferred to a bag notwithstanding the declarations of the spinster that her dues were unsatisfied and that of right ten of the guineas were her property  delighted with a prize that greatly exceeded their expectations the band prepared to depart intending to take the peddler with them in order to give him up to the american troops above and to claim the reward offered for his apprehension everything was ready and they were about to lift birch in their arms for he resolutely refused to move an inch when a form appeared in their midst which appalled the stoutest heart among them the father had arisen from his bed and he tottered forth at the cries of his son around his body was thrown the sheet of the bed and his fixed eye and haggard face gave him the appearance of a being from another world even katy and caesar thought it was the spirit of the elder birch and they fled the house followed by the alarmed skinners in a body  the excitement which had given the sick man strength soon vanished and the peddler lifting him in his arms reconveyed him to his bed the reaction of the system which followed hastened to close the scene  the glazed eye of the father was fixed upon the son his lips moved but his voice was unheard harvey bent down and with the parting breath of his parent received his dying benediction a life of privation and of wrongs embittered most of the future hours of the peddler but under no sufferings in no misfortunes the subject of poverty and obloquy the remembrance of that blessing never left him it constantly gleamed over the images of the past shedding a holy radiance around his saddest hours of despondency it cheered the prospect of the future with the prayers of a pious spirit and it brought the sweet assurance of having faithfully discharged the sacred offices of filial love  the retreat of caesar and the spinster had been too precipitate to admit of much calculation yet they themselves instinctively separated from the skinners after fleeing a short distance they paused and the maiden commenced in a solemn voice  oh caesar was it not dreadful to walk before he had been laid in his grave it must have been the money that disturbed him they say captain kidd walks near the spot where he buried gold in the old war  i never tink johnny birch hab such a big eye said the african his teeth yet chattering with the fright  im sure twould be a botherment to a living soul to lose so much money harvey will be nothing but an utterly despisable povertystricken wretch i wonder who he thinks would even be his housekeeper  maybe a spook take away harvey too observed caesar moving still nearer to the side of the maiden but a new idea had seized the imagination of the spinster she thought it not improbable that the prize had been forsaken in the confusion of the retreat and after deliberating and reasoning for some time with caesar they determined to venture back and ascertain this important fact and if possible learn what had been the fate of the peddler much time was spent in cautiously approaching the dreaded spot and as the spinster had sagaciously placed herself in the line of the retreat of the skinners every stone was examined in the progress in search of abandoned gold but although the suddenness of the alarm and the cry of caesar had impelled the freebooters to so hasty a retreat they grasped the hoard with a hold that death itself would not have loosened perceiving everything to be quiet within katy at length mustered resolution to enter the dwelling where she found the peddler with a heavy heart performing the last sad offices for the dead a few words sufficed to explain to katy the nature of her mistake but caesar continued to his dying day to astonish the sable inmates of the kitchen with learned dissertations on spooks and to relate how direful was the appearance of that of johnny birch  the danger compelled the peddler to abridge even the short period that american custom leaves the deceased with us and aided by the black and katy his painful task was soon ended caesar volunteered to walk a couple of miles with orders to a carpenter and the body being habited in its ordinary attire was left with a sheet thrown decently over it to await the return of the messenger  the skinners had fled precipitately to the wood which was but a short distance from the house of birch and once safely sheltered within its shades they halted and mustered their panicstricken forces  what in the name of fury seized your coward hearts cried their dissatisfied leader drawing his breath heavily  the same question might be asked of yourself returned one of the band sullenly  from your fright i thought a party of de lanceys men were upon us oh you are brave gentlemen at a race  we follow our captain  then follow me back and let us secure the scoundrel and receive the reward  yes and by the time we reach the house that black rascal will have the mad virginian upon us by my soul i would rather meet fifty cowboys than that single man  fool cried the enraged leader dont you know dunwoodies horse are at the corners full two miles from here  i care not where the dragoons are but i will swear that i saw captain lawton enter the house of old wharton while i lay watching an opportunity of getting the british colonels horse from the stable  and if he should come wont a bullet silence a dragoon from the south as well as from old england  aye but i dont choose a hornets nest about my ears rase the skin of one of that corps and you will never see another peaceable nights foraging again  well muttered the leader as they retired deeper into the wood this sottish peddler will stay to see the old devil buried and though we cannot touch him at the funeral for that would raise every old woman and priest in america against us hell wait to look after the movables and tomorrow night shall wind up his concerns  with this threat they withdrew to one of their usual places of resort until darkness should again give them an opportunity of marauding on the community without danger of detection     chapter xi        o wo o woful woful woful day      most lamentable day most woful day      that ever ever i did yet behold      o day o day o day o hateful day      never was seen so black a day as this      o woful day o

occurrence the attacks of the skinners were always made with so much privacy as to exclude the sufferers not only from succor but frequently through a dread of future depredations from the commiseration of their neighbors also additional duties had drawn the ladies from their pillows at an hour somewhat earlier than usual and captain lawton notwithstanding the sufferings of his body had risen in compliance with a rule from which he never departed of sleeping but six hours at a time this was one of the few points in which the care of the human frame was involved on which the trooper and the surgeon of horse were ever known to agree the doctor had watched during the night by the side of the bed of captain singleton without once closing his eyes occasionally he would pay a visit to the wounded englishman who being more hurt in the spirit than in the flesh tolerated the interruptions with a very ill grace and once for an instant he ventured to steal softly to the bed of his obstinate comrade and was near succeeding in obtaining a touch of his pulse when a terrible oath sworn by the trooper in a dream startled the prudent surgeon and warned him of a trite saying in the corps that captain lawton always slept with one eye open this group had assembled in one of the parlors as the sun made its appearance over the eastern hill dispersing the columns of fog which had enveloped the lowland  miss peyton was looking from a window in the direction of the tenement of the peddler and was expressing a kind anxiety after the welfare of the sick man when the person of katy suddenly emerged from the dense covering of an earthly cloud whose mists were scattering before the cheering rays of the sun and was seen making hasty steps towards the locusts there was that in the air of the housekeeper which bespoke distress of an unusual nature and the kindhearted mistress of the locusts opened the door of the room with the benevolent intention of soothing a grief that seemed so overwhelming a nearer view of the disturbed features of the visitor confirmed miss peyton in her belief and with the shock that gentle feelings ever experience at a sudden and endless separation from even the meanest of their associates she said hastily  katy is he gone  no maam replied the disturbed damsel with great bitterness he is not yet gone but he may go as soon as he pleases now for the worst is done i do verily believe miss peyton they havent so much as left him money enough to buy him another suit of clothes to cover his nakedness and those he has on are none of the best i can tell you  how exclaimed the other astonished could anyone have the heart to plunder a man in such distress  hearts repeated katy catching her breath men like them have no bowels at all plunder and distress indeed why maam there were in the iron pot in plain sight fiftyfour guineas of gold besides what lay underneath which i couldnt count without handling and i didnt like to touch it for they say that anothers gold is apt to stickso judging from that in sight there wasnt less than two hundred guineas besides what might have been in the deerskin purse but harvey is little better now than a beggar and a beggar miss jeanette is the most awfully despisable of all earthly creatures  poverty is to be pitied and not despised said the lady still unable to comprehend the extent of the misfortune that had befallen her neighbor during the night but how is the old man and does this loss affect him much  the countenance of katy changed from the natural expression of concern to the set form of melancholy as she answered  he is happily removed from the cares of the world the chinking of the money made him get out of his bed and the poor soul found the shock too great for him he died about two hours and ten minutes before the cock crowed as near as we can say she was interrupted by the physician who approaching inquired with much interest the nature of the disorder glancing her eye over the figure of this new acquaintance katy instinctively adjusting her dress replied  twas the troubles of the times and the loss of property that brought him down he wasted from day to day and all my care and anxiety were lost for now harvey is no better than a beggar and who is there to pay me for what i have done  god will reward you for all the good you have done said miss peyton mildly  yes interrupted the spinster hastily and with an air of reverence that was instantly succeeded by an expression that denoted more of worldly care but then i have left my wages for three years past in the hands of harvey and how am i to get them my brothers told me again and again to ask for my money but i always thought accounts between relations were easily settled  were you related then to birch asked miss peyton observing her to pause  why returned the housekeeper hesitating a little i thought we were as good as so i wonder if i have no claim on the house and garden though they say now it is harveys it will surely be confiscated turning to lawton who had been sitting in one posture with his piercing eyes lowering at her through his thick brows in silence perhaps this gentleman knowshe seems to take an interest in my story  madam said the trooper bowing very low both you and the tale are extremely interestingkaty smiled involuntarilybut my humble knowledge is limited to the setting of a squadron in the field and using it when there i beg leave to refer you to dr archibald sitgreaves a gentleman of universal attainments and unbounded philanthropy the very milk of human sympathies and a mortal foe to all indiscriminate cutting  the surgeon drew up and employed himself in whistling a low air as he looked over some phials on a table but the housekeeper turning to him with an inclination of the head continued  i suppose sir a woman has no dower in her husbands property unless they be actually married  it was a maxim with dr sitgreaves that no species of knowledge was to be despised and consequently he was an empiric in everything but his profession at first indignation at the irony of his comrade kept him silent but suddenly changing his purpose he answered the applicant with a goodnatured smile  i judge not if death has anticipated your nuptials i am fearful you have no remedy against his stern decrees  to katy this sounded well although she understood nothing of its meaning but death and nuptials to this part of his speech then she directed her reply  i did think he only waited the death of the old gentleman before he married said the housekeeper looking on the carpet but now he is nothing more than despisable or whats the same thing a peddler without house pack or money it might be hard for a man to get a wife at all in such a predicarydont you think it would miss peyton  i seldom trouble myself with such things said the lady gravely  during this dialogue captain lawton had been studying the countenance and manner of the housekeeper with a most ludicrous gravity and fearful the conversation would cease he inquired with an appearance of great interest  you think it was age and debility that removed the old gentleman at last  and the troublesome times trouble is a heavy pull down to a sick bed but i suppose his time had come and when that happens it matters but little what doctors stuff we take  let me set you right in that particular interrupted the surgeon we must all die it is true but it is permitted us to use the lights of science in arresting dangers as they occur until  we can die secundem artem cried the trooper  to this observation the physician did not deign to reply but deeming it necessary to his professional dignity that the conversation should continue he added  perhaps in this instance judicious treatment might have prolonged the life of the patient who administered to the case  no one yet said the housekeeper with quickness i expect he has made his last will and testament  the surgeon disregarded the smile of the ladies and pursued his inquiries  it is doubtless wise to be prepared for death but under whose care was the sick man during his indisposition  under mine answered katy with an air of a little importance and care thrown away i may well call it for harvey is quite too despisable to be any sort of compensation at present  the mutual ignorance of each others meaning made very little interruption to the dialogue for both took a good deal for granted and sitgreaves pursued the subject  and how did you treat him  kindly you may be certain said katy rather tartly  the doctor means medically madam observed captain lawton with a face that would have honored the funeral of the deceased  i doctored him mostly with yarbs said the housekeeper smiling as if conscious of error  with simples returned the surgeon they are safer in the hands of the unlettered than more powerful remedies but why had you no regular attendant  im sure harvey has suffered enough already from having so much concerns with the riglars replied the housekeeper he has lost his all and made himself a vagabond through the land and i have reason to rue the day i ever crossed the threshold of his house  dr sitgreaves does not mean a riglar soldier but a regular physician madam said the trooper  oh cried the maiden again correcting herself for the best of all reasons there was none to be had so i took care of him myself if there had been a doctor at hand i am sure we would gladly have had him for my part i am clear for doctoring though harvey says i am killing myself with medicines but i am sure it will make but little difference to him whether i live or die  therein you show your sense said the surgeon approaching the spinster who sat holding the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet to the genial heat of a fine fire making the most of comfort amid all her troubles you appear to be a sensible discreet woman and some who have had opportunities of acquiring more correct views might envy you your respect for knowledge and the lights of science  although the housekeeper did not altogether comprehend the others meaning she knew he used a compliment and as such was highly pleased with what he said with increased animation therefore she cried it was always said of me that i wanted nothing but opportunity to make quite a physician myself so long as before i came to live with harveys father they called me the petticoat doctor  more true than civil i dare say returned the surgeon losing sight of the womans character in his admiration of her respect for the healing art in the absence of more enlightened counselors the experience of a discreet matron is frequently of great efficacy in checking the progress of disease under such circumstances madam it is dreadful to have to contend with ignorance and obstinacy  bad enough as i well know from experience cried katy in triumph harvey is as obstinate about such things as a dumb beast one would think the care i took of his bedridden father might learn him better than to despise good nursing but some day he may know what it is to want a careful woman in his house though now i am sure he is too despisable himself to have a house  indeed i can easily comprehend the mortification you must have felt in having one so selfwilled to deal with returned the surgeon glancing his eyes reproachfully at his comrade but you should rise superior to such opinions and pity the ignorance by which they are engendered  the housekeeper hesitated a moment at a loss to comprehend all that the surgeon expressed yet she felt it was both complimentary and kind therefore suppressing her natural flow of language a little she replied  i tell harvey his conduct is often condemnable and last night he made my words good but the opinions of such unbelievers is not very consequential yet it is dreadful to think how he behaves at times now when he threw away the needle  what said the surgeon interrupting her does he affect to despise the needle but it is my lot to meet with men daily who are equally perverse and who show a still more culpable disrespect for the information that flows from the lights of science  the doctor turned his face towards captain lawton while speaking but the elevation of the head prevented his eyes from resting on the grave countenance maintained by the trooper katy listened with admiring attention and when the other had done she added  then harvey is a disbeliever in the tides  not believe in the tides repeated the healer of bodies in astonishment does the man distrust his senses but perhaps it is the influence of the moon that he doubts  that he does exclaimed katy shaking with delight at meeting with a man of learning who could support her opinions if you was to hear him talk you would think he didnt believe there was such a thing as a moon at all  it is the misfortune of ignorance and incredulity madam that they feed themselves the mind once rejecting useful information insensibly leans to superstition and conclusions on the order of nature that are not less prejudicial to the cause of truth than they are at variance with the first principles of human knowledge  the spinster was too much awestruck to venture an undigested reply to this speech and the surgeon after pausing a moment in a kind of philosophical disdain continued  that any man in his senses can doubt of the flux of the tides is more than i could have thought possible yet obstinacy is a dangerous inmate to harbor and may lead us into any error however gross  you think then they have an effect on the flux said the housekeeper inquiringly  miss peyton rose and beckoned her nieces to give her their assistance in the adjoining pantry while for a moment the dark visage of the attentive lawton was lighted by an animation that vanished by an effort as powerful and as sudden as the one that drew it into being  after reflecting whether he rightly understood the meaning of the other the surgeon making due allowance for the love of learning acting upon a want of education replied  the moon you mean many philosophers have doubted how far it affects the tides but i think it is willfully rejecting the lights of science not to believe it causes both the flux and reflux  as reflux was a disorder with which katy was not acquainted she thought it prudent to be silent yet burning with curiosity to know the meaning of certain portentous lights to which the other so often alluded she ventured to ask  if them lights he spoke of were what was called northern lights in these parts  in charity to her ignorance the surgeon would have entered into an elaborate explanation of his meaning had he not been interrupted by the mirth of lawton the trooper had listened so far with great composure but now he laughed until his aching bones reminded him of his fall and the tears rolled over his cheeks in larger drops than had ever been seen there before at length the offended physician seized an opportunity of a pause to say  to you captain lawton it may be a source of triumph that an uneducated woman should make a mistake in a subject on which men of science have long been at variance but yet you find this respectable matron does not reject the lightsdoes not reject the use of proper instruments in repairing injuries sustained by the human frame you may possibly remember sir her allusion to the use of the needle  aye cried the delighted trooper to mend the peddlers breeches  katy drew up in evident displeasure and prompt to vindicate her character for more lofty acquirements she said  twas not a common use that i put that needle tobut one of much greater virtue  explain yourself madam said the surgeon impatiently that this gentleman may see how little reason he has for exultation  thus solicited katy paused to collect sufficient eloquence to garnish her narrative the substance of her tale was that a child who had been placed by the guardians of the poor in the keeping of harvey had in the absence of its master injured itself badly in the foot by a large needle the offending instrument had been carefully greased wrapped in woolen and placed in a certain charmed nook of the chimney while the foot from a fear of weakening the incantation was left in a state of nature the arrival of the peddler had altered the whole of this admirable treatment and the consequences were expressed by katy as she concluded her narrative by saying  twas no wonder the boy died of a lockjaw  doctor sitgreaves looked out of the window in admiration of the brilliant morning striving all he could to avoid the basilisks eyes of his comrade he was impelled by a feeling that he could not conquer however to look captain lawton in the face the trooper had arranged every muscle of his countenance to express sympathy for the fate of the poor child but the exultation of his eyes cut the astounded man of science to the quick he muttered something concerning the condition of his patients and retreated with precipitation  miss peyton entered into the situation of things at the house of the peddler with all the interest of her excellent feelings she listened patiently while katy recounted more particularly the circumstances of the past night as they had occurred the spinster did not forget to dwell on the magnitude of the pecuniary loss sustained by harvey and in no manner spared her invectives at his betraying a secret which might so easily have been kept  for miss peyton continued the housekeeper after a pause to take breath i would have given up life before i would have given up that secret at the most they could only have killed him and now a body may say that they have slain both soul and body or whats the same thing they have made him a despisable vagabond i wonder who he thinks would be his wife or who would keep his house for my part my good name is too precious to be living with a lone man though for the matter of that he is never there i am resolved to tell him this day that stay there a single woman i will not an hour after the funeral and marry him i dont think i will unless he becomes steadier and more of a home body  the mild mistress of the locusts suffered the exuberance of the housekeepers feelings to expend itself and then by one or two judicious questions that denoted a more intimate knowledge of the windings of the human heart in matters of cupid than might fairly be supposed to belong to a spinster she extracted enough from katy to discover the improbability of harveys ever presuming to offer himself with his broken fortunes to the acceptance of katharine haynes she therefore mentioned her own want of assistance in the present state of her household and expressed a wish that katy would change her residence to the locusts in case the peddler had no further use for her services after a few preliminary conditions on the part of the wary housekeeper the arrangement was concluded and making a few more piteous lamentations on the weight of her own losses and the stupidity of harvey united with some curiosity to know the future fate of the peddler katy withdrew to make the necessary preparations for the approaching funeral which was to take place that day  during the interview between the two females lawton through delicacy had withdrawn anxiety took him to the room of captain singleton the character of this youth it has already been shown endeared him in a peculiar manner to every officer in the corps the singularly mild deportment of the young dragoon had on so many occasions been proved not to proceed from want of resolution that his almost feminine softness of manner and appearance had failed to bring him into disrepute even in that band of partisan warriors  to the major he was as dear as a brother and his easy submission to the directions of his surgeon had made him a marked favorite with dr sitgreaves the rough usage the corps often received in its daring attacks had brought each of its officers in succession under the temporary keeping of the surgeon to captain singleton the man of science had decreed the palm of docility on such occasions and captain lawton he had fairly blackballed he frequently declared with unconquerable simplicity and earnestness of manner that it gave him more pleasure to see the former brought in wounded than any officer in the squadron and that the latter afforded him the least a compliment and condemnation that were usually received by the first of the parties with a quiet smile of good nature and by the last with a grave bow of thanks on the present occasion the mortified surgeon and exulting trooper met in the room of captain singleton as a place where they could act on common ground some time was occupied in joint attentions to the comfort of the wounded officer and the doctor retired to an apartment prepared for his own accommodation here within a few minutes he was surprised by the entrance of lawton the triumph of the trooper had been so complete that he felt he could afford to be generous and commencing by voluntarily throwing aside his coat he cried carelessly  sitgreaves administer a little of the aid of the lights of science to my body if you please  the surgeon was beginning to feel this was a subject that was intolerable but venturing a glance towards his comrade he saw with surprise the preparations he had made and an air of sincerity about him that was unusual to his manner when making such a request changing his intended burst of resentment to a tone of civil inquiry he said  does captain lawton want anything at my hands  look for yourself my dear sir said the trooper mildly here seem to be most of the colors of the rainbow on this shoulder  you have reason for saying so said the other handling the part with great tenderness and consummate skill but happily nothing is broken it is wonderful how well you escaped  i have been a tumbler from my youth and i am past minding a few falls from a horse but sitgreaves he added with affection and pointing to a scar on his body do you remember this bit of work  perfectly well jack it was bravely obtained and neatly extracted but dont you think i had better apply an oil to these bruises  certainly said lawton with unexpected condescension  now my dear boy cried the doctor exultantly as he busied himself in applying the remedy to the hurts do you not think it would have been better to have done all this last night  quite probable  yes jack but if you had let me perform the operation of phlebotomy n when i first saw you it would have been of infinite service  no phlebotomy said the other positively  it is now too late but a dose of oil would carry off the humors famously  to this the captain made no reply but grated his teeth in a way that showed the fortress of his mouth was not to be assailed without a resolute resistance and the experienced physician changed the subject by saying  it is a pity john that you did not catch the rascal after the danger and trouble you incurred  the captain of dragoons made no reply and while placing some bandages on the wounded shoulder the surgeon continued  if i have any wish at all to destroy human life it is to have the pleasure of seeing that traitor hanged  i thought your business was to cure and not to slay said the trooper dryly  aye but he has caused us such heavy losses by his information that i sometimes feel a very unsophistical temper towards that spy  you should not encourage such feelings of animosity to any of your fellow creatures returned lawton in a tone that caused the operator to drop a pin he was arranging in the bandages from his hand he looked the patient in the face to remove all doubts of his identity finding however it was his old comrade captain john lawton who had spoken he rallied his astonished faculties and proceeded by saying  your doctrine is just and in general i subscribe to it but john my dear fellow is the bandage easy  quite  i agree with you as a whole but as matter is infinitely divisible so no case exists without an exception lawton do you feel easy  very  it is not only cruel to the sufferer but sometimes unjust to others to take human life where a less punishment would answer the purpose now jack if you were onlymove your arm a littleif you were onlyi hope you feel easier my dear friend  much  if my dear john you would teach your men to cut with more discretion it would answer you the same purposeand give me great pleasure  the doctor drew a heavy sigh as he was enabled to get rid of what was nearest to the heart and the dragoon coolly replaced his coat saying with great deliberation as he retired  i know no troop that cut more judiciously they generally shave from the crown to the jaw  the disappointed operator collected his instruments and with a heavy heart proceeded to pay a visit to the room of colonel wellmere     chapter xii        this fairy form contains a soul as mighty      as that which lives within a giants frame      these slender limbs that tremble like the aspen      at summer evenings sigh uphold a spirit      which roused can tower to the height of heaven      and light those shining windows of the face      with much of heavens own radiance                                                    duo  the number and character of her guests had greatly added to the cares of miss jeanette peyton the morning found them all restored in some measure to their former ease of body with the exception of the youthful captain of dragoons who had been so deeply regretted by dunwoodie the wound of this officer was severe though the surgeon persevered in saying that it was without danger his comrade we have shown had deserted his couch and henry wharton awoke from a sleep that had been undisturbed by anything but a dream of suffering amputation under the hands of a surgical novice as it proved however to be nothing but a dream the youth found himself much refreshed by his slumbers and dr sitgreaves removed all further apprehensions by confidently pronouncing that he would be a well man within a fortnight  during all this time colonel wellmere did not make his appearance he breakfasted in his own room and notwithstanding certain significant smiles of the man of science declared himself too much injured to rise from his bed leaving him therefore endeavoring to conceal his chagrin in the solitude of his chamber the surgeon proceeded to the more grateful task of sitting an hour by the bedside of george singleton a slight flush was on the face of the patient as the doctor entered the room and the latter advanced promptly and laid his fingers on the pulse of the youth beckoning to him to be silent while he muttered  growing symptoms of a febrile pulseno no my dear george you must remain quiet and dumb though your eyes look better and your skin has even a moisture  nay my dear sitgreaves said the youth taking his hand you see there is no fever about me look is there any of jack lawtons hoarfrost on my tongue  no indeed said the surgeon clapping a spoon in the mouth of the other forcing it open and looking down his throat as if disposed to visit the interior in person the tongue is well and the pulse begins to lower again ah the bleeding did you good phlebotomy is a sovereign specific for southern constitutions but that madcap lawton absolutely refused to be blooded for a fall he had from his horse last night why george your case is becoming singular continued the doctor instinctively throwing aside his wig your pulse even and soft your skin moist but your eye fiery and cheek flushed oh i must examine more closely into these symptoms  softly my good friend softly said the youth falling back on his pillow and losing some of that color which alarmed his companion i believe in extracting the ball you did for me all that is required i am free from pain and only weak i do assure you  captain singleton said the surgeon with heat it is presumptuous in you to pretend to tell your medical attendant when you are free from pain if it be not to enable us to decide in such matters of what avail the lights of science for shame george for shame even that perverse fellow john lawton could not behave with more obstinacy  his patient smiled as he gently repulsed his physician in an attempt to undo the bandages and with a returning glow to his cheeks inquired  do archibalda term of endearment that seldom failed to soften the operators hearttell me what spirit from heaven has been gliding around my apartment while i lay pretending to sleep  if anyone interferes with my patients cried the doctor hastily i will teach them spirit or no spirit what it is to meddle with another mans concerns  tutmy dear fellow there was no interference made nor any intended see exhibiting the bandages everything is as you left itbut it glided about the room with the grace of a fairy and the tenderness of an angel  the surgeon having satisfied himself that everything was as he had left it very deliberately resumed his seat and replaced his wig as he inquired with a brevity that would have honored lieutenant mason  had it petticoats george  i saw nothing but its heavenly eyesits bloomits majestic stepits grace replied the young man with rather more ardor than his surgeon thought consistent with his debilitated condition and he laid his hand on his mouth to stop him saying himself  it must have been miss jeanette peytona lady of fine accomplishments withhemwith something of the kind of step you speak ofa very complacent eye and as to the bloom i dare say offices of charity can summon as fine a color to her cheeks as glows in the faces of her more youthful nieces  nieces has she nieces then the angel i saw may be a daughter a sister or a niecebut never an aunt  hush george hush your talking has brought your pulse up again you must observe quiet and prepare for a meeting with your own sister who will be here within an hour  what isabella and who sent for her  the major  considerate dunwoodie murmured the exhausted youth sinking again on his pillow where the commands of his attendant compelled him to remain silent  even captain lawton had been received with many and courteous inquiries after the state of his health from all the members of the family when he made his morning entrance but an invisible spirit presided over the comforts of the english colonel sarah had shrunk with consciousness from entering the room yet she knew the position of every glass and had with her own hands supplied the contents of every bowl that stood on his table  at the time of our tale we were a divided people and sarah thought it was no more than her duty to cherish the institutions of that country to which she yet clung as the land of her forefathers but there were other and more cogent reasons for the silent preference she was giving to the englishman his image had first filled the void in her youthful fancy and it was an image that was distinguished by many of those attractions that can enchain a female heart it is true he wanted the personal excellence of peyton dunwoodie but his pretensions were far from contemptible sarah had moved about the house during the morning casting frequent and longing glances at the door of wellmeres apartment anxious to learn the condition of his wounds and yet ashamed to inquire conscious interest kept her tongue tied until her sister with the frankness of innocence had put the desired question to dr sitgreaves  colonel wellmere said the operator gravely is in what i call a state of free will madam he is ill or he is well as he pleases his case young lady exceeds my art to heal and i take it sir henry clinton is the best adviser he can apply to though major dunwoodie has made the communication with his leech rather difficult  frances smiled but averted her face while sarah moved with the grace of an offended juno from the apartment her own room however afforded her but little relief and in passing through the long gallery that communicated with each of the chambers of the building she noticed the door of singletons room to be open the wounded youth seemed sleeping and was alone she had ventured lightly into the apartment and busied herself for a few minutes in arranging the tables and the nourishment provided for the patient hardly conscious of what she was doing and possibly dreaming that these little feminine offices were performed for another her natural bloom was heightened by the insinuation of the surgeon nor was the luster of her eye in any degree diminished the sound of the approaching footsteps of sitgreaves hastened her retreat down a private stairway to the side of her sister the sisters then sought the fresh air on the piazza and as they pursued their walk arm in arm the following dialogue took place  there is something disagreeable about this surgeon of dunwoodie said sarah that causes me to wish him away most heartily  frances fixed her laughing eyes on her sister but forbearing to speak the other readily construed their expression and hastily added but i forget he is one of your renowned corps of virginians and must be spoken of reverently  as respectfully as you please my dear sister there is but little danger of exceeding the truth  not in your opinion said the elder with a little warmth but i think mr dunwoodie has taken a liberty that exceeds the rights of consanguinity he has made our fathers house a hospital  we ought to be grateful that none of the patients it contains are dearer to us  your brother is one  true true interrupted frances blushing to the eyes but he leaves his room and thinks his wound lightly purchased by the pleasure of being with his friends if she added with a tremulous lip this dreadful suspicion that is affixed to his visit were removed i could consider his wound of little moment  you now have the fruits of rebellion brought home to you a brother wounded and a prisoner and perhaps a victim your father distressed his privacy interrupted and not improbably his estates torn from him on account of his loyalty to his king  frances continued her walk in silence while facing the northern entrance to the vale her eyes were uniformly fastened on the point where the road was suddenly lost by the intervention of a hill and at each turn as she lost sight of the spot she lingered until an impatient movement of her sister quickened her pace to an even motion with that of her own at length a single horse chaise was seen making its way carefully among the stones which lay scattered over the country road that wound through the valley and approached the cottage the color of frances changed as the vehicle gradually drew nearer and when she was enabled to see a female form in it by the side of a black in livery her limbs shook with an agitation that compelled her to lean on sarah for support in a few minutes the travelers approached the gate it was thrown open by a dragoon who followed the carriage and who had been the messenger dispatched by dunwoodie to the father of captain singleton miss peyton advanced to receive their guest and the sisters united in giving her the kindest welcome still frances could with difficulty withdraw her truant eyes from the countenance of their visitor she was young and of a light and fragile form but of exquisite proportions her eyes were large full black piercing and at times a little wild her hair was luxuriant and as it was without the powder it was then the fashion to wear it fell in raven blackness a few of its locks had fallen on her cheek giving its chilling whiteness by the contrast a more deadly character dr sitgreaves supported her from the chaise and when she gained the floor of the piazza she turned an expressive look on the face of the practitioner  your brother is out of danger and wishes to see you miss singleton said the surgeon  the lady burst into a flood of tears frances had stood contemplating the action and face of isabella with a kind of uneasy admiration but she now sprang to her side with the ardor of a sister and kindly drawing her arm within her own led the way to a retired room the movement was so ingenuous so considerate and so delicate that even miss peyton withheld her interference following the youthful pair with only her eyes and a smile of complacency the feeling was communicated to all the spectators and they dispersed in pursuit of their usual avocations isabella yielded to the gentle influence of frances without resistance and having gained the room where the latter conducted her wept in silence on the shoulder of the observant and soothing girl until frances thought her tears exceeded the emotion natural to the occasion the sobs of miss singleton for a time were violent and uncontrollable until with an evident exertion she yielded to a kind observation of her companion and succeeded in suppressing her tears raising her face to the eyes of frances she rose while a smile of beautiful radiance passed over her features and making a hasty apology for the excess of her emotion she desired to be conducted to the room of the invalid  the meeting between the brother and sister was warm but by an effort on the part of the lady more composed than her previous agitation had given reason to expect isabella found her brother looking better and in less danger than her sensitive imagination had led her to suppose her spirits rose in proportion from despondency she passed to something like gayety her beautiful eyes sparkled with renovated brilliancy and her face was lighted with smiles so fascinating that frances who in compliance with her earnest entreaties had accompanied her to the sick chamber sat gazing on a countenance that possessed so wonderful variability impelled by a charm that was beyond her control the youth had thrown an earnest look at frances as soon as his sister raised herself from his arms and perhaps it was the first glance at the lovely lineaments of our heroine when the gazer turned his eyes from the view in disappointment he seemed bewildered rubbed his forehead like a man awaking from a dream and mused  where is dunwoodie isabella he said the excellent fellow is never weary of kind actions after a day of such service as that of yesterday he has spent the night in bringing me a nurse whose presence alone is able to raise me from my couch  the expression of the ladys countenance changed her eye roved around the apartment with a character of wildness in it that repelled the anxious frances who studied her movements with unabated interest  dunwoodie is he then not here i thought to have met him by the side of my brothers bed  he has duties that require his presence elsewhere the english are said to be out by the way of the hudson and they give us light troops but little rest surely nothing else could have kept him so long from a wounded friend but isabella the meeting has been too much for you you tremble  isabella made no reply she stretched her hand towards the table which held the nourishment of the captain and the attentive frances comprehended her wishes in a moment a glass of water in some measure revived the sister who was enabled to say  doubtless it is his duty twas said above a royal party was moving on the river though i passed the troops but two miles from this spot the latter part of the sentence was hardly audible and it was spoken more in the manner of a soliloquy than as if for the ears of her companions  on the march isabella eagerly inquired her brother  no dismounted and seemingly at rest was the reply  the wondering dragoon turned his gaze on the countenance of his sister who sat with her eye bent on the carpet in unconscious absence but found no explanation his look was changed to the face of frances who startled by the earnestness of his expression arose and hastily inquired if he would have any assistance  if you can pardon the rudeness said the wounded officer making a feeble effort to raise his body i would request to have captain lawtons company for a moment  frances hastened instantly to communicate his wish to that gentleman and impelled by an interest she could not control she returned again to her seat by the side of miss singleton  lawton said the youth impatiently as the trooper entered hear you from the major  the eye of the sister was now bent on the face of the trooper who made his salutations to the lady with ease blended with the frankness of a soldier  his man has been here twice he said to inquire how we fared in the lazaretto  and why not himself  that is a question the major can answer best but you know the redcoats are abroad and dunwoodie commands in the county these english must be looked to  true said singleton slowly as if struck with the others reasons but how is it that you are idle when there is work to do  my sword arm is not in the best condition and roanoke has but a shambling gait this morning besides there is another reason i could mention if it were not that miss wharton would never forgive me  speak i beg without dread of my displeasure said frances returning the goodhumored smile of the trooper with the archness natural to her own sweet face  the odors of your kitchen then cried lawton bluntly forbid my quitting the domains until i qualify myself to speak with more certainty concerning the fatness of the land  oh aunt jeanette is exerting herself to do credit to my fathers hospitality said the laughing girl and i am a truant from her labors as i shall be a stranger to her favor unless i proffer my assistance  frances withdrew to seek her aunt musing deeply on the character and extreme sensibility of the new acquaintance chance had brought to the cottage  the wounded officer followed her with his eyes as she moved with infantile grace through the door of his apartment and as she vanished from his view he observed  such an aunt and niece are seldom to be met with jack this seems a fairy but the aunt is angelic  you are doing well i see your enthusiasm for the sex holds its own  i should be ungrateful as well as insensible did i not bear testimony to the loveliness of miss peyton  a good motherly lady but as to love that is a matter of taste a few years younger with deference to her prudence and experience would accord better with my fancy  she must be under twenty said the other quickly  it depends on the way you count if you begin at the heel of life well but if you reckon downward as is most common i think she is nearer forty  you have mistaken an elder sister for the aunt said isabella laying her fair hand on the mouth of the invalid you must be silent your feelings are beginning to affect your frame  the entrance of dr sitgreaves who in some alarm noticed the increase of feverish symptoms in his patient enforced this mandate and the trooper withdrew to pay a visit of condolence to roanoke who had been an equal sufferer with himself in their last nights somersault to his great joy his man pronounced the steed to be equally convalescent with the master and lawton found that by dint of rubbing the animals limbs several hours without ceasing he was enabled to place his feet in what he called systematic motion orders were accordingly given to be in readiness to rejoin the troop at the four corners as soon as his master had shared in the bounty of the approaching banquet  in the meantime henry wharton entered the apartment of wellmere and by his sympathy succeeded in restoring the colonel to his own good graces the latter was consequently enabled to rise and prepared to meet a rival of whom he had spoken so lightly and as the result had proved with so little reason wharton knew that their misfortune as they both termed their defeat was owing to the others rashness but he forbore to speak of anything except the unfortunate accident which had deprived the english of their leader and to which he goodnaturedly ascribed their subsequent discomfiture  in short wharton said the colonel putting one leg out of bed it may be called a combination of untoward events your own ungovernable horse prevented my orders from being carried to the major in season to flank the rebels  very true replied the captain kicking a slipper towards the bed had we succeeded in getting a few good fires upon them in flank we should have sent these brave virginians to the right about  aye and that in doublequick time cried the colonel making the other leg follow its companion then it was necessary to rout the guides you know and the movement gave them the best possible opportunity to charge  yes said the other sending the second slipper after the first and this major dunwoodie never overlooks an advantage  i think if we had the thing to do over again continued the colonel raising himself on his feet we might alter the case very materially though the chief thing the rebels have now to boast of is my capture they were repulsed you saw in their attempt to drive us from the wood  at least they would have been had they made an attack said the captain throwing the rest of his clothes within reach of the colonel  why that is the same thing returned wellmere beginning to dress himself to assume such an attitude as to intimidate your enemy is the chief art of war  doubtless then you may remember in one of their charges they were completely routed  truetrue cried the colonel with animation had i been there to have improved that advantage we might have turned the table on the yankees saying which he displayed still greater animation in completing his toilet and he was soon prepared to make his appearance fully restored to his own good opinion and fairly persuaded that his capture was owing to casualties absolutely beyond the control of man  the knowledge that colonel wellmere was to be a guest at the table in no degree diminished the preparations which were already making for the banquet and sarah after receiving the compliments of the gentleman and making many kind inquiries after the state of his wounds proceeded in person to lend her counsel and taste to one of those labored entertainments which at that day were so frequent in country life and which are not entirely banished from our domestic economy at the present moment     chapter xiii        i will stand to and feed      although my last                            tempest  the savor of preparation which had been noticed by captain lawton began to increase within the walls of the cottage certain sweetsmelling odors that arose from the subterranean territories of caesar gave to the trooper the most pleasing assurances that his olfactory nerves which on such occasions were as acute as his eyes on others had faithfully performed their duty and for the benefit of enjoying the passing sweets as they arose the dragoon so placed himself at a window of the building that not a vapor charged with the spices of the east could exhale on its passage to the clouds without first giving its incense to his nose lawton however by no means indulged himself in this comfortable arrangement without first making such preparations to do meet honor to the feast as his scanty wardrobe would allow the uniform of his corps was always a passport to the best tables and this though somewhat tarnished by faithful service and unceremonious usage was properly brushed and decked out for the occasion his head which nature had ornamented with the blackness of a crow now shone with the whiteness of snow and his bony hand that so well became the saber peered from beneath a ruffle with something like maiden coyness the improvements of the dragoon went no further excepting that his boots shone with more than holiday splendor and his spurs glittered in the rays of the sun as became the pure ore of which they were composed  caesar moved through the apartments with a face charged with an importance exceeding even that which had accompanied him in his melancholy task of the morning the black had early returned from the errand on which he had been dispatched by the peddler and obedient to the commands of his mistress promptly appeared to give his services where his allegiance was due so serious indeed was his duty now becoming that it was only at odd moments he was enabled to impart to his sable brother who had been sent in attendance on miss singleton to the locusts any portion of the wonderful incidents of the momentous night he had so lately passed by ingeniously using however such occasions as accidentally offered caesar communicated so many of the heads of his tale as served to open the eyes of his visitor to their fullest width the gusto for the marvelous was innate in these sable worthies and miss peyton found it necessary to interpose her authority in order to postpone the residue of the history to a more befitting opportunity  ah miss jinnett said caesar shaking his head and looking all that he expressed twas awful to see johnny birch walk on a feet when he lie dead  this concluded the conversation though the black promised himself the satisfaction and did not fail to enjoy it of having many a gossip on the subject at a future period  the ghost thus happily laid the department of miss peyton flourished and by the time the afternoons sun had traveled a two hours journey from the meridian the formal procession from the kitchen to the parlor commenced under the auspices of caesar who led the van supporting a turkey on the palms of his withered hands with the dexterity of a balance master  next followed the servant of captain lawton bearing as he marched stiffly and walking wide as if allowing room for his steed a ham of true virginian flavor a present from the spinsters brother in accomac the supporter of this savory dish kept his eye on his trust with military precision and by the time he reached his destination it might be difficult to say which contained the most juice his own mouth or the accomac bacon  third in the line was to be seen the valet of colonel wellmere who carried in either hand chickens fricasseed and oyster patties  after him marched the attendant of dr sitgreaves who had instinctively seized an enormous tureen as most resembling matters he understood and followed on in place until the steams of the soup so completely bedimmed the spectacles he wore as a badge of office that on arriving at the scene of action he was compelled to deposit his freight on the floor until by removing the glasses he could see his way through the piles of reserved china and plate warmers  next followed another trooper whose duty it was to attend on captain singleton and as if apportioning his appetite to the feeble state of his master he had contented himself with conveying a pair of ducks roasted until their tempting fragrance began to make him repent his having so lately demolished a breakfast that had been provided for his masters sister with another prepared for himself  the white boy who belonged to the house brought up the rear groaning under a load of sundry dishes of vegetables that the cook by way of climax had unwittingly heaped on him  but this was far from all of the preparations for that days feast caesar had no sooner deposited his bird which but the week before had been flying amongst the highlands of dutchess little dreaming of so soon heading such a goodly assemblage than he turned mechanically on his heel and took up his line of march again for the kitchen in this evolution the black was imitated by his companions in succession and another procession to the parlor followed in the same order by this admirable arrangement whole flocks of pigeons certain bevies of quails shoals of flatfish bass and sundry woodcock found their way into the presence of the company  a third attack brought suitable quantities of potatoes onions beets coldslaw rice and all the other minutiae of a goodly dinner  the board now fairly groaned with american profusion and caesar glancing his eye over the show with a most approving conscience after readjusting every dish that had not been placed on the table with his own hands proceeded to acquaint the mistress of the revels that his task was happily accomplished  some half hour before the culinary array just recorded took place all the ladies disappeared much in the same unaccountable manner that swallows flee the approach of winter but the springtime of their return had arrived and the whole party were collected in an apartment that in consequence of its containing no side table and being furnished with a chintz coverlet settee was termed a withdrawingroom  the kindhearted spinster had deemed the occasion worthy not only of extraordinary preparations in the culinary department but had seen proper to deck her own person in garments suited to the guests whom it was now her happiness to entertain  on her head miss peyton wore a cap of exquisite lawn which was ornamented in front with a broad border of lace that spread from the face in such a manner as to admit of a display of artificial flowers clustered in a group on the summit of her fine forehead  the color of her hair was lost in the profusion of powder with which it was covered but a slight curling of the extremities in some degree relieved the formality of its arrangement and gave a look of feminine softness to the features  her dress was a rich heavy silk of violet color cut low around the bust with a stomacher of the same material that fitted close to the figure and exhibited the form from the shoulders to the waist in its true proportions below the dress was full and sufficiently showed that parsimony in attire was not a foible of the day a small loop displayed the beauty of the fabric to advantage and aided in giving majesty to the figure  the tall stature of the lady was heightened by shoes of the same material with the dress whose heels added more than an inch to the liberality of nature  the sleeves were short and close to the limb until they fell off at the elbows in large ruffles that hung in rich profusion from the arm when extended and duplicates and triplicates of lawn trimmed with dresden lace lent their aid in giving delicacy to a hand and arm that yet retained their whiteness and symmetry a treble row of large pearls closely encircled her throat and a handkerchief of lace partially concealed that part of the person that the silk had left exposed but which the experience of forty years had warned miss peyton should now be veiled  thus attired and standing erect with the lofty grace that distinguished the manners of that day the maiden would have looked into nothingness a bevy of modern belles  the taste of sarah had kept even pace with the decorations of her aunt and a dress differing in no respect from the one just described but in material and tints exhibited her imposing form to equal advantage the satin of her robe was of a pale bluish color twenty years did not however require the screen that was prudent in forty and nothing but an envious border of exquisite lace hid in some measure what the satin left exposed to view the upper part of the bust and the fine fall of the shoulders were blazing in all their native beauty and like the aunt the throat was ornamented by a treble row of pearls to correspond with which were rings of the same quality in the ears the head was without a cap and the hair drawn up from the countenance so as to give to the eye all the loveliness of a forehead as polished as marble and as white as snow a few straggling curls fell gracefully on the neck and a bouquet of artificial flowers was also placed like a coronet over her brow  miss singleton had resigned her brother to the advice of dr sitgreaves who had succeeded in getting his patient into a deep sleep after quieting certain feverish symptoms that followed the agitation of the interview the sister was persuaded by the observant mistress of the mansion to make one of the party and she sat by the side of sarah differing but little in appearance from that lady except in refusing the use of powder on her raven locks and that her unusually high forehead and large brilliant eyes gave an expression of thoughtfulness to her features that was possibly heightened by the paleness of her cheek  last and least but not the most unlovely in this display of female charms was the youngest daughter of mr wharton frances we have already mentioned left the city before she had attained to the age of fashionable womanhood a few adventurous spirits were already beginning to make inroads in those customs which had so long invaded the comforts of the fair sex and the youthful girl had ventured to trust her beauty to the height which nature had bestowed this was but little but that little was a masterpiece frances several times had determined in the course of the morning to bestow more than usual pains in the decoration of her person each time in succession as she formed this resolution she spent a few minutes in looking earnestly towards the north and then she as invariably changed it  at the appointed hour our heroine appeared in the drawingroom clothed in a robe of pale blue silk of a cut and fashion much like that worn by her sister her hair was left to the wild curls of nature its exuberance being confined to the crown of her head by a long low comb made of light tortoise shell a color barely distinguishable in the golden hue of her tresses her dress was without a plait or a wrinkle and fitted the form with an exactitude that might lead one to imagine the arch girl more than suspected the beauties it displayed a tucker of rich dresden lace softened the contour of the figure her head was without ornament but around her throat was a necklace of gold clasped in front with a rich cornelian  once and once only as they moved towards the repast did lawton see a foot thrust itself from beneath the folds of her robe and exhibit its little beauties encased in a slipper of blue silk clasped close to the shape by a buckle of brilliants the trooper caught himself sighing as he thought though it was good for nothing in the stirrup how enchantingly it would grace a minuet  as the black appeared on the threshold of the room making a low reverence which has been interpreted for some centuries into dinner waits mr wharton clad in a dress of drab bedecked with enormous buttons advanced formally to miss singleton and bending his powdered head nearly to the level of the hand he extended received hers in return  dr sitgreaves offered the same homage to miss peyton and met with equal favor the lady first pausing to draw on her gloves  colonel wellmere was honored with a smile from sarah while performing a similar duty and frances gave the ends of her taper fingers to captain lawton with maiden bashfulness  much time and some trouble were expended before the whole party were to the great joy of caesar comfortably arranged around the table with proper attention to all points of etiquette and precedence the black well knew the viands were not improving and though abundantly able to comprehend the disadvantage of eating a cold dinner it greatly exceeded his powers of philosophy to weigh all the latent consequences to society which depend on social order  for the first ten minutes all but the captain of dragoons found themselves in a situation much to their liking even lawton would have been perfectly happy had not excess of civility on the part of his host and miss jeanette peyton kept him from the more agreeable occupation of tasting dishes he did want in order to decline those he did not at length however the repast was fairly commenced and a devoted application to the viands was more eloquent than a thousand words in favor of dinahs skill  next came drinking with the ladies but as the wine was excellent and the glasses ample the trooper bore this interruption with consummate good nature nay so fearful was he of giving offense and of omitting any of the nicer points of punctilio that having commenced this courtesy with the lady who sat next him he persevered until not one of his fair companions could with justice reproach him with partiality in this particular  long abstemiousness from anything like generous wine might plead the excuse of captain lawton especially when exposed to so strong a temptation as that now before him mr wharton had been one of a set of politicians in new york whose principal exploits before the war had been to assemble and pass sage opinions on the signs of the times under the inspiration of certain liquor made from a grape that grew on the south side of the island of madeira and which found its way into the colonies of north america through the medium of the west indies sojourning awhile in the western archipelago by way of proving the virtues of the climate a large supply of this cordial had been drawn from his storehouse in the city and some of it now sparkled in a bottle before the captain blushing in the rays of the sun which were passing obliquely through it like amber  though the meat and vegetables had made their entrance with perfect order and propriety their exeunt was effected much in the manner of a retreat of militia the point was to clear the board something after the fabled practice of the harpies and by dint of scrambling tossing breaking and spilling the remnants of the overflowing repast disappeared and now another series of processions commenced by virtue of which a goodly display of pastry with its usual accompaniments garnished the table  mr wharton poured out a glass of wine for the lady who sat on his right hand and pushing the bottle to a guest said with a low bow  we are to be honored with a toast from miss singleton  although there was nothing more in this movement than occurred every day on such occasions yet the lady trembled colored and grew pale again seemingly endeavoring to rally her thoughts until by her agitation she had excited the interest of the whole party when by an effort and in a manner as if she had striven in vain to think of another isabella said faintly  major dunwoodie  the health was drunk cheerfully by all but colonel wellmere who wet his lips and drew figures on the table with some of the liquor he had spilled  at length colonel wellmere broke silence by saying aloud to captain lawton  i suppose sir this mr dunwoodie will receive promotion in the rebel army for the advantage my misfortune gave him over my command  the trooper had supplied the wants of nature to his perfect satisfaction and perhaps with the exception of washington and his immediate commander there was no mortal whose displeasure he regarded a tittle first helping himself therefore to a little of his favorite bottle he replied with admirable coolness  colonel wellmere your pardon major dunwoodie owes his allegiance to the confederated states of north america and where he owes it he pays it such a man is no rebel promoted i hope he may be both because he deserves it and because i am next in rank in the corps and i know not what you call a misfortune unless you deem meeting the virginia horse as such  we will not differ about terms sir said the colonel haughtily i spoke as duty to my sovereign prompted but do you not call the loss of a commander a misfortune to a party  it certainly may be so said the trooper with emphasis  miss peyton will you favor us with a toast cried the master of the house anxious to stop this dialogue  the lady bowed her head with dignity as she named general montrose and the longabsent bloom stole lightly over her features  there is no term more doubtful than that word misfortune said the surgeon regardless of the nice maneuvers of the host some deem one thing a misfortune others its opposite misfortune begets misfortune life is a misfortune for it may be the means of enduring misfortune and death is a misfortune as it abridges the enjoyments of life  it is a misfortune that our mess has no such wine as this interrupted the trooper  we will pledge you a sentiment in it sir as it seems to suit your taste said mr wharton  lawton filled to the brim and drank a speedy peace or a stirring war  i drink your toast captain lawton though i greatly distrust your construction of activity said the surgeon in my poor judgment cavalry should be kept in the rear to improve a victory and not sent in front to gain it such may be said to be their natural occupation if the term can be used in reference to so artificial a body for all history shows that the horse have done most when held in reserve  this dissertation uttered in a sufficiently didactic manner was a hint that miss peyton did not neglect she arose and retired followed by her juniors  nearly at the same moment mr wharton and his son made an apology for their absence which was required on account of the death of a near neighbor and withdrew  the retreat of the ladies was the signal for the appearance of the surgeons cigar which being established in a corner of his mouth in a certain knowing way caused not the slightest interruption to his discourse  if anything can sweeten captivity and wounds it must be the happiness of suffering in the society of the ladies who have left us gallantly observed the colonel as he resumed his seat after closing the door  sympathy and kindness have their influence on the human system returned the surgeon knocking the ashes from his cigar with the tip of a little finger in the manner of an adept the connection is intimate between the moral and physical feelings but still to accomplish a cure and restore nature to the healthy tone it has lost from disease or accident requires more than can flow from unguided sympathies in such cases the lights the surgeon accidentally caught the eye of the trooper and he paused taking two or three hasty puffs he essayed to finish the sentence in such cases the knowledge that flows from the lights  you were saying sir said colonel wellmere sipping his wine  the purport of my remark went to say continued sitgreaves turning his back on lawton that a bread poultice would not set a broken arm  more is the pity cried the trooper for next to eating the nourishment could not be more innocently applied  to you colonel wellmere said the surgeon as a man of education i can with safety appeal the colonel bowed you must have observed the dreadful havoc made in your ranks by the men who were led by this gentleman the colonel looked grave again how when blows lighted on their frames life was invariably extinguished beyond all hope of scientific reparation how certain yawning wounds were inflicted that must set at defiance the art of the most experienced practitioner now sir to you i triumphantly appeal therefore to know whether your detachment would not have been as effectually defeated if the men had all lost a right arm for instance as if they had all lost their heads  the triumph of your appeal is somewhat hasty sir said wellmere  is the cause of liberty advanced a step by such injudicious harshness in the field continued the surgeon bent on the favorite principle of his life  i am yet to learn that the cause of liberty is in any manner advanced by the services of any gentleman in the rebel army rejoined the colonel  not liberty good god for what then are we contending  slavery sir yes even slavery you are putting the tyranny of a mob on the throne of a kind and lenient prince where is the consistency of your boasted liberty  consistency repeated the surgeon looking about him a little wildly at hearing such sweeping charges against a cause he had so long thought holy  aye sir your consistency your congress of sages have published a manifesto wherein they set forth the equality of political rights  tis true and it is done most ably  i say nothing of its ability but if true why not set your slaves at liberty this argument which is thought by most of the colonels countrymen a triumphant answer to a thousand eloquent facts lost none of its weight by the manner in which it was uttered  every american feels humbled at the necessity of vindicating his country from the apparent inconsistency and injustice of the laws alluded to his feelings are much like those of an honorable man who is compelled to exonerate himself from a disgraceful charge although he may know the accusation to be false at the bottom sitgreaves had much good sense and thus called on he took up the cudgels of argument in downright earnest  we deem it a liberty to have the deciding voice in the councils by which we are governed we think it a hardship to be ruled by the king of a people who live at a distance of three thousand miles and who cannot and who do not feel a single political interest in common with ourselves i say nothing of oppression the child was of age and was entitled to the privileges of majority in such cases there is but one tribunal to which to appeal for a nations rightsit is power and we now make the appeal  such doctrines may suit your present purposes said wellmere with a sneer but i apprehend it is opposed to all the opinions and practices of civilized nations  it is in conformity with the practices of all nations said the surgeon returning the nod and smile of lawton who enjoyed the good sense of his comrade as much as he disliked what he called his medical talk who would be ruled when he can rule the only rational ground to take is that every community has a right to govern itself so that in no manner it violates the laws of god  and is holding your fellow creatures in bondage in conformity to those laws asked the colonel impressively  the surgeon took another glass and hemming once returned to the combat  sir said he slavery is of very ancient origin and it seems to have been confined to no particular religion or form of government every nation of civilized europe does or has held their fellow creatures in this kind of duresse  you will except great britain cried the colonel proudly  no sir continued the surgeon confidently feeling that he was now carrying the war out of his own country i cannot except great britain it was her children her ships and her laws that first introduced the practice into these states and on her institutions the judgment must fall there is not a foot of ground belonging to england in which a negro would be useful that has not its slave england herself has none but england is overflowing with physical force a part of which she is obliged to maintain in the shape of paupers the same is true of france and most other european countries so long as we were content to remain colonies nothing was said of our system of domestic slavery but now when we are resolute to obtain as much freedom as the vicious system of metropolitan rule has left us that which is englands gift has become our reproach will your master liberate the slaves of his subjects should he succeed in subduing the new states or will he condemn the whites to the same servitude as that in which he has been so long content to see the blacks it is true we continue the practice but we must come gradually to the remedy or create an evil greater than that which we endure at present doubtless as we advance the manumission of our slaves will accompany us until happily these fair regions shall exist without a single image of the creator that is held in a state which disqualifies him to judge of that creators goodness  it will be remembered that doctor sitgreaves spoke forty years ago and wellmere was unable to contradict his prophetic assertion  finding the subject getting to be knotty the englishman retired to the apartment in which the ladies had assembled and seated by the side of sarah he found a more pleasing employment in relating the events of fashionable life in the metropolis and in recalling the thousand little anecdotes of their former associates miss peyton was a pleased listener as she dispensed the bounties of the tea table and sarah frequently bowed her blushing countenance to her needlework as her face glowed at the flattering remarks of her companion  the dialogue we have related established a perfect truce between the surgeon and his comrade and the former having paid a visit to singleton they took their leave of the ladies and mounted the former to visit the wounded at the encampment and the latter to rejoin his troop but their movements were arrested at the gate by an occurrence that we shall relate in the next chapter     chapter xiv        i see no more those white locks thinly spread      round the bald polish of that honored head      no more that meek that suppliant look in prayer      nor that pure faith that gave it force are there      but he is blest and i lament no more      a wise good man contented to be poor                                             crabbe  we have already said that the customs of america leave the dead but a short time in sight of the mourners and the necessity of providing for his own safety had compelled the peddler to abridge even this brief space in the confusion and agitation produced by the events we have recorded the death of the elder birch had occurred unnoticed but a sufficient number of the immediate neighbors were hastily collected and the ordinary rites of sepulture were now about to be paid to the deceased it was the approach of this humble procession that arrested the movements of the trooper and his comrade four men supported the body on a rude bier and four others walked in advance ready to relieve their friends from their burden the peddler walked next the coffin and by his side moved katy haynes with a most determined aspect of woe and next to the mourners came mr wharton and the english captain two or three old men and women with a few straggling boys brought up the rear captain lawton sat in his saddle in rigid silence until the bearers came opposite to his position and then for the first time harvey raised his eyes from the ground and saw the enemy that he dreaded so near him the first impulse of the peddler was certainly flight but recovering his recollection he fixed his eye on the coffin of his parent and passed the dragoon with a firm step but swelling heart the trooper slowly lifted his cap and continued uncovered until mr wharton and his son had moved by when accompanied by the surgeon he rode leisurely in the rear maintaining an inflexible silence  caesar emerged from the cellar kitchen of the cottage and with a face of settled solemnity added himself to the number of the followers of the funeral though with a humble mien and at a most respectful distance from the horsemen the old negro had placed around his arm a little above the elbow a napkin of unsullied whiteness it being the only time since his departure from the city that he had enjoyed an opportunity of exhibiting himself in the garniture of servile mourning he was a great lover of propriety and had been a little stimulated to this display by a desire to show his sable friend from georgia all the decencies of a new york funeral and the ebullition of his zeal went off very well producing no other result than a mild lecture from miss peyton at his return on the fitness of things the attendance of the black was thought well enough in itself but the napkin was deemed a superfluous exhibition of ceremony at the funeral of a man who had performed all the menial offices in his own person  the graveyard was an inclosure on the grounds of mr wharton which had been fenced with stone and set apart for the purpose by that gentleman some years before it was not however intended as a burial place for any of his own family until the fire which raged as the british troops took possession of new york had laid trinity in ashes a goodly gilded tablet on its walls proclaimed the virtues of his deceased parents and beneath a flag of marble in one of the aisles of the church their bones were left to molder in aristocratical repose captain lawton made a movement as if he was disposed to follow the procession when it left the highway to enter the field which contained the graves of the humble dead but he was recalled to recollection by a hint from his companion that he was taking the wrong road  of all the various methods which have been adopted by man for the disposal of his earthly remains which do you prefer captain lawton said the surgeon as they separated from the little procession in some countries the body is exposed to be devoured by wild beasts in others it is suspended in the air to exhale its substance in the manner of decomposition in other regions it is consumed on the funeral pile and again it is inhumed in the bowels of the earth every people have their own particular fashion and to which do you give the preference  all are agreeable said the trooper following the group they had left with his eyes though the speediest interments give the cleanest fields of which are you an admirer  the last as practiced by ourselves for the other three are destructive of all the opportunities for dissection whereas in the last the coffin can lie in peaceful decency while the remains are made to subserve the useful purposes of science ah captain lawton i enjoy comparatively but few opportunities of such a nature to what i expected on entering the army  to what may these pleasures numerically amount in a year said the captain withdrawing his gaze from the graveyard  within a dozen upon my honor my best picking is when the corps is detached for when we are with the main army there are so many boys to be satisfied that i seldom get a good subject those youngsters are as wasteful as prodigals and as greedy as vultures  a dozen echoed the trooper in surprise why i furnish you that number with my own hands  ah jack returned the doctor approaching the subject with great tenderness of manner it is seldom i can do anything with your patients you disfigure them woefully believe me john when i tell you as a friend that your system is all wrong you unnecessarily destroy life and then you injure the body so that it is unfit for the only use that can be made of a dead man  the trooper maintained a silence which he thought would be the most probable means of preserving peace between them and the surgeon turning his head from taking a last look at the burial as they rode around the foot of the hill that shut the valley from their sight continued with a suppressed sigh  one might get a natural death from that graveyard tonight if there was but time and opportunity the patient must be the father of the lady we saw this morning  the petticoat doctorshe with the aurora borealis complexion said the trooper with a smile that began to cause uneasiness to his companion but the lady was not the gentlemans daughter only his medicopetticoat attendant and the harvey whose name was made to rime with every word in her song is the renowned peddler spy  what he who unhorsed you  no man ever unhorsed me dr sitgreaves said the dragoon gravely i fell by mischance of roanoke rider and beast kissed the earth together  a warm embrace from the love spots it left on your cuticle tis a thousand pities that you cannot find where the tattling rascal lies hid  he followed his fathers body  and you let him pass cried the surgeon checking his horse let us return immediately and take him tomorrow you shall have him hanged jackand damn him ill dissect him  softly softly my dear archibald would you arrest a man while paying the last offices to a dead father leave him to me and i pledge myself he shall have justice  the doctor muttered his dissatisfaction at any postponement of vengeance but he was compelled to acquiesce from a regard to his reputation for propriety and they continued their ride to the quarters of the corps engaged in various discussions concerning the welfare of the human body  birch supported the grave and collected manner that was thought becoming in a male mourner on such occasions and to katy was left the part of exhibiting the tenderness of the softer sex there are some people whose feelings are of such nature that they cannot weep unless it be in proper company and the spinster was a good deal addicted to this congregational virtue after casting her eyes around the small assemblage the housekeeper found the countenances of the few females who were present fixed on her in solemn expectation and the effect was instantaneous the maiden really wept and she gained no inconsiderable sympathy and some reputation for a tender heart from the spectators the muscles of the peddlers face were seen to move and as the first clod of earth fell on the tenement of his father sending up that dull hollow sound that speaks so eloquently the mortality of man his whole frame was for an instant convulsed he bent his body down as if in pain his fingers worked while the hands hung lifeless by his side and there was an expression in his countenance that seemed to announce a writhing of the soul but it was not unresisted and it was transient he stood erect drew a long breath and looked around him with an elevated face that even seemed to smile with a consciousness of having obtained the mastery the grave was soon filled a rough stone placed at either extremity marked its position and the turf whose faded vegetation was adapted to the fortunes of the deceased covered the little hillock with the last office of seemliness this office ended the neighbors who had officiously pressed forward to offer their services in performing their solemn duty paused and lifting their hats stood looking towards the mourner who now felt himself to be really alone in the world uncovering his head also the peddler hesitated a moment to gather energy and spoke  my friends and neighbors he said i thank you for assisting me to bury my dead out of my sight  a solemn pause succeeded the customary address and the group dispersed in silence some few walking with the mourners back to their own habitation but respectfully leaving them at its entrance the peddler and katy were followed into the building by one man however who was well known to the surrounding country by the significant term of a speculator katy saw him enter with a heart that palpitated with dreadful forebodings but harvey civilly handed him a chair and evidently was prepared for the visit  the peddler went to the door and taking a cautious glance about the valley quickly returned and commenced the following dialogue  the sun has just left the top of the eastern hill my time presses me here is the deed for the house and lot everything is done according to law  the other took the paper and conned its contents with a deliberation that proceeded partly from his caution and partly from the unlucky circumstance of his education having been much neglected when a youth the time occupied in this tedious examination was employed by harvey in gathering together certain articles which he intended to include in the stores that were to leave the habitation with himself katy had already inquired of the peddler whether the deceased had left a will and she saw the bible placed in the bottom of a new pack which she had made for his accommodation with a most stoical indifference but as the six silver spoons were laid carefully by its side a sudden twinge of her conscience objected to such a palpable waste of property and she broke silence  when you marry harvey you may miss those spoons  i never shall marry  well if you dont theres no occasion to make rash promises even to yourself one never knows what one may do in such a case i should like to know of what use so many spoons can be to a single man for my part i think it is a duty for every man who is well provided to have a wife and family to maintain  at the time when katy expressed this sentiment the fortune of women in her class of life consisted of a cow a bed the labors of their own hands in the shape of divers pillowcases blankets and sheets with where fortune was unusually kind a half dozen silver spoons the spinster herself had obtained all the other necessaries by her own industry and prudence and it can easily be imagined that she saw the articles she had long counted her own vanish in the enormous pack with a dissatisfaction that was in no degree diminished by the declaration that had preceded the act harvey however disregarded her opinions and feelings and continued his employment of filling the pack which soon grew to something like the ordinary size of the peddlers burden  im rather timersome about this conveyance said the purchaser having at length waded through the covenants of the deed  why so  im afraid it wont stand good in law i know that two of the neighbors leave home tomorrow morning to have the place entered for confiscation and if i should give forty pounds and lose it all twould be a dead pull back to me  they can only take my right said the peddler pay me two hundred dollars and the house is yours you are a wellknown whig and you at least they wont trouble as harvey spoke there was a strange bitterness of manner mingled with the shrewd care he expressed concerning the sale of his property  say one hundred and it is a bargain returned the man with a grin that he meant for a goodnatured smile  a bargain echoed the peddler in surprise i thought the bargain already made  nothing is a bargain said the purchaser with a chuckle until papers are delivered and the money paid in hand  you have the paper  aye and will keep it if you will excuse the money come say one hundred and fifty and i wont be hard herehere is just the money  the peddler looked from the window and saw with dismay that the evening was fast advancing and knew well that he endangered his life by remaining in the dwelling after dark yet he could not tolerate the idea of being defrauded in this manner in a bargain that had already been fairly made he hesitated  well said the purchaser rising mayhap you can find another man to trade with between this and morning but if you dont your title wont be worth much afterwards  take it harvey said katy who felt it impossible to resist a tender like the one before her for the purchase money was in english guineas her voice roused the peddler and a new idea seemed to strike him  i agree to the price he said and turning to the spinster he placed part of the money in her hand as he continued had i other means to pay you i would have lost all rather than suffer myself to be defrauded of part  you may lose all yet muttered the stranger with a sneer as he rose and left the building  yes said katy following him with her eyes he knows your failing harvey he thinks with me now the old gentleman is gone you will want a careful body to take care of your concerns  the peddler was busied in making arrangements for his departure and he took no notice of this insinuation while the spinster returned again to the attack she had lived so many years in expectation of a termination to her hopes so different from that which now seemed likely to occur that the idea of separation began to give her more uneasiness than she had thought herself capable of feeling about a man so destitute and friendless  have you another house to go to inquired katy  providence will provide me with a home  yes said the housekeeper but maybe twill not be to your liking  the poor must not be difficult  im sure im anything but a difficult body cried the spinster very hastily but i love to see things becoming and in their places yet i wouldnt be hard to persuade to leave this place myself i cant say i altogether like the ways of the people hereabouts  the valley is lovely said the peddler with fervor and the people like all the race of man but to me it matters nothing all places are now alike and all faces equally strange as he spoke he dropped the article he was packing from his hand and seated himself on a chest with a look of vacant misery  not so not so said katy shoving her chair nearer to the place where the peddler sat not so harvey you must know me at least my face cannot be strange to you  birch turned his eyes slowly on her countenance which exhibited more of feeling and less of self than he had ever seen there before he took her hand kindly and his own features lost some of their painful expression as he said  yes good woman you at least are not a stranger to me you may do me partial justice when others revile me possibly your feelings may lead you to say something in my defense  that i will that i would said katy eagerly i will defend you harvey to the last drop let me hear them that dare to revile you you say true harvey i am partial and just to you what if you do like the king i have often heard it said he was at the bottom a good man but theres no religion in the old country for everybody allows the ministers are desperate bad  the peddler paced the floor in evident distress of mind his eyes had a look of wildness that katy had never witnessed before and his step was measured with a dignity that appalled the housekeeper  while my father lived murmured harvey unable to smother his feelings there was one who read my heart and oh what a consolation to return from my secret marches of danger and the insults and wrongs that i suffered to receive his blessing and his praise but he is gone he continued stopping and gazing wildly towards the corner that used to hold the figure of his parent and who is there to do me justice  why harvey harvey  yes there is one who will who must know me before i die oh it is dreadful to die and leave such a name behind me  dont talk of dying harvey said the spinster glancing her eye around the room and pushing the wood in the fire to obtain a light from the blaze  the ebullition of feeling in the peddler was over it had been excited by the events of the past day and a vivid perception of his sufferings it was not long however that passion maintained an ascendency ever the reason of this singular man and perceiving that the night had already thrown an obscurity around objects without doors he hastily threw his pack over his shoulders and taking katy kindly by the hand in leavetaking  it is painful to part with even you good woman he said but the hour has come and i must go what is left in the house is yours to me it could be of no use and it may serve to make you more comfortable farewellwe shall meet hereafter  in the regions of darkness cried a voice that caused the peddler to sink on the chest from which he had risen in despair  what another pack mr birch and so well stuffed so soon  have you not done evil enough cried the peddler regaining his firmness and springing on his feet with energy is it not enough to harass the last moments of a dying manto impoverish me what more would you have  your blood said the skinner with cool malignity  and for money cried harvey bitterly like the ancient judas you would grow rich with the price of blood  aye and a fair price it is my gentleman fifty guineas nearly the weight of that carcass of yours in gold  here said katy promptly here are fifteen guineas and these drawers and this bed are all mine if you will give harvey but one hours start from the door they shall be yours  one hour said the skinner showing his teeth and looking with a longing eye at the money  but a single hour here take the money  hold cried harvey put no faith in the miscreant  she may do what she pleases with her faith said the skinner with malignant pleasure but i have the money in good keeping as for you mr birch we will bear your insolence for the fifty guineas that are to pay for your gallows  go on said the peddler proudly take me to major dunwoodie he at least may be kind although just  i can do better than by marching so far in such disgraceful company this mr dunwoodie has let one or two tories go at large but the troop of captain lawton is quartered some half mile nearer and his receipt will get me the reward as soon as his majors how relish you the idea of supping with captain lawton this evening mr birch  give me my money or set harvey free cried the spinster in alarm  your bribe was not enough good woman unless there is money in this bed thrusting his bayonet through the ticking and ripping it for some distance he took a malicious satisfaction in scattering its contents about the room  if cried the housekeeper losing sight of her personal danger in care for her newlyacquired property there is law in the land i will be righted  the law of the neutral ground is the law of the strongest but your tongue is not as long as my bayonet you had therefore best not set them at loggerheads or you might be the loser  a figure stood in the shadow of the door as if afraid to be seen in the group of skinners but a blaze of light raised by some articles thrown in the fire by his persecutors showed the peddler the face of the purchaser of his little domain occasionally there was some whispering between this man and the skinner nearest him that induced harvey to suspect he had been the dupe of a contrivance in which that wretch had participated it was however too late to repine and he followed the party from the house with a firm and collected tread as if marching to a triumph and not to a gallows in passing through the yard the leader of the band fell over a billet of wood and received a momentary hurt from the fall exasperated at the incident the fellow sprang on his feet filling the air with execrations  the curse of heaven light on the log he exclaimed the night is too dark for us to move in throw that brand of fire in yon pile of tow to light up the scene  hold roared the speculator youll fire the house  and see the farther said the other hurling the brand in the midst of the combustibles in an instant the building was in flames come on let us move towards the heights while we have light to pick our road  villain cried the exasperated purchaser is this your friendshipthis my reward for kidnapping the peddler  twould be wise to move more from the light if you mean to entertain us with abuse or we may see too well to miss our mark cried the leader of the gang the next instant he was as good as his threat but happily missed the terrified speculator and equally appalled spinster who saw herself again reduced from comparative wealth to poverty by the blow prudence dictated to the pair a speedy retreat and the next morning the only remains of the dwelling of the peddler was the huge chimney we have already mentioned     chapter xv        trifles light as air      are to the jealous confirmations strong      as proofs of holy writ                                     othello  the weather which had been mild and clear since the storm now changed with the suddenness of the american climate towards evening the cold blasts poured down from the mountains and flurries of snow plainly indicated that the month of november had arrived a season whose temperature varies from the heats of summer to the cold of winter frances had stood at the window of her own apartment watching the slow progress of the funeral procession with a melancholy that was too deep to be excited by the spectacle there was something in the sad office that was in unison with her feelings as she gazed around she saw the trees bending to the force of the wind that swept through the valley with an impetuosity that shook even the buildings and the forest that had so lately glittered in the sun with its variegated hues was fast losing its loveliness as the leaves were torn from the branches and were driving irregularly before the eddies of the blast a few of the southern dragoons who were patrolling the passes which led to the encampment of the corps could be distinguished at a distance on the heights bending to their pommels as they faced the keen air which had so lately traversed the great freshwater lakes and drawing their watch coats about them in tighter folds  frances witnessed the disappearance of the wooden tenement of the deceased as it was slowly lowered from the light of day and the sight added to the chilling dreariness of the view captain singleton was sleeping under the care of his own man while his sister had been persuaded to take possession of her room for the purpose of obtaining the repose of which her last nights journeying had robbed her the apartment of miss singleton communicated with the room occupied by the sisters through a private door as well as through the ordinary passage of the house this door was partly open and frances moved towards it with the benevolent intention of ascertaining the situation of her guest when the surprised girl saw her whom she had thought to be sleeping not only awake but employed in a manner that banished all probability of present repose the black tresses that during the dinner had been drawn in close folds over the crown of the head were now loosened and fell in profusion over her shoulders and bosom imparting a slight degree of wildness to her countenance the chilling white of her complexion was strongly contrasted with eyes of the deepest black that were fixed in rooted attention on a picture she held in her hand frances hardly breathed as she was enabled by a movement of isabella to see that it was the figure of a man in the wellknown dress of the southern horse but she gasped for breath and instinctively laid her hand on her heart to quell its throbbings as she thought she recognized the lineaments that were so deeply seated in her own imagination frances felt she was improperly prying into the sacred privacy of another but her emotions were too powerful to permit her to speak and she drew back to a chair where she still retained a view of the stranger from whose countenance she felt it to be impossible to withdraw her eyes isabella was too much engrossed by her own feelings to discover the trembling figure of the witness to her actions and she pressed the inanimate image to her lips with an enthusiasm that denoted the most intense passion the expression of the countenance of the fair stranger was so changeable and the transitions were so rapid that frances had scarcely time to distinguish the character of the emotion before it was succeeded by another equally powerful and equally attractive admiration and sorrow were however the preponderating passions the latter was indicated by large drops that fell from her eyes on the picture and which followed each other over her cheek at such intervals as seemed to pronounce the grief too heavy to admit of the ordinary demonstrations of sorrow every movement of isabella was marked by an enthusiasm that was peculiar to her nature and every passion in its turn triumphed in her breast the fury of the wind as it whistled round the angles of the building was in consonance with those feelings and she rose and moved to a window of her apartment her figure was now hid from the view of frances who was about to rise and approach her guest when tones of a thrilling melody chained her in breathless silence to the spot the notes were wild and the voice not powerful but the execution exceeded anything that frances had ever heard and she stood endeavoring to stifle the sounds of her own gentle breathing until the following song was concluded       cold blow the blasts oer the tops of the mountain        and bare is the oak on the hill      slowly the vapors exhale from the fountain        and bright gleams the icebordered rill      all nature is seeking its annual rest      but the slumbers of peace have deserted my breast       long has the storm poured its weight on my nation        and long have her braves stood the shock      long has her chieftain ennobled his station        a bulwark on libertys rock      unlicensed ambition relaxes its toil      yet blighted affection represses my smile       abroad the wild fury of winter is lowering        and leafless and drear is the tree      but the vertical sun of the south appears pouring        its fierce killing heats upon me      without all the seasons chill symptoms begin      but the fire of passion is raging within  frances abandoned her whole soul to the suppressed melody of the music though the language of the song expressed a meaning which united with certain events of that and the preceding day left a sensation of uneasiness in the bosom of the warmhearted girl to which she had hitherto been a stranger isabella moved from the window as her last tones melted on the ear of her admiring listener and for the first time her eye rested on the pallid face of the intruder a glow of fire lighted the countenance of both at the same instant and the blue eye of frances met the brilliant black one of her guest for a single moment and both fell in abashed confusion on the carpet they advanced however until they met and had taken each others hand before either ventured again to look her companion in the face  this sudden change in the weather and perhaps the situation of my brother have united to make me melancholy miss wharton said isabella in a low tone and in a voice that trembled as she spoke  tis thought you have little to apprehend for your brother said frances in the same embarrassed manner had you seen him when he was brought in by major dunwoodie  frances paused with a feeling of conscious shame for which she could not account and in raising her eyes she saw isabella studying her countenance with an earnestness that again drove the blood tumultuously to her temples  you were speaking of major dunwoodie said isabella faintly  he was with captain singleton  do you know dunwoodie have you seen him often  once more frances ventured to look her guest in the face and again she met the piercing eyes bent on her as if to search her inmost heart speak miss wharton is major dunwoodie known to you  he is my relative said frances appalled at the manner of the other  a relative echoed miss singleton in what degreespeak miss wharton i conjure you to speak  our parents were cousins faintly replied frances  and he is to be your husband said the stranger impetuously  frances felt shocked and all her pride awakened by this direct attack upon her feelings and she raised her eyes from the floor to her interrogator a little proudly when the pale cheek and quivering lip of isabella removed her resentment in a moment  it is true my conjecture is true speak to me miss wharton i conjure you in mercy to my feelings to tell medo you love dunwoodie there was a plaintive earnestness in the voice of miss singleton that disarmed frances of all resentment and the only answer she could make was to hide her burning face between her hands as she sank back in a chair to conceal her confusion  isabella paced the floor in silence for several minutes until she had succeeded in conquering the violence of her feelings when she approached the place where frances yet sat endeavoring to exclude the eyes of her companion from reading the shame expressed in her countenance and taking the hand of the other she spoke with an evident effort at composure  pardon me miss wharton if my ungovernable feelings have led me into impropriety the powerful motivethe cruel reasonshe hesitated frances now raised her face and their eyes once more met they fell in each others arms and laid their burning cheeks together the embrace was longwas ardent and sincerebut neither spoke and on separating frances retired to her own room without further explanation  while this extraordinary scene was acting in the room of miss singleton matters of great importance were agitated in the drawingroom the disposition of the fragments of such a dinner as the one we have recorded was a task that required no little exertion and calculation notwithstanding several of the small game had nestled in the pocket of captain lawtons man and even the assistant of dr sitgreaves had calculated the uncertainty of his remaining long in such good quarters still there was more left unconsumed than the prudent miss peyton knew how to dispose of to advantage caesar and his mistress had therefore a long and confidential communication on this important business and the consequence was that colonel wellmere was left to the hospitality of sarah wharton all the ordinary topics of conversation were exhausted when the colonel with a little of the uneasiness that is in some degree inseparable from conscious error touched lightly on the transactions of the preceding day  we little thought miss wharton when i first saw this mr dunwoodie in your house in queen street that he was to be the renowned warrior he has proved himself said wellmere endeavoring to smile away his chagrin  renowned when we consider the enemy he overcame said sarah with consideration for her companions feelings twas unfortunate indeed in every respect that you met with the accident or doubtless the royal arms would have triumphed in their usual manner  and yet the pleasure of such society as this accident has introduced me to would more than repay the pain of a mortified spirit and wounded body added the colonel in a manner of peculiar softness  i hope the latter is but trifling said sarah stooping to hide her blushes under the pretext of biting a thread from the work on her knee  trifling indeed compared to the former returned the colonel in the same manner ah miss wharton it is in such moments that we feel the full value of friendship and sympathy  those who have never tried it cannot easily imagine what a rapid progress a warmhearted female can make in love in the short space of half an hour particularly where there is a predisposition to the distemper sarah found the conversation when it began to touch on friendship and sympathy too interesting to venture her voice with a reply she however turned her eyes on the colonel and saw him gazing at her fine face with an admiration that was quite as manifest and much more soothing than any words could make it  their têteàtête was uninterrupted for an hour and although nothing that would be called decided by an experienced matron was said by the gentleman he uttered a thousand things that delighted his companion who retired to her rest with a lighter heart than she had felt since the arrest of her brother by the americans     chapter xvi       and let me the canakin clink clink     and let me the canakin clink         a soldiers a man         a lifes but a span     why then let a soldier drink                                                 othello  the position held by the corps of dragoons we have already said was a favorite place of halting with their commander a cluster of some half dozen small and dilapidated buildings formed what from the circumstance of two roads intersecting each other at right angles was called the village of the four corners as usual one of the most imposing of these edifices had been termed in the language of the day a house of entertainment for man and beast on a rough board suspended from the gallowslooking post that had supported the ancient sign was however written in red chalk elizabeth flanagan her hotel an ebullition of the wit of some of the idle wags of the corps the matron whose name had thus been exalted to an office of such unexpected dignity ordinarily discharged the duties of a female sutler washerwoman and to use the language of katy haynes petticoat doctor to the troops she was the widow of a soldier who had been killed in the service and who like herself was a native of a distant island and had early tried his fortune in the colonies of north america she constantly migrated with the troops and it was seldom that they became stationary for two days at a time but the little cart of the bustling woman was seen driving into the encampment loaded with such articles as she conceived would make her presence most welcome with a celerity that seemed almost supernatural betty took up her ground and commenced her occupation sometimes the cart itself was her shop at others the soldiers made her a rude shelter of such materials as offered but on the present occasion she had seized on a vacant building and by dint of stuffing the dirty breeches and halfdried linen of the troopers into the broken windows to exclude the cold which had now become severe she formed what she herself had pronounced to be most illigant lodgings the men were quartered in the adjacent barns and the officers collected in the hotel flanagan as they facetiously called headquarters betty was well known to every trooper in the corps could call each by his christian or nickname as best suited her fancy and although absolutely intolerable to all whom habit had not made familiar with her virtues was a general favorite with these partisan warriors her faults were a trifling love of liquor excessive filthiness and a total disregard of all the decencies of language her virtues an unbounded love for her adopted country perfect honesty when dealing on certain known principles with the soldiery and great good nature added to these betty had the merit of being the inventor of that beverage which is so well known at the present hour to all the patriots who make a winters march between the commercial and political capitals of this great state and which is distinguished by the name of cocktail elizabeth flanagan was peculiarly well qualified by education and circumstances to perfect this improvement in liquors having been literally brought up on its principal ingredient and having acquired from her virginian customers the use of mint from its flavor in a julep to its height of renown in the article in question such then was the mistress of the mansion who reckless of the cold northern blasts showed her blooming face from the door of the building to welcome the arrival of her favorite captain lawton and his companion her master in matters of surgery  ah by my hopes of promotion my gentle elizabeth but you are welcome cried the trooper as he threw himself from his saddle this villainous freshwater gas from the canadas has been whistling among my bones till they ache with the cold but the sight of your fiery countenance is as cheery as a christmas fire  now sure captain jack yes always full of your complimentaries replied the sutler taking the bridle of her customer but hurry in for the life of you darling the fences hereabouts are not so strong as in the highlands and theres that within will warm both sowl and body  so you have been laying the rails under contribution i see well that may do for the body said the captain coolly but i have had a pull at a bottle of cut glass with a silver stand and i doubt my relish for your whisky for a month to come  if its silver or goold that yere thinking of its but little i have though ive a trifling bit of the continental said betty with a look of humor but theres that within thats fit to be put in vissils of dimonds  what can she mean archibald asked lawton the animal looks as if it meant more than it says  tis probably a wandering of the reasoning powers created by the frequency of intoxicating drafts observed the surgeon as he deliberately threw his left leg over the pommel of the saddle and slid down on the right side of his horse  faith my dear jewel of a doctor but it was this side i was expicting you the whole corps come down on this side but yeerself said betty winking at the trooper but ive been feeding the wounded in yeer absence with the fat of the land  barbarous stupidity cried the panicstricken physician to feed men laboring under the excitement of fever with powerful nutriment woman woman you are enough to defeat the skill of hippocrates  pooh said betty with infinite composure what a botheration ye make about a little whisky there was but a gallon betwixt a good dozen of them and i gave it to the boys to make them sleep asy sure jist as slumbering drops  lawton and his companion now entered the building and the first objects which met their eyes explained the hidden meaning of bettys comfortable declaration a long table made of boards torn from the side of an outbuilding was stretched through the middle of the largest apartment or the barroom and on it was a very scanty display of crockery ware the steams of cookery arose from an adjoining kitchen but the principal attraction was in a demijohn of fair proportions which had been ostentatiously placed on high by betty as the object most worthy of notice lawton soon learned that it was teeming with the real ambercolored juice of the grape and had been sent from the locusts as an offering to major dunwoodie from his friend captain wharton of the royal army  and a royal gift it is said the grinning subaltern who made the explanation the major gives us an entertainment in honor of our victory and you see the principal expense is borne as it should be by the enemy zounds i am thinking that after we have primed with such stuff we could charge through sir henrys headquarters and carry off the knight himself  the captain of dragoons was in no manner displeased at the prospect of terminating so pleasantly a day that had been so agreeably commenced he was soon surrounded by his comrades who made many eager inquiries concerning his adventures while the surgeon proceeded with certain quakings of the heart to examine into the state of his wounded enormous fires were snapping in the chimneys of the house superseding the necessity of candles by the bright light which was thrown from the blazing piles the group within were all young men and tried soldiers in number they were rather more than a dozen and their manners and conversation were a strange mixture of the bluntness of the partisan with the manners of gentlemen their dresses were neat though plain and a neverfailing topic amongst them was the performance and quality of their horses some were endeavoring to sleep on the benches which lined the walls some were walking the apartments and others were seated in earnest discussion on subjects connected with the business of their lives occasionally as the door of the kitchen opened the hissing sounds of the frying pans and the inviting savor of the food created a stagnation in all other employments even the sleepers at such moments would open their eyes and raise their heads to reconnoiter the state of the preparations all this time dunwoodie sat by himself gazing at the fire and lost in reflections which none of his officers presumed to disturb he had made earnest inquiries of sitgreaves after the condition of singleton during which a profound and respectful silence was maintained in the room but as soon as he had ended and resumed his seat the usual ease and freedom prevailed  the arrangement of the table was a matter of but little concern to mrs flanagan and caesar would have been sadly scandalized at witnessing the informality with which various dishes each bearing a wonderful resemblance to the others were placed before so many gentlemen of consideration in taking their places at the board the strictest attention was paid to precedency for notwithstanding the freedom of manners which prevailed in the corps the points of military etiquette were at all times observed with something approaching to religious veneration most of the guests had been fasting too long to be in any degree fastidious in their appetites but the case was different with captain lawton he felt an unaccountable loathing at the exhibition of bettys food and could not refrain from making a few passing comments on the condition of the knives and the clouded aspect of the plates the good nature and the personal affection of betty for the offender restrained her for some time from answering his innuendoes until lawton having ventured to admit a piece of the black meat into his mouth inquired with the affectation of a spoiled child  what kind of animal might this have been when living mrs flanagan  sure captain and wasnt it the ould cow replied the sutler with a warmth that proceeded partly from dissatisfaction at the complaints of her favorite and partly from grief at the loss of the deceased  what roared the trooper stopping short as he was about to swallow his morsel ancient jenny  the devil cried another dropping his knife and fork she who made the campaign of the jerseys with us  the very same replied the mistress of the hotel with a piteous aspect of woe a gentle baste and one that could and did live on less than air at need sure gentlemen tis awful to have to eat sitch an ould friend  and has she sunk to this said lawton pointing with his knife to the remnants on the table  nay captain said betty with spirit i sould two of her quarters to some of your troop but divil the word did i tell the boys what an ould frind it was they had bought for fear it might damage their appetites  fury cried the trooper with affected anger i shall have my fellows as limber as supplejacks on such fare afraid of an englishman as a virginian negro is of his driver  well said lieutenant mason dropping his knife and fork in a kind of despair my jaws have more sympathy than many mens hearts they absolutely decline making any impression on the relics of their old acquaintance  try a drop of the gift said betty soothingly pouring a large allowance of the wine into a bowl and drinking it off as taster to the corps faith tis but a wishywashy sort of stuff after all  the ice once broken however a clear glass of wine was handed to dunwoodie who bowing to his companions drank the liquor in the midst of a profound silence for a few glasses there was much formality observed and sundry patriotic toasts and sentiments were duly noticed by the company the liquor however performed its wonted office and before the second sentinel at the door had been relieved all recollection of the dinner and their cares was lost in the present festivity dr sitgreaves did not return in season to partake of jenny but he was in time to receive his fair proportion of captain whartons present  a song a song from captain lawton cried two or three of the party in a breath on observing the failure of some of the points of goodfellowship in the trooper silence for the song of captain lawton  gentlemen returned lawton his dark eyes swimming with the bumpers he had finished though his head was as impenetrable as a post i am not much of a nightingale but under the favor of your good wishes i consent to comply with the demand  now jack said sitgreaves nodding on his seat remember the air i taught you andstop i have a copy of the words in my pocket  forbear forbear good doctor said the trooper filling his glass with great deliberation i never could wheel round those hard names gentlemen i will give you a humble attempt of my own  silence for captain lawtons song roared five or six at once when the trooper proceeded in a fine full tone to sing the following words to a wellknown bacchanalian air several of his comrades helping him through the chorus with a fervor that shook the crazy edifice they were in       now push the mug my jolly boys        and live while live we can      tomorrows sun may end your joys        for briefs the hour of man      and he who bravely meets the foe      his lease of life can never know            old mother flanagan            come and fill the can again            for you can fill and we can swill            good betty flanagan       if love of life pervades your breast        or love of ease your frame      quit honors path for peaceful rest        and bear a cowards name      for soon and late we danger know      and fearless on the saddle go            old mother etc       when foreign foes invade the land        and wives and sweethearts call      in freedoms cause well bravely stand        or will as bravely fall      in this fair home the fates have given      well live as lords or live in heaven            old mother etc  at each appeal made to herself by the united voices of the choir betty invariably advanced and complied literally with the request contained in the chorus to the infinite delight of the singers and with no small participation in the satisfaction on her account the hostess was provided with a beverage more suited to the high seasoning to which she had accustomed her palate than the tasteless present of captain wharton by which means betty had managed with tolerable facility to keep even pace with the exhilaraton of her guests the applause received by captain lawton was general with the exception of the surgeon who rose from the bench during the first chorus and paced the floor in a flow of classical indignation the bravos and bravissimos drowned all other noises for a short time but as they gradually ceased the doctor turned to the musician and exclaimed with heat  captain lawton i marvel that a gentleman and a gallant officer can find no other subject for his muse in these times of trial than in such beastly invocations to that notorious follower of the camp the filthy elizabeth flanagan methinks the goddess of liberty could furnish a more noble inspiration and the sufferings of your country a more befitting theme  heyday shouted the hostess advancing towards him in a threatening attitude and who is it that calls me filthy master squirt master popgun  peace said dunwoodie in a voice that was exerted but a little more than common but which was succeeded by the stillness of death woman leave the room dr sitgreaves i call you to your seat to wait the order of the revels  proceed proceed said the surgeon drawing himself up in an attitude of dignified composure i trust major dunwoodie i am not unacquainted with the rules of decorum nor ignorant of the bylaws of goodfellowship betty made a hasty but somewhat devious retreat to her own dominions being unaccustomed to dispute the orders of the commanding officer  major dunwoodie will honor us with a sentimental song said lawton bowing to his leader with the collected manner he so well knew how to assume  the major hesitated a moment and then sang with fine execution the following words       some love the heats of southern suns      wheres lifes warm current maddening runs        in one quick circling stream      but dearer fars the mellow light      which trembling shines reflected bright        in lunas milder beam       some love the tulips gaudier dyes      where deepening blue with yellow vies        and gorgeous beauty glows      but happier he whose bridal wreath      by love entwined is found to breathe        the sweetness of the rose  the voice of dunwoodie never lost its authority with his inferiors and the applause which followed his song though by no means so riotous as that which succeeded the effort of the captain was much more flattering  if sir said the doctor after joining in the plaudits of his companions you would but learn to unite classical allusions with your delicate imagination you would become a pretty amateur poet  he who criticizes ought to be able to perform said dunwoodie with a smile i call on dr sitgreaves for a specimen of the style he admires  dr sitgreaves song dr sitgreaves song echoed all at the table with delight a classical ode from dr sitgreaves  the surgeon made a complacent bow took the remnant of his glass and gave a few preliminary hems that served hugely to delight three or four young cornets at the foot of the table he then commenced singing in a cracked voice and to anything but a tune the following ditty      hast thou ever felt loves dart dearest       or breathed his trembling sigh     thought him afar was ever nearest       before that sparkling eye     then hast thou known what tis to feel     the pain that galen could not heal  hurrah shouted lawton archibald eclipses the muses themselves his words flow like the sylvan stream by moonlight and his melody is a crossbreed of the nightingale and the owl  captain lawton cried the exasperated operator it is one thing to despise the lights of classical learning and another to be despised for your own ignorance  a loud summons at the door of the building created a dead halt in the uproar and the dragoons instinctively caught up their arms to be prepared for the worst the door was opened and the skinners entered dragging in the peddler bending beneath the load of his pack  which is captain lawton said the leader of the gang gazing around him in some little astonishment  he waits your pleasure said the trooper dryly  then here i deliver to your hands a condemned traitor this is harvey birch the peddler spy  lawton started as he looked his old acquaintance in the face and turning to the skinner with a lowering look he asked  and who are you sir that speak so freely of your neighbors but bowing to dunwoodie your pardon sir here is the commanding officer to him you will please address yourself  no said the man sullenly it is to you i deliver the peddler and from you i claim my reward  are you harvey birch said dunwoodie advancing with an air of authority that instantly drove the skinner to a corner of the room  i am said birch proudly  and a traitor to your country continued the major with sternness do you know that i should be justified in ordering your execution this night  tis not the will of god to call a soul so hastily to his presence said the peddler with solemnity  you speak truth said dunwoodie and a few brief hours shall be added to your life but as your offense is most odious to a soldier so it will be sure to meet with the soldiers vengeance you die tomorrow  tis as god wills  i have spent many a good hour to entrap the villain said the skinner advancing a little from his corner and i hope you will give me a certificate that will entitle us to the reward twas promised to be paid in gold  major dunwoodie said the officer of the day entering the room the patrols report a house to be burned near yesterdays battle ground  twas the hut of the peddler muttered the leader of the gang we have not left him a shingle for shelter i should have burned it months ago but i wanted his shed for a trap to catch the sly fox in  you seem a most ingenious patriot said lawton major dunwoodie i second the request of this worthy gentleman and crave the office of bestowing the reward on him and his fellows  take it and you miserable man prepare for that fate which will surely befall you before the setting of tomorrows sun  life offers but little to tempt me with said harvey slowly raising his eyes and gazing wildly at the strange faces in the apartment  come worthy children of america said lawton follow and receive your reward  the gang eagerly accepted the invitation and followed the captain towards the quarters assigned to his troop dunwoodie paused a moment from reluctance to triumph over a fallen foe before he proceeded  you have already been tried harvey birch and the truth has proved you to be an enemy too dangerous to the liberties of america to be suffered to live  the truth echoed the peddler starting and raising himself in a manner that disregarded the weight of his pack  aye the truth you are charged with loitering near the continental army to gain intelligence of its movements and by communicating them to the enemy to enable him to frustrate the intentions of washington  will washington say so think you  doubtless he would even the justice of washington condemns you  no no no cried the peddler in a voice and with a manner that startled dunwoodie washington can see beyond the hollow views of pretended patriots has he not risked his all on the cast of a die if a gallows is ready for me was there not one for him also no no no nowashington would never say lead him to a gallows  have you anything wretched man to urge to the commander in chief why you should not die said the major recovering from the surprise created by the manner of the other  birch trembled for violent emotions were contending in his bosom his face assumed the ghastly paleness of death and his hand drew a box of tin from the folds of his shirt he opened it showing by the act that it contained a small piece of paper on this document his eye was for an instant fixedhe had already held it towards dunwoodie when suddenly withdrawing his hand he exclaimed  noit dies with me i know the conditions of my service and will not purchase life with their forfeitureit dies with me  deliver that paper and you may possibly find favor cried dunwoodie expecting a discovery of importance to the cause  it dies with me repeated birch a flush passing over his pallid features and lighting them with extraordinary brilliancy  seize the traitor cried the major and wrest the secret from his hands  the order was immediately obeyed but the movements of the peddler were too quick in an instant he swallowed the paper the officers paused in astonishment but the surgeon cried eagerly  hold him while i administer an emetic  forbear said dunwoodie beckoning him back with his hand if his crime is great so will his punishment be heavy  lead on cried the peddler dropping his pack from his shoulders and advancing towards the door with a manner of incomprehensible dignity  whither asked dunwoodie in amazement  to the gallows  no said the major recoiling in horror at his own justice my duty requires that i order you to be executed but surely not so hastily take until nine tomorrow to prepare for the awful change  dunwoodie whispered his orders in the ear of a subaltern and motioned to the peddler to withdraw the interruption caused by this scene prevented further enjoyment around the table and the officers dispersed to their several places of rest in a short time the only noise to be heard was the heavy tread of the sentinel as he paced the frozen ground in front of the hotel flanagan     chapter xvii        there are whose changing lineaments      express each guileless passion of the breast      where love and hope and tenderhearted pity      are seen reflected as from a mirrors face      but cold experience can veil these hues      with looks invented shrewdly to encompass      the cunning purposes of base deceit                                           duo  the officer to whose keeping dunwoodie had committed the peddler transferred his charge to the custody of the regular sergeant of the guard the gift of captain wharton had not been lost on the youthful lieutenant and a certain dancing motion that had taken possession of objects before his eyes gave him warning of the necessity of recruiting nature by sleep after admonishing the noncommissioned guardian of harvey to omit no watchfulness in securing the prisoner the youth wrapped himself in his cloak and stretched on a bench before a fire soon found the repose he needed a rude shed extended the whole length of the rear of the building and from off one of its ends had been partitioned a small apartment that was intended as a repository for many of the lesser implements of husbandry the lawless times had however occasioned its being stripped of everything of value and the searching eyes of betty flanagan selected this spot on her arrival as the storehouse for her movables and a sanctuary for her person the spare arms and baggage of the corps had also been deposited here and the united treasures were placed under the eye of the sentinel who paraded the shed as a guardian of the rear of the headquarters a second soldier who was stationed near the house to protect the horses of the officers could command a view of the outside of the apartment and as it was without window or outlet of any kind excepting its door the considerate sergeant thought this the most befitting place in which to deposit his prisoner until the moment of his execution several inducements urged sergeant hollister to this determination among which was the absence of the washerwoman who lay before the kitchen fire dreaming that the corps was attacking a party of the enemy and mistaking the noise that proceeded from her own nose for the bugles of the virginians sounding the charge another was the peculiar opinions that the veteran entertained of life and death and by which he was distinguished in the corps as a man of most exemplary piety and holiness of life the sergeant was more than fifty years of age and for half that period he had borne arms the constant recurrence of sudden deaths before his eyes had produced an effect on him differing greatly from that which was the usual moral consequence of such scenes and he had become not only the most steady but the most trustworthy soldier in his troop captain lawton had rewarded his fidelity by making him its orderly  followed by birch the sergeant proceeded in silence to the door of the intended prison and throwing it open with one hand he held a lantern with the other to light the peddler to his prison seating himself on a cask that contained some of bettys favorite beverage the sergeant motioned to birch to occupy another in the same manner the lantern was placed on the floor when the dragoon after looking his prisoner steadily in the face observed  you look as if you would meet death like a man and i have brought you to a spot where you can tranquilly arrange your thoughts and be quiet and undisturbed  tis a fearful place to prepare for the last change in said harvey gazing around his little prison with a vacant eye  why for the matter of that returned the veteran it can reckon but little in the great account where a man parades his thoughts for the last review so that he finds them fit to pass the muster of another world i have a small book here which i make it a point to read a little in whenever we are about to engage and i find it a great strengthener in time of need while speaking he took a bible from his pocket and offered it to the peddler birch received the volume with habitual reverence but there was an abstracted air about him and a wandering of the eye that induced his companion to think that alarm was getting the mastery of the peddlers feelings accordingly he proceeded in what he conceived to be the offices of consolation  if anything lies heavy on your mind now is the best time to get rid of itif you have done any wrong to anyone i promise you on the word of an honest dragoon to lend you a helping hand to see them righted  there are few who have not done so said the peddler turning his vacant gaze once more on his companion  truetis natural to sin but it sometimes happens that a man does what at other times he may be sorry for one would not wish to die with any very heavy sin on his conscience after all  harvey had by this time thoroughly examined the place in which he was to pass the night and saw no means of escape but as hope is ever the last feeling to desert the human breast the peddler gave the dragoon more of his attention fixing on his sunburned features such searching looks that sergeant hollister lowered his eyes before the wild expression which he met in the gaze of his prisoner  i have been taught to lay the burden of my sins at the feet of my savior replied the peddler  why yesall that is well enough returned the other but justice should be done while there is opportunity there have been stirring times in this country since the war began and many have been deprived of their rightful goods i oftentimes find it hard to reconcile even my lawful plunder to a tender conscience  these hands said the peddler stretching forth his meager bony fingers have spent years in toil but not a moment in pilfering  it is well that it is so said the honesthearted soldier and no doubt you now feel it a great consolation there are three great sins that if a man can keep his conscience clear of why by the mercy of god he may hope to pass muster with the saints in heaven they are stealing murdering and desertion  thank god said birch with fervor i have never yet taken the life of a fellow creature  as to killing a man in lawful battle that is no more than doing ones duty if the cause is wrong the sin of such a deed you know falls on the nation and a man receives his punishment here with the rest of the people but murdering in cold blood stands next to desertion as a crime in the eye of god  i never was a soldier therefore never could desert said the peddler resting his face on his hand in a melancholy attitude  why desertion consists of more than quitting your colors though that is certainly the worst kind a man may desert his country in the hour of need  birch buried his face in both his hands and his whole frame shook the sergeant regarded him closely but good feelings soon got the better of his antipathies and he continued more mildly  but still that is a sin which i think may be forgiven if sincerely repented of and it matters but little when or how a man dies so that he dies like a christian and a man i recommend you to say your prayers and then to get some rest in order that you may do both there is no hope of your being pardoned for colonel singleton has sent down the most positive orders to take your life whenever we met you no nonothing can save you  you say the truth cried birch it is now too latei have destroyed my only safeguard but he will do my memory justice at least  what safeguard asked the sergeant with awakened curiosity  tis nothing replied the peddler recovering his natural manner and lowering his face to avoid the earnest looks of his companion  and who is he  no one added harvey anxious to say no more  nothing and no one can avail but little now said the sergeant rising to go lay yourself on the blanket of mrs flanagan and get a little sleep i will call you betimes in the morning and from the bottom of my soul i wish i could be of some service to you for i dislike greatly to see a man hung up like a dog  then you might save me from this ignominious death said birch springing to his feet and catching the dragoon by the arm and oh what will i not give you in reward  in what manner asked the sergeant looking at him in surprise  see said the peddler producing several guineas from his person these are nothing to what i will give you if you will assist me to escape  were you the man whose picture is on the gold i would not listen to such a crime said the trooper throwing the money on the floor with contempt gogo poor wretch and make your peace with god for it is he only that can be of service to you now  the sergeant took up the lantern and with some indignation in his manner he left the peddler to sorrowful meditations on his approaching fate birch sank in momentary despair on the pallet of betty while his guardian proceeded to give the necessary instructions to the sentinels for his safekeeping  hollister concluded his injunctions to the man in the shed by saying your life will depend on his not escaping let none enter or quit the room till morning  but said the trooper my orders are to let the washerwoman pass in and out as she pleases  well let her then but be careful that this wily peddler does not get out in the folds of her petticoats he then continued his walk giving similar orders to each of the sentinels near the spot  for some time after the departure of the sergeant silence prevailed within the solitary prison of the peddler until the dragoon at his door heard his loud breathings which soon rose into the regular cadence of one in a deep sleep the man continued walking his post musing on an indifference to life which could allow nature its customary rest even on the threshold of the grave harvey birch had however been a name too long held in detestation by every man in the corps to suffer any feelings of commiseration to mingle with these reflections of the sentinel for notwithstanding the consideration and kindness manifested by the sergeant there probably was not another man of his rank in the whole party who would have discovered equal benevolence to the prisoner or who would not have imitated the veteran in rejecting the bribe although probably from a less worthy motive there was something of disappointed vengeance in the feelings of the man who watched the door of the room on finding his prisoner enjoying a sleep of which he himself was deprived and at his exhibiting such obvious indifference to the utmost penalty that military rigor could inflict on all his treason to the cause of liberty and america more than once he felt prompted to disturb the repose of the peddler by taunts and revilings but the discipline he was under and a secret sense of shame at the brutality of the act held him in subjection  his meditations were however soon interrupted by the appearance of the washerwoman who came staggering through the door that communicated with the kitchen muttering execrations against the servants of the officers who by their waggery had disturbed her slumbers before the fire the sentinel understood enough of her maledictions to comprehend the case but all his efforts to enter into conversation with the enraged woman were useless and he suffered her to enter her room without explaining that it contained another inmate the noise of her huge frame falling on the bed was succeeded by a silence that was soon interrupted by the renewed respiration of the peddler and within a few minutes harvey continued to breathe aloud as if no interruption had occurred the relief arrived at this moment  the sentinel who felt nettled at the contempt of the peddler after communicating his orders while he was retiring exclaimed to his successor  you may keep yourself warm by dancing john the peddler spy has tuned his fiddle you hear and it will not be long before betty will strike up in her turn  the joke was followed by a general laugh from the party who marched on in performance of their duty at this instant the door of the prison was opened and betty reappeared staggering back again toward her former quarters  stop said the sentinel catching her by her clothes are you sure the spy is not in your pocket  cant you hear the rascal snoring in my room you dirty blackguard sputtered betty her whole frame shaking with rage and is it so ye would sarve a dacent famale that a man must be put to sleep in the room wid her ye rapscallion  pooh do you mind a fellow whos to be hanged in the morning you see he sleeps already tomorrow hell take a longer nap  hands off ye villain cried the washerwoman relinquishing a small bottle that the trooper had succeeded in wresting from her but ill go to captain jack and know if its orders to put a hanggallows spy in my room aye even in my widowed bed you tief  silence old jezebel said the fellow with a laugh taking the bottle from his mouth to breathe or you will wake the gentleman would you disturb a man in his last sleep  ill awake captain jack you reprobate villain and bring him here to see me righted he will punish ye all for imposing on a dacent widowed body you marauder  with these words which only extorted a laugh from the sentinel betty staggered round the end of the building and made the best of her way towards the quarters of her favorite captain john lawton in search of redress neither the officer nor the woman however appeared during the night and nothing further occurred to disturb the repose of the peddler who to the astonishment of the different sentinels continued by his breathing to manifest how little the gallows could affect his slumbers     chapter xviii        a daniel come to judgment yea a daniel      o wise young judge how i do honor thee                                          merchant of venice  the skinners followed captain lawton with alacrity towards the quarters occupied by the troop of that gentleman the captain of dragoons had on all occasions manifested so much zeal for the cause in which he was engaged was so regardless of personal danger when opposed to the enemy and his stature and stern countenance contributed so much to render him terrific that these qualities had in some measure procured him a reputation distinct from the corps in which he served his intrepidity was mistaken for ferocity and his hasty zeal for the natural love of cruelty on the other hand a few acts of clemency or more properly speaking of discriminating justice had with one portion of the community acquired for dunwoodie the character of undue forbearance it is seldom that either popular condemnation or popular applause falls exactly in the quantities earned where it is merited  while in the presence of the major the leader of the gang had felt himself under that restraint which vice must ever experience in the company of acknowledged virtue but having left the house he at once conceived that he was under the protection of a congenial spirit there was a gravity in the manner of lawton that deceived most of those who did not know him intimately and it was a common saying in his troop that when the captain laughed he was sure to punish drawing near his conductor therefore the leader commenced a confidential dialogue  tis always well for a man to know his friends from his enemies said the halflicensed freebooter  to this prefatory observation the captain made no other reply than a sound which the other interpreted into assent  i suppose major dunwoodie has the good opinion of washington continued the skinner in a tone that rather expressed a doubt than asked a question  there are some who think so  many of the friends of congress in this county the man proceeded wish the horse was led by some other officer for my part if i could only be covered by a troop now and then i could do many an important piece of service to the cause to which this capture of the peddler would be a trifle  indeed such as what  for the matter of that it could be made as profitable to the officer as it would be to us who did it said the skinner with a look of the most significant meaning  but how asked lawton a little impatiently and quickening his step to get out of the hearing of the rest of the party  why near the royal lines even under the very guns of the heights might be good picking if we had a force to guard us from de lanceys footnote the partisan corps called cowboys in the parlance of the country was commanded by colonel de lancey this gentleman for such he was by birth and education rendered himself very odious to the americans by his fancied cruelty though there is no evidence of his being guilty of any acts unusual in this species of warfare colonel de lancey belonged to a family of the highest consequence in the american colonies his uncle having died in the administration of the government of that of new york he should not be confounded with other gentlemen of his name and family many of whom served in the royal army his cousin colonel oliver de lancey was at the time of our tale adjutant general of the british forces in america having succeeded to the unfortunate andre the cowboys were sometimes called refugees in consequence of their having taken refuge under the protection of the crown men and to cover our retreat from being cut off by the way of kings bridge  i thought the refugees took all that game to themselves  they do a little at it but they are obliged to be sparing among their own people i have been down twice under an agreement with them the first time they acted with honor but the second they came upon us and drove us off and took the plunder to themselves  that was a very dishonorable act indeed i wonder that an honorable man will associate with such rascals  it is necessary to have an understanding with some of them or we might be taken but a man without honor is worse than a brute do you think major dunwoodie is to be trusted  you mean on honorable principles  certainly you know arnold was thought well of until the royal major was taken  why i do not believe dunwoodie would sell his command as arnold wished to do neither do i think him exactly trustworthy in a delicate business like this of yours  thats just my notion rejoined the skinner with a selfapproving manner that showed how much he was satisfied with his own estimate of character  by this time they had arrived at a better sort of farmhouse the very extensive outbuildings of which were in tolerable repair for the times the barns were occupied by the men of the troop while the horses were arranged under the long sheds which protected the yard from the cold north wind the latter were quietly eating with saddles on their backs and bridles thrown on their necks ready to be bitted and mounted at the shortest warning lawton excused himself for a moment and entered his quarters he soon returned holding in his hand one of the common stable lanterns and led the way towards a large orchard that surrounded the buildings on three sides the gang followed the trooper in silence believing his object to be facility of communicating further on this interesting topic without the danger of being overheard  approaching the captain the skinner renewed the discourse with a view of establishing further confidence and of giving his companion a more favorable opinion of his own intellects  do you think the colonies will finally get the better of the king he inquired with a little of the importance of a politician  get the better echoed the captain with impetuosity then checking himself he continued no doubt they will if the french will give us arms and money we will drive out the royal troops in six months  well so i hope we shall soon and then we shall have a free government and we who fight for it will get our reward  oh cried lawton your claims will be indisputable while all these vile tories who live at home peaceably to take care of their farms will be held in the contempt they merit you have no farm i suppose  not yetbut it will go hard if i do not find one before the peace is made  right study your own interests and you study the interests of your country press the point of your own services and rail at the tories and ill bet my spurs against a rusty nail that you get to be a county clerk at least  dont you think pauldings footnote the author must have intended some allusion to an individual which is too local to be understood by the general reader andre as is well known was arrested by three countrymen who were on the lookout for predatory parties of the enemy the principal man of this party was named paulding the disinterested manner in which they refused the offers of their captive is matter of history party were fools in not letting the royal adjutant general escape said the man thrown off his guard by the freedom of the captains manner  fools cried lawton with a bitter laugh aye fools indeed king george would have paid them better for he is richer he would have made them gentlemen for their losses but thank god there is a pervading spirit in the people that seems miraculous men who have nothing act as if the wealth of the indies depended on their fidelity all are not villains like yourself or we should have been slaves to england years ago  how exclaimed the skinner starting back and dropping his musket to the level of the others breast am i betrayed and are you my enemy  miscreant shouted lawton his saber ringing in its steel scabbard as he struck the musket of the fellow from his hands offer but again to point your gun at me and ill cleave you to the middle  and you will not pay us then captain lawton said the skinner trembling in every joint for just then he saw a party of mounted dragoons silently encircling the whole party  oh pay youyes you shall have the full measure of your reward there is the money that colonel singleton sent down for the captors of the spy throwing a bag of guineas with disdain at the others feet but ground your arms you rascals and see that the money is truly told  the intimidated band did as they were ordered and while they were eagerly employed in this pleasing avocation a few of lawtons men privately knocked the flints out of their muskets  well cried the impatient captain is it right have you the promised reward  there is just the money said the leader and we will now go to our homes with your permission  hold so much to redeem our promisenow for justice we pay you for taking a spy but we punish you for burning robbing and murdering seize them my lads and give each of them the law of mosesforty save one  this command was given to no unwilling listeners and in the twinkling of an eye the skinners were stripped and fastened by the halters of the party to as many of the apple trees as were necessary to furnish one to each of the gang swords were quickly drawn and fifty branches were cut from the trees like magic from these were selected a few of the most supple of the twigs and a willing dragoon was soon found to wield each of the weapons captain lawton gave the word humanely cautioning his men not to exceed the discipline prescribed by the mosaic law and the uproar of babel  commenced in the orchard the cries of the leader were easily to be distinguished above those of his men a circumstance which might be accounted for by captain lawtons reminding his corrector that he had to deal with an officer and he should remember and pay him unusual honor the flagellation was executed with great neatness and dispatch and it was distinguished by no irregularity excepting that none of the disciplinarians began to count until they had tried their whips by a dozen or more blows by the way as they said themselves of finding out the proper places to strike as soon as this summary operation was satisfactorily completed lawton directed his men to leave the skinners to replace their own clothes and to mount their horses for they were a party who had been detached for the purpose of patrolling lower down in the county  you see my friend said the captain to the leader of the skinners after he had prepared himself to depart i can cover you to some purpose when necessary if we meet often you will be covered with scars which if not very honorable will at least be merited  the fellow made no reply he was busy with his musket and hastening his comrades to march when everything being ready they proceeded sullenly towards some rocks at no great distance which were overhung by a deep wood the moon was just rising and the group of dragoons could easily be distinguished where they had been left suddenly turning the whole gang leveled their pieces and drew the triggers the action was noticed and the snapping of the locks was heard by the soldiers who returned their futile attempt with a laugh of derision the captain crying aloud  ah rascals i knew you and have taken away your flints  you should have taken away that in my pouch too shouted the leader firing his gun in the next instant the bullet grazed the ear of lawton who laughed as he shook his head saying a miss was as good as a mile one of the dragoons had seen the preparations of the skinnerwho had been left alone by the rest of his gang as soon as they had made their abortive attempt at revengeand was in the act of plunging his spurs into his horse as the fellow fired the distance to the rocks was but small yet the speed of the horse compelled the leader to abandon both money and musket to effect his escape the soldier returned with his prizes and offered them to the acceptance of his captain but lawton rejected them telling the man to retain them himself until the rascal appeared in person to claim his property it would have been a business of no small difficulty for any tribunal then existing in the new states to have enforced a restitution of the money for it was shortly after most equitably distributed by the hands of sergeant hollister among a troop of horse the patrol departed and the captain slowly returned to his quarters with an intention of retiring to rest a figure moving rapidly among the trees in the direction of the wood whither the skinners had retired caught his eye and wheeling on his heel the cautious partisan approached it and to his astonishment saw the washerwoman at that hour of the night and in such a place  what betty walking in your sleep or dreaming while awake cried the trooper are you not afraid of meeting with the ghost of ancient jenny in this her favorite pasture  ah sure captain jack returned the sutler in her native accent and reeling in a manner that made it difficult for her to raise her head its not jenny or her ghost that im saaking but some yarbs for the wounded and its the vartue of the rising moon as it jist touches them that i want they grow under yon rocks and i must hasten or the charm will lose its power  fool you are fitter for your pallet than for wandering among those rocks a fall from one of them would break your bones besides the skinners have fled to those heights and should you fall in with them they would revenge on you a sound flogging they have just received from me better return old woman and finish your nap we march in the morning  betty disregarded his advice and continued her devious route to the hillside for an instant as lawton mentioned the skinners she had paused but immediately resuming her course she was soon out of sight among the trees  as the captain entered his quarters the sentinel at the door inquired if he had met mrs flanagan and added that she had passed there filling the air with threats against her tormentors at the hotel and inquiring for the captain in search of redress lawton heard the man in astonishmentappeared struck with a new ideawalked several yards towards the orchard and returned again for several minutes he paced rapidly to and fro before the door of the house and then hastily entering it he threw himself on a bed in his clothes and was soon in a profound sleep  in the meantime the gang of marauders had successfully gained the summit of the rocks and scattering in every direction they buried themselves in the depths of the wood finding however there was no pursuit which indeed would have been impracticable for horse the leader ventured to call his band together with a whistle and in a short time he succeeded in collecting his discomfited party at a point where they had but little to apprehend from any enemy  well said one of the fellows while a fire was lighting to protect them against the air which was becoming severely cold there is an end to our business in westchester the virginia horse will make the county too hot to hold us  ill have his blood muttered the leader if i die for it the next instant  oh you are very valiant here in the wood cried the other with a savage laugh why did you who boast so much of your aim miss your man at thirty yards  twas the horseman that disturbed me or i would have ended this captain lawton on the spot besides the cold had set me ashivering and i had no longer a steady hand  say it was fear and you will tell no lie said his comrade with a sneer for my part i think i shall never be cold again my back burns as if a thousand gridirons were laid on it  and you would tamely submit to such usage and kiss the rod that beat you  as for kissing the rod it would be no easy matter mine was broken into so small pieces on my own shoulders that it would be difficult to find one big enough to kiss but i would rather submit to lose half my skin than to lose the whole of it with my ears in the bargain and such will be our fates if we tempt this mad virginian again god willing i would at any time give him enough of my hide to make a pair of jack boots to get out of his hands with the remainder if you had known when you were well off you would have stuck to major dunwoodie who dont know half so much of our evil doings  silence you talking fool shouted the enraged leader your prating is sufficient to drive a man mad is it not enough to be robbed and beaten but we must be tormented with your folly help to get out the provisions if any is left in the wallet and try and stop your mouth with food  this injunction was obeyed and the whole party amidst sundry groans and contortions excited by the disordered state of their backs made their arrangements for a scanty meal a large fire of dry wood was burning in the cleft of a rock and at length they began to recover from the confusion of their flight and to collect their scattered senses their hunger being appeased and many of their garments thrown aside for the better opportunity of dressing their wounds the gang began to plot measures of revenge an hour was spent in this manner and various expedients were proposed but as they all depended on personal prowess for their success and were attended by great danger they were of course rejected there was no possibility of approaching the troops by surprise their vigilance being ever on the watch and the hope of meeting captain lawton away from his men was equally forlorn for the trooper was constantly engaged in his duty and his movements were so rapid that any opportunity of meeting with him at all must depend greatly on accident besides it was by no means certain that such an interview would result happily for themselves the cunning of the trooper was notorious and rough and broken as was westchester the fearless partisan was known to take desperate leaps and stone walls were but slight impediments to the charges of the southern horse gradually the conversation took another direction until the gang determined on a plan which should both revenge themselves and at the same time offer some additional stimulus to their exertions the whole business was accurately discussed the time fixed and the manner adopted in short nothing was wanting to the previous arrangement for this deed of villainy when they were aroused by a voice calling aloud  this way captain jackhere are the rascals ating by a firethis way and murder the tieves where they sitquick lave your horses and shoot your pistols  this terrific summons was enough to disturb all the philosophy of the gang springing on their feet they rushed deeper into the wood and having already agreed upon a place of rendezvous previously to their intended expedition they dispersed towards the four quarters of the heavens certain sounds and different voices were heard calling on each other but as the marauders were well trained to speed of foot they were soon lost in the distance  it was not long before betty flanagan emerged from the darkness and very coolly took possession of what the skinners had left behind them namely food and divers articles of dress the washerwoman deliberately seated herself and made a meal with great apparent satisfaction for an hour she sat with her head upon her hand in deep musing then she gathered together such articles of the clothes as seemed to suit her fancy and retired into the wood leaving the fire to throw its glimmering light on the adjacent rocks until its last brand died away and the place was abandoned to solitude and darkness     chapter xix        no longer then perplex the breast      when thoughts torment the first are best      tis mad to go tis death to stay      away to orra haste away                                       lapland love song  while his comrades were sleeping in perfect forgetfulness of their hardships and dangers the slumbers of dunwoodie were broken and unquiet after spending a night of restlessness he arose unrefreshed from the rude bed where he had thrown himself in his clothes and without awaking any of the group around him he wandered into the open air in search of relief the soft rays of the moon were just passing away in the more distinct light of the morning the wind had fallen and the rising mists gave the promise of another of those autumnal days which in this unstable climate succeed a tempest with the rapid transitions of magic the hour had not yet arrived when he intended moving from his present position and willing to allow his warriors all the refreshment that circumstances would permit he strolled towards the scene of the skinners punishment musing upon the embarrassments of his situation and uncertain how he should reconcile his sense of duty with his love although dunwoodie himself placed the most implicit reliance on the captains purity of intention he was by no means assured that a board of officers would be equally credulous and independently of all feelings of private regard he felt certain that with the execution of henry would be destroyed all hopes of a union with his sister he had dispatched an officer the preceding evening to colonel singleton who was in command of the advance posts reporting the capture of the british captain and after giving his own opinion of his innocence requesting orders as to the manner in which he was to dispose of his prisoner these orders might be expected every hour and his uneasiness increased in proportion as the moment approached when his friend might be removed from his protection in this disturbed state of mind the major wandered through the orchard and was stopped in his walk by arriving at the base of those rocks which had protected the skinners in their flight before he was conscious whither his steps had carried him he was about to turn and retrace his path to his quarters when he was startled by a voice bidding him  stand or die  dunwoodie turned in amazement and beheld the figure of a man placed at a little distance above him on a shelving rock with a musket leveled at himself the light was not yet sufficiently powerful to reach the recesses of that gloomy spot and a second look was necessary before he discovered to his astonishment that the peddler stood before him comprehending in an instant the danger of his situation and disdaining to implore mercy or to retreat had the latter been possible the youth cried firmly  if i am to be murdered fire i will never become your prisoner  no major dunwoodie said birch lowering his musket it is neither my intention to capture nor to slay  what then would you have mysterious being said dunwoodie hardly able to persuade himself that the form he saw was not a creature of the imagination  your good opinion answered the peddler with emotion i would wish all good men to judge me with lenity  to you it must be indifferent what may be the judgment of men for you seem to be beyond the reach of their sentence  god spares the lives of his servants to his own time said the peddler solemnly a few hours ago i was your prisoner and threatened with the gallows now you are mine but major dunwoodie you are free there are men abroad who would treat you less kindly of what service would that sword be to you against my weapon and a steady hand take the advice of one who has never harmed you and who never will do not trust yourself in the skirts of any wood unless in company and mounted  and have you comrades who have assisted you to escape and who are less generous than yourself  nono i am alone trulynone know me but my god and him  and who asked the major with an interest he could not control  none continued the peddler recovering his composure but such is not your case major dunwoodie you are young and happy there are those that are dear to you and such are not far awaydanger is near them you love mostdanger within and withoutdouble your watchfulness strengthen your patrolsand be silent with your opinion of me should i tell you more you would suspect an ambush but remember and guard them you love best  the peddler discharged the musket in the air and threw it at the feet of his astonished auditor when surprise and the smoke allowed dunwoodie to look again on the rock where he had stood the spot was vacant  the youth was aroused from the stupor which had been created by this strange scene by the trampling of horses and the sound of the bugles a patrol was drawn to the spot by the report of the musket and the alarm had been given to the corps without entering into any explanation with his men the major returned quickly to his quarters where he found the whole squadron under arms in battle array impatiently awaiting the appearance of their leader the officer whose duty it was to superintend such matters had directed a party to lower the sign of the hotel flanagan and the post was already arranged for the execution of the spy on hearing from the major that the musket was discharged by himself and was probably one of those dropped by the skinners for by this time dunwoodie had learned the punishment inflicted by lawton but chose to conceal his own interview with birch his officers suggested the propriety of executing their prisoner before they marched unable to believe that all he had seen was not a dream dunwoodie followed by many of his officers and preceded by sergeant hollister went to the place which was supposed to contain the peddler  well sir said the major to the sentinel who guarded the door i trust you have your prisoner in safety  he is yet asleep replied the man and he makes such a noise i could hardly hear the bugles sound the alarm  open the door and bring him forth  the order was obeyed but to the utter amazement of the honest veteran who entered the prison he found the room in no little disorderthe coat of the peddler where his body ought to have been and part of the wardrobe of betty scattered in disorder on the floor the washerwoman herself occupied the pallet in profound mental oblivion clad as when last seen excepting a little black bonnet which she so constantly wore that it was commonly thought she made it perform the double duty of both day and night cap the noise of their entrance and the exclamations of their party awoke the woman  is it the breakfast thats wanting said betty rubbing her eyes faith ye look as if ye would ate myselfbut patience a little darlings and yell see sich a fry as never was  fry echoed the sergeant forgetful of his religious philosophy and the presence of his officers well have you roasted jezebelyouve helped that damned peddler to escape  jezebel back agin in your own teeth and damned piddler too mr sargeant cried betty who was easily roused what have i to do with piddlers or escapes i might have been a piddlers lady and wore my silks if id had sawny mtwill instead of tagging at the heels of a parcel of dragooning rapscallions who dont know how to trate a lone body with dacency  the fellow has left my bible said the veteran taking he book from the floor instead of spending his time in reading it to prepare for his end like a good christian he has been busy in laboring to escape  and who would stay and be hanged like a dog cried betty beginning to comprehend the case tisnt everyone thats born to meet with sich an indlike yourself mr hollister  silence said dunwoodie this must be inquired into closely gentlemen there is no outlet but the door and there he could not pass unless the sentinel connived at his escape or was asleep at his post call up the guard  as these men were not paraded curiosity had already drawn them to the place and they one and all with the exception of him before mentioned denied that any person had passed out the individual in question acknowledged that betty had gone by him but pleaded his orders in justification  you lie you tiefyou lie shouted betty who had impatiently listened to his exculpation would ye slanderize a lone woman by saying she walks a camp at midnight here have i been slaping the long night swaatly as the sucking babe  here sir said the sergeant turning respectfully to dunwoodie is something written in my bible that was not in it before for having no family to record i would not suffer any scribbling in the sacred book  one of the officers read aloud these certify that if suffered to get free it is by gods help alone to whose divine aid i humbly riccommind myself im forced to take the womans clothes but in her pocket is a ricompinse witness my handharvey birch  what roared betty has the tief robbed a lone woman of her all hang himcatch him and hang him major if theres law or justice in the land  examine your pocket said one of the youngsters who was enjoying the scene careless of the consequences  ah faith cried the washerwoman producing a guinea but he is a jewel of a piddler long life and a brisk trade to him say i he is wilcome to the dudsand if he is ever hanged many a bigger rogue will go free  dunwoodie turned to leave the apartment and he saw captain lawton standing with folded arms contemplating the scene with profound silence his manner so different from his usual impetuosity and zeal struck his commander as singular their eyes met and they walked together for a few minutes in close conversation when dunwoodie returned and dismissed the guard to their place of rendezvous sergeant hollister however continued along with betty who having found none of her vestments disturbed but such as the guinea more than paid for was in high good humor the washerwoman had for a long time looked on the veteran with the eyes of affection and she had determined within herself to remove certain delicate objections which had long embarrassed her peculiar situation as respected the corps by making the sergeant the successor of her late husband for some time past the trooper had seemed to flatter this preference and betty conceiving that her violence might have mortified her suitor was determined to make him all the amends in her power besides rough and uncouth as she was the washerwoman had still enough of her sex to know that the moments of reconciliation were the moments of power she therefore poured out a glass of her morning beverage and handed it to her companion as a peace offering  a few warm words between frinds are a trifle ye must be knowing sargeant said the washerwoman it was michael flanagan that i ever calumnated the most when i was loving him the best  michael was a good soldier and a brave man said the trooper finishing the glass our troop was covering the flank of his regiment when he fell and i rode over his body myself during the day poor fellow he lay on his back and looked as composed as if he had died a natural death after a years consumption  oh michael was a great consumer and be sartin two such as us make dreadful inroads in the stock sargeant but yere a sober discrate man mister hollister and would be a helpmate indeed  why mrs flanagan ive tarried to speak on a subject that lies heavy at my heart and i will now open my mind if youve leisure to listen  is it listen cried the impatient woman and id listen to you sargeant if the officers never ate another mouthful but take a second drop dear twill encourage you to spake freely  i am already bold enough in so good a cause returned the veteran rejecting her bounty betty do you think it was really the peddler spy that i placed in this room the last night  and who should it be else darling  the evil one  what the divil  aye even beelzebub disguised as the peddler and them fellows we thought to be skinners were his imps  well sure sargeant dear yere but little out this time anyway for if the divils imps go at large in the county westchester sure it is the skinners themselves  mrs flanagan i mean in their incarnate spirits the evil one knew there was no one we would arrest sooner than the peddler birch and he took on his appearance to gain admission to your room  and what should the divil be wanting of me cried betty tartly and isnt there divils enough in the corps already without ones coming from the bottomless pit to frighten a lone body  twas in mercy to you betty that he was permitted to come you see he vanished through the door in your form which is a symbol of your fate unless you mend your life oh i noticed how he trembled when i gave him the good book would any christian think you my dear betty write in a bible in this way unless it might be the matter of births and deaths and such lawful chronicles  the washerwoman was pleased with the softness of her lovers manner but dreadfully scandalized at his insinuation she however preserved her temper and with the quickness of her own countrys people rejoined and would the divil have paid for the clothes think yeaye and overpaid  doubtless the money is base said the sergeant a little staggered at such an evidence of honesty in one of whom as to generals he thought so meanly he tempted me with his glittering coin but the lord gave me strength to resist  the goold looks well but ill change it anyway with captain jack the day he is niver a bit afeard of any divil of them all  betty betty said her companion do not speak so disreverently of the evil spirit he is ever at hand and will owe you a grudge for your language  pooh if he has any bowels at all he wont mind a fillip or two from a poor lone woman im sure no other christian would  but the dark one has no bowels except to devour the children of men said the sergeant looking around him in horror and its best to make friends everywhere for there is no telling what may happen till it comes but betty no man could have got out of this place and passed all the sentinels without being known take awful warning from the visit therefore  here the dialogue was interrupted by a peremptory summons to the sutler to prepare the mornings repast and they were obliged to separate the woman secretly hoping that the interest the sergeant manifested was more earthly than he imagined and the man bent on saving a soul from the fangs of the dark spirit that was prowling through their camp in quest of victims  during the breakfast several expresses arrived one of which brought intelligence of the actual force and destination of the enemys expedition that was out on the hudson and another orders to send captain wharton to the first post above under the escort of a body of dragoons these last instructions or rather commands for they admitted of no departure from their letter completed the sum of dunwoodies uneasiness the despair and misery of frances were constantly before his eyes and fifty times he was tempted to throw himself on his horse and gallop to the locusts but an uncontrollable feeling prevented in obedience to the commands of his superior an officer with a small party was sent to the cottage to conduct henry wharton to the place directed and the gentleman who was intrusted with the execution of the order was charged with a letter from dunwoodie to his friend containing the most cheering assurances of his safety as well as the strongest pledges of his own unceasing exertions in his favor lawton was left with part of his own troop in charge of the few wounded and as soon as the men were refreshed the encampment broke up the main body marching towards the hudson dunwoodie repeated his injunctions to captain lawton again and againdwelt on every word that had fallen from the peddler and canvassed in every possible manner that his ingenuity could devise the probable meaning of his mysterious warnings until no excuse remained for delaying his own departure suddenly recollecting however that no directions had been given for the disposal of colonel wellmere instead of following the rear of the column the major yielded to his desires and turned down the road which led to the locusts the horse of dunwoodie was fleet as the wind and scarcely a minute seemed to have passed before he gained sight from an eminence of the lonely vale and as he was plunging into the bottom lands that formed its surface he caught a glimpse of henry wharton and his escort at a distance defiling through a pass which led to the posts above this sight added to the speed of the anxious youth who now turned the angle of the hill that opened to the valley and came suddenly on the object of his search frances had followed the party which guarded her brother at a distance and as they vanished from her sight she felt deserted by all that she most prized in this world the unaccountable absence of dunwoodie with the shock of parting from henry under such circumstances had entirely subdued her fortitude and she had sunk on a stone by the roadside sobbing as if her heart would break dunwoodie sprang from his charger threw the reins over the neck of the animal and in a moment he was by the side of the weeping girl  francesmy own frances he exclaimed why this distress let not the situation of your brother create any alarm as soon as the duty i am now on is completed i will hasten to the feet of washington and beg his release the father of his country will never deny such a boon to one of his favorite pupils  major dunwoodie for your interest in behalf of my poor brother i thank you said the trembling girl drying her eyes and rising with dignity but such language addressed to me surely is improper  improper are you not mineby the consent of your fatheryour auntyour brothernay by your own consent my sweet frances  i wish not major dunwoodie to interfere with the prior claims that any other lady may have to your affections said frances struggling to speak with firmness  none other i swear by heaven none other has any claim on me cried dunwoodie with fervor you alone are mistress of my inmost soul  you have practiced so much and so successfully major dunwoodie that it is no wonder you excel in deceiving the credulity of my sex returned frances attempting a smile which the tremulousness of her muscles smothered at birth  am i a villain miss wharton that you receive me with such language when have i ever deceived you frances who has practiced in this manner on your purity of heart  why has not major dunwoodie honored the dwelling of his intended father with his presence lately did he forget it contained one friend on a bed of sickness and another in deep distress has it escaped his memory that it held his intended wife or is he fearful of meeting more than one that can lay a claim to that title oh peytonpeyton how have i been deceived in you with the foolish credulity of my youth i thought you all that was brave noble generous and loyal  frances i see how you have deceived yourself cried dunwoodie his face in a glow of fire you do me injustice i swear by all that is most dear to me that you do me injustice  swear not major dunwoodie interrupted frances her fine countenance lighting with the luster of womanly pride the time is gone by for me to credit oaths  miss wharton would you have me a coxcombmake me contemptible in my own eyes by boasting with the hope of raising myself in your estimation  flatter not yourself that the task is so easy sir returned frances moving towards the cottage we converse together in private for the last time butpossiblymy father would welcome my mothers kinsman  no miss wharton i cannot enter his dwelling now i should act in a manner unworthy of myself you drive me from you frances in despair i am going on desperate service and may not live to return should fortune prove severe at least do my memory justice remember that the last breathings of my soul will be for your happiness so saying he had already placed his foot in the stirrup but his youthful mistress turning on him an eye that pierced his soul arrested the action  peytonmajor dunwoodie she said can you ever forget the sacred cause in which you are enlisted duty both to your god and to your country forbids your doing anything rashly the latter has need of your services besidesbut her voice became choked and she was unable to proceed  besides what echoed the youth springing to her side and offering to take her hand in his own frances having however recovered herself coldly repulsed him and continued her walk homeward  is this our parting cried dunwoodie in agony am i a wretch that you treat me so cruelly you have never loved me and wish to conceal your own fickleness by accusations that you will not explain  frances stopped short in her walk and turned on him a look of so much purity and feeling that heartstricken dunwoodie would have knelt at her feet for pardon but motioning him for silence she once more spoke  hear me major dunwoodie for the last time it is a bitter knowledge when we first discover our own inferiority but it is a truth that i have lately learned against you i bring no chargesmake no accusations no not willingly in my thoughts were my claims to your heart just i am not worthy of you it is not a feeble timid girl like me that could make you happy no peyton you are formed for great and glorious actions deeds of daring and renown and should be united to a soul like your own one that can rise above the weakness of her sex i should be a weight to drag you to the dust but with a different spirit in your companion you might soar to the very pinnacle of earthly glory to such a one therefore i resign you freely if not cheerfully and pray oh how fervently do i pray that with such a one you may be happy  lovely enthusiast cried dunwoodie you know not yourself nor me it is a woman mild gentle and dependent as yourself that my very nature loves deceive not yourself with visionary ideas of generosity which will only make me miserable  farewell major dunwoodie said the agitated girl pausing for a moment to gasp for breath forget that you ever knew meremember the claims of your bleeding country and be happy  happy repeated the youthful soldier bitterly as he saw her light form gliding through the gate of the lawn and disappearing behind its shrubbery yes i am happy indeed  throwing himself into the saddle he plunged his spurs into his horse and soon overtook his squadron which was marching slowly over the hilly roads of the county to gain the banks of the hudson  but painful as were the feelings of dunwoodie at this unexpected termination of the interview with his mistress they were but light compared with those which were experienced by the fond girl herself frances had with the keen eye of jealous love easily detected the attachment of isabella singleton to dunwoodie delicate and retiring herself it never could present itself to her mind that this love had been unsought ardent in her own affections and artless in their exhibition she had early caught the eye of the young soldier but it required all the manly frankness of dunwoodie to court her favor and the most pointed devotion to obtain his conquest this done his power was durable entire and engrossing but the unusual occurrences of the few preceding days the altered mien of her lover during those events his unwonted indifference to herself and chiefly the romantic idolatry of isabella had aroused new sensations in her bosom with a dread of her lovers integrity had been awakened the neverfailing concomitant of the purest affection a distrust of her own merits in the moment of enthusiasm the task of resigning her lover to another who might be more worthy of him seemed easy but it is in vain that the imagination attempts to deceive the heart dunwoodie had no sooner disappeared than our heroine felt all the misery of her situation and if the youth found some relief in the cares of his command frances was less fortunate in the performance of a duty imposed on her by filial piety the removal of his son had nearly destroyed the little energy of mr wharton who required all the tenderness of his remaining children to convince him that he was able to perform the ordinary functions of life     chapter xx        flatter and praise commend extol their graces      though neer so black say they have angels faces      that man who hath a tongue i say is no man      if with that tongue he cannot win a woman                                   two gentlemen of verona  in making the arrangements by which captain lawton had been left with sergeant hollister and twelve men as a guard over the wounded and heavy baggage of the corps dunwoodie had consulted not only the information which had been conveyed in the letter of colonel singleton but the bruises of his comrades body in vain lawton declared himself fit for any duty that man could perform or plainly intimated that his men would never follow tom mason to a charge with the alacrity and confidence with which they followed himself his commander was firm and the reluctant captain was compelled to comply with as good a grace as he could assume before parting dunwoodie repeated his caution to keep a watchful eye on the inmates of the cottage and especially enjoined him if any movements of a particularly suspicious nature were seen in the neighborhood to break up from his present quarters and to move down with his party and take possession of the domains of mr wharton a vague suspicion of danger to the family had been awakened in the breast of the major by the language of the peddler although he was unable to refer it to any particular source or to understand why it was to be apprehended  for some time after the departure of the troops the captain was walking before the door of the hotel inwardly cursing his fate that condemned him to an inglorious idleness at a moment when a meeting with the enemy might be expected and replying to the occasional queries of betty who from the interior of the building ever and anon demanded in a high tone of voice an explanation of various passages in the peddlers escape which as yet she could not comprehend at this instant he was joined by the surgeon who had hitherto been engaged among his patients in a distant building and was profoundly ignorant of everything that had occurred even to the departure of the troops  where are all the sentinels john he inquired as he gazed around with a look of curiosity and why are you here alone  offall off with dunwoodie to the river you and i are left here to take care of a few sick men and some women  i am glad however said the surgeon that major dunwoodie had consideration enough not to move the wounded here you mrs elizabeth flanagan hasten with some food that i may appease my appetite i have a dead body to dissect and am in haste  and here you mister doctor archibald sitgreaves echoed betty showing her blooming countenance from a broken window of the kitchen you are ever acoming too late here is nothing to ate but the skin of jenny and the body yere mentioning  woman said the surgeon in anger do you take me for a cannibal that you address your filthy discourse to me in this manner i bid you hasten with such food as may be proper to be received into the stomach fasting  and im sure its for a popgun that i should be taking you sooner than for a cannon ball said betty winking at the captain and i tell ye that its fasting you must be unless yell let me cook ye a steak from the skin of jenny the boys have ate me up intirely  lawton now interfered to preserve the peace and assured the surgeon that he had already dispatched the proper persons in quest of food for the party a little mollified with this explanation the operator soon forgot his hunger and declared his intention of proceeding to business at once  and where is your subject asked lawton  the peddler said the other glancing a look at the signpost i made hollister put a stage so high that the neck would not be dislocated by the fall and i intend making as handsome a skeleton of him as there is in the states of north america the fellow has good points and his bones are well knit i will make a perfect beauty of him i have long been wanting something of this sort to send as a present to my old aunt in virginia who was so kind to me when a boy  the devil cried lawton would you send the old woman a dead mans bones  why not said the surgeon what nobler object is there in nature than the figure of a manand the skeleton may be called his elementary parts but what has been done with the body  off too  off and who has dared to interfere with my perquisites  sure jist the divil said betty and wholl be taking yeerself away some of these times too without asking yeer lave  silence you witch said lawton with difficulty suppressing a laugh is this the manner in which to address an officer  who called me the filthy elizabeth flanagan cried the washerwoman snapping her fingers contemptuously i can remimber a frind for a year and dont forgit an inimy for a month  but the friendship or enmity of mrs flanagan was alike indifferent to the surgeon who could think of nothing but his loss and lawton was obliged to explain to his friend the apparent manner in which it had happened  and a lucky escape it was for ye my jewel of a doctor cried betty as the captain concluded sargeant hollister who saw him face to face as it might be says its beelzeboob and no piddler unless it may be in a small matter of lies and thefts and sich wickedness now a pretty figure ye would have been in cutting up beelzeboob if the major had hanged him i dont think its very asy he would have been under yeer knife  thus doubly disappointed in his meal and his business sitgreaves suddenly declared his intention of visiting the locusts and inquiring into the state of captain singleton lawton was ready for the excursion and mounting they were soon on the road though the surgeon was obliged to submit to a few more jokes from the washerwoman before he could get out of hearing for some time the two rode in silence when lawton perceiving that his companions temper was somewhat ruffled by his disappointments and bettys attack made an effort to restore the tranquillity of his feelings  that was a charming song archibald that you commenced last evening when we were interrupted by the party that brought in the peddler he said the allusion to galen was much to the purpose  i knew you would like it jack when you had got the fumes of the wine out of your head poetry is a respectable art though it wants the precision of the exact sciences and the natural beneficence of the physical considered in reference to the wants of life i should define poetry as an emollient rather than as a succulent  and yet your ode was full of the meat of wit  ode is by no means a proper term for the composition i should term it a classical ballad  very probably said the trooper hearing only one verse it was difficult to class the composition  the surgeon involuntarily hemmed and began to clear his throat although scarcely conscious himself to what the preparation tended but the captain rolling his dark eyes towards his companion and observing him to be sitting with great uneasiness on his horse continued  the air is still and the road solitarywhy not give the remainder it is never too late to repair a loss  my dear john if i thought it would correct the errors you have imbibed from habit and indulgence nothing could give me more pleasure  we are fast approaching some rocks on our left the echo will double my satisfaction  thus encouraged and somewhat impelled by the opinion that he both sang and wrote with taste the surgeon set about complying with the request in sober earnest some little time was lost in clearing his throat and getting the proper pitch of his voice but no sooner were these two points achieved than lawton had the secret delight of hearing his friend commence       hast thou ever  hush interrupted the trooper what rustling noise is that among the rocks  it must have been the rushing of the melody a powerful voice is like the breathing of the winds       hast thou ever  listen said lawton stopping his horse he had not done speaking when a stone fell at his feet and rolled harmlessly across the path  a friendly shot that cried the trooper neither the weapon nor its force implies much ill will  blows from stones seldom produce more than contusions said the operator bending his gaze in every direction in vain in quest of the hand from which the missile had been hurled it must be meteoric there is no living being in sight except ourselves  it would be easy to hide a regiment behind those rocks returned the trooper dismounting and taking the stone in his hand oh here is the explanation along with the mystery so saying he tore a piece of paper that had been ingeniously fastened to the small fragment of rock which had thus singularly fallen before him and opening it the captain read the following words written in no very legible hand a musket bullet will go farther than a stone and things more dangerous than yarbs for wounded men lie hid in the rocks of westchester the horse may be good but can he mount a precipice  thou sayest the truth strange man said lawton courage and activity would avail but little against assassination and these rugged passes remounting his horse he cried aloud thanks unknown friend your caution will be remembered  a meager hand was extended for an instant over a rock in the air and afterwards nothing further was seen or heard in that quarter by the soldiers  quite an extraordinary interruption said the astonished sitgreaves and a letter of very mysterious meaning  oh tis nothing but the wit of some bumpkin who thinks to frighten two of the virginians by an artifice of this kind said the trooper placing the billet in his pocket but let me tell you mr archibald sitgreaves you were wanting to dissect just now a damned honest fellow  it was the peddlerone of the most notorious spies in the enemys service and i must say that i think it would be an honor to such a man to be devoted to the uses of science  he may be a spyhe must be one said lawton musing but he has a heart above enmity and a soul that would honor a soldier  the surgeon turned a vacant eye on his companion as he uttered this soliloquy while the penetrating looks of the trooper had already discovered another pile of rocks which jutting forward nearly obstructed the highway that wound directly around its base  what the steed cannot mount the foot of man can overcome exclaimed the wary partisan throwing himself again from his saddle and leaping a wall of stone he began to ascend the hill at a pace which would soon have given him a birdseye view of the rocks in question together with all their crevices this movement was no sooner made than lawton caught a glimpse of the figure of a man stealing rapidly from his approach and disappearing on the opposite side of the precipice  spur sitgreavesspur shouted the trooper dashing over every impediment in pursuit and murder the villain as he flies  the former part of the request was promptly complied with and a few moments brought the surgeon in full view of a man armed with a musket who was crossing the road and evidently seeking the protection of the thick wood on its opposite side  stop my friendstop until captain lawton comes up if you please cried the surgeon observing him to flee with a rapidity that baffled his horsemanship but as if the invitation contained new terrors the footman redoubled his efforts nor paused even to breathe until he had reached his goal when turning on his heel he discharged his musket towards the surgeon and was out of sight in an instant to gain the highway and throw himself into his saddle detained lawton but a moment and he rode to the side of his comrade just as the figure disappeared  which way has he fled cried the trooper  john said the surgeon am i not a noncombatant  whither has the rascal fled cried lawton impatiently  where you cannot followinto that wood but i repeat john am i not a noncombatant  the disappointed trooper perceiving that his enemy had escaped him now turned his eyes which were flashing with anger upon his comrade and gradually his muscles lost their rigid compression his brow relaxed and his look changed from its fierce expression to the covert laughter which so often distinguished his countenance the surgeon sat in dignified composure on his horse his thin body erect and his head elevated with the indignation of one conscious of having been unjustly treated  why did you suffer the villain to escape demanded the captain once within reach of my saber and i would have given you a subject for the dissecting table  twas impossible to prevent it said the surgeon pointing to the bars before which he had stopped his horse the rogue threw himself on the other side of this fence and left me where you see nor would the man in the least attend to my remonstrances or to an intimation that you wished to hold discourse with him  he was truly a discourteous rascal but why did you not leap the fence and compel him to a halt you see but three of the bars are up and betty flanagan could clear them on her cow  the surgeon for the first time withdrew his eyes from the place where the fugitive had disappeared and turned his look on his comrade his head however was not permitted to lower itself in the least as he replied  i humbly conceive captain lawton that neither mrs elizabeth flanagan nor her cow is an example to be emulated by doctor archibald sitgreaves it would be but a sorry compliment to science to say that a doctor of medicine had fractured both his legs by injudiciously striking them against a pair of barposts while speaking the surgeon raised the limbs in question to a nearly horizontal position an attitude which really appeared to bid defiance to anything like a passage for himself through the defile but the trooper disregarding this ocular proof of the impossibility of the movement cried hastily  here was nothing to stop you man i could leap a platoon through boot and thigh without pricking with a single spur pshaw i have often charged upon the bayonets of infantry over greater difficulties than this  you will please to remember captain john lawton that i am not the riding master of the regimentnor a drill sergeantnor a crazy cornet no sirand i speak it with a due respect for the commission of the continental congressnor an inconsiderate captain who regards his own life as little as that of his enemies i am only sir a poor humble man of letters a mere doctor of medicine an unworthy graduate of edinburgh and a surgeon of dragoons nothing more i do assure you captain john lawton so saying he turned his horses head towards the cottage and recommenced his ride  aye you speak the truth muttered the dragoon had i but the meanest rider of my troop with me i should have taken the scoundrel and given at least one victim to the laws but archibald no man can ride well who straddles in this manner like the colossus of rhodes you should depend less on your stirrup and keep your seat by the power of the knee  with proper deference to your experience captain lawton returned the surgeon i conceive myself to be no incompetent judge of muscular action whether in the knee or in any other part of the human frame and although but humbly educated i am not now to learn that the wider the base the more firm is the superstructure  would you fill a highway in this manner with one pair of legs when half a dozen might pass together in comfort stretching them abroad like the scythes of the ancient chariot wheels  the allusion to the practice of the ancients somewhat softened the indignation of the surgeon and he replied with rather less hauteur  you should speak with reverence of the usages of those who have gone before us and who however ignorant they were in matters of science and particularly that of surgery yet furnished many brilliant hints to our own improvements now sir i have no doubt that galen has operated on wounds occasioned by these very scythes that you mention although we can find no evidence of the fact in contemporary writers ah they must have given dreadful injuries and i doubt not caused great uneasiness to the medical gentlemen of that day  occasionally a body must have been left in two pieces to puzzle the ingenuity of those gentry to unite yet venerable and learned as they were i doubt not they did it  what unite two parts of the human body that have been severed by an edged instrument to any of the purposes of animal life  that have been rent asunder by a scythe and are united to do military duty said lawton  tis impossiblequite impossible cried the surgeon it is in vain captain lawton that human ingenuity endeavors to baffle the efforts of nature think my dear sir in this case you separate all the arteriesinjure all of the intestinessever all of the nerves and sinews and what is of more consequence you  you have said enough dr sitgreaves to convince a member of a rival school nothing shall ever tempt me willingly to submit to be divided in this irretrievable manner  certes there is little pleasure in a wound which from its nature is incurable  i should think so said lawton dryly  what do you think is the greatest pleasure in life asked the operator suddenly  that must greatly depend on taste  not at all cried the surgeon it is in witnessing or rather feeling the ravages of disease repaired by the lights of science cooperating with nature i once broke my little finger intentionally in order that i might reduce the fracture and watch the cure it was only on a small scale you know dear john still the thrilling sensation excited by the knitting of the bone aided by the contemplation of the art of man thus acting in unison with nature exceeded any other enjoyment that i have ever experienced now had it been one of the more important members such as the leg or arm how much greater must the pleasure have been  or the neck said the trooper but their desultory discourse was interrupted by their arrival at the cottage of mr wharton no one appearing to usher them into an apartment the captain proceeded to the door of the parlor where he knew visitors were commonly received on opening it he paused for a moment in admiration at the scene within the person of colonel wellmere first met his eye bending towards the figure of the blushing sarah with an earnestness of manner that prevented the noise of lawtons entrance from being heard by either of the parties certain significant signs which were embraced at a glance by the prying gaze of the trooper at once made him a master of their secret and he was about to retire as silently as he had advanced when his companion pushing himself through the passage abruptly entered the room advancing instantly to the chair of wellmere the surgeon instinctively laid hold of his arm and exclaimed  bless mea quick and irregular pulseflushed cheek and fiery eyestrong febrile symptoms and such as must be attended to while speaking the doctor who was much addicted to practicing in a summary waya weakness of most medical men in military practicehad already produced his lancet and was making certain other indications of his intentions to proceed at once to business but colonel wellmere recovering from the confusion of the surprise arose from his seat haughtily and said  sir it is the warmth of the room that lends me the color and i am already too much indebted to your skill to give you any further trouble miss wharton knows that i am quite well and i do assure you that i never felt better or happier in my life  there was a peculiar emphasis on the latter part of this speech that however it might gratify the feelings of sarah brought the color to her cheeks again and sitgreaves as his eye followed the direction of those of his patient did not fail to observe it  your arm if you please madam said the surgeon advancing with a bow anxiety and watching have done their work on your delicate frame and there are symptoms about you that must not be neglected  excuse me sir said sarah recovering herself with womanly pride the heat is oppressive and i will retire and acquaint miss peyton with your presence  there was but little difficulty in practicing on the abstracted simplicity of the surgeon but it was necessary for sarah to raise her eyes to return the salutation of lawton as he bowed his head nearly to a level with the hand that held open the door for her passage one look was sufficient she was able to control her steps sufficiently to retire with dignity but no sooner was she relieved from the presence of all observers than she fell into a chair and abandoned herself to a feeling of mingled shame and pleasure  a little nettled at the contumacious deportment of the british colonel sitgreaves after once more tendering services that were again rejected withdrew to the chamber of young singleton whither lawton had already preceded him     chapter xxi        oh henry when thou deignst to sue         can i thy suit withstand      when thou loved youth hast won my heart         can i refuse my hand                     hermit of warkevorth  the graduate of edinburgh found his patient rapidly improving in health and entirely free from fever his sister with a cheek that was if possible paler than on her arrival watched around his couch with tender care and the ladies of the cottage had not in the midst of their sorrows and varied emotions forgotten to discharge the duties of hospitality frances felt herself impelled towards their disconsolate guest with an interest for which she could not account and with a force that she could not control she had unconsciously connected the fates of dunwoodie and isabella in her imagination and she felt with the romantic ardor of a generous mind that she was serving her former lover most by exhibiting kindness to her he loved best isabella received her attentions with gratitude but neither of them indulged in any allusions to the latent source of their uneasiness the observation of miss peyton seldom penetrated beyond things that were visible and to her the situation of henry wharton seemed to furnish an awful excuse for the fading cheeks and tearful eyes of her niece if sarah manifested less of care than her sister still the unpracticed aunt was not at a loss to comprehend the reason love is a holy feeling with the virtuous of the female sex and it hallows all that come within its influence although miss peyton mourned with sincerity over the danger which threatened her nephew she well knew that an active campaign was not favorable to love and the moments that were thus accidentally granted were not to be thrown away  several days now passed without any interruption of the usual avocations of the inhabitants of the cottage or the party at the four corners the former were supporting their fortitude with the certainty of henrys innocence and a strong reliance on dunwoodies exertions in his behalf and the latter waiting with impatience the intelligence that was hourly expected of a conflict and their orders to depart captain lawton however waited for both these events in vain letters from the major announced that the enemy finding that the party which was to coöperate with them had been defeated and was withdrawn had retired also behind the works of fort washington where they continued inactive threatening constantly to strike a blow in revenge for their disgrace the trooper was enjoined to vigilance and the letter concluded with a compliment to his honor zeal and undoubted bravery  extremely flattering major dunwoodie muttered the dragoon as he threw down this epistle and stalked across the floor to quiet his impatience a proper guard have you selected for this service let me seei have to watch over the interests of a crazy irresolute old man who does not know whether he belongs to us or to the enemy four women three of whom are well enough in themselves but who are not immensely flattered by my society and the fourth who good as she is is on the wrong side of forty some two or three blacks a talkative housekeeper that does nothing but chatter about gold and despisables and signs and omens and poor george singleton well a comrade in suffering has a claim on a manso ill make the best of it  as he concluded this soliloquy the trooper took a seat and began to whistle to convince himself how little he cared about the matter when by throwing his booted leg carelessly round he upset the canteen that held his whole stock of brandy the accident was soon repaired but in replacing the wooden vessel he observed a billet lying on the bench on which the liquor had been placed it was soon opened and he read the moon will not rise till after midnighta fit time for deeds of darkness there was no mistaking the hand it was clearly the same that had given him the timely warning against assassination and the trooper continued for a long time musing on the nature of these two notices and the motives that could induce the peddler to favor an implacable enemy in the manner that he had latterly done that he was a spy of the enemy lawton knew for the fact of his conveying intelligence to the english commander in chief of a party of americans that were exposed to the enemy was proved most clearly against him on the trial for his life the consequences of his treason had been avoided it is true by a lucky order from washington which withdrew the regiment a short time before the british appeared to cut it off but still the crime was the same perhaps thought the partisan he wishes to make a friend of me against the event of another capture but at all events he spared my life on one occasion and saved it on another i will endeavor to be as generous as himself and pray that my duty may never interfere with my feelings  whether the danger intimated in the present note threatened the cottage or his own party the captain was uncertain but he inclined to the latter opinion and determined to beware how he rode abroad in the dark to a man in a peaceable country and in times of quiet and order the indifference with which the partisan regarded the impending danger would be inconceivable his reflections on the subject were more directed towards devising means to entrap his enemies than to escape their machinations but the arrival of the surgeon who had been to pay his daily visit to the locusts interrupted his meditations sitgreaves brought an invitation from the mistress of the mansion to captain lawton desiring that the cottage might be honored with his presence at an early hour on that evening  ha cried the trooper then they have received a letter also  i think nothing more probable said the surgeon there is a chaplain at the cottage from the royal army who has come out to exchange the british wounded and who has an order from colonel singleton for their delivery but a more mad project than to remove them now was never adopted  a priest say youis he a hard drinkera real campidlera fellow to breed a famine in a regiment or does he seem a man who is earnest in his trade  a very respectable and orderly gentleman and not unreasonably given to intemperance judging from the outward symptoms returned the surgeon and a man who really says grace in a very regular and appropriate manner  and does he stay the night  certainly he waits for his cartel but hasten john we have but little time to waste i will just step up and bleed two or three of the englishmen who are to move in the morning in order to anticipate inflammation and be with you immediately  the gala suit of captain lawton was easily adjusted to his huge frame and his companion being ready they once more took their route towards the cottage roanoke had been as much benefited by a few days rest as his master and lawton ardently wished as he curbed his gallant steed on passing the wellremembered rocks that his treacherous enemy stood before him mounted and armed as himself but no enemy nor any disturbance whatever interfered with their progress and they reached the locusts just as the sun was throwing his setting rays on the valley and tingeing the tops of the leafless trees with gold it never required more than a single look to acquaint the trooper with the particulars of every scene that was not uncommonly veiled and the first survey that he took on entering the house told him more than the observations of a day had put into the possession of doctor sitgreaves miss peyton accosted him with a smiling welcome that exceeded the bounds of ordinary courtesy and which evidently flowed more from feelings that were connected with the heart than from manner frances glided about tearful and agitated while mr wharton stood ready to receive them decked in a suit of velvet that would have been conspicuous in the gayest drawingroom colonel wellmere was in the uniform of an officer of the household troops of his prince and isabella singleton sat in the parlor clad in the habiliments of joy but with a countenance that belied her appearance while her brother by her side looked with a cheek of flitting color and an eye of intense interest like anything but an invalid as it was the third day that he had left his room dr sitgreaves who began to stare about him in stupid wonder forgot to reprove his patient for imprudence into this scene captain lawton moved with all the composure and gravity of a man whose nerves were not easily discomposed by novelties his compliments were received as graciously as they were offered and after exchanging a few words with the different individuals present he approached the surgeon who had withdrawn in a kind of confused astonishment to rally his senses  john whispered the surgeon with awakened curiosity what means this festival  that your wig and my black head would look the better for a little of betty flanagans flour but it is too late now and we must fight the battle armed as you see  observe here comes the army chaplain in his full robes as a doctor divinitatis what can it mean  an exchange said the trooper the wounded of cupid are to meet and settle their accounts with the god in the way of plighting faith to suffer from his archery no more  the surgeon laid a finger on the side of his nose and he began to comprehend the case  is it not a crying shame that a sunshine hero and an enemy should thus be suffered to steal away one of the fairest plants that grow in our soil muttered lawton a flower fit to be placed in the bosom of any man  if he be not more accommodating as a husband than as a patient john i fear me that the lady will lead a troubled life  let her said the trooper indignantly she has chosen from her countrys enemies and may she meet with a foreigners virtues in her choice  further conversation was interrupted by miss peyton who advancing acquainted them that they had been invited to grace the nuptials of her eldest niece and colonel wellmere the gentlemen bowed and the good aunt with an inherent love of propriety went on to add that the acquaintance was of an old date and the attachment by no means a sudden thing to this lawton merely bowed still more ceremoniously but the surgeon who loved to hold converse with the virgin replied  that the human mind was differently constituted in different individuals in some impressions are vivid and transitory in others more deep and lasting indeed there are some philosophers who pretend to trace a connection between the physical and mental powers of the animal but for my part madam i believe that the one is much influenced by habit and association and the other subject altogether to the peculiar laws of matter  miss peyton in her turn bowed her silent assent to this remark and retired with dignity to usher the intended bride into the presence of the company the hour had arrived when american custom has decreed that the vows of wedlock must be exchanged and sarah blushing with a variety of emotions followed her aunt to the drawingroom wellmere sprang to receive the hand that with an averted face she extended towards him and for the first time the english colonel appeared fully conscious of the important part that he was to act in the approaching ceremony hitherto his air had been abstracted and his manner uneasy but everything excepting the certainty of his bliss seemed to vanish at the blaze of loveliness that now burst on his sight all arose from their seats and the reverend gentleman had already opened the sacred volume when the absence of frances was noticed miss peyton withdrew in search of her youngest niece whom she found in her own apartment and in tears  come my love the ceremony waits but for us said the aunt affectionately entwining her arm in that of her niece endeavor to compose yourself that proper honor may be done to the choice of your sister  is hecan he be worthy of her  can he be otherwise returned miss peyton is he not a gentlemana gallant soldier though an unfortunate one and certainly my love one who appears every way qualified to make any woman happy  frances had given vent to her feelings and with an effort she collected sufficient resolution to venture to join the party below but to relieve the embarrassment of this delay the clergyman had put sundry questions to the bridegroom one of which was by no means answered to his satisfaction wellmere was compelled to acknowledge that he was unprovided with a ring and to perform the marriage ceremony without one the divine pronounced to be canonically impossible his appeal to mr wharton for the propriety of this decision was answered affirmatively as it would have been negatively had the question been put in a manner to lead to such a result the owner of the locusts had lost the little energy he possessed by the blow recently received through his son and his assent to the objection of the clergyman was as easily obtained as had been his consent to the premature proposals of wellmere in this stage of the dilemma miss peyton and frances appeared the surgeon of dragoons approached the former and as he handed her to a chair observed  it appears madam that untoward circumstances have prevented colonel wellmere from providing all of the decorations that custom antiquity and the canons of the church have prescribed as indispensable to enter into the honorable state of wedlock  miss peyton glanced her quiet eye at the uneasy bridegroom and perceiving him to be adorned with what she thought sufficient splendor allowing for the time and the suddenness of the occasion she turned her look on the speaker as if to demand an explanation  the surgeon understood her wishes and proceeded at once to gratify them  there is he observed an opinion prevalent that the heart lies on the left side of the body and that the connection between the members of that side and what may be called the seat of life is more intimate than that which exists with their opposites but this is an error which grows out of an ignorance of the organic arrangement of the human frame in obedience to this opinion the fourth finger of the left hand is thought to contain a virtue that belongs to no other branch of that digitated member and it is ordinarily encircled during the solemnization of wedlock with a cincture or ring as if to chain that affection to the marriage state which is best secured by the graces of the female character while speaking the operator laid his hand expressively on his heart and he bowed nearly to the floor when he had concluded  i know not sir that i rightly understand your meaning said miss peyton whose want of comprehension was sufficiently excusable  a ring madama ring is wanting for the ceremony  the instant that the surgeon spoke explicitly the awkwardness of the situation was understood she glanced her eyes at her nieces and in the younger she read a secret exultation that somewhat displeased her but the countenance of sarah was suffused with a shame that the considerate aunt well understood not for the world would she violate any of the observances of female etiquette it suggested itself to all the females at the same moment that the wedding ring of the late mother and sister was reposing peacefully amid the rest of her jewelry in a secret receptacle that had been provided at an early day to secure the valuables against the predatory inroads of the marauders who roamed through the county into this hidden vault the plate and whatever was most prized made a nightly retreat and there the ring in question had long lain forgotten until at this moment but it was the business of the bridegroom from time immemorial to furnish this indispensable to wedlock and on no account would miss peyton do anything that transcended the usual reserve of the sex on this solemn occasion certainly not until sufficient expiation for the offense had been made by a due portion of trouble and disquiet this material fact therefore was not disclosed by either the aunt consulting female propriety the bride yielding to shame and frances rejoicing that an embarrassment proceeding from almost any cause should delay her sisters vow it was reserved for doctor sitgreaves to interrupt the awkward silence  if madam a plain ring that once belonged to a sister of my own he paused and hemmedif madam a ring of that description might be admitted to this honor i have one that could be easily produced from my quarters at the corners and i doubt not it would fit the finger for which it is desired there is a strong resemblance betweenhembetween my late sister and miss wharton in stature and anatomical figure and in all eligible subjects the proportions are apt to be observed throughout the whole animal economy  a glance of miss peytons eye recalled colonel wellmere to a sense of his duty and springing from his chair he assured the surgeon that in no way could he confer a greater obligation on himself than by sending for that very ring the operator bowed a little haughtily and withdrew to fulfill his promise by dispatching a messenger on the errand the aunt suffered him to retire but unwillingness to admit a stranger into the privacy of their domestic arrangements induced her to follow and tender the services of caesar instead of those of sitgreaves man who had volunteered for this duty katy haynes was accordingly directed to summon the black to the vacant parlor and thither miss peyton and the surgeon repaired to give their several instructions  the consent to this sudden union of sarah and wellmere and especially at a time when the life of a member of the family was in such imminent jeopardy was given from a conviction that the unsettled state of the country would probably prevent another opportunity to the lovers of meeting and a secret dread on the part of mr wharton that the death of his son might by hastening his own leave his remaining children without a protector but notwithstanding miss peyton had complied with her brothers wish to profit by the accidental visit of a divine she had not thought it necessary to blazon the intended nuptials of her niece to the neighborhood had even time been allowed she thought therefore that she was now communicating a profound secret to the negro and her housekeeper  caesar she commenced with a smile you are now to learn that your young mistress miss sarah is to be united to colonel wellmere this evening  i tink i see him afore said caesar chuckling old black man can tell when a young lady make up he mind  really caesar i find i have never given you credit for half the observation that you deserve but as you already know on what emergency your services are required listen to the directions of this gentleman and observe them  the black turned in quiet submission to the surgeon who commenced as follows  caesar your mistress has already acquainted you with the important event about to be solemnized within this habitation but a cincture or ring is wanting to encircle the finger of the bride a custom derived from the ancients and which has been continued in the marriage forms of several branches of the christian church and which is even by a species of typical wedlock used in the installation of prelates as you doubtless understand  praps massa doctor will say him over agin interrupted the old negro whose memory began to fail him just as the other made so confident an allusion to his powers of comprehension i tink i get him by heart dis time  it is impossible to gather honey from a rock caesar and therefore i will abridge the little i have to say ride to the four corners and present this note to sergeant hollister or to mrs elizabeth flanagan either of whom will furnish the necessary pledge of connubial affection and return forthwith  the letter which the surgeon put into the hands of his messenger as he ceased was conceived in the following terms  if the fever has left kinder give him nourishment take three ounces more of blood from watson have a search made that the woman flanagan has left none of her jugs of alcohol in the hospital renew the dressings of johnson and dismiss smith to duty send the ring which is pendent from the chain of the watch that i left with you to time the doses by the bearer  archibald sitgreaves m d surgeon of dragoons  caesar said katy when she was alone with the black put the ring when you get it in your left pocket for that is nearest your heart and by no means endeavor to try it on your finger for it is unlucky  try um on he finger interrupted the negro stretching forth his bony knuckles tink a miss sallys ring go on old caesar finger  tis not consequential whether it goes on or not said the housekeeper but it is an evil omen to place a marriage ring on the finger of another after wedlock and of course it may be dangerous before  i tell you katy i neber tink to put um on a finger  go then caesar and do not forget the left pocket be careful to take off your hat as you pass the graveyard and be expeditious for nothing i am certain can be more trying to the patience than thus to be waiting for the ceremony when a body has fully made up her mind to marry  with this injunction caesar quitted the house and he was soon firmly fixed in the saddle from his youth the black like all of his race had been a hard rider but bending under the weight of sixty winters his african blood had lost some of its native heat the night was dark and the wind whistled through the vale with the dreariness of november when caesar reached the graveyard he uncovered his grizzled head with superstitious awe and threw around him many a fearful glance in momentary expectation of seeing something superhuman there was sufficient light to discern a being of earthly mold stealing from among the graves apparently with a design to enter the highway it is in vain that philosophy and reason contend with early impressions and poor caesar was even without the support of either of these frail allies he was however well mounted on a coach horse of mr whartons and clinging to the back of the animal with instinctive skill he abandoned the rein to the beast hillocks woods rocks fences and houses flew by him with the rapidity of lightning and the black had just begun to think whither and on what business he was riding in this headlong manner when he reached the place where the roads met and the hotel flanagan stood before him in its dilapidated simplicity the sight of a cheerful fire first told the negro that he had reached the habitation of man and with it came all his dread of the bloody virginians his duty must however be done and dismounting he fastened the foaming animal to a fence and approached the window with cautious steps to reconnoiter  before a blazing fire sat sergeant hollister and betty flanagan enjoying themselves over a liberal potation  i tell ye sargeant dear said betty removing the mug from her mouth tis no rasonable to think it was more than the piddler himself sure now where was the smell of sulphur and the wings and the tail and the cloven foot besides sargeant its no dacent to tell a lone famale that she had beelzeboob for a bedfellow  it matters but little mrs flanagan provided you escape his talons and fangs hereafter returned the veteran following the remark by a heavy draft  caesar heard enough to convince him that little danger from this pair was to be apprehended his teeth already began to chatter and the cold without and the comfort within stimulated him greatly to enter he made his approaches with proper caution and knocked with extreme humility the appearance of hollister with a drawn sword roughly demanding who was without contributed in no degree to the restoration of his faculties but fear itself lent him power to explain his errand  advance said the sergeant throwing a look of close scrutiny on the black as he brought him to the light advance and deliver your dispatches have you the countersign  i dont tink he know what dat be said the black shaking in his shoes dough massa dat sent me gib me many tings to carry dat he little understand  who ordered you on this duty did you say  well it war he doctor heself so he come up on a gallop as he always do on a doctors errand  twas doctor sitgreaves he never knows the countersign himself now blackey had it been captain lawton he would not have sent you here close to a sentinel without the countersign for you might get a pistol bullet through your head and that would be cruel to you for although you be black i am none of them who thinks niggers have no souls  sure a nagur has as much sowl as a white said betty come hither ould man and warm that shivering carcass of yeers by the blaze of this fire im sure a guinea nagur loves hate as much as a soldier loves his drop  caesar obeyed in silence and a mulatto boy who was sleeping on a bench in the room was bidden to convey the note of the surgeon to the building where the wounded were quartered  here said the washerwoman tendering to caesar a taste of the article that most delighted herself try a drop smooty twill warm the black sowl within your crazy body and be giving you spirits as you are going homeward  i tell you elizabeth said the sergeant that the souls of niggers are the same as our own how often have i heard the good mr whitefield say that there was no distinction of color in heaven therefore it is reasonable to believe that the soul of this here black is as white as my own or even major dunwoodies  be sure he be cried caesar a little tartly whose courage had revived by tasting the drop of mrs flanagan  its a good sowl that the major is anyway returned the washerwoman and a kind sowlaye and a brave sowl too and yell say all that yeerself sargeant im thinking  for the matter of that returned the veteran there is one above even washington to judge of souls but this i will say that major dunwoodie is a gentleman who never says go boysbut always says come boys and if a poor fellow is in want of a spur or a martingale and the leatherwhack is gone there is never wanting the real silver to make up the loss and that from his own pocket too  why then are you here idle when all that he holds most dear are in danger cried a voice with startling abruptness mount mount and follow your captain arm and mount and that instantly or you will be too late  this unexpected interruption produced an instantaneous confusion amongst the tipplers caesar fled instinctively into the fireplace where he maintained his position in defiance of a heat that would have roasted a white man sergeant hollister turned promptly on his heel and seizing big saber the steel was glittering by the firelight in the twinkling of an eye but perceiving the intruder to be the peddler who stood near the open door that led to the leanto in the rear he began to fall back towards the position of the black with a military intuition that taught him to concentrate his forces betty alone stood her ground by the side of the temporary table replenishing the mug with a large addition of the article known to the soldiery by the name of chokedog she held it towards the peddler the eyes of the washerwoman had for some time been swimming with love and liquor and turning them goodnaturedly on birch she cried  faith but yere wilcome mister piddler or mister birch or mister beelzeboob or whats yeer name yere an honest divil anyway and im hoping that you found the pitticoats convanient come forward dear and fale the fire sergeant hollister wont be hurting you for the fear of an ill turn you may be doing him hereafterwill ye sargeant dear  depart ungodly man cried the veteran edging still nearer to caesar but lifting his legs alternately as they scorched with the heat depart in peace there is none here for thy service and you seek the woman in vain there is a tender mercy that will save her from thy talons the sergeant ceased to utter aloud but the motion of his lips continued and a few scattering words of prayer were alone audible  the brain of the washerwoman was in such a state of confusion that she did not clearly comprehend the meaning of her suitor but a new idea struck her imagination and she broke forth  if its me the man saaks wheres the matter pray am i not a widowed body and my own property and you talk of tinderness sargeant but its little i see of it anyway who knows but mr beelzeboob here is free to speak his mind im sure it is willing to hear i am  woman said the peddler be silent and you foolish man mountarm and mount and fly to the rescue of your officer if you are worthy of the cause in which you serve and would not disgrace the coat you wear the peddler vanished from the sight of the bewildered trio with a rapidity that left them uncertain whither he had fled  on hearing the voice of an old friend caesar emerged from his corner and fearlessly advanced to the spot where betty had resolutely maintained her ground though in a state of utter mental confusion  i wish harvey stop said the black if he ride down a road i should like he company i dont tink johnny birch hurt he own son  poor ignorant wretch exclaimed the veteran recovering his voice with a longdrawn breath think you that figure was made of flesh and blood  harvey aint fleshy replied the black but he berry clebber man  pooh sargeant dear exclaimed the washerwoman talk rason for once and mind what the knowing one tells ye call out the boys and ride a bit after captain jack remimber darling that he told ye the day to be in readiness to mount at a moments warning  aye but not at a summons from the foul fiend let captain lawton or lieutenant mason or cornet skipwith say the word and who is quicker in the saddle than i  well sargeant how often is it that yeve boasted to myself that the corps wasnt a bit afeard to face the divil  no more are we in battle array and by daylight but its foolhardy and irreverent to tempt satan and on such a night as this listen how the wind whistles through the trees and hark there is the howling of evil spirits abroad  i see him said caesar opening his eyes to a width that might have embraced more than an ideal form  where interrupted the sergeant instinctively laying his hand on the hilt of his saber  no no said the black i see a johnny birch come out of he gravejohnny walk afore he buried  ah then he must have led an evil life indeed said hollister the blessed in spirit lie quiet until the general muster but wickedness disturbs the soul in this life as well as in that which is to come  and what is to come of captain jack cried betty angrily is it yeer orders that ye wont mind nor a warning given ill jist git my cart and ride down and tell him that yere afeard of a dead man and beelzeboob and it isnt succor he may be expicting from ye i wonder wholl be the orderly of the troop the morrow thenhis name wont be hollister anyway  nay betty nay said the sergeant laying his hand familiarly on her shoulder if there must be riding tonight let it be by him whose duty it is to call out the men and set an example the lord have mercy and send us enemies of flesh and blood  another glass confirmed the veteran in a resolution that was only excited by a dread of his captains displeasure and he proceeded to summon the dozen men who had been left under his command the boy arriving with the ring caesar placed it carefully in the pocket of his waistcoat next his heart and mounting shut his eyes seized his charger by the mane and continued in a state of comparative insensibility until the animal stopped at the door of the warm stable whence he had started  the movements of the dragoons being timed to the order of a march were much slower for they were made with a watchfulness that was intended to guard against surprise from the evil one himself     chapter xxii        be not your tongue thy own shames orator      look sweet speak fair become disloyalty      apparel vice like virtues harbinger                                      comedy of errors  the situation of the party in mr whartons dwelling was sufficiently awkward during the hour of caesars absence for such was the astonishing rapidity displayed by his courser that the four miles of road was gone over and the events we have recorded had occurred somewhat within that period of time of course the gentlemen strove to make the irksome moments fly as swiftly as possible but premeditated happiness is certainly of the least joyous kind the bride and bridegroom are immemorially privileged to be dull and but few of their friends seemed disposed on the present occasion to dishonor their example the english colonel exhibited a proper portion of uneasiness at this unexpected interruption of his felicity and he sat with a varying countenance by the side of sarah who seemed to be profiting by the delay to gather fortitude for the solemn ceremony in the midst of this embarrassing silence doctor sitgreaves addressed himself to miss peyton by whose side he had contrived to procure a chair marriage madam is pronounced to be honorable in the sight of god and man and it may be said to be reduced in the present age to the laws of nature and reason the ancients in sanctioning polygamy lost sight of the provisions of nature and condemned thousands to misery but with the increase of science have grown the wise ordinances of society which ordain that man should be the husband of but one woman  wellmere glanced a fierce expression of disgust at the surgeon that indicated his sense of the tediousness of the others remarks while miss peyton with a slight hesitation as if fearful of touching on forbidden subjects replied  i had thought sir that we were indebted to the christian religion for our morals on this subject  true madam it is somewhere provided in the prescriptions of the apostles that the sexes should henceforth be on an equality in this particular but in what degree could polygamy affect holiness of life it was probably a wise arrangement of paul who was much of a scholar and probably had frequent conferences on this important subject with luke whom we all know to have been bred to the practice of medicine  there is no telling how far the discursive fancy of sitgreaves might have led him on this subject had he not been interrupted but lawton who had been a close though silent observer of all that passed profited by the hint to ask abruptly  pray colonel wellmere in what manner is bigamy punished in england  the bridegroom started and his lip blanched recovering himself however on the instant he answered with a suavity that became so happy a man  deathas such an offense merits he said  death and dissection continued the operator it is seldom that law loses sight of eventual utility in a malefactor bigamy in a man is a heinous offense  more so than celibacy asked lawton  more so returned the surgeon with undisturbed simplicity one who remains in a single state may devote his life to science and the extension of knowledge if not of his species but the wretch who profits by the constitutional tendency of the female sex to credulity and tenderness incurs the wickedness of a positive sin heightened by the baseness of deception  really sir the ladies are infinitely obliged to you for attributing folly to them as part of their nature  captain lawton in man the animal is more nobly formed than in woman the nerves are endowed with less sensi bility the whole frame is less pliable and yielding is it therefore surprising that a tendency to rely on the faith of her partner is more natural to woman than to the other sex  wellmere as if unable to listen with any degree of patience to so illtimed a dialogue sprang from his seat and paced the floor in disorder pitying his situation the reverend gentleman who was patiently awaiting the return of caesar changed the discourse and a few minutes brought the black himself the billet was handed to dr sitgreaves for miss peyton had expressly enjoined caesar not to implicate her in any manner in the errand on which he was dispatched the note contained a summary statement of the several subjects of the surgeons directions and referred him to the black for the ring the latter was instantly demanded and promptly delivered a transient look of melancholy clouded the brow of the surgeon as he stood a moment and gazed silently on the bauble nor did he remember the place or the occasion while he mournfully soliloquized as follows  poor anna gay as innocence and youth could make thee was thy heart when this cincture was formed to grace thy nuptials but ere the hour had come god had taken thee to himself years have passed my sister but never have i forgotten the companion of my infancy he advanced to sarah and unconscious of observation placing the ring on her finger continued she for whom it was intended has long been in her grave and the youth who bestowed the gift soon followed her sainted spirit take it madam and god grant that it may be an instrument in making you as happy as you deserve  sarah felt a chill at her heart as this burst of feeling escaped the surgeon but wellmere offering his hand she was led before the divine and the ceremony began the first words of this imposing office produced a dead stillness in the apartment and the minister of god proceeded to the solemn exhortation and witnessed the plighted troth of the parties when the investiture was to follow the ring had been left from inadvertency and the agitation of the moment on the finger where sitgreaves had placed it the slight interruption occasioned by the circumstance was over and the clergyman was about to proceed when a figure gliding into the midst of the party at once put a stop to the ceremony it was the peddler his look was bitter and ironical while a finger raised towards the divine seemed to forbid the ceremony to go any further  can colonel wellmere waste the precious moments here when his wife has crossed the ocean to meet him the nights are long and the moon bright a few hours will take him to the city  aghast at the suddenness of this extraordinary address wellmere for a moment lost the command of his faculties to sarah the countenance of birch expressive as it was produced no terror but the instant she recovered from the surprise of his interruption she turned her anxious gaze on the features of the man to whom she had just pledged her troth they afforded the most terrible confirmation of all that the peddler affirmed the room whirled round and she fell lifeless into the arms of her aunt there is an instinctive delicacy in woman that seems to conquer all other emotions and the insensible bride was immediately conveyed from sight leaving the room to the sole possession of the other sex  the confusion enabled the peddler to retreat with a rapidity that would have baffled pursuit had any been attempted and wellmere stood with every eye fixed on him in ominous silence  tis falsetis false as hell he cried striking his forehead i have ever denied her claim nor will the laws of my country compel me to acknowledge it  but what will conscience and the laws of god do asked lawton  tis well sir said wellmere haughtily and retreating towards the door my situation protects you now but a time may come  he had reached the entry when a slight tap on his shoulder caused him to turn his head it was captain lawton who with a smile of peculiar meaning beckoned him to follow the state of wellmeres mind was such that he would gladly have gone anywhere to avoid the gaze of horror and detestation that glared from every eye he met they reached the stables before the trooper spoke when he cried aloud  bring out roanoke  his man appeared with the steed caparisoned for its master lawton coolly throwing the bridle on the neck of the animal took his pistols from the holsters and continued here are weapons that have seen good service before todayaye and in honorable hands sir these were the pistols of my father colonel wellmere he used them with credit in the wars with france and gave them to me to fight the battles of my country with in what better way can i serve her than in exterminating a wretch who would have blasted one of her fairest daughters  this injurious treatment shall meet with its reward cried the other seizing the offered weapon the blood lie on the head of him who sought it  amen but hold a moment sir you are now free and the passports of washington are in your pocket i give you the fire if i fall there is a steed that will outstrip pursuit and i would advise you to reteat without much delay for even archibald sitgreaves would fight in such a causenor will the guard above be very apt to give quarter  are you ready asked wellmere gnashing his teeth with rage  stand forward tom with the lights fire  wellmere fired and the bullion flew from the epaulet of the trooper  now the turn is mine said lawton deliberately leveling his pistol  and mine shouted a voice as the weapon was struck from his hand by all the devils in hell tis the mad virginianfall on my boys and take him this is a prize not hoped for  unarmed and surprised as he was lawtons presence of mind did not desert him he felt that he was in the hands of those from whom he was to expect no mercy and as four of the skinners fell upon him at once he used his gigantic strength to the utmost three of the band grasped him by the neck and arms with an intent to clog his efforts and pinion him with ropes the first of these he threw from him with a violence that sent him against the building where he lay stunned with the blow but the fourth seized his legs and unable to contend with such odds the trooper came to the earth bringing with him all of his assailants the struggle on the ground was short but terrific curses and the most dreadful imprecations were uttered by the skinners who in vain called on more of their band who were gazing on the combat in nerveless horror to assist a difficulty of breathing from one of the combatants was heard accompanied by the stifled moanings of a strangled man and directly one of the group arose on his feet shaking himself free from the wild grasp of the others both wellmere and the servant of lawton had fled the former to the stables and the latter to give the alarm leaving all in darkness the figure that stood erect sprang into the saddle of the unheeded charger sparks of fire issuing from the armed feet of the horse gave a momentary light by which the captain was seen dashing like the wind towards the highway  by hell hes off cried the leader hoarse with rage and exhaustion firebring him downfire or youll be too late  the order was obeyed and one moment of suspense followed in the vain hope of hearing the huge frame of lawton tumbling from his steed  he would not fall if you had killed him muttered one ive known these virginians sit their horses with two or three balls through them aye even after they were dead  a freshening of the wind wafted the tread of a horse down the valley which by its speed gave assurance of a rider governing its motion  these trained horses always stop when the rider falls observed one of the gang  then cried the leader striking his musket on the ground in a rage the fellow is safeto your business at once a short half hour will bring down that canting sergeant and the guard upon us twill be lucky if the guns dont turn them out quick to your posts and fire the house in the chambers smoking ruins are good to cover evil deeds  what is to be done with this lump of earth cried another pushing the body that yet lay insensible where it had been hurled by the arm of lawton a little rubbing would bring him to  let him lie said the leader fiercely had he been half a man that dragooning rascal would have been in my power enter the house i say and fire the chambers we cant go amiss here there is plate and money enough to make you all gentlemenand revenge too  the idea of silver in any way was not to be resisted and leaving their companion who began to show faint signs of life they rushed tumultuously towards the dwelling wellmere availed himself of the opportunity and stealing from the stable with his own charger he was able to gain the highway unnoticed for an instant he hesitated whether to ride towards the point where he knew the guard was stationed and endeavor to rescue the family or profiting by his liberty and the exchange that had been effected by the divine to seek the royal army shame and a consciousness of guilt determined him to take the latter course and he rode towards new york stung with the reflection of his own baseness and harassed with the apprehension of meeting with an enraged woman that he had married during his late visit to england but whose claims as soon as his passion was sated he had resolved never willingly to admit in the tumult and agitation of the moment the retreat of lawton and wellmere was but little noticed the condition of mr wharton demanding the care and consolation of both the surgeon and the divine the report of the firearms at first roused the family to the sense of a new danger and but a moment elapsed before the leader and one more of the gang entered the room  surrender you servants of king george shouted the leader presenting his musket to the breast of sitgreaves or i will let a little tory blood from your veins  gentlygently my friend said the surgeon you are doubtless more expert in inflicting wounds than in healing them the weapon that you hold so indiscreetly is extremely dangerous to animal life  yield or take its contents  why and wherefore should i yieldi am a noncombatant the articles of capitulation must be arranged with captain john lawton though yielding i believe is not a subject on which you will find him particularly complying  the fellow had by this time taken such a survey of the group as convinced him that little danger was to be apprehended from resistance and eager to seize his share of the plunder he dropped his musket and was soon busy with the assistance of his men in arranging divers articles of plate in bags the cottage now presented a singular spectacle the ladies were gathered around sarah who yet continued insensible in one of the rooms that had escaped the notice of the marauders mr wharton sat in a state of perfect imbecility listening to but not profiting by the meaning words of comfort that fell from the lips of the clergyman singleton was lying on a sofa shaking with debility and inattentive to surrounding objects while the surgeon was administering restoratives and looking at the dressings with a coolness that mocked the tumult caesar and the attendant of captain singleton had retreated to the wood in the rear of the cottage and katy haynes was flying about the building busily employed in forming a bundle of valuables from which with the most scrupulous honesty she rejected every article that was not really and truly her own  but to return to the party at the four corners when the veteran had got his men mounted and under arms a restless desire to participate in the glory and dangers of the expedition came over the washerwoman whether she was impelled to the undertaking by a dread of remaining alone or a wish to hasten in person to the relief of her favorite we will not venture to assert but as hollister was giving the orders to wheel and march the voice of betty was heard exclaiming  stop a bit sargeant dear till two of the boys get out the cart and ill jist ride wid ye tis like therell be wounded and it will be mighty convanient to bring them home in  although inwardly much pleased with any cause of delay to a service that he so little relished hollister affected some displeasure at the detention  nothing but a cannon ball can take one of my lads from his charger he said and its not very likely that we shall have as fair fighting as cannon and musketry in a business of the evil ones inventing so elizabeth you may go if you will but the cart will not be wanting  now sargeant dear you lie anyway said betty who was somewhat unduly governed by her potations and wasnt captain singleton shot off his horse but tin days gone by aye and captain jack himself too and didnt he lie on the ground face uppermost and back downwards looking grim and didnt the boys tink him dead and turn and lave the riglars the day  you lie back again cried the sergeant fiercely and so does anyone who says that we didnt gain the day  for a bit or soonly i mane for a bit or so said the washerwoman but major dunwoodie turned you and so you licked the riglars but the captain it was that fell and im thinking that theres no better rider going so sargeant its the cart will be convanient here two of you jist hitch the mare to the tills and its no whisky that yell be wanting the morrow and put the piece of jennys hide under the pad the baste is never the better for the rough ways of the county westchester the consent of the sergeant being obtained the equipage of mrs flanagan was soon in readiness to receive its burden  as it is quite uncertain whether we shall be attacked in front or in rear said hollister five of you shall march in advance and the remainder shall cover our retreat towards the barrack should we be pressed tis an awful moment to a man of little learning elizabeth to command in such a service for my part i wish devoutly that one of the officers were here but my trust is in the lord  pooh man away wid ye said the washerwoman who had got herself comfortably seated the divil a bit of an inimy is there near march on hurryskurry and let the mare trot or its but little that captain jack will thank ye for the help  although unlearned in matters of communicating with spirits or laying the dead mrs flanagan said the veteran i have not served through the old war and five years in this not to know how to guard the baggage doesnt washington always cover the baggage i am not to be told my duty by a camp follower fall in as you are ordered and dress men  well march anyway cried the impatient washerwoman the black is there already and its tardy the captain will think ye  are you sure that it was really a black man that brought the order said the sergeant dropping in between the platoons where he could converse with betty and be at hand to lead on an emergency either on an advance or on a retreat  nayand im sure of nothing dear but why dont the boys prick their horses and jog a trot the mare is mighty unasy and its no warm in this cursed valley riding as much like a funeral party as old rags is to continental footnote the paper money issued by congress was familiarly called continental money this term continental was applied to the army the congress the ships of war and in short to almost everything of interest which belonged to the new government it would seem to have been invented as the opposite of the insular position of the mother country fairly and softly aye and prudently mrs flanagan its not rashness that makes the good officer if we have to encounter a spirit its more than likely hell make his attack by surprise horses are not very powerful in the dark and i have a character to lose good woman  caractur and isnt it caractur and life too that captain jack has to lose  halt cried the sergeant what is that lurking near the foot of the rock on the left  sure its nothing unless it be a matter of captain jacks sowl thats come to haunt ye for not being brisker on the march  betty your levity makes you an unfit comrade for such an expedition advance one of you and reconnoiter the spot draw swordsrear rank close to the front  pshaw shouted betty is it a big fool or a big coward that ye are jist wheel from the road boys and ill shove the mare down upon it in the twinkling of an eyeand its no ghost that i fear  by this time one of the men had returned and declared there was nothing to prevent their advancing and the party continued their march but with great deliberation and caution  courage and prudence are the jewels of a soldier mrs flanagan said the sergeant without the one the other may be said to be good for nothing  prudence without courage is it that you maneand its so that im thinking myself sargeant this baste pulls tight on the reins any way  be patient good woman hark what is that said hollister pricking up his ears at the report of wellmeres pistol ill swear that was a human pistol and one from our regiment rear rank close to the frontmrs flanagan i must leave you so saying having recovered all his faculties by hearing a sound that he understood he placed himself at the head of his men with an air of military pride that the darkness prevented the washerwoman from beholding a volley of musketry now rattled in the night wind and the sergeant exclaimed  marchquick time  the next instant the trampling of a horse was heard coming up the road at a rate that announced a matter of life or death and hollister again halted his party riding a short distance in front himself to meet the rider  standwho goes there shouted hollister  ha hollister is it you cried lawton ever ready and at your post but where is the guard  at hand sir and ready to follow you through thick and thin said the veteran relieved at once from responsibility and as eager as a boy to be led against his enemy  tis well said the trooper riding up to his men then speaking a few words of encouragement he led them down the valley at a rate but little less rapid than his approach the miserable horse of the sutler was soon distanced and betty thus thrown out in the chase turned to the side of the road and observed  thereits no difficult to tell that captain jack is wid em anyway and away they go like so many nagur boys to a huskingfrolic well ill jist hitch the mare to this bit of a fence and walk down and see the sport afootits no rasonable to expose the baste to be hurted  led on by lawton the men followed destitute alike of fear and reflection whether it was a party of the refugees or a detachment from the royal army that they were to assail they were profoundly ignorant but they knew that the officer in advance was distinguished for courage and personal prowess and these are virtues that are sure to captivate the thoughtless soldiery on arriving near the gates of the locusts the trooper halted his party and made his arrangements for the assault dismounting he ordered eight of his men to follow his example and turning to hollister said  stand you here and guard the horses if anything attempt to pass stop it or cut it down and  the flames at this moment burst through the dormer windows and cedar roof of the cottage and a bright light glared on the darkness of the night on shouted the trooper ongive quarter when you have done justice  there was a startling fierceness in the voice of the trooper that reached to the heart even amid the horrors of the cottage the leader of the skinners dropped his plunder and for a moment he stood in nerveless dread then rushing to a window he threw up the sash at this instant lawton entered saber in hand into the apartment  die miscreant cried the trooper cleaving a marauder to the jaw but the leader sprang into the lawn and escaped his vengeance the shrieks of the females restored lawton to his presence of mind and the earnest entreaty of the divine induced him to attend to the safety of the family one more of the gang fell in with the dragoons and met his death but the remainder had taken the alarm in season occupied with sarah neither miss singleton nor the ladies of the house had discovered the entrance of the skinners though the flames were raging around them with a fury that threatened the building with rapid destruction the shrieks of katy and the terrified consort of caesar together with the noise and uproar in the adjacent apartment first roused miss peyton and isabella to a sense of their danger  merciful providence exclaimed the alarmed aunt there is a dreadful confusion in the house and there will be blood shed in consequence of this affair  there are none to fight returned isabella with a face paler than that of the other dr sitgreaves is very peaceable in his disposition and surely captain lawton would not forget himself so far  the southern temper is quick and fiery continued miss peyton and your brother feeble and weak as he is has looked the whole afternoon flushed and angry  good heaven cried isabella with difficulty supporting herself on the couch of sarah he is gentle as the lamb by nature though the lion is not his equal when roused  we must interfere our presence will quell the tumult and possibly save the life of a fellow creature  miss peyton excited to attempt what she conceived a duty worthy of her sex and nature advanced with the dignity of injured female feeling to the door followed by isabella the apartment to which sarah had been conveyed was in one of the wings of the building and it communicated with the principal hall of the cottage by a long and dark passage this was now light and across its termination several figures were seen rushing with an impetuosity that prevented an examination of their employment  let us advance said miss peyton with a firmness her face belied they must respect our sex  they shall cried isabella taking the lead in the enterprise frances was left alone with her sister a few minutes were passed in silence when a loud crash in the upper apartments was succeeded by a bright light that glared through the open door and made objects as distinct to the eye as if they were placed under a noonday sun sarah raised herself on her bed and staring wildly around pressed both her hands on her forehead endeavoring to recollect herself  this then is heavenand you are one of its bright spirits oh how glorious is its radiance i had thought the happiness i have lately experienced was too much for earth but we shall meet again yesyeswe shall meet again  sarah sarah cried frances in terror my sistermy only sisteroh do not smile so horridly know me or you will break my heart  hush said sarah raising her hand for silence you may disturb his restsurely he will follow me to the grave think you there can be two wives in the grave nonono oneoneoneonly one  frances dropped her head into the lap of her sister and wept in agony  do you shed tears sweet angel continued sarah soothingly then heaven is not exempt from grief but where is henry he was executed and he must be here too perhaps they will come together oh how joyful will be the meeting  frances sprang on her feet and paced the apartment the eye of sarah followed her in childish admiration of her beauty  you look like my sister but all good and lovely spirits are alike tell me were you ever married did you ever let a stranger steal your affections from father and brother and sister if not poor wretch i pity you although you may be in heaven  sarahpeace peacei implore you to be silent shrieked frances rushing to her bed or you will kill me at your feet  another dreadful crash shook the building to its center it was the falling of the roof and the flames threw their light abroad so as to make objects visible around the cottage through the windows of the room frances flew to one of them and saw the confused group that was collected on the lawn among them were her aunt and isabella pointing with distraction to the fiery edifice and apparently urging the dragoons to enter it for the first time she comprehended their danger and uttering a wild shriek she flew through the passage without consideration or object  a dense and suffocating column of smoke opposed her progress she paused to breathe when a man caught her in his arms and bore her in a state of insensibility through the falling embers and darkness to the open air the instant that frances recovered her recollection she perceived that she owed her life lo lawton and throwing herself on her knees she cried  sarah sarah sarah save my sister and may the blessing of god await you  her strength failed and she sank on the grass in insensibility the trooper pointed to her figure motioned to katy for assistance and advanced once more to the building the fire had already communicated to the woodwork of the piazzas and windows and the whole exterior of the cottage was covered with smoke the only entrance was through these dangers and even the hardy and impetuous lawton paused to consider it was for a moment only when he dashed into the heat and darkness where missing the entrance he wandered for a minute and precipitated himself back again upon the lawn drawing a single breath of pure air he renewed the effort and was again unsuccessful on a third trial he met a man staggering under the load of a human body it was neither the place nor was there time to question or to make distinctions seizing both in his arms with gigantic strength he bore them through the smoke he soon perceived to his astonishment that it was the surgeon and the body of one of the skinners that he had saved  archibald he exclaimed why in the name of justice did you bring this miscreant to light again his deeds are rank to heaven  the surgeon who had been in imminent peril was too much bewildered to reply instantly but wiping the moisture from his forehead and clearing his lungs from the vapor he had inhaled he said piteously  ah it is all over had i been in time to have stopped the effusion from the jugular he might have been saved but the heat was conducive to hemorrhage life is extinct indeed well are there any more wounded  his question was put to the air for frances had been removed to the opposite side of the building where her friends were collected and lawton had once more disappeared in the smoke  by this time the flames had dispersed much of the suffocating vapor so that the trooper was able to find the door and in its very entrance he was met by a man supporting the insensible sarah there was but barely time to reach the lawn again before the fire broke through the windows and wrapped the whole building in a sheet of flame  god be praised ejaculated the preserver of sarah it would have been a dreadful death to die  the trooper turned from gazing at the edifice to the speaker and to his astonishment instead of one of his own men he beheld the peddler  ha the spy he exclaimed by heavens you cross me like a specter  captain lawton said birch leaning in momentary exhaustion against the fence to which they had retired from the heat i am again in your power for i can neither flee nor resist  the cause of america is dear to me as life said the trooper but she cannot require her children to forget gratitude and honor fly unhappy man while yet you are unseen or it will exceed my power to save you  may god prosper you and make you victorious over your enemies said birch grasping the hand of the dragoon with an iron strength that his meager figure did not indicate  hold said lawton but a wordare you what you seemcan youare you  a royal spy interrupted birch averting his face and endeavoring to release his hand  then go miserable wretch said the trooper relinquishing his grasp either avarice or delusion has led a noble heart astray  the bright light from the flames reached a great distance around the ruins but the words were hardly past the lips of lawton before the gaunt form of the peddler had glided over the visible space and plunged into the darkness beyond  the eye of lawton rested for a moment on the spot where he had last seen this inexplicable man and then turning to the yet insensible sarah he lifted her in his arms and bore her like a sleeping infant to the care of her friends     chapter xxiii        and now her charms are fading fast      her spirits now no more are gay      alas that beauty cannot last      that flowers so sweet so soon decay               how sad appears               the vale of years      how changed from youths too flattering scene        where are her fond admirers gone        alas and shall there then be none      on whom her soul may lean                                  cynthias grave  the walls of the cottage were all that was left of the building and these blackened by smoke and stripped of their piazzas and ornaments were but dreary memorials of the content and security that had so lately reigned within the roof together with the rest of the woodwork had tumbled into the cellars and a pale and flitting light ascending from their embers shone faintly through the windows the early flight of the skinners left the dragoons at liberty to exert themselves in saving much of the furniture which lay scattered in heaps on the lawn giving the finishing touch of desolation to the scene whenever a stronger ray of light than common shot upwards the composed figures of sergeant hollister and his associates sitting on their horses in rigid discipline were to be seen in the background of the picture together with the beast of mrs flanagan which having slipped its bridle was quietly grazing by the highway betty herself had advanced to the spot where the sergeant was posted and with an incredible degree of composure witnessed the whole of the events as they occurred more than once she suggested to her companion that as the fighting seemed to be over the proper time for plunder had arrived but the veteran acquainted her with his orders and remained inflexible and immovable until the washerwoman observing lawton come round the wing of the building with sarah ventured amongst the warriors the captain after placing sarah on a sofa that had been hurled from the building by two of his men retired that the ladies might succeed him in his care miss peyton and her niece flew with a rapture that was blessed with a momentary forgetfulness of all but her preservation to receive sarah from the trooper but the vacant eye and flushed cheek restored them instantly to their recollection  sarah my child my beloved niece said the former folding the unconscious bride in her arms you are saved and may the blessing of god await him who has been the instrument  see said sarah gently pushing her aunt aside and pointing to the glimmering ruins the windows are illuminated in honor of my arrival they always receive a bride thushe told me they would do no less listen and you will hear the bells  here is no bride no rejoicing nothing but woe cried frances in a manner but little less frantic than that of her sister oh may heaven restore you to usto yourself  peace foolish young woman said sarah with a smile of affected pity all cannot be happy at the same moment perhaps you have no brother or husband to console you you look beautiful and you will yet find one but she continued dropping her voice to a whisper see that he has no other wifetis dreadful to think what might happen should he be twice married  the shock has destroyed her mind cried miss peyton my child my beauteous sarah is a maniac  no no no cried frances it is fever she is lightheadedshe must recovershe shall recover  the aunt caught joyfully at the hope conveyed in this suggestion and dispatched katy to request the immediate aid and advice of dr sitgreaves the surgeon was found inquiring among the men for professional employment and inquisitively examining every bruise and scratch that he could induce the sturdy warriors to acknowledge they had received a summons of the sort conveyed by katy was instantly obeyed and not a minute elapsed before he was by the side of miss peyton  this is a melancholy termination to so joyful a commencement of the night madam he observed in a soothing manner but war must bring its attendant miseries though doubtless it often supports the cause of liberty and improves the knowledge of surgical science  miss peyton could make no reply but pointed to her niece  tis fever answered frances see how glassy is her eye and look at her cheek how flushed  the surgeon stood for a moment deeply studying the outward symptoms of his patient and then he silently took her hand in his own it was seldom that the hard and abstracted features of sitgreaves discovered any violent emotion all his passions seemed schooled and his countenance did not often betray what indeed his heart frequently felt in the present instance however the eager gaze of the aunt and sister quickly detected his emotions after laying his fingers for a minute on the beautiful arm which bared to the elbow and glittering with jewels sarah suffered him to retain he dropped it and dashing a hand over his eyes turned sorrowfully away  here is no fever to excitetis a case my dear madam for time and care only these with the blessing of god may effect a cure  and where is the wretch who has caused this ruin exclaimed singleton rejecting the support of his man and making an effort to rise from the chair to which he had been driven by debility it is in vain that we overcome our enemies if conquered they can inflict such wounds as this  dost think foolish boy said lawton with a bitter smile that hearts can feel in a colony what is america but a satellite of englandto move as she moves follow where she wists and shine that the mother country may become more splendid by her radiance surely you forget that it is honor enough for a colonist to receive ruin from the hand of a child of britain  i forget not that i wear a sword said singleton falling back exhausted but was there no willing arm ready to avenge that lovely suffererto appease the wrongs of this hoary father  neither arms nor hearts are wanting sir in such a cause said the trooper fiercely but chance oftentimes helps the wicked by heavens id give roanoke himself for a clear field with the miscreant  nay captain dear no be parting with the horse anyway said betty it is no trifle that can be had by jist asking of the right person if yere in need of silver and the baste is sure of foot and jumps like a squirrel  woman fifty horses aye the best that were ever reared on the banks of the potomac would be but a paltry price for one blow at a villain  come said the surgeon the night air can do no service to george or these ladies and it is incumbent on us to remove them where they can find surgical attendance and refreshment here is nothing but smoking ruins and the miasma of the swamps  to this rational proposition no objection could be raised and the necessary orders were issued by lawton to remove the whole party to the four corners  america furnished but few and very indifferent carriagemakers at the period of which we write and every vehicle that in the least aspired to that dignity was the manufacture of a london mechanic when mr wharton left the city he was one of the very few who maintained the state of a carriage and at the time miss peyton and his daughters joined him in his retirement they had been conveyed to the cottage in the heavy chariot that had once so imposingly rolled through the windings of queen street or emerged with somber dignity into the more spacious drive of broadway this vehicle stood undisturbed where it had been placed on its arrival and the age of the horses alone had protected the favorites of caesar from sequestration by the contending forces in their neighborhood with a heavy heart the black assisted by a few of the dragoons proceeded to prepare it for the reception of the ladies it was a cumbrous vehicle whose faded linings and tarnished hammercloth together with its panels of changing color denoted the want of that art which had once given it luster and beauty the lion couchant of the wharton arms was reposing on the reviving splendor of a blazonry that told the armorial bearings of a prince of the church and the miter that began to shine through its american mask was a symbol of the rank of its original owner the chaise which conveyed miss singleton was also safe for the stable and outbuildings had entirely escaped the flames it certainly had been no part of the plan of the marauders to leave so wellappointed a stud behind them but the suddenness of the attack by lawton not only disconcerted their arrangements on this point but on many others also a guard was left on the ground under the command of hollister who having discovered that his enemy was of mortal mold took his position with admirable coolness and no little skill to guard against surprise he drew off his small party to such a distance from the ruins that it was effectually concealed in the darkness while at the same time the light continued sufficiently power ful to discover anyone who might approach the lawn with an intent to plunder  satisfied with this judicious arrangement captain lawton made his dispositions for the march miss peyton her two nieces and isabella were placed in the chariot while the cart of mrs flanagan amply supplied with blankets and a bed was honored with the person of captain singleton dr sitgreaves took charge of the chaise and mr wharton what became of the rest of the family during that eventful night is unknown for caesar alone of the domestics was to be found if we except the housekeeper having disposed of the whole party in this manner lawton gave the word to march he remained himself for a few minutes alone on the lawn secreting various pieces of plate and other valuables that he was fearful might tempt the cupidity of his own men when perceiving nothing more that he conceived likely to overcome their honesty he threw himself into the saddle with the soldierly intention of bringing up the rear  stop stop cried a female voice will you leave me alone to be murdered the spoon is melted i believe and ill have compensation if theres law or justice in this unhappy land  lawton turned an eye in the direction of the sound and perceived a female emerging from the ruins loaded with a bundle that vied in size with the renowned pack of the peddler  whom have we here said the trooper rising like a phoenix from the flames oh by the soul of hippocrates but it is the identical shedoctor of famous needle reputation well good woman what means this outcry  outcry echoed katy panting for breath is it not disparagement enough to lose a silver spoon but i must be left alone in this lonesome place to be robbed and perhaps murdered harvey would not serve me so when i lived with harvey i was always treated with respect at least if he was a little close with his secrets and wasteful of his money  then madam you once formed part of the household of mr harvey birch  you may say i was the whole of his household returned the other there was nobody but i and he and the old gentleman you didnt know the old gentleman perhaps  that happiness was denied me how long did you live in the family of mr birch  i disremember the precise time but it must have been hard on upon nine years and what better am i for it all  sure enough i can see but little benefit that you have derived from the association truly but is there not something unusual in the movements and character of this mr birch  unusual is an easy word for such unaccountables replied katy lowering her voice and looking around her he was a wonderful disregardful man and minded a guinea no more than i do a kernel of corn but help me to some way of joining miss jinitt and i will tell you prodigies of what harvey has done first and last  you will exclaimed the trooper musing here give me leave to feel your arm above the elbow thereyou are not deficient in bone let the blood be as it may so saying he gave the spinster a sudden whirl that effectually confused all her faculties until she found herself safely if not comfortably seated on the crupper of lawtons steed  now madam you have the consolation of knowing that you are as well mounted as washington the nag is sure of foot and will leap like a panther  let me get down cried katy struggling to release herself from his iron grasp and yet afraid of falling this is no way to put a woman on a horse besides i cant ride without a pillion  softly good madam said lawton for although roanoke never falls before he sometimes rises behind he is far from being accustomed to a pair of heels beating upon his flanks like a drum major on a field day a single touch of the spur will serve him for a fortnight and it is by no means wise to be kicking in this manner for he is a horse that but little likes to be outdone  let me down i say screamed katy i shall fall and be killed besides i have nothing to hold on with my arms are full of valuables  true returned the trooper observing that he had brought bundle and all from the ground i perceive that you belong to the baggage guard but my sword belt will encircle your little waist as well as my own  katy was too much pleased with this compliment to make any resistance while he buckled her close to his own herculean frame and driving a spur into his charger they flew from the lawn with a rapidity that defied further denial after proceeding for some time at a rate that a good deal discomposed the spinster they overtook the cart of the washerwoman driving slowly over the stones with a proper consideration for the wounds of captain singleton the occurrences of that eventful night had produced an excitement in the young soldier that was followed by the ordinary lassitude of reaction and he lay carefully enveloped in blankets and supported by his man but little able to converse though deeply brooding over the past the dialogue between lawton and his companion ceased with the commencement of their motions but a footpace being more favorable to speech the trooper began anew  then you have been an inmate in the same house with harvey birch  for more than nine years said katy drawing her breath and rejoicing greatly that their speed was abated  the deep tones of the troopers voice were no sooner conveyed to the ears of the washerwoman than turning her head where she sat directing the movements of the mare she put into the discourse at the first pause  belike then good woman yere knowing whether or no hes akin to beelzeboob said betty its sargeant hollister whos saying the same and no fool is the sargeant anyway  its a scandalous disparagement cried katy vehemently no kinder soul than harvey carries a pack and for a gownd or a tidy apron he will never take a kings farthing from a friend beelzebub indeed for what would he read the bible if he had dealings with the evil spirit  hes an honest divil anyway as i was saying before the guinea was pure but then the sargeant thinks him amiss and its no want of larning that mister hollister has  hes a fool said katy tartly harvey might be a man of substance were he not so disregardful how often have i told him that if he did nothing but peddle and would put his gains to use and get married so that things at home could be kept within doors and leave off his dealings with the riglars and all incumberments that he would soon become an excellent liver sergeant hollister would be glad to hold a candle to him indeed  pooh said betty in her philosophical way yere no thinking that mister hollister is an officer and stands next the cornet in the troop but this piddler gave warning of the brush the night and its no sure that captain jack would have got the day but for the reënforcement  how say you betty cried the trooper bending forward on his saddle had you notice of our danger from birch  the very same darling and its hurry i was till the boys was in motion not but i knew yere enough for the cowboys any time but wid the divil on your side i was sure of the day im only wondering theres so little plunder in a business of beelzeboobs contriving  im obliged to you for the rescue and equally indebted to the motive  is it the plunder but little did i tink of it till i saw the movables on the ground some burnt and some broke and other some as good as new it would be convanient to have one feather bed in the corps anyway  by heavens twas timely succor had not roanoke been swifter than their bullets i must have fallen the animal is worth his weight in gold  its continental you mane darling goold weighs heavy and is no plenty in the states if the nagur hadnt been staying and frighting the sargeant with his coppercolored looks and a matter of blarney bout ghosts we should have been in time to have killed all the dogs and taken the rest prisoners  it is very well as it is betty said lawton a day will yet come i trust when these miscreants shall be rewarded if not in judgments upon their persons at least in the opinions of their fellow citizens the time must arrive when america will distinguish between a patriot and a robber  speak low said katy theres some who think much of themselves that have doings with the skinners  its more they are thinking of themselves then than other people thinks of them cried betty a tiefs a tief anyway whether he stales for king george or for congress  i knowd that evil would soon happen said katy the sun set tonight behind a black cloud and the house dog whined although i gave him his supper with my own hands besides its not a week sin i dreamed the dream about the thousand lighted candles and the cakes burnt in the oven  well said betty its but little i drame anyway jist keep an asy conscience and a plenty of the stuff in ye and yell sleep like an infant the last drame i had was when the boys put the thistle tops in the blankets and then i was thinking that captain jacks man was currying me down for the matter of roanoke but its no trifle i mind either in skin or stomach  im sure said katy with a stiff erectness that drew lawton back in his saddle no man shall ever dare to lay hands on bed of mine its undecent and despisable conduct  pooh pooh cried betty if you tag after a troop of horse a small bit of a joke must be borne what would become of the states and liberty if the boys had never a clane shirt or a drop to comfort them ask captain jack there if theyd fight mrs beelzeboob and they no clane linen to keep the victory in  im a single woman and my name is haynes said katy and id thank you to use no disparaging terms when speaking to me  you must tolerate a little license in the tongue of mrs flanagan madam said the trooper the drop she speaks of is often of an extraordinary size and then she has acquired the freedom of a soldiers manner  pooh captain darling cried betty why do you bother the woman talk like yeerself dear and its no fool of a tongue that yeve got in yeer own head but jist hereaway that sargeant made a halt thinking there might be more divils than one stirring the night the clouds are as black as arnolds heart and deuce the star is there twinkling among them well the mare is used to a march after nightfall and is smelling out the road like a pointer slut  it wants but little to the rising moon observed the trooper he called a dragoon who was riding in advance issued a few orders and cautions relative to the comfort and safety of singleton and speaking a consoling word to his friend himself gave roanoke the spur and dashed by the car at a rate that again put to flight all the philosophy of katharine haynes  good luck to ye for a free rider and a bold shouted the washerwoman as he passed if yere meeting mister beelzeboob jist back the baste up to him and show him his consort that yeve got on the crupper im thinking its no long hed tarry to chat well well its his life that we saved he was saying so himselfthough the plunder is nothing to signify  the cries of betty flanagan were too familiar to the ears of captain lawton to elicit a reply notwithstanding the unusual burden that roanoke sustained he got over the ground with great rapidity and the distance between the cart of mrs flanagan and the chariot of miss peyton was passed in a manner that however it answered the intentions of the trooper in no degree contributed to the comfort of his companion the meeting occurred but a short distance from the quarters of lawton and at the same instant the moon broke from a mass of clouds and threw its light on objects  compared with the simple elegance and substantial comfort of the locusts the hotel flanagan presented but a dreary spectacle in the place of carpeted floors and curtained windows were the yawning cracks of a rudelyconstructed dwelling and boards and paper were ingeniously applied to supply the place of the green glass in more than half the lights the care of lawton had anticipated every improvement that their situation would allow and blazing fires were made before the party arrived the dragoons who had been charged with this duty had conveyed a few necessary articles of furniture and miss peyton and her companions on alighting found something like habitable apartments prepared for their reception the mind of sarah had continued to wander during the ride and with the ingenuity of the insane she accommodated every circumstance to the feelings that were uppermost in her own bosom  it is impossible to minister to a mind that has sustained such a blow said lawton to isabella singleton time and gods mercy can alone cure it but something more may be done towards the bodily comfort of all you are a soldiers daughter and used to scenes like this help me to exclude some of the cold air from these windows  miss singleton acceded to his request and while lawton was endeavoring from without to remedy the defect of broken panes isabella was arranging a substitute for a curtain within  i hear the cart said the trooper in reply to one of her interrogatories betty is tenderhearted in the main believe me poor george will not only be safe but comfortable  god bless her for her care and bless you all said isabella fervently dr sitgreaves has gone down the road to meet him i know what is that glittering in the moon  directly opposite the window where they stood were the outbuildings of the farm and the quick eye of lawton caught at a glance the object to which she alluded  tis the glare of firearms said the trooper springing from the window towards his charger which yet remained caparisoned at the door his movement was quick as thought but a flash of fire was followed by the whistling of a bullet before he had proceeded a step a loud shriek burst from the dwelling and the captain sprang into his saddle the whole was the business of but a moment  mountmount and follow shouted the trooper and before his astonished men could understand the cause of alarm roanoke had carried him in safety over the fence which lay between him and his foe the chase was for life or death but the distance to the rocks was again too short and the disappointed trooper saw his intended victim vanish in their clefts where he could not follow  by the life of washington muttered lawton as he sheathed his saber i would have made two halves of him had he not been so nimble on the footbut a time will come so saying he returned to his quarters with the indifference of a man who knew his life was at any moment to be offered a sacrifice to his country an extraordinary tumult in the house induced him to quicken his speed and on arriving at the door the panicstricken katy informed him that the bullet aimed at his own life had taken effect in the bosom of miss singleton     chapter xxiv        hushed were his gertrudes lips but still their bland      and beautiful expression seemed to melt      with love that could not die and still his hand      she presses to the heart no more that felt                                      gertrude of wyoming  the brief arrangements of the dragoons had prepared two apartments for the reception of the ladies the one being intended as a sleeping room and situated within the other into the latter isabella was immediately conveyed at her own request and placed on a rude bed by the side of the unconscious sarah when miss peyton and frances flew to her assistance they found her with a smile on her pallid lip and a composure in her countenance that induced them to think her uninjured  god be praised exclaimed the trembling aunt the report of firearms and your fall had led me into error surely surely there was enough horror before but this has been spared us  isabella pressed her hand upon her bosom still smiling but with a ghastliness that curdled the blood of frances  is george far distant she asked let him knowhasten him that i may see my brother once again  it is as i apprehended shrieked miss peyton but you smilesurely you are not hurt  quite wellquite happy murmured isabella here is a remedy for every pain  sarah arose from the reclining posture she had taken and gazed wildly at her companion she stretched forth her own hand and raised that of isabella from her bosom it was dyed in blood  see said sarah but will it not wash away love marry young woman and then no one can expel him from your heart unlessshe added whispering and bending over the otheryou find another there before you then die and go to heaventhere are no wives in heaven  the lovely maniac hid her face under the clothes and continued silent during the remainder of the night at this moment lawton entered inured as he was to danger in all its forms and accustomed to the horrors of a partisan war the trooper could not behold the ruin before him unmoved he bent over the fragile form of isabella and his gloomy eye betrayed the workings of his soul  isabella he at length uttered i know you to possess a courage beyond the strength of women  speak she said earnestly if you have anything to say speak fearlessly  the trooper averted his face as he replied none ever receive a ball there and survive  i have no dread of death lawton returned isabella i thank you for not doubting me i felt it from the first  these are not scenes for a form like yours added the trooper tis enough that britain calls our youth to the field but when such loveliness becomes the victim of war i sicken of my trade  hear me captain lawton said isabella raising herself with difficulty but rejecting aid from early womanhood to the present hour have i been an inmate of camps and garrisons i have lived to cheer the leisure of an aged father and think you i would change those days of danger and privation for any ease no i have the consolation of knowing in my dying moments that what woman could do in such a cause i have done  who could prove a recreant and witness such a spirit hundreds of warriors have i witnessed in their blood but never a firmer soul among them all  tis the soul only said isabella my sex and strength have denied me the dearest of privileges but to you captain lawton nature has been more bountiful you have an arm and a heart to devote to the cause and i know they are in arm and a heart that will prove true to the last and georgeand she paused her lip quivered and her eye sank to the floor  and dunwoodie added the trooper would you speak of dunwoodie  name him not said isabella sinking back and concealing her face in her garments leave me lawtonprepare poor george for this unexpected blow  the trooper continued for a little while gazing in melancholy interest at the convulsive shudderings of her frame which the scanty covering could not conceal and withdrew to meet his comrade the interview between singleton and his sister was painful and for a moment isabella yielded to a burst of tenderness but as if aware that her hours were numbered she was the first to rouse herself to exertion at her earnest request the room was left to herself the captain and frances the repeated applications of the surgeon to be permitted to use professional aid were steadily rejected and at length he was obliged unwillingly to retire  raise me said the dying young woman and let me look on a face that i love once more frances silently complied and isabella turned her eyes in sisterly affection upon george it matters but little my brothera few hours must close the scene  live isabella my sister my only sister cried the youth with a burst of sorrow that he could not control my father my poor father  there is the sting of death but he is a soldier and a christian miss wharton i would speak of what interests you while yet i have strength for the task  nay said frances tenderly compose yourself let no desire to oblige me endanger a life that is precious totoso many the words were nearly stifled by her emotions for the other had touched a chord that thrilled to her heart  poor sensitive girl said isabella regarding her with tender interest but the world is still before you and why should i disturb the little happiness it may afford dream on lovely innocent and may god keep the evil day of knowledge far distant  oh there is even now little left for me to enjoy said frances burying her face in the clothes i am heartstricken in all that i most loved  no interrupted isabella you have one inducement to wish for life that pleads strongly in a womans breast it is a delusion that nothing but death can destroy exhaustion compelled her to pause and her auditors continued in breathless suspense until recovering her strength she laid her hand on that of frances and continued more mildly miss wharton if there breathes a spirit congenial to dunwoodies and worthy of his love it is your own  a flush of fire passed over the face of the listener and she raised her eyes flashing with an ungovernable look of delight to the countenance of isabella but the ruin she beheld recalled better feelings and again her head dropped upon the covering of the bed isabella watched her emotion with a look that partook both of pity and admiration  such have been the feelings that i have escaped she continued yes miss wharton dunwoodie is wholly yours  be just to yourself my sister exclaimed the youth let no romantic generosity cause you to forget your own character  she heard him and fixed a gaze of tender interest on his face but slowly shook her head as she replied  it is not romance but truth that bids me speak oh how much have i lived within an hour miss wharton i was born under a burning sun and my feelings seem to have imbibed its warmth i have existed for passion only  say not sosay not so i implore you cried the agitated brother think how devoted has been your love to our aged father how disinterested how tender your affection to me  yes said isabella a smile of mild pleasure beaming on her countenance that at least is a reflection which may be taken to the grave  neither frances nor her brother interrupted her meditations which continued for several minutes when suddenly recollecting herself she continued  i remain selfish even to the last with me miss wharton america and her liberties were my earliest passion and again she paused and frances thought it was the struggle of death that followed but reviving she proceeded why should i hesitate on the brink of the grave dunwoodie was my next and my last but burying her face in her hands it was a love that was unsought  isabella exclaimed her brother springing from the bed and pacing the floor in disorder  see how dependent we become under the dominion of worldly pride it is painful to george to learn that one he loves had not feelings superior to her nature and education  say no more whispered frances you distress us bothsay no more i entreat you  in justice to dunwoodie i must speak and for the same reason my brother you must listen by no act or word has dunwoodie ever induced me to believe he wished me more than a friend nay latterly i have had the burning shame of thinking that he avoided my presence  would he dare said singleton fiercely  peace my brother and listen continued isabella rousing herself with an effort that was final here is the innocent the justifiable cause we are both motherless but that auntthat mild plainhearted observing aunt has given you the victory oh how much she loses who loses a female guardian to her youth i have exhibited those feelings which you have been taught to repress after this can i wish to live  isabella my poor isabella you wander in your mind  but one word morefor i feel that blood which ever flowed too swiftly rushing where nature never intended it to go woman must be sought to be prized her life is one of concealed emotions blessed are they whose early impressions make the task free from hypocrisy for such only can be happy with men likelike dunwoodie her voice failed and she sank back on her pillow in silence the cry of singleton brought the rest of the party to her bedside but death was already upon her countenance her remaining strength just sufficed to reach the hand of george and pressing it to her bosom for a moment she relinquished her grasp and with a slight convulsion expired  frances wharton had thought that fate had done its worst in endangering the life of her brother and destroying the reason of her sister but the relief conveyed by the dying declaration of isabella taught her that another sorrow had aided in loading her heart with grief she saw the whole truth at a glance nor was the manly delicacy of dunwoodie lost upon hereverything tended to raise him in her estimation and for mourning that duty and pride had induced her to strive to think less of him she was compelled to substitute regret that her own act had driven him from her in sorrow if not in desperation it is not in the nature of youth however to despair and frances now knew a secret joy that gave a new spring to her existence  the sun broke forth on the morning that succeeded this night of desolation in unclouded luster and seemed to mock the petty sorrows of those who received his rays lawton had early ordered his steed and was ready to mount as the first burst of light broke over the hills his orders were already given and the trooper threw his leg across the saddle in silence and casting a glance of fierce chagrin at the narrow space that had favored the flight of the skinner he gave roanoke the rein and moved slowly towards the valley  the stillness of death pervaded the road nor was there a single vestige of the scenes of the night to tarnish the loveliness of a glorious morn struck with the contrast between man and nature the fearless trooper rode by each pass of danger regardless of what might happen nor did he rouse himself from his musing until the noble charger snuffing the morning air greeted the steeds of the guard under sergeant hollister  here indeed was to be seen sad evidence of the midnight fray but the trooper glanced his eye over it with the coolness of one accustomed to such sights without wasting the moments in useless regrets he proceeded at once to business  have you seen anything he demanded of the orderly  nothing sir that we dared to charge upon returned hollister but we mounted once at the report of distant firearms  tis well said lawton gloomily ah hollister i would give the animal i ride to have had your single arm between the wretch who drew that trigger and these useless rocks which overhang every bit of ground as if they grudged pasture to a single hoof  under the light of day and charging man to man i am as good as another but i cant say that im overfond of fighting with those that neither steel nor lead can bring down  what silly crotchet is uppermost now in that mystified brain of thine deacon hollister  i like not the dark object that has been maneuvering in the skirt of the wood since the first dawn of day and twice during the night it was seen marching across the firelight no doubt with evil intent  is it yon ball of black at the foot of the rock maple that you mean in truth it moves  but without mortal motion said the sergeant regarding it with awful reverence it glides along but no feet have been seen by any who watch here  had it wings cried lawton it is mine stand fast until i join the words were hardly uttered before roanoke was flying across the plain and apparently verifying the boast of his master  those cursed rocks ejaculated the trooper as he saw the object of his pursuit approaching the hillside but either from want of practice or from terror it passed the obvious shelter they offered and fled into the open plain  i have you man or devil shouted lawton whirling his saber from its scabbard halt and take quarter  his proposition was apparently acceded to for at the sound of his powerful voice the figure sank upon the ground exhibiting a shapeless ball of black without life or motion  what have we here cried lawton drawing up by its side a gala suit of the good maiden jeanette peyton wandering around its birthplace or searching in vain for its discomfited mistress he leaned forward in his stirrups and placing the point of his sword under the silken garment by throwing aside the covering discovered part of the form of the reverend gentleman who had fled from the locusts the evening before in his robes of office  in truth hollister had some ground for his alarm an army chaplain is at any time a terror to a troop of horse  the clergyman had collected enough of his disturbed faculties to discover that it was a face he knew and somewhat disconcerted at the terror he had manifested and the indecent attitude in which he had been found he endeavored to rise and offer some explanation lawton received his apologies goodhumoredly if not with much faith in their truth and after a short communication upon the state of the valley the trooper courteously alighted and they proceeded towards the guard  i am so little acquainted sir with the rebel uniform that i really was unable to distinguish whether those men whom you say are your own did or did not belong to the gang of marauders  apology sir is unnecessary replied the trooper curling his lip it is not your task as a minister of god to take note of the facings of a coat the standard under which you serve is acknowledged by us all  i serve under the standard of his gracious majesty george iii returned the priest wiping the cold sweat from his brow but really the idea of being scalped has a strong tendency to unman a newbeginner like myself  scalped echoed lawton stopping short in his walk then recollecting himself he added with composure if it is to dunwoodies squadron of virginia light dragoons that you allude it may be well to inform you that they generally take a bit of the skull with the skin  oh i can have no apprehensions of gentlemen of your appearance said the divine with a smirk it is the natives that i apprehend  natives i have the honor to be one i assure you sir  nay i beg that i may be understoodi mean the indians they who do nothing but rob and murder and destroy  and scalp  yes sir and scalp too continued the clergyman eying his companion a little suspiciously the coppercolored savage indians  and did you expect to meet those nosejeweled gentry in the neutral ground  certainly we understand in england that the interior swarms with them  and call you this the interior of america cried lawton again halting and staring the other in the face with a surprise too naturally expressed to be counterfeited  surely sir i conceive myself to be in the interior  attend said lawton pointing towards the east see you not that broad sheet of water which the eye cannot compass thither lies the england you deem worthy to hold dominion over half the world see you the land of your nativity  tis impossible to behold objects at a distance of three thousand miles exclaimed the wondering priest a little suspicious of his companions sanity  no what a pity it is that the powers of man are not equal to his ambition now turn your eyes westward observe that vast expanse of water which rolls between the shores of america and china  i see nothing but land said the trembling priest there is no water to be seen  tis impossible to behold objects at a distance of three thousand miles repeated lawton pursuing his walk if you apprehend the savages seek them in the ranks of your prince rum and gold have preserved their loyalty  nothing is more probable than my being deceived said the man of peace casting furtive glances at the colossal stature and whiskered front of his companion but the rumors we have at home and the uncertainty of meeting with such an enemy as yourself induced me to fly at your approach  twas not judiciously determined said the trooper as roanoke has the heels of you greatly and flying from scylla you were liable to encounter charybdis those woods and rocks cover the very enemies you dread  the savages exclaimed the divine instinctively placing the trooper in the rear  more than savages men who under the guise of patriotism prowl through the community with a thirst for plunder that is unsatiable and a love of cruelty that mocks the ingenuity of the indianfellows whose mouths are filled with liberty and equality and whose hearts are overflowing with cupidity and gallgentlemen that are ycleped the skinners  i have heard them mentioned in our army said the frightened divine and had thought them to be the aborigines  you did the savages injustice  they now approached the spot occupied by hollister who witnessed with surprise the character of the prisoner made by his captain lawton gave his orders and the men immediately commenced securing and removing such articles of furniture as were thought worthy of the trouble and the captain with his reverend associate who was mounted on a mettled horse returned to the quarters of the troop  it was the wish of singleton that the remains of his sister should be conveyed to the post commanded by his father and preparations were early made to this effect the wounded british were placed under the control of the chaplain and towards the middle of the day lawton saw all the arrangements so far completed as to render it probable that in a few hours he would be left with his small party in undisturbed possession of the corners  while leaning in the doorway gazing in moody silence at the ground which had been the scene of the last nights chase his ear caught the sound of a horse and the next moment a dragoon of his own troop appeared dashing up the road as if on business of the last importance the steed was foaming and the rider had the appearance of having done a days service without speaking he placed a letter in the hand of lawton and led his charger to the stable the trooper knew the hand of the major and ran his eye over the following  i rejoice it is the order of washington that the family of the locusts are to be removed above the highlands they are to be admitted to the society of captain wharton who waits only for their testimony to be tried you will communicate this order and with proper delicacy i do not doubt the english are moving up the river and the moment you see the whartons in safety break up and join your troop there will be good service to be done when we meet as sir henry is reported to have sent out a real soldier in command reports must be made to the commandant at peekskill for colonel singleton is withdrawn to headquarters to preside over the inquiry upon poor wharton fresh orders have been sent to hang the peddler if we can take him but they are not from the commander in chief detail a small guard with the ladies and get into the saddle as soon as possible  yours sincerely peyton dunwoodie  this communication entirely changed the whole arrangement there was no longer any motive for removing the body of isabella since her father was no longer with his command and singleton reluctantly acquiesced in an immediate interment a retired and lovely spot was selected near the foot of the adjacent rocks and such rude preparations were made as the time and the situation of the country permitted a few of the neighboring inhabitants collected from curiosity and interest and miss peyton and frances wept in sincerity over her grave the solemn offices of the church were performed by the minister who had so lately stood forth to officiate in another and very different duty and lawton bent his head and passed his hand across his brow while the words that accompanied the first clod were uttered  a new stimulus was given to the whartons by the intelligence conveyed in the letter of dunwoodie and caesar with his horses was once more put in requisition the relics of the property were intrusted to a neighbor in whom they had confidence and accompanied by the unconscious sarah and attended by four dragoons and all of the american wounded mr whartons party took their departure they were speedily followed by the english chaplain with his countrymen who were conveyed to the waterside where a vessel was in waiting to receive them lawton joyfully witnessed these movements and as soon as the latter were out of sight he ordered his own bugle to sound everything was instantly in motion the mare of mrs flanagan was again fastened to the cart dr sitgreaves exhibited his shapeless form once more on horseback and the trooper appeared in the saddle rejoicing in his emancipation  the word to march was given and lawton throwing a look of sullen ferocity at the place of the skinners concealment and another of melancholy regret towards the grave of isabella led the way accompanied by the surgeon in a brown study while sergeant hollister and betty brought up the rear leaving a fresh southerly wind to whistle through the open doors and broken windows of the hotel flanagan where the laugh of hilarity the joke of the hardy partisan and the lamentations of the sorrowing had so lately echoed     chapter xxv        no vernal blooms their torpid rocks array      but winter lingering chills the lap of may      no zephyr fondly sues the mountains breast      but meteors glare and stormy glooms invest                                              goldsmith  the roads of westchester are at this hour below the improvements of the country their condition at the time of the tale has already been alluded to in these pages and the reader will therefore easily imagine the task assumed by caesar when he undertook to guide the translated chariot of the english prelate through their windings into one of the less frequented passes of the highlands of the hudson  while caesar and his steeds were contending with these difficulties the inmates of the carriage were too much engrossed with their own cares to attend to those who served them the mind of sarah had ceased to wander so wildly as at first but at every advance that she made towards reason she seemed to retire a step from animation from being excited and flighty she was gradually becoming moody and melancholy there were moments indeed when her anxious companions thought that they could discern marks of recollection but the expression of exquisite woe that accompanied these transient gleams of reason forced them to the dreadful alternative of wishing that she might forever be spared the agony of thought the days march was performed chiefly in silence and the party found shelter for the night in different farmhouses  the following morning the cavalcade dispersed the wounded diverged towards the river with the intention of taking water at peekskill in order to be transported to the hospitals of the american army above the litter of singleton was conveyed to a part of the highlands where his father held his quarters and where it was intended that the youth should complete his cure the carriage of mr wharton accompanied by a wagon conveying the housekeeper and what baggage had been saved and could be transported resumed its route towards the place where henry wharton was held in duress and where he only waited their arrival to be put on trial for his life  the country which lies between the waters of the hudson and long island sound is for the first forty miles from their junction a succession of hills and dales the land bordering on the latter then becomes less abrupt and gradually assumes a milder appearance until it finally melts into the lovely plains and meadows of the connecticut but as you approach the hudson the rugged aspect increases until you at length meet with the formidable barrier of the highlands here the neutral ground ceased the royal army held the two points of land that commanded the southern entrance of the river into the mountains but all the remaining passes were guarded by the americans  we have already stated that the pickets of the continental army were sometimes pushed low into the country and that the hamlet of the white plains was occasionally maintained by parties of its troops at other times the advanced guards were withdrawn to the northern extremity of the country and as has been shown the intermediate country was abandoned to the ravages of the miscreants who plundered between both armies serving neither  the road taken by our party was not the one that communicates between the two principal cities of the states but was a retired and unfrequented pass that to this hour is but little known and which entering the hills near the eastern boundary emerges into the plain above many miles from the hudson  it would have been impossible for the tired steeds of mr wharton to drag the heavy chariot up the lengthened and steep ascents which now lay before them and a pair of country horses were procured with but little regard to their owners wishes by the two dragoons who still continued to accompany the party with their assistance caesar was enabled to advance by slow and toilsome steps into the bosom of the hills willing to relieve her own melancholy by breathing a fresher air and also to lessen the weight frances alighted as they reached the foot of the mountain she found that katy had made similar preparations with the like intention of walking to the summit it was near the setting of the sun and from the top of the mountain their guard had declared that the end of their journey might be discerned frances moved forward with the elastic step of youth and followed by the housekeeper at a little distance she soon lost sight of the sluggish carriage that was slowly toiling up the hill occasionally halting to allow the cattle to breathe  oh miss fanny what dreadful times these be said katy when they paused for breath themselves i knowd that calamity was about to befall ever sin the streak of blood was seen in the clouds  there has been blood upon earth katy though but little is ever seen in the clouds  not blood in the clouds echoed the housekeeper yes that there has often and comets with fiery smoking tails didnt people see armed men in the heavens the year the war began and the night before the battle of the plains wasnt there thunder like the cannon themselves ah miss fanny im fearful that no good can follow rebellion against the lords anointed  these events are certainly dreadful returned frances and enough to sicken the stoutest heart but what can be done katy gallant and independent men are unwilling to submit to oppression and i am fearful that such scenes are but too common in war  if i could but see anything to fight about said katy renewing her walk as the young lady proceeded i shouldnt mind it so much twas said the king wanted all the tea for his own family at one time and then again that he meant the colonies should pay over to him all their earnings now this is matter enough to fight aboutfor im sure that no one however he may be lord or king has a right to the hard earnings of another then it was all contradicted and some said washington wanted to be king himself so that between the two one doesnt know which to believe  believe neitherfor neither is true i do not pretend to understand myself all the merits of this war katy but to me it seems unnatural that a country like this should be ruled by another so distant as england  so i have heard harvey say to his father that is dead and in his grave returned katy approaching nearer to the young lady and lowering her voice many is the good time that ive listened to them talking when all the neighborhood was asleep and such conversations miss fanny that you can have no idea on well to say the truth harvey was a mystified body and he was like the winds in the good book no one could tell whence he came or whither he went  frances glanced her eye at her companion with an apparent desire to hear more  there are rumors abroad relative to the character of harvey she said that i should be sorry were true  tis a disparagement every word ont cried katy vehemently harvey had no more dealings with beelzebub than you or i had im sure if harvey had sold himself he would take care to be better paid though to speak the truth he was always a wasteful and disregardful man  nay nay returned the smiling frances i have no such injurious suspicion of him but has he not sold himself to an earthly princeone too much attached to the interests of his native island to be always just to this country  to the kings majesty replied katy why miss fanny your own brother thats in jail serves king george  true said frances but not in secretopenly manfully and bravely  tis said he is a spy and why aint one spy as bad as another  tis untrue no act of deception is worthy of my brother nor of any would he be guilty for so base a purpose as gain or promotion  well im sure said katy a little appalled at the manner of the young lady if a body does the work he should be paid for it harvey is by no means particlar about getting his lawful dues and i darst to say if the truth was forthcoming king george owes him money this very minute  then you acknowledge his connection with the british army said frances i confess there have been moments when i have thought differently  lord miss fanny harvey is a man that no calculation can be made on though i lived in his house for a long concourse of years i have never known whether he belonged above or below footnote the american party was called the party belonging above and the british that of below the terms had reference to the course of the hudson the time that burgyne was taken he came home and there was great doings between him and the old gentleman but for my life i couldnt tell if twas joy or grief then here the other day when the great british generalim sure i have been so flurried with losses and troubles that i forget his name  andre said frances  yes ondree when he was hanged acrost the tappan the old gentleman was near hand to going crazy about it and didnt sleep for night nor day till harvey got back and then his money was mostly golden guineas but the skinners took it all and now he is a beggar or whats the same thing despisable for poverty and want  to this speech frances made no reply but continued her walk up the hill deeply engaged in her own reflections the allusion to andre had recalled her thoughts to the situation of her own brother  they soon reached the highest point in their toilsome progress to the summit and frances seated herself on a rock to rest and to admire immediately at her feet lay a deep dell but little altered by cultivation and dark with the gloom of a november sunset another hill rose opposite to the place where she sat at no great distance along whose rugged sides nothing was to be seen but shapeless rocks and oaks whose stunted growth showed a meager soil  to be seen in their perfection the highlands must be passed immediately after the fall of the leaf the scene is then the finest for neither the scanty foliage which the summer lends the trees nor the snows of winter are present to conceal the minutest objects from the eye chilling solitude is the characteristic of the scenery nor is the mind at liberty as in march to look forward to a renewed vegetation that is soon to check without improving the view  the day had been cloudy and cool and thin fleecy clouds hung around the horizon often promising to disperse but as frequently disappointing frances in the hope of catching a parting beam from the setting sun at length a solitary gleam struck on the base of the mountain on which she was gazing and moved gracefully up its side until reaching the summit it stood for a minute forming a crown of glory to the somber pile so strong were the rays that what was before indistinct now clearly opened to the view with a feeling of awe at being thus unexpectedly admitted as it were into the secrets of that desert place frances gazed intently until among the scattered trees and fantastic rocks something like a rude structure was seen it was low and so obscured by the color of its materials that but for its roof and the glittering of a window it must have escaped her notice while yet lost in the astonishment created by discovering a habitation in such a spot on moving her eyes she perceived another object that increased her wonder it apparently was a human figure but of singular mold and unusual deformity it stood on the edge of a rock a little above the hut and it was no difficult task for our heroine to fancy it was gazing at the vehicles that were ascending the side of the mountain beneath her the distance however was too great to distinguish with precision after looking at it a moment in breathless wonder frances had just come to the conclusion that it was ideal and that what she saw was a part of the rock itself when the object moved swiftly from its position and glided into the hut at once removing every doubt as to the nature of either whether it was owing to the recent conversation that she had been holding with katy or to some fancied resemblance that she discerned frances thought as the figure vanished from her view that it bore a marked likeness to birch moving under the weight of his pack she continued to gaze towards the mysterious residence when the gleam of light passed away and at the same instant the tones of a bugle rang through the glens and hollows and were reechoed in every direction springing on her feet the alarmed girl heard the trampling of horses and directly a party in the wellknown uniform of the virginians came sweeping round the point of a rock near her and drew up at a short distance again the bugle sounded a lively strain and before the agitated frances had time to rally her thoughts dunwoodie dashed by the party of dragoons threw himself from his charger and advanced to her side  his manner was earnest and interested but in a slight degree constrained in a few words he explained that he had been ordered up with a party of lawtons men in the absence of the captain himself to attend the trial of henry which was fixed for the morrow and that anxious for their safety in the rude passes of the mountain he had ridden a mile or two in quest of the travelers frances explained with trembling voice the reason of her being in advance and taught him momentarily to expect the arrival of her father the constraint of his manner had however unwillingly on her part communicated itself to her own deportment and the approach of the chariot was a relief to both the major handed her in spoke a few words of encouragement to mr wharton and miss peyton and again mounting led the way towards the plains of fishkill which broke on their sight on turning the rock with the effect of enchantment a short half hour brought them to the door of the farmhouse which the care of dunwoodie had already prepared for their reception and where captain wharton was anxiously expecting their arrival     chapter xxvi        these limbs are strengthened with a soldiers toil      nor has this cheek been ever blanched with fear      but this sad tale of thine enervates all      within me that i once could boast as man      chill trembling agues seize upon my frame      and tears of childish sorrow pour apace      through scarred channels that were marked by wounds                                                        duo  the friends of henry wharton had placed so much reliance on his innocence that they were unable to see the full danger of his situation as the moment of trial however approached the uneasiness of the youth himself increased and after spending most of the night with his afflicted family he awoke on the following morning from a short and disturbed slumber to a clearer sense of his condition and a survey of the means that were to extricate him from it with life the rank of andre and the importance of the measures he was plotting together with the powerful intercessions that had been made in his behalf occasioned his execution to be stamped with greater notoriety than the ordinary events of the war but spies were frequently arrested and the instances that occurred of summary punishment for this crime were numerous these were facts that were well known to both dunwoodie and the prisoner and to their experienced judgments the preparations for the trial were indeed alarming notwithstanding their apprehensions they succeeded so far in concealing them that neither miss peyton nor frances was aware of their extent a strong guard was stationed in the outbuilding of the farmhouse where the prisoner was quartered and several sentinels watched the avenues that approached the dwelling another was constantly near the room of the british officer a court was already detailed to examine into the circumstances and upon their decision the fate of henry rested  the moment at length arrived and the different actors in the approaching investigation assembled frances experienced a feeling like suffocation as after taking her seat in the midst of her family her eyes wandered over the group who were thus collected the judges three in number sat by themselves clad in the vestments of their profession and maintained a gravity worthy of the occasion and becoming in their rank in the center was a man of advanced years and whose whole exterior bore the stamp of early and longtried military habits this was the president of the court and frances after taking a hasty and unsatisfactory view of his associates turned to his benevolent countenance as to the harbinger of mercy to her brother there was a melting and subdued expression in the features of the veteran that contrasted with the rigid decency and composure of the others could not fail to attract her notice his attire was strictly in conformity to the prescribed rules of the service to which he belonged but while his air was erect and military his fingers trifled with a kind of convulsive and unconscious motion with a bit of crape that entwined the hilt of the sword on which his body partly reclined and which like himself seemed a relic of older times there were the workings of an unquiet soul within but his military front blended awe with the pity that its exhibition excited his associates were officers selected from the eastern troops who held the fortresses of west point and the adjacent passes they were men who had attained the meridian of life and the eye sought in vain the expression of any passion or emotion on which it might seize as an indication of human infirmity in their demeanor there was a mild but a grave intellectual reserve if there was no ferocity nor harshness to chill neither was there compassion nor interest to attract they were men who had long acted under the dominion of a prudent reason and whose feelings seemed trained to a perfect submission to their judgments  before these arbiters of his fate henry wharton was ushered under the custody of armed men a profound and awful silence succeeded his entrance and the blood of frances chilled as she noted the grave character of the whole proceedings there was but little of pomp in the preparations to impress her imagination but the reserved businesslike air of the whole scene made it seem indeed as if the destinies of life awaited the result two of the judges sat in grave reserve fixing their inquiring eyes on the object of their investigation but the president continued gazing around with uneasy convulsive motions of the muscles of the face that indicated a restlessness foreign to his years and duty it was colonel singleton who but the day before had learned the fate of isabella but who stood forth in the discharge of a duty that his country required at his hands the silence and the expectation in every eye at length struck him and making an effort to collect himself he spoke in the tones of one used to authority  bring forth the prisoner he said with a wave of the hand  the sentinels dropped the points of their bayonets towards the judges and henry wharton advanced with a firm step into the center of the apartment all was now anxiety and eager curiosity frances turned for a moment in grateful emotion as the deep and perturbed breathing of dunwoodie reached her ears but her brother again concentrated all her interest in one feeling of intense care in the background were arranged the inmates of the family who owned the dwelling and behind them again was a row of shining faces of ebony glistening with pleased wonder amongst these was the faded luster of caesar thompsons countenance  you are said continued the president to be henry wharton a captain in his britannic majestys 60th regiment of foot  i am  i like your candor sir it partakes of the honorable feelings of a soldier and cannot fail to impress your judges favorably  it would be prudent said one of his companions to advise the prisoner that he is bound to answer no more than he deems necessary although we are a court of martial law yet in this respect we own the principles of all free governments  a nod of approbation from the silent member was bestowed on this remark and the president proceeded with caution referring to the minutes he held in his hand  it is an accusation against you that being an officer of the enemy you passed the pickets of the american army at the white plains in disguise on the 29th of october last whereby you are suspected of views hostile to the interests of america and have subjected yourself to the punishment of a spy  the mild but steady tones of the speaker as he slowly repeated the substance of this charge were full of authority the accusation was so plain the facts so limited the proof so obvious and the penalty so well established that escape seemed impossible but henry replied with earnest grace  that i passed your pickets in disguise is true but  peace interrupted the president the usages of war are stern enough in themselves you need not aid them to your own condemnation  the prisoner can retract that declaration if he please remarked another judge his confession if taken goes fully to prove the charge  i retract nothing that is true said henry proudly  the two nameless judges heard him in silent composure yet there was no exultation mingled with their gravity the president now appeared however to take new interest in the scene  your sentiment is noble sir he said i only regret that a youthful soldier should so far be misled by loyalty as to lend himself to the purposes of deceit  deceit echoed wharton i thought it prudent to guard against capture from my enemies  a soldier captain wharton should never meet his enemy but openly and with arms in his hands i have served two kings of england as i now serve my native land but never did i approach a foe unless under the light of the sun and with honest notice that an enemy was nigh  you are at liberty to explain what your motives were in entering the ground held by our army in disguise said the other judge with a slight movement of the muscles of his mouth  i am the son of this aged man before you continued henry it was to visit him that i encountered the danger besides the country below is seldom held by your troops and its very name implies a right to either party to move at pleasure over its territory  its name as a neutral ground is unauthorized by law it is an appellation that originates with the condition of the country but wherever an army goes it carries its rights along and the first is the ability to protect itself  i am no casuist sir returned the youth but i feel that my father is entitled to my affection and i would encounter greater risks to prove it to him in his old age  a very commendable spirit cried the veteran come gentlemen this business brightens i confess at first it was very bad but no man can censure him for desiring to see his parents  and have you proof that such only was your intention  yeshere said henry admitting a ray of hope here is proofmy father my sister major dunwoodie all know it  then indeed returned his immovable judge we may be able to save you it would be well sir to examine further into this business  certainly said the president with alacrity let the elder mr wharton approach and take the oath  the father made an effort at composure and advancing with a feeble step he complied with the necessary forms of the court  you are the father of the prisoner said colonel singleton in a subdued voice after pausing a moment in respect for the agitation of the witness  he is my only son  and what do you know of his visit to your house on the 29th day of october last  he came as he told you to see me and his sisters  was he in disguise asked the other judge  he did not wear the uniform of the 60th  to see his sisters too said the president with great emotion have you daughters sir  i have twoboth are in this house  had he a wig interrupted the officer  there was some such thing i do believe upon his head  and how long had you been separated asked the president  one year and two months  did he wear a loose greatcoat of coarse materials inquired the officer referring to the paper that contained the charges  there was an overcoat  and you think that it was to see you only that he came out  me and my daughters  a boy of spirit whispered the president to his silent comrade i see but little harm in such a freak twas imprudent but then it was kind  do you know that your son was intrusted with no commission from sir henry clinton and that the visit to you was not merely a cloak to other designs  how can i know it said mr wharton in alarm would sir henry intrust me with such a business  know you anything of this pass exhibiting the paper that dunwoodie had retained when wharton was taken  nothingupon my honor nothing cried the father shrinking from the paper as from contagion  on your oath  nothing  have you other testimony this does not avail you captain wharton you have been taken in a situation where your life is forfeited the labor of proving your innocence rests with yourself take time to reflect and be cool  there was a frightful calmness in the manner of this judge that appalled the prisoner in the sympathy of colonel singleton he could easily lose sight of his danger but the obdurate and collected air of the others was ominous of his fate he continued silent casting imploring glances towards his friend dunwoodie understood the appeal and offered himself as a witness he was sworn and desired to relate what he knew his statement did not materially alter the case and dunwoodie felt that it could not to him personally but little was known and that little rather militated against the safety of henry than otherwise his account was listened to in silence and the significant shake of the head that was made by the silent member spoke too plainly what effect it had produced  still you think that the prisoner had no other object than what he has avowed said the president when he had ended  none other i will pledge my life cried the major with fervor  will you swear it asked the immovable judge  how can i god alone can tell the heart but i have known this gentleman from a boy deceit never formed part of his character he is above it  you say that he escaped and was retaken in open arms said the president  he was nay he received a wound in the combat you see he yet moves his arm with difficulty would he think you sir have trusted himself where he could fall again into our hands unless conscious of innocence  would andre have deserted a field of battle major dunwoodie had he encountered such an event near tarrytown asked his deliberate examiner is it not natural to youth to seek glory  do you call this glory exclaimed the major an ignominious death and a tarnished name  major dunwoodie returned the other still with inveterate gravity you have acted nobly your duty has been arduous and severe but it has been faithfully and honorably discharged ours must not be less so  during the examination the most intense interest prevailed among the hearers with that kind of feeling which could not separate the principle from the cause most of the auditors thought that if dunwoodie failed to move the hearts of henrys judges no other possessed the power caesar thrust his misshapen form forward and his features so expressive of the concern he felt and so different from the vacant curiosity pictured in the countenance of the other blacks caught the attention of the silent judge for the first time he spoke  let that black be brought forward  it was too late to retreat and caesar found himself confronted with a row of rebel officers before he knew what was uppermost in his thoughts the others yielded the examination to the one who suggested it and using all due deliberation he proceeded accordingly  you know the prisoner  i tink he ought returned the black in a manner as sententious as that of his examiner  did he give you the wig when he threw it aside  i dont want em grumbled caesar got a berry good hair heself  were you employed in carrying any letters or messages of any kind while captain wharton was in your masters house  i do what a tell me returned the black  but what did they tell you to do  sometime a one tingsometime anoder  enough said colonel singleton with dignity you have the noble acknowledgment of a gentleman what more can you obtain from this slavecaptain wharton you perceive the unfortunate impression against you have you other testimony to adduce  to henry there now remained but little hope his confidence in his security was fast ebbing but with an indefinite expectation of assistance from the loveliness of his sister he fixed an earnest gaze on the pallid features of frances she arose and with a tottering step moved towards the judges the paleness of her cheek continued but for a moment and gave place to a flush of fire and with a light but firm tread she stood before them raising her hand to her polished forehead frances threw aside her exuberant locks and displayed a picture of beauty and innocence to their view that might have moved even sterner natures the president shrouded his eyes for a moment as if the wild eye and speaking countenance recalled the image of another the movement was transient and recovering himself with an earnestness that betrayed his secret wishes  to you then your brother previously communicated his intention of paying your family a secret visit  nono said frances pressing her hand on her brain as if to collect her thoughts he told me nothingwe knew not of the visit until he arrived but can it be necessary to explain to gallant men that a child would incur hazard to meet his only parent and that in times like these and in a situation like ours  but was this the first time did he never even talk of doing so before inquired the colonel leaning towards her with paternal interest  certainlycertainly cried frances catching the expression of his own benevolent countenance this is but the fourth of his visits  i knew it exclaimed the veteran rubbing his hands with delight an adventurous warmhearted soni warrant me gentlemen a fiery soldier in the field in what disguises did he come  in none for none were then necessary the royal troops covered the country and gave him safe passage  and was this the first of his visits out of the uniform of his regiment asked the colonel in a suppressed voice avoiding the penetrating looks of his companions  oh the very first exclaimed the eager girl his first offense i do assure you if offense it be  but you wrote himyou urged the visit surely young lady you wished to see your brother added the impatient colonel  that we wished it and prayed for itoh how fervently we prayed for itis true but to have held communion with the royal army would have endangered our father and we dared not  did he leave the house until taken or had he intercourse with any out of your own dwelling  with noneno one excepting our neighbor the peddler birch  with whom exclaimed the colonel turning pale and shrinking as from the sting of an adder  dunwoodie groaned aloud and striking his head with his hand cried in piercing tones he is lost and rushed from the apartment  but harvey birch repeated frances gazing wildly at the door through which her lover had disappeared  harvey birch echoed all the judges the two immovable members of the court exchanged looks and threw an inquisitive glance at the prisoner  to you gentlemen it can be no new intelligence to hear that harvey birch is suspected of favoring the royal cause said henry again advancing before the judges for he has already been condemned by your tribunals to the fate that i now see awaits myself i will therefore explain that it was by his assistance i procured the disguise and passed your pickets but to my dying moments and with my dying breath i will avow that my intentions were as pure as the innocent being before you  captain wharton said the president solemnly the enemies of american liberty have made mighty and subtle efforts to overthrow our power a more dangerous man for his means and education is not ranked among our foes than this peddler of westchester he is a spyartful delusive and penetrating beyond the abilities of any of his class sir henry could not do better than to associate him with the officer in his next attempt he would have saved andre indeed young man this is a connection that may prove fatal to you  the honest indignation that beamed on the countenance of the aged warrior was met by a look of perfect conviction on the part of his comrades  i have ruined him cried frances clasping her hands in terror do you desert us then he is lost indeed  forbear lovely innocent forbear said the colonel with strong emotion you injure none but distress us all  is it then such a crime to possess natural affection said frances wildly would washingtonthe noble upright impartial washington judge so harshly delay till washington can hear his tale  it is impossible said the president covering his eyes as if to hide her beauty from his view  impossible oh but for a week suspend your judgment on my knees i entreat you as you will expect mercy yourself when no human power can avail you give him but a day  it is impossible repeated the colonel in a voice that was nearly choked our orders are peremptory and too long delay has been given already  he turned from the kneeling suppliant but could not or would not extricate that hand that she grasped with frenzied fervor  remand your prisoner said one of the judges to the officer who had the charge of henry colonel singleton shall we withdraw  singleton singleton echoed frances then you are a father and know how to pity a fathers woes you cannot will not wound a heart that is now nearly crushed hear me colonel singleton as god will listen to your dying prayers hear me and spare my brother  remove her said the colonel gently endeavoring to extricate his hand but none appeared disposed to obey frances eagerly strove to read the expression of his averted face and resisted all his efforts to retire  colonel singleton how lately was your own son in suffering and in danger under the roof of my father he was cherishedunder my fathers roof he found shelter and protection oh suppose that son the pride of your age the solace and protection of your infant children and then pronounce my brother guilty if you dare  what right has heath to make an executioner of me exclaimed the veteran fiercely rising with a face flushed like fire and every vein and artery swollen with suppressed emotion but i forget myself come gentlemen let us mount our painful duty must be done  mount not go not shrieked frances can you tear a son from his parenta brother from his sister so coldly is this the cause i have so ardently loved are these the men that i have been taught to reverence but you relent you do hear me you will pity and forgive  lead on gentlemen said the colonel motioning towards the door and erecting himself into an air of military grandeur in the vain hope of quieting his feelings  lead not on but hear me cried frances grasping his hand convulsively colonel singleton you are a fatherpitymercymercy for the son mercy for the daughter yesyou had a daughter on this bosom she poured out her last breath these hands closed her eyes these very hands that are now clasped in prayer did those offices for her that you condemn my poor poor brother to require  one mighty emotion the veteran struggled with and quelled but with a groan that shook his whole frame he even looked around in conscious pride at his victory but a second burst of feeling conquered his head white with the frost of seventy winters sank upon the shoulder of the frantic suppliant the sword that had been his companion in so many fields of blood dropped from his nerveless hand and as he cried may god bless you for the deed he wept aloud  long and violent was the indulgence that colonel singleton yielded to his feelings on recovering he gave the senseless frances into the arms of her aunt and turning with an air of fortitude to his comrades he said  still gentlemen we have our duty as officers to discharge our feelings as men may be indulged hereafter what is your pleasure with the prisoner  one of the judges placed in his hand a written sentence that he had prepared while the colonel was engaged with frances and declared it to be the opinion of himself and his companion  it briefly stated that henry wharton had been detected in passing the lines of the american army as a spy and in disguise that thereby according to the laws of war he was liable to suffer death and that this court adjudged him to the penalty recommending him to be executed by hanging before nine oclock on the following morning  it was not usual to inflict capital punishments even on the enemy without referring the case to the commander in chief for his approbation or in his absence to the officer commanding for the time being but as washington held his headquarters at new windsor on the western bank of the hudson there was sufficient time to receive his answer  this is short notice said the veteran holding the pen in his hand in a suspense that had no object not a day to fit one so young for heaven  the royal officers gave hale footnote an american officer of this name was detected within the british lines in disguise in search of military information he was tried and executed as stated in the text as soon as the preparations could be made it is said that he was reproached under the gallows with dishonoring the rank he held by his fate what a death for an officer to die said one of his captors gentlemen any death is honorable when a man dies in a cause like that of america was his answer andre was executed amid the tears of his enemies hale died unpitied and with reproaches in his ears and yet one was the victim of ambition and the other of devotion to his country posterity will do justice between them but an hour returned his comrade we have granted the usual time but washington has the power to extend it or to pardon  then to washington will i go cried the colonel returning the paper with his signature and if the services of an old man like me or that brave boy of mine entitle me to his ear i will yet save the youth  so saying he departed full of his generous intentions in favor of henry wharton  the sentence of the court was communicated with proper tenderness to the prisoner and after giving a few necessary instructions to the officer in command and dispatching a courier to headquarters with their report the remaining judges mounted and rode to their own quarters with the same unmoved exterior but with the consciousness of the same dispassionate integrity that they had maintained throughout the trial     chapter xxvii        have you no countermand for claudio yet      but he must die tomorrow                                     measure for measure  a few hours were passed by the prisoner after his sentence was received in the bosom of his family mr wharton wept in hopeless despondency over the untimely fate of his son and frances after recovering from her insensibility experienced an anguish of feeling to which the bitterness of death itself would have been comparatively light miss peyton alone retained a vestige of hope or presence of mind to suggest what might be proper to be done under their circumstances the comparative composure of the good aunt arose in no degree from any want of interest in the welfare of her nephew but it was founded in a kind of instinctive dependence on the character of washington he was a native of the same colony with herself and although his early military services and her frequent visits to the family of her sister and subsequent establishment at its head had prevented their ever meeting still she was familiar with his domestic virtues and well knew that the rigid inflexibility for which his public acts were distinguished formed no part of his reputation in private life he was known in virginia as a consistent but just and lenient master and she felt a kind of pride in associating in her mind her countryman with the man who led the armies and in a great measure controlled the destinies of america she knew that henry was innocent of the crime for which he was condemned to suffer and with that kind of simple faith that is ever to be found in the most ingenuous characters could not conceive of those constructions and interpretations of law that inflicted punishment without the actual existence of crime but even her confiding hopes were doomed to meet with a speedy termination towards noon a regiment of militia that were quartered on the banks of the river moved to the ground in front of the house that held our heroine and her family and deliberately pitched their tents with the avowed intention of remaining until the following morning to give solemnity and effect to the execution of a british spy  dunwoodie had performed all that was required of him by his orders and was at liberty to retrace his steps to his expectant squadron which was impatiently waiting his return to be led against a detachment of the enemy that was known to be slowly moving up the banks of the river in order to cover a party of foragers in its rear he was accompanied by a small party of lawtons troop under the expectation that their testimony might be required to convict the prisoner and mason the lieutenant was in command but the confession of captain wharton had removed the necessity of examining any witnesses on behalf of the people footnote in america justice is administered in the name of the good people etc etc the sovereignty residing with them the major from an unwillingness to encounter the distress of henrys friends and a dread of trusting himself within its influence had spent the time we have mentioned in walking by himself in keen anxiety at a short distance from the dwelling like miss peyton he had some reliance on the mercy of washington although moments of terrific doubt and despondency were continually crossing his mind to him the rules of service were familiar and he was more accustomed to consider his general in the capacity of a ruler than as exhibiting the characteristics of the individual a dreadful instance had too recently occurred which fully proved that washington was above the weakness of sparing another in mercy to himself while pacing with hurried steps through the orchard laboring under these constantly recurring doubts enlivened by transient rays of hope mason approached accoutered completely for the saddle  thinking you might have forgotten the news brought this morning from below sir i have taken the liberty to order the detachment under arms said the lieutenant very coolly cutting down with his sheathed saber the mullein tops that grew within his reach  what news cried the major starting  only that john bull is out in westchester with a train of wagons which if he fills will compel us to retire through these cursed hills in search of provender these greedy englishmen are so shut up on york island that when they do venture out they seldom leave straw enough to furnish the bed of a yankee heiress  where did the express leave them did you say the intelligence has entirely escaped my memory  on the heights above sing sing returned the lieutenant with no little amazement the road below looks like a hay market and all the swine are sighing forth their lamentations as the corn passes them towards kings bridge george singletons orderly who brought up the tidings says that our horses were holding consultation if they should not go down without their riders and eat another meal for it is questionable with them whether they can get a full stomach again if they are suffered to get back with their plunder we shall not be able to find a piece of pork at christmas fat enough to fry itself  peace with all this nonsense of singletons orderly mr mason cried dunwoodie impatiently let him learn to wait the orders of his superiors  i beg pardon in his name major dunwoodie said the subaltern but like myself he was in error we both thought it was the order of general heath to attack and molest the enemy whenever he ventured out of his nest  recollect yourself lieutenant mason said the major or i may have to teach you that your orders pass through me  i know it major dunwoodiei know it and i am sorry that your memory is so bad as to forget that i never have yet hesitated to obey them  forgive me mason cried dunwoodie taking both his hands i do know you for a brave and obedient soldier forget my humor but this businesshad you ever a friend  nay nay interrupted the lieutenant forgive me and my honest zeal i knew of the orders and was fearful that censure might fall on my officer but remain and let a man breathe a syllable against the corps and every sword will start from the scabbard of itself besides they are still moving up and it is a long road from croton to kings bridge happen what may i see plainly that we shall be on their heels before they are housed again  oh that the courier was returned from headquarters exclaimed dunwoodie this suspense is insupportable  you have your wish cried mason here he is at the moment and riding like the bearer of good news god send it may be so for i cant say that i particularly like myself to see a brave young fellow dancing upon nothing  dunwoodie heard but very little of this feeling declaration for ere half of it was uttered he had leaped the fence and stood before the messenger  what news cried the major the moment that the soldier stopped his horse  good exclaimed the man and feeling no hesitation to intrust an officer so well known as major dunwoodie he placed the paper in his hands as he added but you can read it sir for yourself  dunwoodie paused not to read but flew with the elastic spring of joy to the chamber of the prisoner the sentinel knew him and he was suffered to pass without question  oh peyton cried frances as he entered the apartment you look like a messenger from heaven bring you tidings of mercy  here franceshere henryhere dear cousin jeanette cried the youth as with trembling hands he broke the seal here is the letter itself directed to the captain of the guard but listen  all did listen with intense anxiety and the pang of blasted hope was added to their misery as they saw the glow of delight which had beamed on the countenance of the major give place to a look of horror the paper contained the sentence of the court and underneath was written these simple words  approvedgeo washington  hes lost hes lost cried frances sinking into the arms of her aunt  my son my son sobbed the father there is mercy in heaven if there is none on earth may washington never want that mercy he thus denies to my innocent child  washington echoed dunwoodie gazing around him in vacant horror yes tis the act of washington himself these are his characters his very name is here to sanction the dreadful deed  cruel cruel washington cried miss peyton how has familiarity with blood changed his nature  blame him not said dunwoodie it is the general and not the man my life on it he feels the blow he is compelled to inflict  i have been deceived in him cried frances he is not the savior of his country but a cold and merciless tyrant oh peyton peyton how have you misled me in his character  peace dear frances peace for gods sake use not such language he is but the guardian of the law  you speak the truth major dunwoodie said henry recovering from the shock of having his last ray of hope extinguished and advancing from his seat by the side of his father i who am to suffer blame him not every indulgence has been granted me that i can ask on the verge of the grave i cannot continue unjust at such a moment with so recent an instance of danger to your cause from treason i wonder not at washingtons unbending justice nothing now remains but to prepare for that fate which so speedily awaits me to you major dunwoodie i make my first request  name it said the major giving utterance with difficulty  henry turned and pointing to the group of weeping mourners near him he continued  be a son to this aged man help his weakness and defend him from any usage to which the stigma thrown upon me may subject him he has not many friends amongst the rulers of this country let your powerful name be found among them  it shall  and this helpless innocent continued henry pointing to where sarah sat unconscious of what was passing i had hoped for an opportunity to revenge her wrongs a flush of excitement passed over his features but such thoughts are evili feel them to be wrong under your care peyton she will find sympathy and refuge  she shall whispered dunwoodie  this good aunt has claims upon you already of her i will not speak but here taking the hand of frances and dwelling upon her countenance with an expression of fraternal affection here is the choicest gift of all take her to your bosom and cherish her as you would cultivate innocence and virtue  the major could not repress the eagerness with which he extended his hand to receive the precious boon but frances shrinking from his touch hid her face in the bosom of her aunt  no no no she murmured none can ever be anything to me who aid in my brothers destruction  henry continued gazing at her in tender pity for several moments before he again resumed a discourse that all felt was most peculiarly his own  i have been mistaken then i did think peyton that your worth your noble devotion to a cause that you have been taught to revere that your kindness to our father when in imprisonment your friendship for mein short that your character was understood and valued by my sister  it isit is whispered frances burying her face still deeper in the bosom of her aunt  i believe dear henry said dunwoodie this is a subject that had better not be dwelt upon now  you forget returned the prisoner with a faint smile how much i have to do and how little time is left to do it in  i apprehend continued the major with a face of fire that miss wharton has imbibed some opinions of me that would make a compliance with your request irksome to heropinions that it is now too late to alter  no no no cried frances quickly you are exonerated peytonwith her dying breath she removed my doubts  generous isabella murmured dunwoodie but still henry spare your sister now nay spare even me  i speak in pity to myself returned the brother gently removing frances from the arms of her aunt what a time is this to leave two such lovely females without a protector their abode is destroyed and misery will speedily deprive them of their last male friend looking at his father can i die in peace with the knowledge of the danger to which they will be exposed  you forget me said miss peyton shrinking at the idea of celebrating nuptials at such a moment  no my dear aunt i forget you not nor shall i until i cease to remember but you forget the times and the danger the good woman who lives in this house has already dispatched a messenger for a man of god to smooth my passage to another world frances if you would wish me to die in peace to feel a security that will allow me to turn my whole thoughts to heaven you will let this clergyman unite you to dunwoodie  frances shook her head but remained silent  i ask for no joyno demonstration of a felicity that you will not cannot feel for months to come but obtain a right to his powerful namegive him an undisputed title to protect you  again the maid made an impressive gesture of denial  for the sake of that unconscious suffererpointing to sarah for your sakefor my sakemy sister  peace henry or you will break my heart cried the agitated girl not for worlds would i at such a moment engage in the solemn vows that you wish it would render me miserable for life  you love him not said henry reproachfully i cease to importune you to do what is against your inclinations  frances raised one hand to conceal her countenance as she extended the other towards dunwoodie and said earnestly  now you are unjust to mebefore you were unjust to yourself  promise me then said wharton musing awhile in silence that as soon as the recollection of my fate is softened you will give my friend that hand for life and i am satisfied  i do promise said frances withdrawing the hand that dunwoodie delicately relinquished without even presuming to press it to his lips  well then my good aunt continued henry will you leave me for a short time alone with my friend i have a few melancholy commissions with which to intrust him and would spare you and my sister the pain of hearing them  there is yet time to see washington again said miss peyton moving towards the door and then speaking with extreme dignity she continued i will go myself surely he must listen to a woman from his own colonyand we are in some degree connected with his family  why not apply to mr harper said frances recollecting the parting words of their guest for the first time  harper echoed dunwoodie turning towards her with the swiftness of lightning what of him do you know him  it is in vain said henry drawing him aside frances clings to hope with the fondness of a sister retire my love and leave me with my friend  but frances read an expression in the eye of dunwoodie that chained her to the spot after struggling to command her feelings she continued  he stayed with us for two dayshe was with us when henry was arrested  andanddid you know him  nay continued frances catching her breath as she witnessed the intense interest of her lover we knew him not he came to us in the night a stranger and remained with us during the severe storm but he seemed to take an interest in henry and promised him his friendship  what exclaimed the youth in astonishment did he know your brother  certainly it was at his request that henry threw aside his disguise  but said dunwoodie turning pale with suspense he knew him not as an officer of the royal army  indeed he did cried miss peyton and he cautioned us against this very danger  dunwoodie caught up the fatal paper that still lay where it had fallen from his own hands and studied its characters intently something seemed to bewilder his brain he passed his hand over his forehead while each eye was fixed on him in dreadful suspenseall feeling afraid to admit those hopes anew that had been so sadly destroyed  what said he what promised he at length dunwoodie asked with feverish impatience  he bid henry apply to him when in danger and promised to requite the son for the hospitality of the father  said he this knowing him to be a british officer  most certainly and with a view to this very danger  then cried the youth aloud and yielding to his rapture then you are safethen will i save him yes harper will never forget his word  but has he the power to said frances can he move the stubborn purpose of washington  can he if he cannot shouted the youth if he cannot who can greene and heath and young hamilton are nothing compared to this harper but rushing to his mistress and pressing her hands convulsively repeat to meyou say you have his promise  surely surely peyton his solemn deliberate promise knowing all the circumstances  rest easy cried dunwoodie holding her to his bosom for a moment rest easy for henry is safe  he waited not to explain but darting from the room he left the family in amazement they continued in silent wonder until they heard the feet of his charger as he dashed from the door with the speed of an arrow  a long time was spent after this abrupt departure of the youth by the anxious friends he had left in discussing the probability of his success the confidence of his manner had however communicated to his auditors something of his own spirit each felt that the prospects of henry were again brightening and with their reviving hopes they experienced a renewal of spirits which in all but henry himself amounted to pleasure with him indeed his state was too awful to admit of trifling and for a few hours he was condemned to feel how much more intolerable was suspense than even the certainty of calamity not so with frances she with all the reliance of affection reposed in security on the assurance of dunwoodie without harassing herself with doubts that she possessed not the means of satisfying but believing her lover able to accomplish everything that man could do and retaining a vivid recollection of the manner and benevolent appearance of harper she abandoned herself to all the felicity of renovated hope  the joy of miss peyton was more sobered and she took frequent occasions to reprove her niece for the exuberance of her spirits before there was a certainty that their expectations were to be realized but the slight smile that hovered around the lips of the virgin contradicted the very sobriety of feeling that she inculcated  why dearest aunt said frances playfully in reply to one of her frequent reprimands would you have me repress the pleasure that i feel at henrys deliverance when you yourself have so often declared it to be impossible that such men as ruled in our country could sacrifice an innocent man  nay i did believe it impossible my child and yet think so but still there is a discretion to be shown in joy as well as in sorrow  frances recollected the declaration of isabella and turned an eye filled with tears of gratitude on her excellent aunt as she replied  true but there are feelings that will not yield to reason ah here are those monsters who have come to witness the death of a fellow creature moving around yon field as if life was to them nothing but a military show  it is but little more to the hireling soldier said henry endeavoring to forget his uneasiness  you gaze my love as if you thought a military show of some importance said miss peyton observing her niece to be looking from the window with a fixed and abstracted attention but frances answered not  from the window where she stood the pass that they had traveled through the highlands was easily to be seen and the mountain which held on its summit the mysterious hut was directly before her its side was rugged and barren huge and apparently impassable barriers of rocks presenting themselves through the stunted oaks which stripped of their foliage were scattered over its surface the base of the hill was not half a mile from the house and the object which attracted the notice of frances was the figure of a man emerging from behind a rock of remarkable formation and as suddenly disappearing the maneuver was several times repeated as if it were the intention of the fugitive for such by his air he seemed to be to reconnoiter the proceedings of the soldiery and assure himself of the position of things on the plain notwithstanding the distance frances instantly imbibed the opinion that it was birch perhaps this impression was partly owing to the air and figure of the man but in a great measure to the idea that presented itself on formerly beholding the object at the summit of the mountain that they were the same figure she was confident although this wanted the appearance which in the other she had taken for the pack of the peddler harvey had so connected himself with the mysterious deportment of harper within her imagination that under circumstances of less agitation than those in which she had labored since her arrival she would have kept her suspicions to herself frances therefore sat ruminating on this second appearance in silence and endeavoring to trace what possible connection this extraordinary man could have with the fortunes of her own family he had certainly saved sarah in some degree from the blow that had partially alighted on her and in no instance had he proved himself to be hostile to their interests  after gazing for a long time at the point where she had last seen the figure in the vain expectation of its reappearance she turned to her friends in the apartment miss peyton was sitting by sarah who gave some slight additional signs of observing what passed but who still continued insensible either to joy or grief  i suppose by this time my love that you are well acquainted with the maneuvers of a regiment said miss peyton it is no bad quality in a soldiers wife at all events  i am not a wife yet said frances coloring to the eyes and we have little reason to wish for another wedding in our family  frances exclaimed her brother starting from his seat and pacing the floor in violent agitation touch not the chord again i entreat you while my fate is uncertain i would wish to be at peace with all men  then let the uncertainty cease cried frances springing to the door for here comes peyton with the joyful intelligence of your release  the words were hardly uttered before the door opened and the major entered in his air there was the appearance of neither success nor defeat but there was a marked display of vexation he took the hand that frances in the fullness of her heart extended towards him but instantly relinquishing it threw himself into a chair in evident fatigue  you have failed said wharton with a bound of his heart but an appearance of composure  have you seen harper cried frances turning pale  i have not i crossed the river in one boat as he must have been coming to this side in another i returned without delay and traced him for several miles into the highlands by the western pass but there i unaccountably lost him i have returned here to relieve your uneasiness but see him i will this night and bring a respite for henry  but saw you washington asked miss peyton  dunwoodie gazed at her a moment in abstracted musing and the question was repeated he answered gravely and with some reserve  the commander in chief had left his quarters  but peyton cried frances in returning terror if they should not see each other it will be too late harper alone will not be sufficient  her lover turned his eyes slowly on her anxious countenance and dwelling a moment on her features said still musing  you say that he promised to assist henry  certainly of his own accord and in requital for the hospitality he had received  dunwoodie shook his head and began to look grave  i like not that word hospitalityit has an empty sound there must be something more reasonable to tie harper i dread some mistake repeat to me all that passed  frances in a hurried and earnest voice complied with his request she related particularly the manner of his arrival at the locusts the reception that he received and the events that passed as minutely as her memory could supply her with the means as she alluded to the conversation that occurred between her father and his guest the major smiled but remained silent she then gave a detail of henrys arrival and the events of the following day she dwelt upon the part where harper had desired her brother to throw aside his disguise and recounted with wonderful accuracy his remarks upon the hazard of the step that the youth had taken she even remembered a remarkable expression of his to her brother that he was safer from harpers knowledge of his person than he would be without it frances mentioned with the warmth of youthful admiration the benevolent character of his deportment to herself and gave a minute relation of his adieus to the whole family  dunwoodie at first listened with grave attention evident satisfaction followed as she proceeded when she spoke of herself in connection with their guest he smiled with pleasure and as she concluded he exclaimed with delight  we are safewe are safe  but he was interrupted as will be seen in the following chapter     chapter xxviii       the owlet loves the gloom of night         the lark salutes the day     the timid dove will coo at hand         but falcons soar away                                   song in duo  in a country settled like these states by a people who fled their native land and muchloved firesides victims of consciences and religious zeal none of the decencies and solemnities of a christian death are dispensed with when circumstances will admit of their exercise the good woman of the house was a strict adherent to the forms of the church to which she belonged and having herself been awakened to a sense of her depravity by the ministry of the divine who harangued the people of the adjoining parish she thought it was from his exhortations only that salvation could be meted out to the shortlived hopes of henry wharton not that the kindhearted matron was so ignorant of the doctrines of the religion which she professed as to depend theoretically on mortal aid for protection but she had to use her own phrase sat so long under the preaching of good mr that she had unconsciously imbibed a practical reliance on his assistance for that which her faith should have taught her could come from the deity alone with her the consideration of death was at all times awful and the instant that the sentence of the prisoner was promulgated she dispatched caesar mounted on one of her husbands best horses in quest of her clerical monitor this step had been taken without consulting either henry or his friends and it was only when the services of caesar were required on some domestic emergency that she explained the nature of his absence the youth heard her at first with an unconquerable reluctance to admit of such a spiritual guide but as our view of the things of this life becomes less vivid our prejudices and habits cease to retain their influence and a civil bow of thanks was finally given in requital for the considerate care of the wellmeaning woman  the black returned early from his expedition and as well as could be gathered from his somewhat incoherent narrative a minister of god might be expected to arrive in the course of the day the interruption that we mentioned in our preceding chapter was occasioned by the entrance of the landlady at the intercession of dunwoodie orders had been given to the sentinel who guarded the door of henrys room that the members of the prisoners family should at all times have free access to his apartment caesar was included in this arrangement as a matter of convenience by the officer in command but strict inquiry and examination was made into the errand of every other applicant for admission the major had however included himself among the relatives of the british officer and one pledge that no rescue should be attempted was given in his name for them all a short conversation was passing between the woman of the house and the corporal of the guard before the door that the sentinel had already opened in anticipation of the decision of his noncommissioned commandant  would you refuse the consolations of religion to a fellow creature about to suffer death said the matron with earnest zeal would you plunge a soul into the fiery furnace and a minister at hand to point out the straight and narrow path  ill tell you what good woman returned the corporal gently pushing her away ive no notion of my back being a highway for any man to walk to heaven upon a pretty figure i should make at the pickets for disobeying orders just step down and ask lieutenant mason and you may bring in a whole congregation we have not taken the guard from the foot soldiers but an hour and i shouldnt like to have it said that we know less than the militia  admit the woman said dunwoodie sternly observing for the first time that one of his own corps was on post  the corporal raised his hand to his cap and fell back in silence the soldier stood to his arms and the matron entered  here is a reverend gentleman below come to soothe the parting soul in the place of our own divine who is engaged with an appointment that could not be put aside tis to bury old mr  show him in at once said henry with feverish impatience  but will the sentinel let him pass i would not wish a friend of mrto be rudely stopped on the threshold and he a stranger  all eyes were now turned on dunwoodie who looking at his watch spoke a few words with henry in an undertone and hastened from the apartment followed by frances the subject of their conversation was a wish expressed by the prisoner for a clergyman of his own persuasion and a promise from the major that one should be sent from fishkill town through which he was about to pass on his way to the ferry to intercept the expected return of harper mason soon made his bow at the door and willingly complied with the wishes of the landlady and the divine was invited to make his appearance accordingly  the person who was ushered into the apartment preceded by caesar and followed by the matron was a man beyond the middle age or who might rather be said to approach the downhill of life in stature he was above the size of ordinary men though his excessive leanness might contribute in deceiving as to his height his countenance was sharp and unbending and every muscle seemed set in rigid compression no joy or relaxation appeared ever to have dwelt on features that frowned habitually as if in detestation of the vices of mankind the brows were beetling dark and forbidding giving the promise of eyes of no less repelling expression but the organs were concealed beneath a pair of enormous green goggles through which they glared around with a fierceness that denounced the coming day of wrath all was fanaticism uncharitableness and denunciation long lank hair a mixture of gray and black fell down his neck and in some degree obscured the sides of his face and parting on his forehead fell in either direction in straight and formal screens on the top of this ungraceful exhibition was laid impending forward so as to overhang in some measure the whole fabric a large hat of three equal cocks his coat was of a rusty black and his breeches and stockings were of the same color his shoes without luster and halfconcealed beneath huge plated buckles he stalked into the room and giving a stiff nod with his head took the chair offered him by the black in dignified silence for several minutes no one broke this ominous pause in the conversation henry feeling a repugnance to his guest that he was vainly endeavoring to conquer and the stranger himself drawing forth occasional sighs and groans that threatened a dissolution of the unequal connection between his sublimated soul and its ungainly tenement during this deathlike preparation mr wharton with a feeling nearly allied to that of his son led sarah from the apartment his retreat was noticed by the divine in a kind of scornful disdain who began to hum the air of a popular psalm tune giving it the full richness of the twang that distinguishes the eastern footnote by eastern is meant the states of new england which being originally settled by puritans still retain many distinct shades of character psalmody  caesar said miss peyton hand the gentleman some refreshment he must need it after his ride  my strength is not in the things of this life said the divine speaking in a hollow sepulchral voice thrice have i this day held forth in my masters service and fainted not still it is prudent to help this frail tenement of clay for surely the laborer is worthy of his hire  opening a pair of enormous jaws he took a good measure of the proffered brandy and suffered it to glide downwards with that sort of facility with which man is prone to sin  i apprehend then sir that fatigue will disable you from performing the duties which kindness has induced you to attempt  woman exclaimed the stranger with energy when was i ever known to shrink from a duty but judge not lest ye be judged and fancy not that it is given to mortal eyes to fathom the intentions of the deity  nay returned the maiden meekly and slightly disgusted with his jargon i pretend not to judge of either events or the intentions of my fellow creatures much less of those of omnipotence  tis well womantis well cried the minister moving his head with supercilious disdain humility becometh thy sex and lost condition thy weakness driveth thee on headlong like unto the bosom of destruction  surprised at this extraordinary deportment but yielding to that habit which urges us to speak reverently on sacred subjects even when perhaps we had better continue silent miss peyton replied  there is a power above that can and will sustain us all in welldoing if we seek its support in humility and truth  the stranger turned a lowering look at the speaker and then composing himself into an air of selfabasement he continued in the same repelling tones  it is not everyone that crieth out for mercy that will be heard the ways of providence are not to be judged by menmany are called but few chosen it is easier to talk of humility than to feel it are you so humble vile worm as to wish to glorify god by your own damnation if not away with you for a publican and a pharisee  such gross fanaticism was uncommon in america and miss peyton began to imbibe the impression that her guest was deranged but remembering that he had been sent by a wellknown divine and one of reputation she discarded the idea and with some forbearance observed  i may deceive myself in believing that mercy is proffered to all but it is so soothing a doctrine that i would not willingly be undeceived  mercy is only for the elect cried the stranger with an unaccountable energy and you are in the valley of the shadow of death are you not a follower of idle ceremonies which belong to the vain church that our tyrants would gladly establish here along with their stamp acts and tea laws answer me that woman and remember that heaven hears your answer are you not of that idolatrous communion  i worship at the altars of my fathers said miss peyton motioning to henry for silence but bow to no other idol than my own infirmities  yes yes i know ye selfrighteous and papal as ye arefollowers of forms and listeners to bookish preaching think you woman that holy paul had notes in his hand to propound the word to the believers  my presence disturbs you said miss peyton rising i will leave you with my nephew and offer those prayers in private that i did wish to mingle with his  so saying she withdrew followed by the landlady who was not a little shocked and somewhat surprised by the intemperate zeal of her new acquaintance for although the good woman believed that miss peyton and her whole church were on the highroad to destruction she was by no means accustomed to hear such offensive and open avowals of their fate  henry had with difficulty repressed the indignation excited by this unprovoked attack on his meek and unresisting aunt but as the door closed on her retiring figure he gave way to his feelings  i must confess sir he exclaimed with heat that in receiving a minister of god i thought i was admitting a christian and one who by feeling his own weaknesses knew how to pity the frailties of others you have wounded the meek spirit of an excellent woman and i acknowledge but little inclination to mingle in prayer with so intolerant a spirit  the minister stood erect with grave composure following with his eyes in a kind of scornful pity the retiring females and suffered the expostulation of the youth to be given as if unworthy of his notice a third voice however spoke  such a denunciation would have driven many women into fits but it has answered the purpose well enough as it is  whos that cried the prisoner in amazement gazing around the room in quest of the speaker  it is i captain wharton said harvey birch removing the spectacles and exhibiting his piercing eyes shining under a pair of false eyebrows  good heavensharvey  silence said the peddler solemnly tis a name not to be mentioned and least of all here within the heart of the american army birch paused and gazed around him for a moment with an emotion exceeding the base passion of fear and then continued in a gloomy tone there are a thousand halters in that very name and little hope would there be left me of another escape should i be again taken this is a fearful venture that i am making but i could not sleep in quiet and know that an innocent man was about to die the death of a dog when i might save him  no said henry with a glow of generous feeling on his cheek if the risk to yourself be so heavy retire as you came and leave me to my fate dunwoodie is making even now powerful exertions in my behalf and if he meets with mr harper in the course of the night my liberation is certain  harper echoed the peddler remaining with his hands raised in the act of replacing the spectacles what do you know of harper and why do you think he will do you service  i have his promise you remember our recent meeting in my fathers dwelling and he then gave an unasked promise to assist me  yesbut do you know him that iswhy do you think he has the power or what reason have you for believing he will remember his word  if there ever was the stamp of truth or simple honest benevolence in the countenance of man it shone in his said henry besides dunwoodie has powerful friends in the rebel army and it would be better that i take the chance where i am than thus to expose you to certain death if detected  captain wharton said birch looking guardedly around and speaking with impressive seriousness of manner if i fail you all fail you no harper nor dunwoodie can save your life unless you get out with me and that within the hour you die tomorrow on the gallows of a murderer yes such are their laws the man who fights and kills and plunders is honored but he who serves his country as a spy no matter how faithfully no matter how honestly lives to be reviled or dies like the vilest criminal  you forget mr birch said the youth a little indignantly that i am not a treacherous lurking spy who deceives to betray but innocent of the charge imputed to me  the blood rushed over the pale meager features of the peddler until his face was one glow of fire but it passed quickly away as he replied  i have told you truth caesar met me as he was going on his errand this morning and with him i have laid the plan which if executed as i wish will save youotherwise you are lost and i again tell you that no other power on earth not even washington can save you  i submit said the prisoner yielding to his earnest manner and goaded by the fears that were thus awakened anew  the peddler beckoned him to be silent and walking to the door opened it with the stiff formal air with which he had entered the apartment  friend let no one enter he said to the sentinel we are about to go to prayer and would wish to be alone  i dont know that any will wish to interrupt you returned the soldier with a waggish leer of his eye but should they be so disposed i have no power to stop them if they be of the prisoners friends i have my orders and must mind them whether the englishman goes to heaven or not  audacious sinner said the pretended priest have you not the fear of god before your eyes i tell you as you will dread punishment at the last day to let none of the idolatrous communion enter to mingle in the prayers of the righteous  whewewewwhat a noble commander youd make for sergeant hollister youd preach him dumb in a roll call harkee ill thank you not to make such a noise when you hold forth as to drown our bugles or you may get a poor fellow a short horn at his grog for not turning out to the evening parade if you want to be alone have you no knife to stick over the door latch that you must have a troop of horse to guard your meetinghouse  the peddler took the hint and closed the door immediately using the precaution suggested by the dragoon  you overact your part said young wharton in constant apprehension of discovery your zeal is too intemperate  for a foot soldier and them eastern militia it might be said harvey turning a bag upside down that caesar now handed him but these dragoons are fellows that you must brag down a faint heart captain wharton would do but little here but come here is a black shroud for your goodlooking countenance taking at the same time a parchment mask and fitting it to the face of henry the master and the man must change places for a season  i dont tink he look a bit like me said caesar with disgust as he surveyed his young master with his new complexion  stop a minute caesar said the peddler with the lurking drollery that at times formed part of his manner till we get on the wool  he worse than ebber now cried the discontented african a tink colored man like a sheep i nebber see sich a lip harvey he most as big as a sausage  great pains had been taken in forming the different articles used in the disguise of captain wharton and when arranged under the skillful superintendence of the peddler they formed together a transformation that would easily escape detection from any but an extraordinary observer  the mask was stuffed and shaped in such a manner as to preserve the peculiarities as well as the color of the african visage and the wig was so artfully formed of black and white wool as to imitate the pepperandsalt color of caesars own head and to exact plaudits from the black himself who thought it an excellent counterfeit in everything but quality  there is but one man in the american army who could detect you captain wharton said the peddler surveying his work with satisfaction and he is just now out of our way  and who is he  the man who made you prisoner he would see your white skin through a plank but strip both of you your clothes must be exchanged from head to foot  caesar who had received minute instructions from the peddler in their morning interview immediately commenced throwing aside his coarse garments which the youth took up and prepared to invest himself with unable however to repress a few signs of loathing  in the manner of the peddler there was an odd mixture of care and humor the former was the result of a perfect knowledge of their danger and the means necessary to be used in avoiding it and the latter proceeded from the unavoidably ludicrous circumstances before him acting on an indifference which sprang from habit and long familiarity with such scenes as the present  here captain he said taking up some loose wool and beginning to stuff the stockings of caesar which were already on the leg of the prisoner some judgment is necessary in shaping this limb you will have to display it on horseback and the southern dragoons are so used to the brittleshins that should they notice your wellturned calf theyd know at once it never belonged to a black  golly said caesar with a chuckle that exhibited a mouth open from ear to ear massa harry breeches fit  anything but your leg said the peddler coolly pursuing the toilet of henry slip on the coat captain over all upon my word youd pass well at a pinkster frolic and here caesar place this powdered wig over your curls and be careful and look out of the window whenever the door is open and on no account speak or you will betray all  i spose harvey tink a colored man aint got a tongue like oder folk grumbled the black as he took the station assigned to him  everything now was arranged for action and the peddler very deliberately went over the whole of his injunctions to the two actors in the scene the captain he conjured to dispense with his erect military carriage and for a season to adopt the humble paces of his fathers negro and caesar he enjoined to silence and disguise so long as he could possibly maintain them thus prepared he opened the door and called aloud to the sentinel who had retired to the farthest end of the passage in order to avoid receiving any of that spiritual comfort which he felt was the sole property of another  let the woman of the house be called said harvey in the solemn key of his assumed character and let her come alone the prisoner is in a happy train of meditation and must not be led from his devotions  caesar sank his face between his hands and when the soldier looked into the apartment he thought he saw his charge in deep abstraction casting a glance of huge contempt at the divine he called aloud for the good woman of the house she hastened at the summons with earnest zeal entertaining a secret hope that she was to be admitted to the gossip of a deathbed repentance  sister said the minister in the authoritative tones of a master have you in the house the christian criminals last moments or thoughts on eternity for them who die a violent death  i never heard of the book said the matron in astonishment  tis not unlikely there are many books you have never heard of it is impossible for this poor penitent to pass in peace without the consolations of that volume one hours reading in it is worth an age of mans preaching  bless me what a treasure to possess when was it put out  it was first put out at geneva in the greek language and then translated at boston it is a book woman that should be in the hands of every christian especially such as die upon the gallows have a horse prepared instantly for this black who shall accompany me to my brother and i will send down the volume yet in season brother compose thy mind you are now in the narrow path to glory  caesar wriggled a little in his chair but he had sufficient recollection to conceal his face with hands that were in their turn concealed by gloves the landlady departed to comply with this very reasonable request and the group of conspirators were again left to themselves  this is well said the peddler but the difficult task is to deceive the officer who commands the guardhe is lieutenant to lawton and has learned some of the captains own cunning in these things remember captain wharton continued he with an air of pride that now is the moment when everything depends on our coolness  my fate can be made but little worse than it is at present my worthy fellow said henry but for your sake i will do all that in me lies  and wherein can i be more forlorn and persecuted than i now am asked the peddler with that wild incoherence which often crossed his manner but i have promised one to save you and to him i have never yet broken my word  and who is he said henry with awakened interest  no one  the man soon returned and announced that the horses were at the door harvey gave the captain a glance and led the way down the stairs first desiring the woman to leave the prisoner to himself in order that he might digest the wholesome mental food that he had so lately received  a rumor of the odd character of the priest had spread from the sentinel at the door to his comrades so that when harvey and wharton reached the open space before the building they found a dozen idle dragoons loitering about with the waggish intention of quizzing the fanatic and employed in affected admiration of the steeds  a fine horse said the leader in this plan of mischief but a little low in flesh i suppose from hard labor in your calling  my calling may be laborsome to both myself and this faithful beast but then a day of settling is at hand that will reward me for all my outgoings and incomings said birch putting his foot in the stirrup and preparing to mount  you work for pay then as we fight fort cried another of the party  even sois not the laborer worthy of his hire  come suppose you give us a little preaching we have a leisure moment just now and theres no telling how much good you might do a set of reprobates like us in a few words here mount this horseblock and take your text where you please  the men now gathered in eager delight around the peddler who glancing his eye expressively towards the captain who had been suffered to mount replied  doubtless for such is my duty but caesar you can ride up the road and deliver the notethe unhappy prisoner will be wanting the book for his hours are numbered  aye aye go along caesar and get the book shouted half a dozen voices all crowding eagerly around the ideal priest in anticipation of a frolic  the peddler inwardly dreaded that in their unceremonious handling of himself and garments his hat and wig might be displaced when detection would be certain he was therefore fain to comply with their request ascending the horseblock after hemming once or twice and casting several glances at the captain who continued immovable he commenced as follows  i shall call your attention my brethren to that portion of scripture which you will find in the second book of samuel and which is written in the following wordsand the king lamented over abner and said died abner as a fool dieth thy hands were not bound nor thy feet put into fetters as a man falleth before wicked men so fellest thou and all the people wept again over him caesar ride forward i say and obtain the book as directed thy master is groaning in spirit even now for the want of it  an excellent text cried the dragoons go ongo onlet the snowball stay he wants to be edified as well as another  what are you at there scoundrels cried lieutenant mason as he came in sight from a walk he had taken to sneer at the evening parade of the regiment of militia away with every man of you to your quarters and let me find that each horse is cleaned and littered when i come round the sound of the officers voice operated like a charm and no priest could desire a more silent congregation although he might possibly have wished for one that was more numerous mason had not done speaking when it was reduced to the image of caesar only the peddler took that opportunity to mount but he had to preserve the gravity of his movements for the remark of the troopers upon the condition of their beasts was but too just and a dozen dragoon horses stood saddled and bridled at hand ready to receive their riders at a moments warning  well have you bitted the poor fellow within said mason that he can take his last ride under the curb of divinity old gentleman  there is evil in thy conversation profane man cried the priest raising his hands and casting his eyes upwards in holy horror so i will depart from thee unhurt as daniel was liberated from the lions den  off with you for a hypocritical psalmsinging canting rogue in disguise said mason scornfully by the life of washington it worries an honest fellow to see such voracious beasts of prey ravaging a country for which he sheds his blood if i had you on a virginia plantation for a quarter of an hour id teach you to worm the tobacco with the turkeys  i leave you and shake the dust off my shoes that no remnant of this wicked hole may tarnish the vestments of the godly  start or i will shake the dust from your jacket designing knave a fellow to be preaching to my men theres hollister put the devil in them by his exhorting the rascals were getting too conscientious to strike a blow that would raze the skin but hold whither do you travel master blackey in such godly company  he goes said the minister hastily speaking for his companion to return with a book of much condolence and virtue to the sinful youth above whose soul will speedily become white even as his outwards are black and unseemly would you deprive a dying man of the consolation of religion  no no poor fellow his fate is bad enough a famous good breakfast his prim body of an aunt gave us but harkee mr revelation if the youth must die secundum arlem let it be under a gentlemans directions and my advice is that you never trust that skeleton of yours among us again or i will take the skin off and leave you naked  out upon thee for a reviler and scoffer of goodness said birch moving slowly and with a due observance of clerical dignity down the road followed by the imaginary caesar but i leave thee and that behind me that will prove thy condemnation and take from thee a hearty and joyful deliverance  damn him muttered the trooper the fellow rides like a stake and his legs stick out like the cocks of his hat i wish i had him below these hills where the law is not overparticular id  corporal of the guardcorporal of the guard shouted the sentinel in the passage to the chambers corporal of the guardcorporal of the guard  the subaltern flew up the narrow stairway that led to the room of the prisoner and demanded the meaning of the outcry  the soldier was standing at the open door of the apartment looking in with a suspicious eye on the supposed british officer on observing his lieutenant he fell back with habitual respect and replied with an air of puzzled thought  i dont know sir but just now the prisoner looked queer ever since the preacher has left him he dont look as he used to dobut gazing intently over the shoulder of his officer it must be him too there is the same powdered head and the darn in the coat where he was hit the day we had the last brush with the enemy  and then all this noise is occasioned by your doubting whether that poor gentleman is your prisoner or not is it sirrah who the devil do you think it can be else  i dont know who else it can be returned the fellow sullenly but he has grown thicker and shorter if it is he and see for yourself sir he shakes all over like a man in an ague  this was but too true caesar was an alarmed auditor of this short conversation and from congratulating himself upon the dexterous escape of his young master his thoughts were very naturally beginning to dwell upon the probable consequences to his own person the pause that succeeded the last remark of the sentinel in no degree contributed to the restoration of his faculties lieutenant mason was busied in examining with his own eyes the suspected person of the black and caesar was aware of the fact by stealing a look through a passage under one of his arms that he had left expressly for the purpose of reconnoitering captain lawton would have discovered the fraud immediately but mason was by no means so quicksighted as his commander he therefore turned rather contemptuously to the soldier and speaking in an undertone observed  that anabaptist methodistical quaker psalmsinging rascal has frightened the boy with his farrago about flames and brimstone ill step in and cheer him with a little rational conversation  i have heard of fear making a man white said the soldier drawing back and staring as if his eyes would start from their sockets but it has changed the royal captain to a black  the truth was that caesar unable to hear what mason uttered in a low voice and having every fear aroused in him by what had already passed incautiously removed the wig a little from one of his ears in order to hear the better without in the least remembering that its color might prove fatal to his disguise the sentinel had kept his eyes fastened on his prisoner and noticed the action the attention of mason was instantly drawn to the same object and forgetting all delicacy for a brother officer in distress or in short forgetting everything but the censure that might alight on his corps the lieutenant sprang forward and seized the terrified african by the throat for no sooner had caesar heard his color named than he knew his discovery was certain and at the first sound of masons heavy boot on the floor he arose from his seat and retreated precipitately to a corner of the room  who are you cried mason dashing the head of the old man against the angle of the wall at each interrogatory who the devil are you and where is the englishman speak thou thundercloud answer me you jackdaw or ill hang you on the gallows of the spy  caesar continued firm neither the threats nor the blows could extract any reply until the lieutenant by a very natural transition in the attack sent his heavy boot forward in a direction that brought it in direct contact with the most sensitive part of the negrohis shin the most obdurate heart could not have exacted further patience and caesar instantly gave in the first words he spoke were  golly massa you tink i got no feelin  by heavens shouted the lieutenant it is the negro himself scoundrel where is your master and who was the priest while speaking he made a movement as if about to renew the attack but caesar cried aloud for mercy promising to tell all that he knew  who was the priest repeated the dragoon drawing back his formidable leg and holding it in threatening suspense harvey harvey cried caesar dancing from one leg to the other as he thought each member in turn might be assailed  harvey who you black villain cried the impatient lieutenant as he executed a full measure of vengeance by letting his leg fly  birch shrieked caesar falling on his knees the tears rolling in large drops over his shining face  harvey birch echoed the trooper hurling the black from him and rushing from the room to arms to arms fifty guineas for the life of the peddler spygive no quarter to either mount mount to arms to horse  during the uproar occasioned by the assembling of the dragoons who all rushed tumultuously to their horses caesar rose from the floor where he had been thrown by mason and began to examine into his injuries happily for himself he had alighted on his head and consequently sustained no material damage     chapter xxix        away went gilpin neck or nought      away went hat and wig      he little dreamt when he set out      of running such a rig                               cowper  the road which it was necessary for the peddler and the english captain to travel in order to reach the shelter of the hills lay for a half mile in full view from the door of the building that had so recently been the prison of the latter running for the whole distance over the rich plain that spreads to the very foot of the mountains which here rise in a nearly perpendicular ascent from their bases it then turned short to the right and was obliged to follow the windings of nature as it won its way into the bosom of the highlands  to preserve the supposed difference in their stations harvey rode a short distance ahead of his companion and maintained the sober dignified pace that was suited to his assumed character on their right the regiment of foot that we have already mentioned lay in tents and the sentinels who guarded their encampment were to be seen moving with measured tread under the hills themselves  the first impulse of henry was certainly to urge the beast he rode to his greatest speed at once and by a coup de main not only accomplish his escape but relieve himself from the torturing suspense of his situation but the forward movement that the youth made for this purpose was instantly checked by the peddler  hold up he cried dexterously reining his own horse across the path of the other would you ruin us both fall into the place of a black following his master did you not see their blooded chargers all saddled and bridled standing in the sun before the house how long do you think that miserable dutch horse you are on would hold his speed if pursued by the virginians every foot that we can gain without giving the alarm counts a day in our lives ride steadily after me and on no account look back they are as subtle as foxes aye and as ravenous for blood as wolves  henry reluctantly restrained his impatience and followed the direction of the peddler his imagination however continually alarmed him with the fancied sounds of pursuit though birch who occasionally looked back under the pretense of addressing his companion assured him that all continued quiet and peaceful  but said henry it will not be possible for caesar to remain long undiscovered had we not better put our horses to the gallop and by the time they can reflect on the cause of our flight we can reach the corner of the woods  ah you little know them captain wharton returned the peddler there is a sergeant at this moment looking after us as if he thought all was not right the keeneyed fellow watches me like a tiger lying in wait for his leap when i stood on the horseblock he half suspected that something was wrong nay check your beastwe must let the animals walk a little for he is laying his hand on the pommel of his saddle if he mounts we are gone the footsoldiers could reach us with their muskets  what does he now asked henry reining his horse to a walk but at the same time pressing his heels into the animals sides to be in readiness for a spring  he turns from his charger and looks the other way now trot on gentlynot so fastnot so fast observe the sentinel in the field a little ahead of ushe eyes us keenly  never mind the footman said henry impatiently he can do nothing but shoot uswhereas these dragoons may make me a captive again surely harvey there are horse moving down the road behind us do you see nothing particular  humph ejaculated the peddler there is something particular indeed to be seen behind the thicket on our left turn your head a little and you may see and profit by it too  henry eagerly seized this permission to look aside and the blood curdled to his heart as he observed that they were passing a gallows which unquestionably had been erected for his own execution he turned his face from the sight in undisguised horror  there is a warning to be prudent said the peddler in the sententious manner that he often adopted  it is a terrific sight indeed cried henry for a moment veiling his eyes with his hand as if to drive a vision from before him  the peddler moved his body partly around and spoke with energetic but gloomy bitterness and yet captain wharton you see it where the setting sun shines full upon you the air you breathe is clear and fresh from the hills before you every step that you take leaves that hated gallows behind and every dark hollow and every shapeless rock in the mountains offers you a hiding place from the vengeance of your enemies but i have seen the gibbet raised when no place of refuge offered twice have i been buried in dungeons where fettered and in chains i have passed nights in torture looking forward to the mornings dawn that was to light me to a death of infamy the sweat has started from limbs that seemed already drained of their moisture and if i ventured to the hole that admitted air through grates of iron to look out upon the smiles of nature which god has bestowed for the meanest of his creatures the gibbet has glared before my eyes like an evil conscience harrowing the soul of a dying man four times have i been in their power besides this last buttwicedid i think my hour had come it is hard to die at the best captain wharton but to spend your last moments alone and unpitied to know that none near you so much as think of the fate that is to you the closing of all that is earthly to think that in a few hours you are to be led from the gloom which as you dwell on what follows becomes dear to you to the face of day and there to meet all eyes fixed upon you as if you were a wild beast and to lose sight of everything amidst the jeers and scoffs of your fellow creaturesthat captain wharton that indeed is to die  henry listened in amazement as his companion uttered this speech with a vehemence altogether new to him both seemed to have forgotten their danger and their disguises  what were you ever so near death as that  have i not been the hunted beast of these hills for three years past resumed harvey and once they even led me to the foot of the gallows itself and i escaped only by an alarm from the royal troops had they been a quarter of an hour later i must have died there was i placed in the midst of unfeeling men and gaping women and children as a monster to be cursed when i would pray to god my ears were insulted with the history of my crimes and when in all that multitude i looked around for a single face that showed me any pity i could find noneno not even one all cursed me as a wretch who would sell his country for gold the sun was brighter to my eyes than commonbut it was the last time i should see it the fields were gay and pleasant and everything seemed as if this world was a kind of heaven oh how sweet life was to me at that moment twas a dreadful hour captain wharton and such as you have never known you have friends to feel for you but i had none but a father to mourn my loss when he might hear of it but there was no pity no consolation near to soothe my anguish everything seemed to have deserted me i even thought that he had forgotten that i lived  what did you feel that god himself had forgotten you harvey  god never forsakes his servants returned birch with reverence and exhibiting naturally a devotion that hitherto he had only assumed  and whom did you mean by he  the peddler raised himself in his saddle to the stiff and upright posture that was suited to his outward appearance the look of fire that for a short time glowed on his countenance disappeared in the solemn lines of unbending selfabasement and speaking as if addressing a negro he replied  in heaven there is no distinction of color my brother therefore you have a precious charge within you that you must hereafter render an account of dropping his voicethis is the last sentinel near the road look not back as you value your life  henry remembered his situation and instantly assumed the humble demeanor of his adopted character the unaccountable energy of the peddlers manner was soon forgotten in the sense of his own immediate danger and with the recollection of his critical situation returned all the uneasiness that he had momentarily forgotten  what see you harvey he cried observing the peddler to gaze towards the building they had left with ominous interest what see you at the house  that which bodes no good to us returned the pretended priest throw aside the mask and wig you will need all your senses without much delay throw them in the road there are none before us that i dread but there are those behind who will give us a fearful race  nay then cried the captain casting the implements of his disguise into the highway let us improve our time to the utmost we want a full quarter to the turn why not push for it at once  be cool they are in alarm but they will not mount without an officer unless they see us flynow he comes he moves to the stables trots briskly a dozen are in their saddles but the officer stops to tighten his girths they hope to steal a march upon us he is mounted now ride captain wharton for your life and keep at my heels if you quit me you will be lost  a second request was unnecessary the instant that harvey put his horse to his speed captain wharton was at his heels urging the miserable animal he rode to the utmost birch had selected his own beast and although vastly inferior to the highfed and blooded chargers of the dragoons still it was much superior to the little pony that had been thought good enough to carry caesar thompson on an errand a very few jumps convinced the captain that his companion was fast leaving him and a fearful glance thrown behind informed the fugitive that his enemies were as speedily approaching with that abandonment that makes misery doubly grievous when it is to be supported alone henry cried aloud to the peddler not to desert him harvey instantly drew up and suffered his companion to run alongside of his own horse the cocked hat and wig of the peddler fell from his head the moment that his steed began to move briskly and this development of their disguise as it might be termed was witnessed by the dragoons who announced their observation by a boisterous shout that seemed to be uttered in the very ears of the fugitives so loud was the cry and so short the distance between them  had we not better leave our horses said henry and make for the hills across the fields on our left the fence will stop our pursuers  that way lies the gallows returned the peddler these fellows go three feet to our two and would mind the fences no more than we do these ruts but it is a short quarter to the turn and there are two roads behind the wood they may stand to choose until they can take the track and we shall gain a little upon them there  but this miserable horse is blown already cried henry urging his beast with the end of his bridle at the same time that harvey aided his efforts by applying the lash of a heavy riding whip he carried he will never stand it for half a mile farther  a quarter will do a quarter will do said the peddler a single quarter will save us if you follow my directions  somewhat cheered by the cool and confident manner of his companion henry continued silently urging his horse forward a few moments brought them to the desired turn and as they doubled round a point of low underbrush the fugitives caught a glimpse of their pursuers scattered along the highway mason and the sergeant being better mounted than the rest of the party were much nearer to their heels than even the peddler thought could be possible  at the foot of the hills and for some distance up the dark valley that wound among the mountains a thick underwood of saplings had been suffered to shoot up where the heavier growth was felled for the sake of the fuel at the sight of this cover henry again urged the peddler to dismount and to plunge into the woods but his request was promptly refused the two roads before mentioned met at very sharp angles at a short distance from the turn and both were circuitous so that but little of either could be seen at a time the peddler took the one which led to the left but held it only a moment for on reaching a partial opening in the thicket he darted across into the righthand path and led the way up a steep ascent which lay directly before them this maneuver saved them on reaching the fork the dragoons followed the track and passed the spot where the fugitives had crossed to the other road before they missed the marks of the footsteps their loud cries were heard by henry and the peddler as their wearied and breathless animals toiled up the hill ordering their comrades in the rear to ride in the right direction the captain again proposed to leave their horses and dash into the thicket  not yet not yet said birch in a low voice the road falls from the top of this hill as steep as it rises first let us gain the top while speaking they reached the desired summit and both threw themselves from their horses henry plunging into the thick underwood which covered the side of the mountain for some distance above them harvey stopped to give each of their beasts a few severe blows of his whip that drove them headlong down the path on the other side of the eminence and then followed his example  the peddler entered the thicket with a little caution and avoided as much as possible rustling or breaking the branches in his way there was but time only to shelter his person from view when a dragoon led up the ascent and on reaching the height he cried aloud  i saw one of their horses turning the hill this minute  drive on spur forward my lads shouted mason give the englishman quarter but cut down the peddler and make an end of him  henry felt his companion grip his arm hard as he listened in a great tremor to this cry which was followed by the passage of a dozen horsemen with a vigor and speed that showed too plainly how little security their overtired steeds could have afforded them  now said the peddler rising from the cover to reconnoiter and standing for a moment in suspense all that we gain is clear gain for as we go up they go down let us be stirring  but will they not follow us and surround this mountain said henry rising and imitating the labored but rapid progress of his companion remember they have foot as well as horse and at any rate we shall starve in the hills  fear nothing captain wharton returned the peddler with confidence this is not the mountain that i would be on but necessity has made me a dexterous pilot among these hills i will lead you where no man will dare to follow see the sun is already setting behind the tops of the western mountains and it will be two hours to the rising of the moon who think you will follow us far on a november night among these rocks and precipices  listen exclaimed henry the dragoons are shouting to each other they miss us already  come to the point of this rock and you may see them said harvey composedly setting himself down to rest nay they can see usobserve they are pointing up with their fingers there one has fired his pistol but the distance is too great even for a musket  they will pursue us cried the impatient henry let us be moving  they will not think of such a thing returned the peddler picking the checkerberries that grew on the thin soil where he sat and very deliberately chewing them leaves and all to refresh his mouth what progress could they make here in their heavy boots and spurs and long swords no nothey may go back and turn out the foot but the horse pass through these defiles when they can keep the saddle with fear and trembling come follow me captain wharton we have a troublesome march before us but i will bring you where none will think of venturing this night  so saying they both arose and were soon hid from view amongst the rocks and caverns of the mountain  the conjecture of the peddler was true mason and his men dashed down the hill in pursuit as they supposed of their victims but on reaching the bottom lands they found only the deserted horses of the fugitives some little time was spent in examining the woods near them and in endeavoring to take the trail on such ground as might enable the horse to pursue when one of the party descried the peddler and henry seated on the rock already mentioned  hes off muttered mason eying harvey with fury hes off and we are disgraced by heavens washington will not trust us with the keeping of a suspected tory if we let the rascal trifle in this manner with the corps and there sits the englishman too looking down upon us with a smile of benevolence i fancy that i can see it well well my lad you are comfortably seated i will confess and that is something better than dancing upon nothing but you are not to the west of the harlem river yet and ill try your wind before you tell sir henry what you have seen  shall i fire and frighten the peddler asked one of the men drawing his pistol from the holster  aye startle the birds from their perchlet us see how they can use the wing the man fired the pistol and mason continuedfore george i believe the scoundrels laugh at us but homeward or we shall have them rolling stones upon our heads and the royal gazettes teeming with an account of a rebel regiment routed by two loyalists they have told bigger lies than that before now  the dragoons moved sullenly after their officer who rode towards their quarters musing on the course it behooved him to pursue in the present dilemma it was twilight when masons party reached the dwelling before the door of which were collected a great number of the officers and men busily employed in giving and listening to the most exaggerated accounts of the escape of the spy the mortified dragoons gave their ungrateful tidings with the sullen air of disappointed men and most of the officers gathered round mason to consult of the steps that ought to be taken miss peyton and frances were breathless and unobserved listeners to all that passed between them from the window of the chamber immediately above their heads  something must be done and that speedily observed the commanding officer of the regiment which lay encamped before the house this english officer is doubtless an instrument in the great blow aimed at us by the enemy lately besides our honor is involved in his escape  let us beat the woods cried several at once by morning we shall have them both again  softly softly gentlemen returned the colonel no man can travel these hills after dark unless used to the passes nothing but horse can do service in this business and i presume lieutenant mason hesitates to move without the orders of his major  i certainly dare not replied the subaltern gravely shaking his head unless you will take the responsibility of an order but major dunwoodie will be back again in two hours and we can carry the tidings through the hills before daylight so that by spreading patrols across from one river to the other and offering a reward to the country people their escape will yet be impossible unless they can join the party that is said to be out on the hudson  a very plausible plan cried the colonel and one that must succeed but let a messenger be dispatched to dunwoodie or he may continue at the ferry until it proves too late though doubtless the runaways will lie in the mountains tonight  to this suggestion mason acquiesced and a courier was sent to the major with the important intelligence of the escape of henry and an intimation of the necessity of his presence to conduct the pursuit after this arrangement the officers separated  when miss peyton and her niece first learned the escape of captain wharton it was with difficulty they could credit their senses they both relied so implicitly on the success of dunwoodies exertions that they thought the act on the part of their relative extremely imprudent but it was now too late to mend it while listening to the conversation of the officers both were struck with the increased danger of henrys situation if recaptured and they trembled to think of the great exertions that would be made to accomplish this object miss peyton consoled herself and endeavored to cheer her niece with the probability that the fugitives would pursue their course with unremitting diligence so that they might reach the neutral ground before the horse would carry down the tidings of their flight the absence of dunwoodie seemed to her allimportant and the artless lady was anxiously devising some project that might detain her kinsman and thus give her nephew the longest possible time but very different were the reflections of frances she could no longer doubt that the figure she had seen on the hill was birch and she felt certain that instead of flying to the friendly forces below her brother would be taken to the mysterious hut to pass the night  frances and her aunt held a long and animated discussion by themselves when the good spinster reluctantly yielded to the representation of her niece and folding her in her arms she kissed her cold cheek and fervently blessing her allowed her to depart on an errand of fraternal love     chapter xxx        and here forlorn and lost i tread      with fainting steps and slow      where wilds immeasurably spread      seem lengthning as i go                                      goldsmith  the night had set in dark and chilling as frances wharton with a beating heart but light step moved through the little garden that lay behind the farmhouse which had been her brothers prison and took her way to the foot of the mountain where she had seen the figure of him she supposed to be the peddler it was still early but the darkness and the dreary nature of a november evening would at any other moment or with less inducement to exertion have driven her back in terror to the circle she had left without pausing to reflect however she flew over the ground with a rapidity that seemed to bid defiance to all impediments nor stopped even to breathe until she had gone half the distance to the rock that she had marked as the spot where birch made his appearance on that very morning  the good treatment of their women is the surest evidence that a people can give of their civilization and there is no nation which has more to boast of in this respect than the americans frances felt but little apprehension from the orderly and quiet troops who were taking their evenings repast on the side of the highway opposite to the field through which she was flying they were her countrymen and she knew that her sex would be respected by the eastern militia who composed this body but in the volatile and reckless character of the southern horse she had less confidence outrages of any description were seldom committed by the really american soldiery but she recoiled with exquisite delicacy from even the appearance of humiliation when therefore she heard the footsteps of a horse moving slowly up the road she shrank timidly into a little thicket of wood which grew around the spring that bubbled from the side of a hillock near her the vidette for such it proved to be passed her without noticing her form which was so enveloped as to be as little conspicuous as possible humming a low air to himself and probably thinking of some other fair that he had left on the banks of the potomac  frances listened anxiously to the retreating footsteps of his horse and as they died upon her ear she ventured from her place of secrecy and advanced a short distance into the field where startled at the gloom and appalled with the dreariness of the prospect she paused to reflect on what she had undertaken throwing back the hood of her cardinal she sought the support of a tree and gazed towards the summit of the mountain that was to be the goal of her enterprise it rose from the plain like a huge pyramid giving nothing to the eye but its outlines the pinnacle could be faintly discerned in front of a lighter background of clouds between which a few glimmering stars occasionally twinkled in momentary brightness and then gradually became obscured by the passing vapor that was moving before the wind at a vast distance below the clouds themselves should she return henry and the peddler would most probably pass the night in fancied security upon that very hill towards which she was straining her eyes in the vain hope of observing some light that might encourage her to proceed the deliberate and what to her seemed coldblooded project of the officer for the recapture of the fugitives still rang in her ears and stimulated her to go on but the solitude into which she must venture the time the actual danger of the ascent and the uncertainty of her finding the hut or what was still more disheartening the chance that it might be occupied by unknown tenants and those of the worst descriptionurged her to retreat  the increasing darkness was each moment rendering objects less and less distinct and the clouds were gathering more gloomily in the rear of the hill until its form could no longer be discerned frances threw back her rich curls with both hands on her temples in order to possess her senses in their utmost keenness but the towering hill was entirely lost to the eye at length she discovered a faint and twinkling blaze in the direction in which she thought the building stood that by its reviving and receding luster might be taken for the glimmering of a fire but the delusion vanished as the horizon again cleared and the star of evening shone forth from a cloud after struggling hard as if for existence she now saw the mountain to the left of the place where the planet was shining and suddenly a streak of mellow light burst upon the fantastic oaks that were thinly scattered over its summit and gradually moved down its side until the whole pile became distinct under the rays of the rising moon although it would have been physically impossible for our heroine to advance without the aid of the friendly light which now gleamed on the long line of level land before her yet she was not encouraged to proceed if she could see the goal of her wishes she could also perceive the difficulties that must attend her reaching it  while deliberating in distressing incertitude now shrinking with the timidity of her sex and years from the enterprise and now resolving to rescue her brother at every hazard frances turned her looks towards the east in earnest gaze at the clouds which constantly threatened to involve her again in comparative darkness had an adder stung her she could not have sprung with greater celerity than she recoiled from the object against which she was leaning and which she for the first time noticed the two upright posts with a crossbeam on their tops and a rude platform beneath told but too plainly the nature of the structure even the cord was suspended from an iron staple and was swinging to and fro in the night air frances hesitated no longer but rather flew than ran across the meadow and was soon at the base of the rock where she hoped to find something like a path to the summit of the mountain here she was compelled to pause for breath and she improved the leisure by surveying the ground about her the ascent was quite abrupt but she soon found a sheep path that wound among the shelving rocks and through the trees so as to render her labor much less tiresome than it otherwise would have been throwing a fearful glance behind the determined girl commenced her journey upwards young active and impelled by her generous motive she moved up the hill with elastic steps and very soon emerged from the cover of the woods into an open space of more level ground that had evidently been cleared of its timber for the purpose of cultivation but either the war or the sterility of the soil had compelled the adventurer to abandon the advantages that he had obtained over the wilderness and already the bushes and briers were springing up afresh as if the plow had never traced furrows through the mold which nourished them frances felt her spirits invigorated by these faint vestiges of the labor of man and she walked up the gentle acclivity with renewed hopes of success the path now diverged in so many different directions that she soon saw it would be useless to follow their windings and abandoning it at the first turn she labored forward towards what she thought was the nearest point of the summit the cleared ground was soon past and woods and rocks clinging to the precipitous sides of the mountain again opposed themselves to her progress occasionally the path was to be seen running along the verge of the clearing and then striking off into the scattering patches of grass and herbage but in no instance could she trace it upward tufts of wool hanging to the briers sufficiently denoted the origin of these tracks and frances rightly conjectured that whoever descended the mountain would avail himself of their existence to lighten the labor seating herself on a stone the wearied girl again paused to rest and to reflect the clouds were rising before the moon and the whole scene at her feet lay pictured in softest colors  the white tents of the militia were stretched in regular lines immediately beneath her the light was shining in the window of her aunt who frances easily fancied was watching the mountain racked with all the anxiety she might be supposed to feel for her niece lanterns were playing about in the stable yard where she knew the horses of the dragoons were kept and believing them to be preparing for their night march she again sprang upon her feet and renewed her toil  our heroine had to ascend more than a quarter of a mile farther although she had already conquered two thirds of the height of the mountain but she was now without a path or any guide to direct her in her course fortunately the hill was conical like most of the mountains in that range and by advancing upwards she was certain of at length reaching the desired hut which hung as it were on the very pinnacle nearly an hour did she struggle with the numerous difficulties that she was obliged to overcome when having been repeatedly exhausted with her efforts and in several instances in great danger from falls she succeeded in gaining the small piece of tableland on the summit  faint with her exertions which had been unusually severe for so slight a frame she sank on a rock to recover her strength and fortitude for the approaching interview a few moments sufficed for this purpose when she proceeded in quest of the hut all of the neighboring hills were distinctly visible by the aid of the moon and frances was able where she stood to trace the route of the highway from the plains into the mountains by following this line with her eyes she soon discovered the point whence she had seen the mysterious dwelling and directly opposite to that point she well knew the hut must stand  the chilling air sighed through the leafless branches of the gnarled and crooked oaks as with a step so light as hardly to rustle the dry leaves on which she trod frances moved forward to that part of the hill where she expected to find this secluded habitation but nothing could she discern that in the least resembled a dwelling of any sort in vain she examined every recess of the rocks or inquisitively explored every part of the summit that she thought could hold the tenement of the peddler no hut nor any vestige of a human being could she trace the idea of her solitude struck on the terrified mind of the affrighted girl and approaching to the edge of a shelving rock she bent forward to gaze on the signs of life in the vale when a ray of keen light dazzled her eyes and a warm ray diffused itself over her whole frame recovering from her surprise frances looked on the ledge beneath her and at once perceived that she stood directly over the object of her search a hole through its roof afforded a passage to the smoke which as it blew aside showed her a clear and cheerful fire crackling and snapping on a rude hearth of stone the approach to the front of the hut was by a winding path around the point of the rock on which she stood and by this she advanced to its door  three sides of this singular edifice if such it could be called were composed of logs laid alternately on each other to a little more than the height of a man and the fourth was formed by the rock against which it leaned the roof was made of the bark of trees laid in long strips from the rock to its eaves the fissures between the logs had been stuffed with clay which in many places had fallen out and dried leaves were made use of as a substitute to keep out the wind a single window of four panes of glass was in front but a board carefully closed it in such a manner as to emit no light from the fire within after pausing some time to view this singularly constructed hiding place for such frances well knew it to be she applied her eye to a crevice to examine the inside there was no lamp or candle but the blazing fire of dry wood made the interior of the hut light enough to read by in one corner lay a bed of straw with a pair of blankets thrown carelessly over it as if left where they had last been used against the walls and rock were suspended from pegs forced into the crevices various garments and such as were apparently fitted for all ages and conditions and for either sex british and american uniforms hung peaceably by the side of each other and on the peg that supported a gown of striped calico such as was the usual country wear was also depending a wellpowdered wig in short the attire was numerous and as various as if a whole parish were to be equipped from this one wardrobe  in the angle against the rock and opposite to the fire which was burning in the other corner was an open cupboard that held a plate or two a mug and the remains of some broken meat before the fire was a table with one of its legs fractured and made of rough boards these with a single stool composed the furniture if we except a few articles of cooking a book that by its size and shape appeared to be a bible was lying on the table unopened but it was the occupant of the hut in whom frances was chiefly interested this was a man sitting on the stool with his head leaning on his hand in such a manner as to conceal his features and deeply occupied in examining some open papers on the table lay a pair of curiously and richly mounted horsemans pistols and the handle of a sheathed rapier of exquisite workmanship protruded from between the legs of the gentleman one of whose hands carelessly rested on its guard the tall stature of this unexpected tenant of the hut and his form much more athletic than that of either harvey or her brother told frances without the aid of his dress that it was neither of those she sought a close surtout was buttoned high in the throat of the stranger and parting at his knees showed breeches of buff with military boots and spurs his hair was dressed so as to expose the whole face and after the fashion of that day it was profusely powdered a round hat was laid on the stones that formed a paved floor to the hut as if to make room for a large map which among the other papers occupied the table  this was an unexpected event to our adventurer she had been so confident that the figure twice seen was the peddler that on learning his agency in her brothers escape she did not in the least doubt of finding them both in the place which she now discovered was occupied by another and a stranger she stood earnestly looking through the crevice hesitating whether to retire or to wait with the expectation of yet meeting henry as the stranger moved his hand from before his eyes and raised his face apparently in deep musing when frances instantly recognized the benevolent and strongly marked but composed features of harper  all that dunwoodie had said of his power and disposition all that he had himself promised her brother and all the confidence that had been created by his dignified and paternal manner rushed across the mind of frances who threw open the door of the hut and falling at his feet clasped his knees with her arms as she cried  save himsave himsave my brother remember your promise and save him  harper had risen as the door opened and there was a slight movement of one hand towards his pistols but it was cool and instantly checked he raised the hood of the cardinal which had fallen over her features and exclaimed with some uneasiness  miss wharton but you cannot be alone  there is none here but my god and you and by his sacred name i conjure you to remember your promise and save my brother  harper gently raised her from her knees and placed her on the stool begging her at the same time to be composed and to acquaint him with the nature of her errand this frances instantly did ingenuously admitting him to a knowledge of all her views in visiting that lone spot at such an hour and by herself  it was at all times difficult to probe the thoughts of one who held his passions in such disciplined subjection as harper but still there was a lighting of his thoughtful eye and a slight unbending of his muscles as the hurried and anxious girl proceeded in her narrative his interest as she dwelt upon the manner of henrys escape and the flight to the woods was deep and manifest and he listened to the remainder of her tale with a marked expression of benevolent indulgence her apprehensions that her brother might still be too late through the mountains seemed to have much weight with him for as she concluded he walked a turn or two across the hut in silent musing  frances hesitated and unconsciously played with the handle of one of the pistols and the paleness that her fears had spread over her fine features began to give place to a rich tint as after a short pause she added  we can depend much on the friendship of major dunwoodie but his sense of honor is so pure thatthatnotwithstanding hishisfeelingshis desire to serve ushe will conceive it to be his duty to apprehend my brother again besides he thinks there will be no danger in so doing as he relies greatly on your interference  on mine said harper raising his eyes in surprise  yes on yours when we told him of your kind language he at once assured us all that you had the power and if you had promised would have the inclination to procure henrys pardon  said he more asked harper who appeared slightly uneasy  nothing but reiterated assurances of henrys safety even now he is in quest of you  miss wharton that i bear no mean part in the unhappy struggle between england and america it might now be useless to deny you owe your brothers escape this night to my knowledge of his innocence and the remembrance of my word major dunwoodie is mistaken when he says that i might openly have procured his pardon i now indeed can control his fate and i pledge to you a word which has some influence with washington that means shall be taken to prevent his recapture but from you also i exact a promise that this interview and all that has passed between us remain confined to your own bosom until you have my permission to speak upon the subject  frances gave the desired assurance and he continued  the peddler and your brother will soon be here but i must not be seen by the royal officer or the life of birch might be the forfeiture  never cried frances ardently henry could never be so base as to betray the man who saved him  it is no childish game that we are now playing miss wharton mens lives and fortunes hang upon slender threads and nothing must be left to accident that can be guarded against did sir henry clinton know that the peddler had communion with me and under such circumstances the life of the miserable man would be taken instantly therefore as you value human blood or remember the rescue of your brother be prudent and be silent communicate what you know to them both and urge them to instant departure if they can reach the last pickets of our army before morning it shall be my care that there are none to intercept them there is better work for major dunwoodie than to be exposing the life of his friend  while harper was speaking he carefully rolled up the map he had been studying and placed it together with sundry papers that were also open into his pocket he was still occupied in this manner when the voice of the peddler talking in unusually loud tones was heard directly over their heads  stand farther this way captain wharton and you can see the tents in the moonshine but let them mount and ride i have a nest here that will hold us both and we will go in at our leisure  and where is this nest i confess that i have eaten but little the last two days and i crave some of the cheer you mention  hem said the peddler exerting his voice still more hemthis fog has given me a cold but move slowand be careful not to slip or you may land on the bayonet of the sentinel on the flats tis a steep hill to rise but one can go down it with ease  harper pressed his finger on his lip to remind frances of her promise and taking his pistols and hat so that no vestige of his visit remained he retired deliberately to a far corner of the hut where lifting several articles of dress he entered a recess in the rock and letting them fall again was hid from view frances noticed by the strong firelight as he entered that it was a natural cavity and contained nothing but a few more articles of domestic use  the surprise of henry and the peddler on entering and finding frances in possession of the hut may be easily imagined without waiting for explanations or questions the warmhearted girl flew into the arms of her brother and gave a vent to her emotions in tears but the peddler seemed struck with very different feelings his first look was at the fire which had been recently supplied with fuel he then drew open a small drawer of the table and looked a little alarmed at finding it empty  are you alone miss fanny he asked in a quick voice you did not come here alone  as you see me mr birch said frances raising herself from her brothers arms and turning an expressive glance towards the secret cavern that the quick eye of the peddler instantly understood  but why and wherefore are you here exclaimed her astonished brother and how knew you of this place at all  frances entered at once into a brief detail of what had occurred at the house since their departure and the motives which induced her to seek them  but said birch why follow us here when we were left on the opposite hill  frances related the glimpse that she had caught of the hut and peddler in her passage through the highlands as well as her view of him on that day and her immediate conjecture that the fugitives would seek the shelter of this habitation for the night birch examined her features as with open ingenuousness she related the simple incidents that had made her mistress of his secret and as she ended he sprang upon his feet and striking the window with the stick in his hand demolished it at a blow  tis but little luxury or comfort that i know he said but even that little cannot be enjoyed in safety miss wharton he added advancing before frances and speaking with the bitter melancholy that was common to him i am hunted through these hills like a beast of the forest but whenever tired with my toils i can reach this spot poor and dreary as it is i can spend my solitary nights in safety will you aid to make the life of a wretch still more miserable  never cried frances with fervor your secret is safe with me  major dunwoodiesaid the peddler slowly turning an eye upon her that read her soul  frances lowered her head upon her bosom for a moment in shame then elevating her fine and glowing face she added with enthusiasm  never never harvey as god may hear my prayers  the peddler seemed satisfied for he drew back and watching his opportunity unseen by henry slipped behind the screen and entered the cavern  frances and her brother who thought his companion had passed through the door continued conversing on the latters situation for several minutes when the former urged the necessity of expedition on his part in order to precede dunwoodie from whose sense of duty they knew they had no escape the captain took out his pocketbook and wrote a few lines with his pencil then folding the paper he handed it to his sister  frances he said you have this night proved yourself to be an incomparable woman as you love me give that unopened to dunwoodie and remember that two hours may save my life  i willi will but why delay why not fly and improve these precious moments  your sister says well captain wharton exclaimed harvey who had reentered unseen we must go at once here is food to eat as we travel  but who is to see this fair creature in safety cried the captain i can never desert my sister in such a place as this  leave me leave me said frances i can descend as i came up do not doubt me you know not my courage nor my strength  i have not known you dear girl it is true but now as i learn your value can i quit you here never never  captain wharton said birch throwing open the door you can trifle with your own lives if you have many to spare i have but one and must nurse it do i go alone or not  go go dear henry said frances embracing him go remember our father remember sarah she waited not for his answer but gently forced him through the door and closed it with her own hands  for a short time there was a warm debate between henry and the peddler but the latter finally prevailed and the breathless girl heard the successive plunges as they went down the sides of the mountain at a rapid rate  immediately after the noise of their departure had ceased harper reappeared he took the arm of frances in silence and led her from the hut the way seemed familiar to him for ascending to the ledge above them he led his companion across the tableland tenderly pointing out the little difficulties in their route and cautioning her against injury  frances felt as she walked by the side of this extraordinary man that she was supported by one of no common stamp the firmness of his step and the composure of his manner seemed to indicate a mind settled and resolved by taking a route over the back of the hill they descended with great expedition and but little danger the distance it had taken frances an hour to conquer was passed by harper and his companion in ten minutes and they entered the open space already mentioned he struck into one of the sheep paths and crossing the clearing with rapid steps they came suddenly upon a horse caparisoned for a rider of no mean rank the noble beast snorted and pawed the earth as his master approached and replaced the pistols in the holsters  harper then turned and taking the hand of frances spoke as follows  you have this night saved your brother miss wharton it would not be proper for me to explain why there are limits to my ability to serve him but if you can detain the horse for two hours he is assuredly safe after what you have already done i can believe you equal to any duty god has denied to me children young lady but if it had been his blessed will that my marriage should not have been childless such a treasure as yourself would i have asked from his mercy but you are my child all who dwell in this broad land are my children and my care and take the blessing of one who hopes yet to meet you in happier days  as he spoke with a solemnity that touched frances to the heart he laid his hand impressively upon her head the guileless girl turned her face towards him and the hood again falling back exposed her lovely features to the moonbeams a tear was glistening on either cheek and her mild blue eyes were gazing upon him in reverence harper bent and pressed a paternal kiss upon her forehead and continued any of these sheep paths will take you to the plain but here we must parti have much to do and far to ride forget me in all but your prayers  he then mounted his horse and lifting his hat rode towards the back of the mountain descending at the same time and was soon hid by the trees frances sprang forward with a lightened heart and taking the first path that led downwards in a few minutes she reached the plain in safety while busied in stealing through the meadows towards the house the noise of horse approaching startled her and she felt how much more was to be apprehended from man in some situations than from solitude hiding her form in the angle of a fence near the road she remained quiet for a moment and watched their passage a small party of dragoons whose dress was different from the virginians passed at a brisk trot they were followed by a gentleman enveloped in a large cloak whom she at once knew to be harper behind him rode a black in livery and two youths in uniform brought up the rear instead of taking the road that led by the encampment they turned short to the left and entered the hills  wondering who this unknown but powerful friend of her brother could be frances glided across the fields and using due precautions in approaching the dwelling regained her residence undiscovered and in safety     chapter xxxi        hence bashful cunning      and prompt me plain and holy innocence      i am your wife if you will marry me                                         tempest  on joining miss peyton frances learned that dunwoodie was not yet returned although with a view to relieve henry from the importunities of the supposed fanatic he had desired a very respectable divine of their own church to ride up from the river and offer his services this gentleman was already arrived and had been passing the half hour he had been there in a sensible and wellbred conversation with the spinster that in no degree touched upon their domestic affairs  to the eager inquiries of miss peyton relative to her success in her romantic excursion frances could say no more than that she was bound to be silent and to recommend the same precaution to the good maiden also there was a smile playing around the beautiful mouth of frances while she uttered this injunction which satisfied her aunt that all was as it should be she was urging her niece to take some refreshment after her fatiguing expedition when the noise of a horseman riding to the door announced the return of the major he had been found by the courier who was dispatched by mason impatiently waiting the return of harper to the ferry and immediately flew to the place where his friend had been confined tormented by a thousand conflicting fears the heart of frances bounded as she listened to his approaching footsteps it wanted yet an hour to the termination of the shortest period that the peddler had fixed as the time necessary to effect his escape even harper powerful and welldisposed as he acknowledged himself to be had laid great stress upon the importance of detaining the virginians during that hour she however had not time to rally her thoughts before dunwoodie entered one door as miss peyton with the readiness of female instinct retired through another  the countenance of peyton was flushed and an air of vexation and disappointment pervaded his manner  twas imprudent frances nay it was unkind he cried throwing himself in a chair to fly at the very moment that i had assured him of safety i can almost persuade myself that you delight in creating points of difference in our feelings and duties  in our duties there may very possibly be a difference returned his mistress approaching and leaning her slender form against the wall but not in our feelings peyton you must certainly rejoice in the escape of henry  there was no danger impending he had the promise of harper and it is a word never to be doubted o frances frances had you known the man you would never have distrusted his assurance nor would you have again reduced me to this distressing alternative  what alternative asked frances pitying his emotions deeply but eagerly seizing upon every circumstance to prolong the interview  what alternative am i not compelled to spend this night in the saddle to recapture your brother when i had thought to lay my head on its pillow with the happy consciousness of having contributed to his release you make me seem your enemy i who would cheerfully shed the last drop of blood in your service i repeat frances it was rash it was unkind it was a sad sad mistake  she bent towards him and timidly took one of his hands while with the other she gently removed the curls from his burning brow  why go at all dear peyton she asked you have done much for your country and she cannot exact such a sacrifice as this at your hand  frances miss wharton exclaimed the youth springing on his feet and pacing the floor with a cheek that burned through its brown covering and an eye that sparkled with wounded integrity it is not my country but my honor that requires the sacrifice has he not fled from a guard of my own corps but for this i might have been spared the blow but if the eyes of the virginians are blinded to deception and artifice their horses are swift of foot and their sabers keen we shall see before tomorrows sun who will presume to hint that the beauty of the sister furnished a mask to conceal the brother yes yes i should like even now he continued laughing bitterly to hear the villain who would dare to surmise that such treachery existed  peyton dear peyton said frances recoiling from his angry eye you curdle my bloodwould you kill my brother  would i not die for him exclaimed dunwoodie as he turned to her more mildly you know i would but i am distracted with the cruel surmise to which this step of henrys subjects me what will washington think of me should he learn that i ever became your husband  if that alone impels you to act so harshly towards my brother returned frances with a slight tremor in her voice let it never happen for him to learn  and this is consolation frances  nay dear dunwoodie i meant nothing harsh or unkind but are you not making us both of more consequence with washington than the truth will justify  i trust that my name is not entirely unknown to the commander in chief said the major a little proudly nor are you as obscure as your modesty would make you i believe you frances when you say that you pity me and it must be my task to continue worthy of such feelings but i waste the precious moments we must go through the hills tonight that we may be refreshed in time for the duty of tomorrow mason is already waiting my orders to mount frances i leave you with a heavy heart pity me but feel no concern for your brother he must again become a prisoner but every hair of his head is sacred  stop dunwoodie i conjure you cried frances gasping for breath as she noticed that the hand of the clock still wanted many minutes to the desired hour before you go on your errand of fastidious duty read this note that henry has left for you and which doubtless he thought he was writing to the friend of his youth  frances i excuse your feelings but the time will come when you will do me justice  that time is now she answered extending her hand unable any longer to feign a displeasure that she did not feel  where got you this note exclaimed the youth glancing his eyes over its contents poor henry you are indeed my friend if anyone wishes me happiness it is you  he does he does cried frances eagerly he wishes you every happiness believe what he tells you every word is true  i do believe him lovely girl and he refers me to you for its confirmation would that i could trust equally to your affections  you may peyton said frances looking up with innocent confidence towards her lover  then read for yourself and verify your words interrupted dunwoodie holding the note towards her  frances received it in astonishment and read the following  life is too precious to be trusted to uncertainties i leave you peyton unknown to all but caesar and i recommend him to your mercy but there is a care that weighs me to the earth look at my aged and infirm parent he will be reproached for the supposed crime of his son look at those helpless sisters that i leave behind me without a protector prove to me that you love us all let the clergyman whom you will bring with you unite you this night to frances and become at once brother son and husband  the paper fell from the hands of frances and she endeavored to raise her eyes to the face of dunwoodie but they sank abashed to the floor  am i worthy of this confidence will you send me out this night to meet my own brother or will it be the officer of congress in quest of the officer of britain  and would you do less of your duty because i am your wife major dunwoodie in what degree would it better the condition of henry  henry i repeat is safe the word of harper is his guarantee but i will show the world a bridegroom continued the youth perhaps deceiving himself a little who is equal to the duty of arresting the brother of his bride  and will the world comprehend this refinement said frances with a musing air that lighted a thousand hopes in the bosom of her lover in fact the temptation was mighty indeed there seemed no other way to detain dunwoodie until the fatal hour had elapsed the words of harper himself who had so lately told her that openly he could do but little for henry and that everything depended upon gaining time were deeply engraved upon her memory perhaps there was also a fleeting thought of the possibility of an eternal separation from her lover should he proceed and bring back her brother to punishment it is difficult at all times to analyze human emotions and they pass through the sensitive heart of a woman with the rapidity and nearly with the vividness of lightning  why do you hesitate dear frances cried dunwoodie who was studying her varying countenance a few minutes might give me a husbands claim to protect you  frances grew giddy she turned an anxious eye to the clock and the hand seemed to linger over its face as if with intent to torture her  speak frances murmured dunwoodie may i summon my good kinswoman determine for time presses  she endeavored to reply but could only whisper something that was inaudible but which her lover with the privilege of immemorial custom construed into assent he turned and flew to the door when his mistress recovered her voice  stop peyton i cannot enter into such a solemn engagement with a fraud upon my conscience i have seen henry since his escape and time is allimportant to him here is my hand if with this knowledge of the consequences of delay you will not reject it it is freely yours  reject it cried the delighted youth i take it as the richest gift of heaven there is time enough for us all two hours will take me through the hills and by noon tomorrow i will return with washingtons pardon for your brother and henry will help to enliven our nuptials  then meet me here in ten minutes said frances greatly relieved by unburdening her mind and filled with the hope of securing henrys safety and i will return and take those vows which will bind me to you forever  dunwoodie paused only to press her once to his bosom and flew to communicate his wishes to the priest  miss peyton received the avowal of her niece with infinite astonishment and a little displeasure it was violating all the order and decorum of a wedding to get it up so hastily and with so little ceremony but frances with modest firmness declared that her resolution was taken she had long possessed the consent of her friends and their nuptials for months had only waited her pleasure she had now promised dunwoodie and it was her wish to comply more she dare not say without committing herself by entering into explanations that might endanger birch or harper or both unused to contention and really much attached to her kinsman the feeble objections of miss peyton gave way to the firmness of her niece mr wharton was too completely a convert to the doctrine of passive obedience and nonresistance to withstand any solicitation from an officer of dunwoodies influence in the rebel armies and the maid returned to the apartment accompanied by her father and aunt at the expiration of the time that she had fixed dunwoodie and the clergyman were already there frances silently and without the affectation of reserve placed in his hand the wedding ring of her own mother and after some little time spent in arranging mr wharton and herself miss peyton suffered the ceremony to proceed  the clock stood directly before the eyes of frances and she turned many an anxious glance at the dial but the solemn language of the priest soon caught her attention and her mind became intent upon the vows she was uttering the ceremony was quickly over and as the clergyman closed the words of benediction the clock told the hour of nine this was the time that harper had deemed so important and frances felt as if a mighty load was at once removed from her heart  dunwoodie folded her in his arms saluted the mild aunt again and again and shook mr wharton and the divine repeatedly by the hands in the midst of the felicitation a tap was heard at the door it was opened and mason appeared  we are in the saddle said the lieutenant and with your permission i will lead on as you are so well mounted you can overtake us at your leisure  yes yes my good fellow march cried dunwoodie gladly seizing an excuse to linger i will reach you at the first halt  the subaltern retired to execute these orders he was followed by mr wharton and the divine  now peyton said frances it is indeed a brother that you seek i am sure i need not caution you in his behalf should you unfortunately find him  say fortunately cried the youth for i am determined he shall yet dance at my wedding would that i could win him to our cause it is the cause of his country and i could fight with more pleasure frances with your brother by my side  oh mention it not you awaken terrible reflections  i will not mention it returned her husband but i must now leave you but the sooner i go frances the sooner i shall return  the noise of a horseman was heard approaching the house and dunwoodie was yet taking leave of his bride and her aunt when an officer was shown into the room by his own man  the gentleman wore the dress of an aiddecamp and the major at once knew him to be one of the military family of washington  major dunwoodie he said after bowing to the ladies the commander in chief has directed me to give you these orders  he executed his mission and pleading duty took his leave immediately  here indeed cried the major is an unexpected turn in the whole affair but i understand it harper has got my letter and already we feel his influence  have you news affecting henry cried frances springing to his side  listen and you shall judge  sirupon the receipt of this you will concentrate your squadron so as to be in front of a covering party which the enemy has sent up in front of his foragers by ten oclock tomorrow on the heights of croton where you will find a body of foot to support you the escape of the english spy has been reported to me but his arrest is unimportant compared with the duty i now assign you you will therefore recall your men if any are in pursuit and endeavor to defeat the enemy forthwith  your obedient servant geo washington  thank god cried dunwoodie my hands are washed of henrys recapture i can now move to my duty with honor  and with prudence too dear peyton said frances with a face as pale as death remember dunwoodie you leave behind you new claims on your life  the youth dwelt on her lovely but pallid features with rapture and as he folded her to his heart exclaimed  for your sake i will lovely innocent frances sobbed a moment on his bosom and he tore himself from her presence  miss peyton retired with her niece to whom she conceived it necessary before they separated for the night to give an admonitory lecture on the subject of matrimonial duty her instruction was modestly received if not properly digested we regret that history has not handed down to us this precious dissertation but the result of all our investigation has been to learn that it partook largely of those peculiarities which are said to tincture the rules prescribed to govern bachelors children we shall now leave the ladies of the wharton family and return to captain wharton and harvey birch     chapter xxxii        allow him not a parting word      short be the shrift and sure the cord                                             rokeby  the peddler and his companion soon reached the valley and after pausing to listen and hearing no sounds which announced that pursuers were abroad they entered the highway acquainted with every step that led through the mountains and possessed of sinews inured to toil birch led the way with the lengthened strides that were peculiar to the man and his profession his pack alone was wanting to finish the appearance of his ordinary business air at times when they approached one of those little posts held by the american troops with which the highlands abounded he would take a circuit to avoid the sentinels and plunge fearlessly into a thicket or ascend a rugged hill that to the eye seemed impassable but the peddler was familiar with every turn in their difficult route knew where the ravines might be penetrated or where the streams were fordable in one or two instances henry thought that their further progress was absolutely at an end but the ingenuity or knowledge of his guide conquered every difficulty after walking at a great rate for three hours they suddenly diverged from the road which inclined to the east and held their course directly across the hills in a due south direction this movement was made the peddler informed his companion in order to avoid the parties who constantly patrolled in the southern entrance of the highlands as well as to shorten the distance by traveling in a straight line after reaching the summit of a hill harvey seated himself by the side of a little run and opening a wallet that he had slung where his pack was commonly suspended he invited his comrade to partake of the coarse fare it contained henry had kept pace with the peddler more by the excitement natural to his situation than by the equality of his physical powers the idea of a halt was unpleasant so long as there existed a possibility of the horse getting below him in time to intercept their retreat through the neutral ground he therefore stated his apprehensions to his companion and urged a wish to proceed  follow my example captain wharton said the peddler commencing his frugal meal if the horse have started it will be more than man can do to head them and if they have not work is cut out for them that will drive all thoughts of you and me from their brains  you said yourself that two hours detention was allimportant to us and if we loiter here of what use will be the advantage that we may have already obtained  the time is past and major dunwoodie thinks little of following two men when hundreds are waiting for him on the banks of the river  listen interrupted henry there are horse at this moment passing the foot of the hill i hear them even laughing and talking to each other hist there is the voice of dunwoodie himself he calls to his comrade in a manner that shows but little uneasiness one would think that the situation of his friend would lower his spirits surely frances could not have given him the letter  on hearing the first exclamation of the captain birch arose from his seat and approached cautiously to the brow of the hill taking care to keep his body in the shadow of the rocks so as to be unseen at any distance and earnestly reconnoitered the group of passing horsemen he continued listening until their quick footsteps were no longer audible and then quietly returned to his seat and with incomparable coolness resumed his meal  you have a long walk and a tiresome one before you captain wharton you had better do as i doyou were eager for food at the hut above fishkill but traveling seems to have worn down your appetite  i thought myself safe then but the information of my sister fills me with uneasiness and i cannot eat  you have less reason to be troubled now than at any time since the night before you were taken when you refused my advice and an offer to see you in safety returned the peddler major dunwoodie is not a man to laugh and be gay when his friend is in difficulty come then and eat for no horse will be in our way if we can hold our legs for four hours longer and the sun keeps behind the hills as long as common  there was a composure in the peddlers manner that encouraged his companion and having once determined to submit to harveys government he suffered himself to be persuaded into a tolerable supper if quantity be considered without any reference to the quality after completing their repast the peddler resumed his journey  henry followed in blind submission to his will for two hours more they struggled with the difficult and dangerous passes of the highlands without road or any other guide than the moon which was traveling the heavens now wading through flying clouds and now shining brightly at length they arrived at a point where the mountains sank into rough and unequal hillocks and passed at once from the barren sterility of the precipices to the imperfect culture of the neutral ground  the peddler now became more guarded in the manner in which they proceeded and took divers precautions to prevent meeting any moving parts of the americans with the stationary posts he was too familiar to render it probable he might fall upon any of them unawares he wound among the hills and vales now keeping the highways and now avoiding them with a precision that seemed instinctive there was nothing elastic in his tread but he glided over the ground with enormous strides and a body bent forward without appearing to use exertion or know weariness  the moon had set and a faint streak of light was beginning to show itself in the east captain wharton ventured to express a sense of fatigue and to inquire if they were not yet arrived at a part of the country where it might be safe to apply at some of the farmhouses for admission  see here said the peddler pointing to a hill at a short distance in the rear do you not see a man walking on the point of that rock turn so as to bring the daylight in the rangenow see he moves and seems to be looking earnestly at something to the eastward that is a royal sentinel two hundred of the riglar troops lay on that hill no doubt sleeping on their arms  then cried henry let us join them and our danger is ended  softly softly captain wharton said the peddler dryly youve once been in the midst of three hundred of them but there was a man who could take you out see you not yon dark body on the side of the opposite hill just above the cornstalks there are thethe rebels since that is the word for us loyal subjects waiting only for day to see who will be master of the ground  nay then exclaimed the fiery youth i will join the troops of my prince and share their fortune be it good or be it bad  you forget that you fight with a halter round your neck no noi have promised one whom i must not disappoint to carry you safe in and unless you forget what i have already done and what i have risked for you captain wharton you will turn and follow me to harlem  to this appeal the youth felt unwillingly obliged to submit and they continued their course towards the city it was not long before they gained the banks of the hudson after searching for a short time under the shore the peddler discovered a skiff that appeared to be an old acquaintance and entering it with his companion he landed him on the south side of the croton here birch declared they were in safety for the royal troops held the continentals at bay and the former were out in too great strength for the light parties of the latter to trust themselves below that river on the immediate banks of the hudson  throughout the whole of this arduous flight the peddler had manifested a coolness and presence of mind that nothing appeared to disturb all his faculties seemed to be of more than usual perfection and the infirmities of nature to have no dominion over him henry had followed him like a child in leading strings and he now reaped his reward as he felt a bound of pleasure at his heart on hearing that he was relieved from apprehension and permitted to banish every doubt of security  a steep and laborious ascent brought them from the level of the tidewaters to the high lands that form in this part of the river the eastern banks of the hudson retiring a little from the highway under the shelter of a thicket of cedars the peddler threw his form on a flat rock and announced to his companion that the hour for rest and refreshment was at length arrived the day was now opened and objects could be seen in the distance with distinctness beneath them lay the hudson stretching to the south in a straight line as far as the eye could reach to the north the broken fragments of the highlands threw upwards their lofty heads above masses of fog that hung over the water and by which the course of the river could be traced into the bosom of hills whose conical summits were grouping togather one behind another in that disorder which might be supposed to have succeeded their gigantic but fruitless efforts to stop the progress of the flood emerging from these confused piles the river as if rejoicing at its release from the struggle expanded into a wide bay which was ornamented by a few fertile and low points that jutted humbly into its broad basin on the opposite or western shore the rocks of jersey were gathered into an array that has obtained for them the name of the palisades elevating themselves for many hundred feet as if to protect the rich country in their rear from the inroads of the conqueror but disdaining such an enemy the river swept proudly by their feet and held its undeviating way to the ocean a ray of the rising sun darted upon the slight cloud that hung over the placid river and at once the whole scene was in motion changing and assuming new forms and exhibiting fresh objects in each successive moment at the daily rising of this great curtain of nature at the present time scores of white sails and sluggish vessels are seen thickening on the water with that air of life which denotes the neighborhood to the metropolis of a great and flourishing empire but to henry and the peddler it displayed only the square yards and lofty masts of a vessel of war riding a few miles below them before the fog had begun to move the tall spars were seen above it and from one of them a long pennant was feebly borne abroad in the current of night air that still quivered along the river but as the smoke arose the black hull the crowded and complicated mass of rigging and the heavy yards and booms spreading their arms afar were successively brought into view  there captain wharton said the peddler there is a safe resting place for you america has no arm that can reach you if you gain the deck of that ship she is sent up to cover the foragers and support the troops the riglar officers are fond of the sound of cannon from their shipping  without condescending to reply to the sarcasm conveyed in this speech or perhaps not noticing it henry joyfully acquiesced in the proposal and it was accordingly arranged between them that as soon as they were refreshed he should endeavor to get on board the vessel  while busily occupied in the very indispensable operation of breaking their fast our adventurers were startled with the sound of distant firearms at first a few scattering shots were fired which were succeeded by a long and animated roll of musketry and then quick and heavy volleys followed each other  your prophecy is made good cried the english officer springing upon his feet our troops and the rebels are at it i would give six months pay to see the charge  umph returned his companion without ceasing his meal they do very well to look at from a distance i cant say but the company of this bacon cold as it is is more to my taste just now than a hot fire from the continentals  the discharges are heavy for so small a force but the fire seems irregular  the scattering guns are from the connecticut militia said harvey raising his head to listen they rattle it off finely and are no fools at a mark the volleys are the riglars who you know fire by wordas long as they can  i like not the warmth of what you call a scattering fire exclaimed the captain moving about with uneasiness it is more like the roll of a drum than skirmishers shooting  no no i said not skrimmagers returned the other raising himself upon a knee and ceasing to eat so long as they stand they are too good for the best troops in the royal army each man does his work as if fighting by the job and then they think while they fight and dont send bullets to the clouds that were meant to kill men on earth  you talk and look sir as if you wished them success said henry sternly  i wish success to the good cause only captain wharton i thought you knew me too well to be uncertain which party i favored  oh you are reputed loyal mr birch but the volleys have ceased  both now listened intently for a little while during which the irregular reports became less brisk and suddenly heavy and repeated volleys followed  theyve been at the bayonet said the peddler the riglars have tried the bayonet and the rebels are driven  aye mr birch the bayonet is the thing for the british soldier after all they delight in the bayonet  well to my notion said the peddler theres but little delight to be taken in any such fearful weapon i dare say the militia are of my mind for half of them dont carry the ugly things lord lord captain i wish youd go with me once into the rebel camp and hear what lies the men will tell about bunker hill and burgyne youd think they loved the bayonet as much as they do their dinners  there was a chuckle and an air of affected innocency about his companion that rather annoyed henry and he did not deign to reply  the firing now became desultory occasionally intermingled with heavy volleys both of the fugitives were standing listening with much anxiety when a man armed with a musket was seen stealing towards them under the shelter of the cedar bushes that partially covered the hill henry first observed this suspiciouslooking stranger and instantly pointed him out to his companion birch started and certainly made an indication of sudden flight but recollecting himself he stood in sullen silence until the stranger was within a few yards of them  tis friends said the fellow clubbing his gun but apparently afraid to venture nearer  you had better retire said birch here are riglars at hand we are not near dunwoodies horse now and you will not find me an easy prize today  damn major dunwoodie and his horse cried the leader of the skinners for it was he god bless king george and a speedy end to the rebellion say i if you would show me the safe way in to the refugees mr birch ill pay you well and ever after stand your friend in the bargain  the road is as open to you as to me said birch turning from him in illconcealed disgust if you want to find the refugees you know well where they lay  aye but im a little doubtful of going in upon them by myself now you are well known to them all and it will be no detriment to you just to let me go in with you  henry here interfered and after holding a short dialogue with the fellow he entered into a compact with him that on condition of surrendering his arms he might join the party the man complied instantly and birch received his gun with eagerness nor did he lay it upon his shoulder to renew their march before he had carefully examined the priming and ascertained to his satisfaction that it contained a good dry ball cartridge  as soon as this engagement was completed they commenced their journey anew by following the bank of the river birch led the way free from observation until they reached the point opposite to the frigate when by making a signal a boat was induced to approach some time was spent and much precaution used before the seamen would trust themselves ashore but henry having finally succeeded in making the officer who commanded the party credit his assertions he was able to rejoin his companions in arms in safety before taking leave of birch the captain handed him his purse which was tolerably well supplied for the times the peddler received it and watching an opportunity he conveyed it unnoticed by the skinner to a part of his dress that was ingeniously contrived to hold such treasures  the boat pulled from the shore and birch turned on his heel drawing his breath like one relieved and shot up the hills with the strides for which he was famous the skinner followed and each party pursued the common course casting frequent and suspicious glances at the other and both maintaining a most impenetrable silence  wagons were moving along the river road and occasional parties of horse were seen escorting the fruits of the inroad towards the city as the peddler had views of his own he rather avoided falling in with any of these patrols than sought their protection but after traveling a few miles on the immediate banks of the river during which notwithstanding the repeated efforts of the skinner to establish something like sociability he maintained a most determined silence keeping a firm hold of the gun and always maintaining a jealous watchfulness of his associate the peddler suddenly struck into the highway with an intention of crossing the hills towards harlem at the moment he gained the path a body of horse came over a little eminence and was upon him before he perceived them it was too late to retreat and after taking a view of the materials that composed this party birch rejoiced in the rencounter as a probable means of relieving him from his unwelcome companion there were some eighteen or twenty men mounted and equipped as dragoons though neither their appearance nor manners denoted much discipline at their head rode a heavy middleaged man whose features expressed as much of animal courage and as little of reason as could be desired for such an occupation he wore the dress of an officer but there was none of that neatness in his attire nor grace in his movements that was usually found about the gentlemen who bore the royal commission his limbs were firm and not pliable and he sat his horse with strength and confidence but his bridle hand would have been ridiculed by the meanest rider amongst the virginians as he expected this leader instantly hailed the peddler in a voice by no means more conciliating than his appearance  hey my gentlemen which way so fast he cried has washington sent you down as spies  i am an innocent peddler returned harvey meekly and am going below to lay in a fresh stock of goods  and how do you expect to get below my innocent peddler do you think we hold the forts at kings bridge to cover such peddling rascals as you in your goings in and comings out  i believe i hold a pass that will carry me through said the peddler handing him a paper with an air of indifference  the officer for such he was read it and cast a look of surprise and curiosity at harvey when he had done  then turning to one or two of his men who had officiously stopped the way he cried  why do you detain the man give way and let him pass in peace but whom have we here your name is not mentioned in the pass  no sir said the skinner lifting his hat with humility i have been a poor deluded man who has been serving in the rebel army but thank god ive lived to see the error of my ways and am now come to make reparation by enlisting under the lords anointed  umph a desertera skinner ill swear wanting to turn cowboy in the last brush i had with the scoundrels i could hardly tell my own men from the enemy we are not over well supplied with coats and as for countenances the rascals change sides so often that you may as well count their faces for nothing but trudge on we will contrive to make use of you sooner or later  ungracious as was this reception if you could judge of the skinners feelings from his manner it nevertheless delighted him he moved with alacrity towards the city and really was so happy to escape the brutal looks and frightful manner of his interrogator as to lose sight of all other considerations but the man who performed the functions of orderly in the irregular troop rode up to the side of his commander and commenced a close and apparently a confidential discourse with his principal they spoke in whispers and cast frequent and searching glances at the skinner until the fellow began to think himself an object of more than common attention his satisfaction at this distinction was somewhat heightened at observing a smile on the face of the captain which although it might be thought grim certainly denoted satisfaction this pantomime occupied the time they were passing a hollow and concluded as they rose another hill here the captain and his sergeant both dismounted and ordered the party to halt the two partisans each took a pistol from his holster a movement that excited no suspicion or alarm as it was a precaution always observed and beckoned to the peddler and the skinner to follow a short walk brought them to a spot where the hill overhung the river the ground falling nearly perpendicularly to the shore on the brow of the eminence stood a deserted and dilapidated barn many boards of its covering were torn from their places and its wide doors were lying the one in front of the building and the other halfway down the precipice whither the wind had cast it entering this desolate spot the refugee officer very coolly took from his pocket a short pipe which from long use had acquired not only the hue but the gloss of ebony a tobacco box and a small roll of leather that contained steel flint and tinder with this apparatus he soon furnished his mouth with a companion that habit had long rendered necessary to reflection so soon as a large column of smoke arose from this arrangement the captain significantly held forth a hand towards his assistant a small cord was produced from the pocket of the sergeant and handed to the other the refugee threw out vast puffs of smoke until nearly all of his head was obscured and looked around the building with an inquisitive eye at length he removed the pipe and inhaling a draft of pure air returned it to its domicile and proceeded at once to business a heavy piece of timber lay across the girths of the barn but a little way from the southern door which opened directly upon a full view of the river as it stretched far away towards the bay of new york over this beam the refugee threw one end of the rope and regaining it joined the two parts in his hand a small and weak barrel that wanted a head the staves of which were loose and at one end standing apart was left on the floor probably as useless the sergeant in obedience to a look from his officer placed it beneath the beam all of these arrangements were made with composure and they now seemed completed to the officers perfect satisfaction  come he said coolly to the skinner who admiring the preparations had stood a silent spectator of their progress he obeyed and it was not until he found his neckcloth removed and hat thrown aside that he took the alarm but he had so often resorted to a similar expedient to extort information or plunder that he by no means felt the terror an unpracticed man would have suffered at these ominous movements the rope was adjusted to his neck with the same coolness that formed the characteristic of the whole movement and a fragment of board being laid upon the barrel he was ordered to mount  but it may fall said the skinner for the first time beginning to tremble i will tell you anythingeven how to surprise our party at the pond without all this trouble and it is commanded by my own brother  i want no information returned his executioner for such he now seemed really to be throwing the rope repeatedly over the beam first drawing it tight so as to annoy the skinner a little and then casting the end from him beyond the reach of anyone  this is joking too far cried the skinner in a tone of remonstrance and raising himself on his toes with the vain hope of releasing himself from the cord by slipping his head through the noose but the caution and experience of the refugee officer had guarded against this escape  what have you done with the horse you stole from me rascal muttered the officer of the cowboys throwing out columns of smoke while he waited for a reply  he broke down in the chase replied the skinner quickly but i can tell you where one is to be found that is worth him and his sire  liar i will help myself when i am in need you had better call upon god for aid as your hour is short on concluding this consoling advice he struck the barrel a violent blow with his heavy foot and the slender staves flew in every direction leaving the skinner whirling in the air as his hands were unconfined he threw them upwards and held himself suspended by main strength  come captain he said coaxingly a little huskiness creeping into his voice and his knees beginning to shake with tremor end the joke tis enough to make a laugh and my arms begin to tirei cant hold on much longer  harkee mr peddler said the refugee in a voice that would not be denied i want not your company through that door lies your roadmarch offer to touch that dog and youll swing in his place though twenty sir henrys wanted your services so saying he retired to the road with the sergeant as the peddler precipitately retreated down the bank  birch went no farther than a bush that opportunely offered itself as a screen to his person while he yielded to an unconquerable desire to witness the termination of this extraordinary scene  left alone the skinner began to throw fearful glances around to espy the hiding places of his tormentors for the first time the horrid idea seemed to shoot through his brain that something serious was intended by the cowboy he called entreatingly to be released and made rapid and incoherent promises of important information mingled with affected pleasantry at their conceit which he would hardly admit to himself could mean anything so dreadful as it seemed but as he heard the tread of the horses moving on their course and in vain looked around for human aid violent trembling seized his limbs and his eyes began to start from his head with terror he made a desperate effort to reach the beam but too much exhausted with his previous exertions he caught the rope in his teeth in a vain effort to sever the cord and fell to the whole length of his arms here his cries were turned into shrieks  help cut the rope captainbirch good peddler down with the congresssergeant for gods sake help hurrah for the kingo god o godmercy mercymercy  as his voice became suppressed one of his hands endeavored to make its way between the rope and his neck and partially succeeded but the other fell quivering by his side a convulsive shuddering passed over his whole frame and he hung a hideous corpse  birch continued gazing on this scene with a kind of infatuation at its close he placed his hands to his ears and rushed towards the highway still the cries for mercy rang through his brain and it was many weeks before his memory ceased to dwell on the horrid event the cowboys rode steadily on their route as if nothing had occurred and the body was left swinging in the wind until chance directed the wandering footsteps of some lonely straggler to the place     chapter xxxiii        green be the turf above thee      friend of my better days      none knew thee but to love thee      none named thee but to praise                                         halleck  while the scenes and events that we have recorded were occurring captain lawton led his small party by slow and wary marches from the four corners to the front of a body of the enemy where he so successfully maneuvered for a short time as completely to elude all their efforts to entrap him and yet so disguised his own force as to excite the constant apprehension of an attack from the americans this forbearing policy on the side of the partisan was owing to positive orders received from his commander when dunwoodie left his detachment the enemy were known to be slowly advancing and he directed lawton to hover around them until his own return and the arrival of a body of foot might enable him to intercept their retreat  the trooper discharged his duty to the letter but with no little of the impatience that made part of his character when restrained from the attack  during these movements betty flanagan guided her little cart with indefatigable zeal among the rocks of westchester now discussing with the sergeant the nature of evil spirits and now combating with the surgeon sundry points of practice that were hourly arising between them but the moment arrived that was to decide the temporary mastery of the field a detachment of the eastern militia moved out from their fastnesses and approached the enemy  the junction between lawton and his auxiliaries was made at midnight and an immediate consultation was held between him and the leader of the foot soldiers after listening to the statements of the partisan who rather despised the prowess of his enemy the commandant of the party determined to attack the british the moment daylight enabled him to reconnoiter their position without waiting for the aid of dunwoodie and his horse so soon as this decision was made lawton retired from the building where the consultation was held and rejoined his own small command  the few troopers who were with the captain had fastened their horses in a spot adjacent to a haystack and laid their own frames under its shelter to catch a few hours sleep but dr sitgreaves sergeant hollister and betty flanagan were congregated at a short distance by themselves having spread a few blankets upon the dry surface of a rock lawton threw his huge frame by the side of the surgeon and folding his cloak about him leaned his head upon one hand and appeared deeply engaged in contemplating the moon as it waded through the heavens the sergeant was sitting upright in respectful deference to the surgeon and the washerwoman was now raising her head in order to vindicate some of her favorite maxims and now composing it to sleep  so sergeant continued sitgreaves following up a previous position if you cut upwards the blow by losing the additional momentum of your weight will be less destructive and at the same time effect the true purpose of war that of disabling your enemy  pooh pooh sergeant dear said the washerwoman raising her head from the blanket wheres the harm of taking a life jist in the way of battle is it the riglars wholl show favor and they fighting ask captain jack there if the country could get free and the boys no strike their might i wouldnt have them disparage the whisky so much  it is not to be expected that an ignorant female like yourself mrs flanagan returned the surgeon with a calmness that only rendered his contempt more stinging to betty can comprehend the distinctions of surgical science neither are you accomplished in the sword exercise so that dissertations upon the judicious use of that weapon could avail you nothing either in theory or in practice  its hut little i care anyway for such botherment but fighting is no play and a body shouldnt be particular how they strike or who they hit so its the inimy  are we likely to have a warm day captain lawton  tis more than probable replied the trooper these militia seldom fail of making a bloody field either by their cowardice or their ignorance and the real soldier is made to suffer for their bad conduct  are you ill john said the surgeon passing his hand along the arm of the captain until it instinctively settled on his pulse but the steady even beat announced neither bodily nor mental malady  sick at heart archibald at the folly of our rulers in believing that battles are to be fought and victories won by fellows who handle a musket as they would a flail lads who wink when they pull a trigger and form a line like a hoop pole the dependence we place on these men spills the best blood of the country  the surgeon listened with amazement it was not the matter but the manner that surprised him the trooper had uniformly exhibited on the eve of battle an animation and an eagerness to engage that was directly at variance with the admirable coolness of his manner at other times but now there was a despondency in the tones of his voice and a listlessness in his air that was entirely different the operator hesitated a moment to reflect in what manner he could render this change of service in furthering his favorite system and then continued  it would be wise john to advise the colonel to keep at long shot a spent ball will disable  no exclaimed the trooper impatiently let the rascals singe their whiskers at the muzzles of the british muskets if they can be driven there but enough of them archibald do you deem that moon to be a world like this containing creatures like ourselves  nothing more probable dear john we know its size and reasoning from analogy may easily conjecture its use whether or not its inhabitants have attained to that perfection in the sciences which we have acquired must depend greatly on the state of its society and in some measure upon its physical influences  i care nothing about their learning archibald but tis a wonderful power that can create such worlds and control them in their wanderings i know not why but there is a feeling of melancholy excited within me as i gaze on that body of light shaded as it is by your fancied sea and land it seems to be the resting place of departed spirits  take a drop darling said betty raising her head once more and proffering her own bottle tis the night damp that chills the bloodand then the talk with the cursed militia is no good for a fiery temper take a drop darling and yell sleep till the morning i fed roanoke myself for i thought ye might need hard riding the morrow  tis a glorious heaven to look upon continued the trooper in the same tone disregarding the offer of betty and tis a thousand pities that such worms as men should let their vile passions deface such goodly work  you speak the truth dear john there is room for all to live and enjoy themselves in peace if each could be satisfied with his own still war has its advantages it particularly promotes the knowledge of surgery and  there is a star continued lawton still bent on his own ideas struggling to glitter through a few driving clouds perhaps that too is a world and contains its creatures endowed with reason like ourselves think you that they know of war and bloodshed  if i might be so bold said sergeant hollister mechanically raising his hand to his cap tis mentioned in the good book that the lord made the sun to stand still while joshua was charging the enemy in order sir as i suppose that they might have daylight to turn their flank or perhaps make a feint in the rear or some such maneuver now if the lord would lend them a hand fighting cannot be sinful i have often been nonplused though to find that they used them chariots instead of heavy dragoons who are in all comparison better to break a line of infantry and who for the matter of that could turn such wheel carriages and getting into the rear play the very devil with them horse and all  it is because you do not understand the construction of those ancient vehicles sergeant hollister that you judge of them so erroneously said the surgeon they were armed with sharp weapons that protruded from their wheels and which broke up the columns of foot like dismembered particles of matter i doubt not if similar instruments were affixed to the cart of mrs flanagan that great confusion might be carried into the ranks of the enemy thereby this very day  its but little that the mare would go and the riglars firing at her grumbled betty from under her blanket when we got the plunder the time we drove them through the jarseys it was i had to back the baste up to the dead for the divil the foot would she move fornent the firing wid her eyes open roanoke and captain jack are good enough for the redcoats letting alone myself and the mare  a long roll of the drums from the hill occupied by the british announced that they were on the alert and a corresponding signal was immediately heard from the americans the bugle of the virginians struck up its martial tones and in a few moments both the hills the one held by the royal troops and the other by their enemies were alive with armed men day had begun to dawn and preparations were making by both parties to give and to receive the attack in numbers the americans had greatly the advantage but in discipline and equipment the superiority was entirely with their enemies the arrangements for the battle were brief and by the time the sun rose the militia moved forward  the ground did not admit of the movements of horse and the only duty that could be assigned to the dragoons was to watch the moment of victory and endeavor to improve the success to the utmost lawton soon got his warriors into the saddle and leaving them to the charge of hollister he rode himself along the line of foot who in varied dresses and imperfectly armed were formed in a shape that in some degree resembled a martial array a scornful smile lowered about the lip of the trooper as he guided roanoke with a skillful hand through the windings of their ranks and when the word was given to march he turned the flank of the regiment and followed close in the rear the americans had to descend into a little hollow and rise a hill on its opposite side to approach the enemy  the descent was made with tolerable steadiness until near the foot of the hill when the royal troops advanced in a beautiful line with their flanks protected by the formation of the ground the appearance of the british drew a fire from the militia which was given with good effect and for a moment staggered the regulars but they were rallied by their officers and threw in volley after volley with great steadiness for a short time the fire was warm and destructive until the english advanced with the bayonet this assault the militia had not sufficient discipline to withstand their line wavered then paused and finally broke into companies and fragments of companies keeping up at the same time a scattering and desultory fire  lawton witnessed these operations in silence nor did he open his mouth until the field was covered with parties of the flying americans then indeed he seemed stung with the disgrace thus heaped upon the arms of his country spurring roanoke along the side of the hill he called to the fugitives in all the strength of his powerful voice he pointed to the enemy and assured his countrymen that they had mistaken the way there was such a mixture of indifference and irony in his exhortations that a few paused in surprisemore joined them until roused by the example of the trooper and stimulated by their own spirit they demanded to be led against their foe once more  come on then my brave friends shouted the trooper turning his horses head towards the british line one flank of which was very near him come on and hold your fire until it will scorch their eyebrows  the men sprang forward and followed his example neither giving nor receiving a fire until they had come within a very short distance of the enemy an english sergeant who had been concealed by a rock enraged with the audacity of the officer who thus dared their arms stepped from behind his cover and leveled his musket  fire and you die cried lawton spurring his charger which leaped forward at the instant the action and the tone of his voice shook the nerves of the englishman who drew his trigger with an uncertain aim roanoke sprang with all his feet from the earth and plunging fell headlong and lifeless at the feet of his destroyer lawton kept his feet standing face to face with his enemy the latter presented his bayonet and made a desperate thrust at the troopers heart the steel of their weapons emitted sparks of fire and the bayonet flew fifty feet in the air at the next moment its owner lay a quivering corpse  come on shouted the trooper as a body of english appeared on the rock and threw in a close fire come on he repeated and brandished his saber fiercely then his gigantic form fell backward like a majestic pine yielding to the ax but still as he slowly fell he continued to wield his saber and once more the deep tones of his voice were heard uttering come on  the advancing americans paused aghast and turning they abandoned the field to the royal troops  it was neither the intention nor the policy of the english commander to pursue his success for he well knew that strong parties of the americans would soon arrive accordingly he only tarried to collect his wounded and forming in a square he commenced his retreat towards the shipping within twenty minutes of the fall of lawton the ground was deserted by both english and americans when the inhabitants of the country were called upon to enter the field they were necessarily attended by such surgical advisers as were furnished by the low state of the profession in the interior at that day dr sitgreaves entertained quite as profound a contempt for the medical attendants of the militia as the captain did of the troops themselves he wandered therefore around the field casting many a glance of disapprobation at the slight operations that came under his eye but when among the flying troops he found that his comrade and friend was nowhere to be seen he hastened back to the spot at which hollister was posted to inquire if the trooper had returned of course the answer was in the negative filled with a thousand uneasy conjectures the surgeon without regarding or indeed without at all reflecting upon any dangers that might lie in his way strode over the ground at an enormous rate to the point where he knew the final struggle had been once before the surgeon had rescued his friend from death in a similar situation and he felt a secret joy in his own conscious skill as he perceived betty flanagan seated on the ground holding in her lap the head of a man whose size and dress he knew could belong only to the trooper as he approached the spot the surgeon became alarmed at the aspect of the washerwoman her little black bonnet was thrown aside and her hair which was already streaked with gray hung around her face in disorder  john dear john said the doctor tenderly as he bent and laid his hand upon the senseless wrist of the trooper from which it recoiled with an intuitive knowledge of his fate john where are you hurtcan i help you  ye talk to the senseless clay said betty rocking her body and unconsciously playing with the raven ringlets of the troopers hair its no more will he hear and its but little will he mind yeer probes and yeer medcines och hone och honeand where will be the liberty now or who will there be to fight the battle or gain the day  john repeated the surgeon still unwilling to believe the evidence of his unerring senses dear john speak to me say what you will that you do but speak oh god he is dead would that i had died with him  there is but little use in living and fighting now said betty both him and the baste see there is the poor cratur and here is the master i fed the horse with my own hands the day and the last male that he ate was of my own cooking och hone och honethat captain jack should live to be killed by the riglars  john my dear john said the surgeon with convulsive sobs thy hour has come and many a more prudent man survives thee but none better nor braver o john thou wert to me a kind friend and very dear it is unphilosophical to grieve but for thee i must weep in bitterness of heart  the doctor buried his face in his hands and for several minutes sat yielding to an ungovernable burst of sorrow while the washerwoman gave vent to her grief in words moving her body in a kind of writhing and playing with different parts of her favorites dress with her fingers  and wholl there be to encourage the boys now she said o captain jack ye was the sowl of the troop and it was but little we knowed of the danger and ye fighting och he was no malymouthed that quarreled wid a widowed woman for the matter of a burn in the mate or the want of a breakfast taste a drop darling and it may be twill revive ye och and hell niver taste agin heres the doctor honey him ye used to blarney wid waping as if the poor sowl would die for ye och hes gone hes gone and the liberty is gone with him  a thundering sound of horses feet came rolling along the road which led near the place where lawton lay and directly the whole body of virginians appeared with dunwoodie at their head the news of the captains fate had reached him for the instant that he saw the body he halted the squadron and dismounting approached the spot the countenance of lawton was not in the least distorted but the angry frown which had lowered over his brow during the battle was fixed even in death his frame was composed and stretched as in sleep dunwoodie took hold of his hand and gazed a moment in silence his own dark eye kindled and the paleness which had overspread his features was succeeded by a spot of deep red in either cheek  with his own sword will i avenge him he cried endeavoring to take the weapon from the hand of lawton but the grasp resisted his utmost strength it shall be buried with him sitgreaves take care of our friend while i revenge his death  the major hastened back to his charger and led the way in pursuit of the enemy  while dunwoodie had been thus engaged the body of lawton lay in open view of the whole squadron he was a universal favorite and the sight inflamed the men to the utmost neither officers nor soldiers possessed that coolness which is necessary to insure success in military operations they spurred after their enemies burning for vengeance  the english were formed in a hollow square which contained their wounded who were far from numerous and were marching steadily across a very uneven country as the dragoons approached the horse charged in column and were led by dunwoodie who burning with revenge thought to ride through their ranks and scatter them at a blow but the enemy knew their own strength too well and standing firm they received the charge on the points of their bayonets the horses of the virginians recoiled and the rear rank of the foot throwing in a close fire the major with a few men fell the english continued their retreat the moment they were extricated from their assailants and dunwoodie who was severely but not dangerously wounded recalled his men from further attempts which must be fruitless  a sad duty remained to be fulfilled the dragoons retired slowly through the hills conveying their wounded commander and the body of lawton the latter they interred under the ramparts of one of the highland forts and the former they consigned to the tender care of his afflicted bride  many weeks were gone before the major was restored to sufficient strength to be removed during those weeks how often did he bless the moment that gave him a right to the services of his beautiful nurse she hung around his couch with fond attention administered with her own hands every prescription of the indefatigable sitgreaves and grew each hour in the affections and esteem of her husband an order from washington soon sent the troops into winter quarters and permission was given to dunwoodie to repair to his own plantation with the rank of lieutenant colonel in order to complete the restoration of his health captain singleton made one of the party and the whole family retired from the active scenes of the war to the ease and plenty of the majors own estate before leaving fishkill however letters were conveyed to them through an unknown hand acquainting them with henrys safety and good health and also that colonel wellmere had left the continent for his native island lowered in the estimation of every honest man in the royal army  it was a happy winter for dunwoodie and smiles once more began to play around the lovely mouth of frances     chapter xxxiv        midst furs and silks and jewels sheen      he stood in simple lincoln green      the center of the glittering ring      and snowdons knight is scotlands king                                            lady of the lake  the commencement of the following year was passed on the part of the americans in making great preparations in conjunction with their allies to bring the war to a close in the south greene and rawdon made a bloody campaign that was highly honorable to the troops of the latter but which by terminating entirely to the advantage of the former proved him to be the better general of the two  new york was the point that was threatened by the allied armies and washington by exciting a constant apprehension for the safety of that city prevented such reënforcements from being sent to cornwallis as would have enabled him to improve his success  at length as autumn approached every indication was given that the final moment had arrived  the french forces drew near to the royal lines passing through the neutral ground and threatened an attack in the direction of kings bridge while large bodies of americans were acting in concert by hovering around the british posts and drawing nigh in the jerseys they seemed to threaten the royal forces from that quarter also the preparations partook of the nature of both a siege and a storm but sir henry clinton in the possession of intercepted letters from washington rested within his lines and cautiously disregarded the solicitations of cornwallis for succor  it was at the close of a stormy day in the month of september that a large assemblage of officers was collected near the door of a building that was situated in the heart of the americans troops who held the jerseys the age the dress and the dignity of deportment of most of these warriors indicated them to be of high rank but to one in particular was paid a deference and obedience that announced him to be of the highest his dress was plain but it bore the usual military distinctions of command he was mounted on a noble animal of a deep bay and a group of young men in gayer attire evidently awaited his pleasure and did his bidding many a hat was lifted as its owner addressed this officer and when he spoke a profound attention exceeding the respect of mere professional etiquette was exhibited on every countenance at length the general raised his own hat and bowed gravely to all around him the salute was returned and the party dispersed leaving the officer without a single attendant except his body servants and one aiddecamp dismounting he stepped back a few paces and for a moment viewed the condition of his horse with the eye of one who well understood the animal and then casting a brief but expressive glance at his aid he retired into the building followed by that gentleman  on entering an apartment that was apparently fitted for his reception he took a seat and continued for a long time in a thoughtful attitude like one in the habit of communing much with himself during this silence the aiddecamp stood in expectation of his orders at length the general raised his eyes and spoke in those low placid tones that seemed natural to him  has the man whom i wished to see arrived sir  he waits the pleasure of your excellency  i will receive him here and alone if you please  the aid bowed and withdrew in a few minutes the door again opened and a figure gliding into the apartment stood modestly at a distance from the general without speaking his entrance was unheard by the officer who sat gazing at the fire still absorbed in his own meditations several minutes passed when he spoke to himself in an undertone  tomorrow we must raise the curtain and expose our plans may heaven prosper them  a slight movement made by the stranger caught his ear and he turned his head and saw that he was not alone he pointed silently to the fire toward which the figure advanced although the multitude of his garments which seemed more calculated for disguise than comfort rendered its warmth unnecessary a second mild and courteous gesture motioned to a vacant chair but the stranger refused it with a modest acknowledgment another pause followed and continued for some time at length the officer arose and opening a desk that was laid upon the table near which he sat took from it a small but apparently heavy bag  harvey birch he said turning to the stranger the time has arrived when our connection must cease henceforth and forever we must be strangers  the peddler dropped the folds of the greatcoat that concealed his features and gazed for a moment earnestly at the face of the speaker then dropping his head upon his bosom he said meekly  if it be your excellencys pleasure  it is necessary since i have filled the station which i now hold it has become my duty to know many men who like yourself have been my instruments in procuring intelligence you have i trusted more than all i early saw in you a regard to truth and principle that i am pleased to say has never deceived meyou alone know my secret agents in the city and on your fidelity depend not only their fortunes but their lives  he paused as if to reflect in order that full justice might be done to the peddler and then continued  i believe you are one of the very few that i have employed who have acted faithfully to our cause and while you have passed as a spy of the enemy have never given intelligence that you were not permitted to divulge to me and to me only of all the world you seem to have acted with a strong attachment to the liberties of america  during this address harvey gradually raised his head from his bosom until it reached the highest point of elevation a faint tinge gathered in his cheeks and as the officer concluded it was diffused over his whole countenance in a deep glow while he stood proudly swelling with his emotions but with eyes that sought the feet of the speaker  it is now my duty to pay you for these services hitherto you have postponed receiving your reward and the debt has become a heavy onei wish not to undervalue your dangers here are a hundred doubloons remember the poverty of our country and attribute to it the smallness of your pay  the peddler raised his eyes to the countenance of the speaker but as the other held forth the money he moved back as if refusing the bag  it is not much for your services and risks i acknowledge continued the general but it is all that i have to offer hereafter it may be in my power to increase it  does your excellency think that i have exposed my life and blasted my character for money  if not for money what then  what has brought your excellency into the field for what do you daily and hourly expose your precious life to battle and the halter what is there about me to mourn when such men as you risk their all for our country no no nonot a dollar of your gold will i touch poor america has need of it all  the bag dropped from the hand of the officer and fell at the feet of the peddler where it lay neglected during the remainder of the interview the officer looked steadily at the face of his companion and continued  there are many motives which might govern me that to you are unknown our situations are different i am known as the leader of armiesbut you must descend into the grave with the reputation of a foe to your native land remember that the veil which conceals your true character cannot be raised in yearsperhaps never  birch again lowered his face but there was no yielding of the soul in the movement  you will soon be old the prime of your days is already past what have you to subsist on  these said the peddler stretching forth his hands that were already embrowned with toil  but those may fail you take enough to secure a support to your age remember your risks and cares i have told you that the characters of men who are much esteemed in life depend on your secrecy what pledge can i give them of your fidelity  tell them said birch advancing and unconsciously resting one foot on the bag tell them that i would not take the gold  the composed features of the officer relaxed into a smile of benevolence and he grasped the hand of the peddler firmly  now indeed i know you and although the same reasons which have hitherto compelled me to expose your valuable life will still exist and prevent my openly asserting your character in private i can always be your friend fail not to apply to me when in want or suffering and so long as god giveth to me so long will i freely share with a man who feels so nobly and acts so well if sickness or want should ever assail you and peace once more smile upon our efforts seek the gate of him whom you have so often met as harper and he will not blush to acknowledge you  it is little that i need in this life said harvey so long as god gives me health and honest industry i can never want in this country but to know that your excellency is my friend is a blessing that i prize more than all the gold of englands treasury  the officer stood for a few moments in the attitude of intense thought he then drew to him the desk and wrote a few lines on a piece of paper and gave it to the peddler  that providence destines this country to some great and glorious fate i must believe while i witness the patriotism that pervades the bosoms of her lowest citizens he said it must be dreadful to a mind like yours to descend into the grave branded as a foe to liberty but you already know the lives that would be sacrificed should your real character be revealed it is impossible to do you justice now but i fearlessly intrust you with this certificate should we never meet again it may be serviceable to your children  children exclaimed the peddler can i give to a family the infamy of my name  the officer gazed at the strong emotion he exhibited with pain and he made a slight movement towards the gold but it was arrested by the expression of his companions face harvey saw the intention and shook his head as he continued more mildly  it is indeed a treasure that your excellency gives me it is safe too there are men living who could say that my life was nothing to me compared to your secrets the paper that i told you was lost i swallowed when taken last by the virginians it was the only time i ever deceived your excellency and it shall be the last yes this is indeed a treasure to me perhaps he continued with a melancholy smile it may be known after my death who was my friend but if it should not there are none to grieve for me  remember said the officer with strong emotion that in me you will always have a secret friend but openly i cannot know you  i know it i know it said birch i knew it when i took the service tis probably the last time that i shall ever see your excellency may god pour down his choicest blessings on your head he paused and moved towards the door the officer followed him with eyes that expressed deep interest once more the peddler turned and seemed to gaze on the placid but commanding features of the general with regret and reverence and bowing low he withdrew  the armies of america and france were led by their illustrious commander against the enemy under cornwallis and terminated a campaign in triumph that had commenced in difficulties great britain soon after became disgusted with the war and the states independence was acknowledged  as years rolled by it became a subject of pride among the different actors in the war and their descendants to boast of their efforts in the cause which had confessedly heaped so many blessings upon their country but the name of harvey birch died away among the multitude of agents who were thought to have labored in secret against the rights of their countrymen his image however was often present to the mind of the powerful chief who alone knew his true character and several times did he cause secret inquiries to be made into the others fate one of which only resulted in any success by this he learned that a peddler of a different name but similar appearance was toiling through the new settlements that were springing up in every direction and that he was struggling with the advance of years and apparent poverty death prevented further inquiries on the part of the officer and a long period passed before he was again heard of     chapter xxxv        some village hampden that with dauntless breast      the village tyrant of his fields withstood      some mute inglorious milton here may rest      some cromwell guiltless of his countrys blood                                                    gray  it was thirtythree years after the interview which we have just related that an american army was once more arrayed against the troops of england but the scene was transferred from hudsons banks to those of the niagara  the body of washington had long lain moldering in the tomb but as time was fast obliterating the slight impressions of political enmity or personal envy his name was hourly receiving new luster and his worth and integrity each moment became more visible not only to his countrymen but to the world he was already the acknowledged hero of an age of reason and truth and many a young heart amongst those who formed the pride of our army in 1814 was glowing with the recollection of the one great name of america and inwardly beating with the sanguine expectation of emulating in some degree its renown in no one were these virtuous hopes more vivid than in the bosom of a young officer who stood on the table rock contemplating the great cataract on the evening of the 25th of july of that bloody year the person of this youth was tall and finely molded indicating a just proportion between strength and activity his deep black eyes were of a searching and dazzling brightness at times as they gazed upon the flood of waters that rushed tumultuously at his feet there was a stern and daring look that flashed from them which denoted the ardor of an enthusiast but this proud expression was softened by the lines of a mouth around which there played a suppressed archness that partook of feminine beauty his hair shone in the setting sun like ringlets of gold as the air from the falls gently moved the rich curls from a forehead whose whiteness showed that exposure and heat alone had given their darker hue to a face glowing with health there was another officer standing by the side of this favored youth and both seemed by the interest they betrayed to be gazing for the first time at the wonder of the western world a profound silence was observed by each until the companion of the officer that we have described suddenly started and pointing eagerly with his sword into the abyss beneath exclaimed  see wharton there is a man crossing in the very eddies of the cataract and in a skiff no bigger than an eggshell  he has a knapsackit is probably a soldier returned the other let us meet him at the ladder mason and learn his tidings  some time was expended in reaching the spot where the adventurer was intercepted contrary to the expectations of the young soldiers he proved to be a man far advanced in life and evidently no follower of the camp his years might be seventy and they were indicated more by the thin hairs of silver that lay scattered over his wrinkled brow than by any apparent failure of his system his frame was meager and bent but it was the attitude of habit for his sinews were strung with the toil of half a century his dress was mean and manifested the economy of its owner by the number and nature of its repairs on his back was a scantily furnished pack that had led to the mistake in his profession a few words of salutation and on the part of the young men of surprise that one so aged should venture so near the whirlpools of the cataract were exchanged when the old man inquired with a voice that began to manifest the tremor of age the news from the contending armies  we whipped the redcoats here the other day among the grass on the chippewa plains said the one who was called mason since when we have been playing hide and go seek with the ships but we are now marching back from where we started shaking our heads and as surly as the devil  perhaps you have a son among the soldiers said his companion with a milder demeanor and an air of kindness if so tell me his name and regiment and i will take you to him  the old man shook his head and passing his hand over his silver locks with an air of meek resignation he answered  no i am alone in the world  you should have added captain dunwoodie cried his careless comrade if you could find either for nearly half our army has marched down the road and may be by this time under the walls of fort george for anything that we know to the contrary  the old man stopped suddenly and looked earnestly from one of his companions to the other the action being observed by the soldiers they paused also  did i hear right the stranger uttered raising his hand to screen his eyes from the rays of the setting sun what did he call you my name is wharton dunwoodie replied the youth smiling the stranger motioned silently for him to remove his hat which the youth did accordingly and his fair hair blew aside like curls of silk and opened the whole of his ingenuous countenance to the inspection of the other tis like our native land exclaimed the old man with vehemence improving with time god has blessed both why do you stare thus lieutenant mason cried captain dunwoodie laughing a little you show more astonishment than when you saw the falls oh the fallsthey are a thing to be looked at on a moonshiny night by your aunt sarah and that gay old bachelor colonel singleton but a fellow like myself never shows surprise unless it may be at such a touch as this the extraordinary vehemence of the strangers manner had passed away as suddenly as it was exhibited but he listened to this speech with deep interest while dunwoodie replied a little gravelycome come tom no jokes about my good aunt i beg she is kindness itself and i have heard it whispered that her youth was not altogether happy why as to rumor said mason there goes one in accomac that colonel singleton offers himself to her regularly every valentines day and there are some who add that your old greataunt helps his suit aunt jeanette said dunwoodie laughing dear good soul she thinks but little of marriage in any shape i believe since the death of dr sitgreaves there were some whispers of a courtship between them formerly but it ended in nothing but civilities and i suspect that the whole story arises from the intimacy of colonel singleton and my father you know they were comrades in the horse as indeed was your own father  i know all that of course but you must not tell me that the particular prim bachelor goes so often to general dunwoodies plantation merely for the sake of talking old soldier with your father the last time i was there that yellow sharpnosed housekeeper of your mothers took me into the pantry and said that the colonel was no despisable match as she called it and how the sale of his plantation in georgia had brought himoh lord i dont know how much  quite likely returned the captain katy haynes is no bad calculator  they had stopped during this conversation in uncertainty whether their new companion was to be left or not  the old man listened to each word as it was uttered with the most intense interest but towards the conclusion of the dialogue the earnest attention of his countenance changed to a kind of inward smile he shook his head and passing his hands over his forehead seemed to be thinking of other times mason paid but little attention to the expression of his features and continued  to me she is selfishness embodied  her selfishness does but little harm returned dunwoodie one of her greatest difficulties is her aversion to the blacks she says that she never saw but one she liked  and who was he  his name was caesar he was a house servant of my late grandfather wharton you dont remember him i believe he died the same year with his master while we were children katy yearly sings his requiem and upon my word i believe he deserved it i have heard something of his helping my english uncle as we call general wharton in some difficulty that occurred in the old war my mother always speaks of him with great affection both caesar and katy came to virginia with my mother when she married my mother was  an angel interrupted the old man in a voice that startled the young soldiers by its abruptness and energy  did you know her cried the son with a glow of pleasure on his cheek  the reply of the stranger was interrupted by sudden and heavy explosions of artillery which were immediately followed by continued volleys of small arms and in a few minutes the air was filled with the tumult of a warm and wellcontested battle  the two soldiers hastened with precipitation towards the camp accompanied by their new acquaintance the excitement and anxiety created by the approaching fight prevented a continuance of the conversation and the three held their way to the army making occasional conjectures on the cause of the fire and the probability of a general engagement during their short and hurried walk captain dunwoodie however threw several friendly glances at the old man who moved over the ground with astonishing energy for his years for the heart of the youth was warmed by an eulogium on a mother that he adored in a short time they joined the regiment to which the officers belonged when the captain squeezing the strangers hand earnestly begged that he would make inquiries after him on the following morning and that he might see him in his own tent here they separated  everything in the american camp announced an approaching struggle at a distance of a few miles the sound of cannon and musketry was heard above the roar of the cataract the troops were soon in motion and a movement made to support the division of the army which was already engaged night had set in before the reserve and irregulars reached the foot of lundys lane a road that diverged from the river and crossed a conical eminence at no great distance from the niagara highway the summit of this hill was crowned with the cannon of the british and in the flat beneath was the remnant of scotts gallant brigade which for a long time had held an unequal contest with distinguished bravery a new line was interposed and one column of the americans directed to charge up the hill parallel to the road this column took the english in flank and bayoneting their artillerists gained possession of the cannon they were immediately joined by their comrades and the enemy was swept from the hill but large reenforcements were joining the english general momentarily and their troops were too brave to rest easy under the defeat repeated and bloody charges were made to recover the guns but in all they were repulsed with slaughter during the last of these struggles the ardor of the youthful captain whom we have mentioned urged him to lead his men some distance in advance to scatter a daring party of the enemy he succeeded but in returning to the line missed his lieutenant from the station that he ought to have occupied soon after this repulse which was the last orders were given to the shattered troops to return to the camp the british were nowhere to be seen and preparations were made to take in such of the wounded as could be moved at this moment wharton dunwoodie impelled by affection for his friend seized a lighted fusee and taking two of his men went himself in quest of his body where he was supposed to have fallen mason was found on the side of the hill seated with great composure but unable to walk from a fractured leg dunwoodie saw and flew to the side of his comrade saying  ah dear tom i knew i should find you the nearest man to the enemy  softly softly handle me tenderly replied the lieutenant no there is a brave fellow still nearer than myself and who he can be i know not he rushed out of our smoke near my platoon to make a prisoner or some such thing but poor fellow he never came back there he lies just over the hillock i have spoken to him several times but i fancy he is past answering  dunwoodie went to the spot and to his astonishment beheld the aged stranger  it is the old man who knew my mother cried the youth for her sake he shall have honorable burial lift him and let him be carried in his bones shall rest on native soil  the men approached to obey he was lying on his back with his face exposed to the glaring light of the fusee his eyes were closed as if in slumber his lips sunken with years were slightly moved from their natural position but it seemed more like a smile than a convulsion which had caused the change a soldiers musket lay near him his hands were pressed upon his breast and one of them contained a substance that glittered like silver dunwoodie stooped and removing the limbs perceived the place where the bullet had found a passage to his heart the subject of his last care was a tin box through which the fatal lead had gone and the dying moments of the old man must have passed in drawing it from his bosom dunwoodie opened it and found a paper in which to his astonishment he read the following  circumstances of political importance which involve the lives and fortunes of many have hitherto kept secret what this paper now reveals harvey birch has for years been a faithful and unrequited servant of his country though man does not may god reward him for his conduct  geo washington  it was the spy of the neutral ground who died as he had lived devoted to his country and a martyr to her liberties
