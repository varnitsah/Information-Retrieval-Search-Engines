77504092	the chateau of prince polignac  by anthony trollope     few englishmen or englishwomen are intimately acquainted with the little town of le puy  it is the capital of the old province of le velay which also is now but little known even to french ears for it is in these days called by the imperial name of the department of the haute loire  it is to the southeast of auvergne and is nearly in the centre of the southern half of france  but few towns merely as towns can be better worth visiting  in the first place the volcanic formation of the ground on which it stands is not only singular in the extreme so as to be interesting to the geologist but it is so picturesque as to be equally gratifying to the general tourist  within a narrow valley there stand several rocks rising up from the ground with absolute abruptness  round two of these the town clusters and a third stands but a mile distant forming the centre of a faubourg or suburb  these rocks appear to be and i believe are the harder particles of volcanic matter which have not been carried away through successive ages by the joint agency of water and air  when the tide of lava ran down between the hills the surface left was no doubt on a level with the heads of these rocks but here and there the deposit became harder than elsewhere and these harder points have remained lifting up their steep heads in a line through the valley  the highest of these is called the rocher de corneille  round this and up its steep sides the town stands  on its highest summit there was an old castle and there now is or will be before these pages are printed a colossal figure in bronze of the virgin mary made from the cannon taken at sebastopol  halfway down the hill the cathedral is built a singularly gloomy edificeromanesque as it is called in its style but extremely similar in its mode of architecture to what we know of byzantine structures  but there has been no surface on the rock side large enough to form a resting place for the church which has therefore been built out on huge supporting piles which form a porch below the west front so that the approach is by numerous steps laid along the side of the wall below the church forming a wondrous flight of stairs  let all men who may find themselves stopping at le puy visit the top of these stairs at the time of the setting sun and look down from thence through the framework of the porch on the town beneath and at the hillside beyond  behind the church is the seminary of the priests with its beautiful walks stretching round the rocher de corneille and overlooking the town and valley below  next to this rock and within a quarter of a mile of it is the second peak called the rock of the needle  it rises narrow sharp and abrupt from the valley allowing of no buildings on its sides but on its very point has been erected a church sacred to st michael that lover of rock summits accessible by stairs cut from the stone  this perhapsthis rock i meanis the most wonderful of the wonders which nature has formed at la puy  above this at a miles distance is the rock of espailly formed in the same way and almost equally precipitous  on its summit is a castle having its own legend and professing to have been the residence of charles vii when little of france belonged to its kings but the provinces of berry auvergne and le velay  some three miles farther up there is another volcanic rock larger indeed but equally sudden in its springequally remarkable as rising abruptly from the valleyon which stands the castle and old family residence of the house of polignac  it was lost by them at the revolution but was repurchased by the minister of charles x and is still the property of the head of the race  le puy itself is a small moderate pleasant french town in which the language of the people has not the pure parisian aroma nor is the glory of the boulevards of the capital emulated in its streets these are crooked narrow steep and intricate forming here and there excellent sketches for a lover of street picturesque beauty but hurtful to the feet with their small roundtopped paving stones and not always as clean as pedestrian ladies might desire  and now i would ask my readers to join me at the morning table dhote at the hotel des ambassadeurs  it will of course be understood that this does not mean a breakfast in the ordinary fashion of england consisting of tea or coffee bread and butter and perhaps a boiled egg  it comprises all the requisites for a composite dinner excepting soup and as one gets farther south in france this meal is called dinner  it is however eaten without any prejudice to another similar and somewhat longer meal at six or seven oclock which when the above name is taken up by the earlier enterprise is styled supper  the dejeuner or dinner at the hotel des ambassadeurs on the morning in question though very elaborate was not a very gay affair  there were some fourteen persons present of whom half were residents in the town men employed in some official capacity who found this to be the cheapest the most luxurious and to them the most comfortable mode of living  they clustered together at the head of the table and as they were customary guests at the house they talked their little talk togetherit was very littleand made the most of the good things before them  then there were two or three commisvoyageurs a chance traveller or two and an english lady with a young daughter  the english lady sat next to one of the accustomed guests but he unlike the others held converse with her rather than with them  our story at present has reference only to that lady and to that gentleman  place aux dames  we will speak first of the lady whose name was mrs thompson  she was shall i say a young woman of about thirty six  in so saying i am perhaps creating a prejudice against her in the minds of some readers as they will not unnaturally suppose her after such an announcement to be in truth over forty  any such prejudice will be unjust  i would have it believed that thirtysix was the outside not the inside of her age  she was goodlooking ladylike and considering that she was an englishwoman fairly well dressed  she was inclined to be rather full in her person but perhaps not more so than is becoming to ladies at her time of life  she had rings on her fingers and a brooch on her bosom which were of some value and on the back of her head she wore a jaunty small lace cap which seemed to tell in conjunction with her other appointments that her circumstances were comfortable  the little girl who sat next to her was the youngest of her two daughters and might be about thirteen years of age  her name was matilda but infantine circumstances had invested her with the nickname of mimmy by which her mother always called her  a nice pretty playful little girl was mimmy thompson wearing two long tails of plaited hair hanging behind her head and inclined occasionally to be rather loud in her sport  mrs thompson had another and an elder daughter now some fifteen years old who was at school in le puy and it was with reference to her tuition that mrs thompson had taken up a temporary residence at the hotel des ambassadeurs in that town  lilian thompson was occasionally invited down to dine or breakfast at the inn and was visited daily at her school by her mother  when im sure that shell do i shall leave her there and go back to england mrs thompson had said not in the purest french to the neighbour who always sat next to her at the table dhote the gentleman namely to whom we have above alluded  but still she had remained at le puy a month and did not go a circumstance which was considered singular but by no means unpleasant both by the innkeeper and by the gentleman in question  the facts as regarded mrs thompson were as follows she was the widow of a gentleman who had served for many years in the civil service of the east indies and who on dying had left her a comfortable income ofit matters not how many pounds but constituting quite a sufficiency to enable her to live at her ease and educate her daughters  her children had been sent home to england before her husbands death and after that event she had followed them but there though she was possessed of moderate wealth she had no friends and few acquaintances and after a little while she had found life to be rather dull  her customs were not those of england nor were her propensities english therefore she had gone abroad and having received some recommendation of this school at le puy had made her way thither  as it appeared to her that she really enjoyed more consideration at le puy than had been accorded to her either at torquay or leamington there she remained from day to day  the total payment required at the hotel des ambassadeurs was but six francs daily for herself and three and a half for her little girl and where else could she live with a better junction of economy and comfort  and then the gentleman who always sat next to her was so exceedingly civil  the gentlemans name was m lacordaire  so much she knew and had learned to call him by his name very frequently  mimmy too was quite intimate with m lacordaire but nothing more than his name was known of him  but m lacordaire carried a general letter of recommendation in his face manner gait dress and tone of voice in all these respects there was nothing left to be desired and in addition to this he was decorated and wore the little red ribbon of the legion of honour ingeniously twisted into the shape of a small flower  m lacordaire might be senior in age to mrs thompson by about ten years nor had he about him any of the airs or graces of a wouldbe young man  his hair which he wore very short was grizzled as was also the small pretence of a whisker which came down about as far as the middle of his ear but the tuft on his chin was still brown without a gray hair  his eyes were bright and tender his voice was low and soft his hands were very white his clothes were always new and well fitting and a betterbrushed hat could not be seen out of paris nor perhaps in it  now during the weeks which mrs thompson had passed at la puy the acquaintance which she had formed with m lacordaire had progressed beyond the prolonged meals in the salle a manger  he had occasionally sat beside her evening table as she took her english cup of tea in her own room her bed being duly screened off in its distant niche by becoming curtains and then he had occasionally walked beside her as he civilly escorted her to the lions of the place and he had once accompanied her sitting on the back seat of a french voiture when she had gone forth to see something of the surrounding country  on all such occasions she had been accompanied by one of her daughters and the world of le puy had had nothing material to say against her  but still the world of le puy had whispered a little suggesting that m lacordaire knew very well what he was about  but might not mrs thompson also know as well what she was about  at any rate everything had gone on very pleasantly since the acquaintance had been made  and now so much having been explained we will go back to the elaborate breakfast at the hotel des ambassadeurs  mrs thompson holding mimmy by the hand walked into the room some few minutes after the last bell had been rung and took the place which was now hers by custom  the gentlemen who constantly frequented the house all bowed to her but m lacordaire rose from his seat and offered her his hand  and how is mees meemy this morning said he for twas thus he always pronounced her name  miss mimmy answering for herself declared that she was very well and suggested that m lacordaire should give her a fig from off a dish that was placed immediately before him on the table  this m lacordaire did presenting it very elegantly between his two fingers and making a little bow to the little lady as he did so  fie mimmy said her mother why do you ask for the things before the waiter brings them round  but mamma said mimmy speaking english m lacordaire always gives me a fig every morning  m lacordaire always spoils you i think answered mrs thompson in french  and then they went thoroughly to work at their breakfast  during the whole meal m lacordaire attended assiduously to his neighbour and did so without any evil result except that one frenchman with a black moustache at the head of the table trod on the toe of another frenchman with another black moustache winking as he made the signjust as m lacordaire having selected a bunch of grapes put it on mrs thompsons plate with infinite grace  but who among us all is free from such impertinences as these  but madame really must see the chateau of prince polignac before she leaves le puy said m lacordaire  the chateau of who asked mimmy to whose young ears the french words were already becoming familiar  prince polignac my dear  well i really dont know m lacordairei have seen a great deal of the place already and i shall be going now very soon probably in a day or two said mrs thompson  but madame must positively see the chateau said m lacordaire very impressively and then after a pause he added if madame will have the complaisance to commission me to procure a carriage for this afternoon and will allow me the honour to be her guide i shall consider myself one of the most fortunate of men  oh yes mamma do go said mimmy clapping her hands  and it is thursday and lilian can go with us  be quiet mimmy do  thank you no m lacordaire  i could not go today but i am extremely obliged by your politeness  m lacordaire still pressed the matter and mrs thompson still declined till it was time to rise from the table  she then declared that she did not think it possible that she should visit the chateau before she left le puy but that she would give him an answer at dinner  the most tedious time in the day to mrs thompson were the two hours after breakfast  at one oclock she daily went to the school taking mimmy who for an hour or two shared her sisters lessons this and her little excursions about the place and her shopping managed to make away with her afternoon  then in the evening she generally saw something of m lacordaire  but those two hours after breakfast were hard of killing  on this occasion when she gained her own room she as usual placed mimmy on the sofa with a needle  her custom then was to take up a novel but on this morning she sat herself down in her armchair and resting her head upon her hand and elbow began to turn over certain circumstances in her mind  mamma said mimmy why wont you go with m lacordaire to that place belonging to the prince  princepolly something wasnt it  mind your work my dear said mrs thompson  but i do so wish youd go mamma  what was the princes name  polignac  mamma aint princes very great people  yes my dear sometimes  is prince pollynac like our prince alfred  no my dear not at all  at least i suppose not  is his mother a queen  no my dear  then his father must be a king  no my dear  it is quite a different thing here  here in france they have a great many princes  well at any rate i should like to see a princes chateau so i do hope youll go  and then there was a pause  mamma could it come to pass here in france that m lacordaire should ever be a prince  m lacordaire a prince  no dont talk such nonsense but mind your work  isnt m lacordaire a very nice man  aint you very fond of him  to this question mrs thompson made no answer  mamma continued mimmy after a moments pause wont you tell me whether you are fond of m lacordaire  im quite sure of this that hes very fond of you  what makes you think that asked mrs thompson who could not bring herself to refrain from the question  because he looks at you in that way mamma and squeezes your hand  nonsense child said mrs thompson hold your tongue  i dont know what can have put such stuff into your head  but he does mamma said mimmy who rarely allowed her mother to put her down  mrs thompson made no further answer but again sat with her head resting on her hand  she also if the truth must be told was thinking of m lacordaire and his fondness for herself  he had squeezed her hand and he had looked into her face  however much it may have been nonsense on mimmys part to talk of such things they had not the less absolutely occurred  was it really the fact that m lacordaire was in love with her  and if so what return should she or could she make to such a passion  he had looked at her yesterday and squeezed her hand to day might it not be probable that he would advance a step further tomorrow  if so what answer would she be prepared to make to him  she did not thinkso she said to herselfthat she had any particular objection to marrying again  thompson had been dead now for four years and neither his friends nor her friends nor the world could say she was wrong on that score  and as to marrying a frenchman she could not say she felt within herself any absolute repugnance to doing that  of her own country speaking of england as such she in truth knew but littleand perhaps cared less she had gone to india almost as a child and england had not been specially kind to her on her return  she had found it dull and cold stiff and almost illnatured  people there had not smiled on her and been civil as m lacordaire had done  as far as england and englishmen were considered she saw no reason why she should not marry m lacordaire  and then as regarded the man could she in her heart say that she was prepared to love honour and obey m lacordaire  she certainly knew no reason why she should not do so  she did not know much of him she said to herself at first but she knew as much she said afterwards as she had known personally of mr thompson before their marriage  she had known to be sure what was mr thompsons profession and what his income or if not some one else had known for her  as to both these points she was quite in the dark as regarded m lacordaire  personally she certainly did like him as she said to herself more than once  there was a courtesy and softness about him which were very gratifying to her and then his appearance was so much in his favour  he was not very young she acknowledged but neither was she young herself  it was quite evident that he was fond of her children and that he would be a kind and affectionate father to them  indeed there was kindness in all that he did  should she marry againand she put it to herself quite hypotheticallyshe would look for no romance in such a second marriage  she would be content to sit down in a quiet home to the tame dull realities of life satisfied with the companionship of a man who would be kind and gentle to her and whom she could respect and esteem  where could she find a companion with whom this could be more safely anticipated than with m lacordaire  and so she argued the question within her own breast in a manner not unfriendly to that gentleman  that there was as yet one great hindrance she at once saw but then that might be remedied by a word  she did not know what was his income or his profession  the chambermaid whom she had interrogated had told her that he was a marchand  to merchants generally she felt that she had no objection  the barings and the rothschilds were merchants as was also that wonderful man at bombay sir hommajee bommajee who was worth she did no know how many thousand lacs of rupees  that it would behove her on her own account and that of her daughters to take care of her own little fortune in contracting any such connection that she felt strongly  she would never so commit herself as to put security in that respect out of her power  but then she did not think that m lacordaire would ever ask her to do so at any rate she was determined on this that there should never be any doubt on that matter and as she firmly resolved on this she again took up her book and for a minute or two made an attempt to read  mamma said mummy will m lacordaire go up to the school to see lilian when you go away from this  indeed i cannot say my dear  if lilian is a good girl perhaps he may do so now and then  and will he write to you and tell you how she is  lilian can write for herself can she not  oh yes i suppose she can but i hope m lacordaire will write too we shall come back here some day shant we mamma  i cannot say my dear  i do so hope we shall see m lacordaire again  do you know what i was thinking mamma  little girls like you ought not to think said mrs thompson walking slowly out of the room to the top of the stairs and back again for she had felt the necessity of preventing mimmy from disclosing any more of her thoughts  and now my dear get yourself ready and we will go up to the school  mrs thompson always dressed herself with care though not in especially fine clothes before she went down to dinner at the table dhote but on this occasion she was more than usually particular she hardly explained to herself why she did this but nevertheless as she stood before the glass she did in a certain manner feel that the circumstances of her future life might perhaps depend on what might be said and done that evening  she had not absolutely decided whether or no she would go to the princes chateau but if she did go   well if she did what then  she had sense enough as she assured herself more than once to regulate her own conduct with propriety in any such emergency  during the dinner m lacordaire conversed in his usual manner but said nothing whatever about the visit to polignac  he was very kind to mimmy and very courteous to her mother but did not appear to be at all more particular than usual  indeed it might be a question whether he was not less so  as she had entered the room mrs thompson had said to herself that perhaps after all it would be better that there should be nothing more thought about it but before the four of five courses were over she was beginning to feel a little disappointed  and now the fruit was on the table after the consumption of which it was her practice to retire  it was certainly open to her to ask m lacordaire to take tea with her that evening as she had done on former occasions but she felt that she must not do this now considering the immediate circumstances of the case  if any further steps were to be taken they must be taken by him and not by her or else by mimmy who just as her mother was slowly consuming her last grapes ran round to the back of m lacordaires chair and whispered something into his ear  it may be presumed that mrs thompson did not see the intention of the movement in time to arrest it for she did nothing till the whispering had been whispered and then she rebuked the child bade her not to be troublesome and with more than usual austerity in her voice desired her to get herself ready to go up stairs to their chamber  as she spoke she herself rose from her chair and made her final little bow to the table and her other final little bow and smile to m lacordaire but this was certain to all who saw it that the smile was not as gracious as usual  as she walked forth m lacordaire rose from his chairsuch being his constant practice when she left the table but on this occasion he accompanied her to the door  and has madame decided he asked whether she will permit me to accompany her to the chateau  well i really dont know said mrs thompson  mees meemy continued m lacordaire is very anxious to see the rock and i may perhaps hope that mees lilian would be pleased with such a little excursion  as for myself and then m lacordaire put his hand upon his heart in a manner that seemed to speak more plainly than he had ever spoken  well if the children would really like it andas you are so very kind said mrs thompson and so the matter was conceded  tomorrow afternoon suggested m lacordaire  but mrs thompson fixed on saturday thereby showing that she herself was in no hurry for the expedition  oh i am so glad said mimmy when they had reentered their own room  mamma do let me tell lilian myself when i go up to the school tomorrow  but mamma was in no humour to say much to her child on this subject at the present moment  she threw herself back on her sofa in perfect silence and began to reflect whether she would like to sign her name in future as fanny lacordaire instead of fanny thompson it certainly seemed as though things were verging towards such a necessity  a marchand  but a marchand of what  she had an instinctive feeling that the people in the hotel were talking about her and m lacordaire and was therefore more than ever averse to asking any one a question  as she went up to the school the next afternoon she walked through more of the streets of le puy than was necessary and in every street she looked at the names which she saw over the doors of the more respectable houses of business  but she looked in vain  it might be that m lacordaire was a marchand of so specially high a quality as to be under no necessity to put up his name at all  sir hommajee bommajees name did not appear over any door in bombayat least she thought not  and then came the saturday morning  we shall be ready at two she said as she left the breakfasttable and perhaps you would not mind calling for lilian on the way  m lacordaire would be delighted to call anywhere for anybody on behalf of mrs thompson and then as he got to the door of the salon he offered her his hand  he did so with so much french courtesy that she could not refuse it and then she felt that his purpose was more tender than ever it had been  and why not if this was the destiny which fate had prepared for her  mrs thompson would rather have got into the carriage at any other spot in le puy than at that at which she was forced to do sothe chief entrance namely of the hotel des ambassadeurs  and what made it worse was this that an appearance of a special fate was given to the occasion  m lacordaire was dressed in more than his sunday best  he had on new yellow kid gloves  his coat if not new was newer than any mrs thompson had yet observed and was lined with silk up to the very collar  he had on patent leather boots which glittered as mrs thompson thought much too conspicuously  and as for his hat it was quite evident that it was fresh that morning from the makers block  in this costume with his hat in his hand he stood under the great gateway of the hotel ready to hand mrs thompson into the carriage this would have been nothing if the landlord and landlady had not been there also as well as the mancook and the four waiters and the fille de chambre  two or three other pair of eyes mrs thompson also saw as she glanced round and then mimmy walked across the yard in her best clothes with a feteday air about her for which her mother would have liked to have whipped her  but what did it matter  if it was written in the book that she should become madame lacordaire of course the world would know that there must have been some preparatory lovemaking  let them have their laugh a good husband would not be dearly purchased at so trifling an expense  and so they sallied forth with already half the ceremony of a wedding  mimmy seated herself opposite to her mother and m lacordaire also sat with his back to the horses leaving the second place of honour for lilian  pray make yourself comfortable m lacordaire and dont mind her said mrs thompson  but he was firm in his purpose of civility perhaps making up his mind that when he should in truth stand in the place of papa to the young lady then would be his time for having the back seat in the carnage  lilian also in her best frock came down the schoolsteps and three of the school teachers came with her  it would have added to mrs thompsons happiness at that moment if m lacordaire would have kept his polished boots out of sight and put his yellow gloves into his pocket  and then they started  the road from le puy to polignac is nearly all up hill and a very steep hill it is so that there was plenty of time for conversation  but the girls had it nearly all to themselves  mimmy thought that she had never found m lacordaire so stupid and lilian told her sister on the first safe opportunity that occurred that it seemed very much as though they were all going to church  and do any of the polignac people ever live at this place asked mrs thompson by way of making conversation in answer to which m lacordaire informed madame that the place was at present only a ruin and then there was again silence till they found themselves under the rock and were informed by the driver that the rest of the ascent must be made on foot  the rock now stood abrupt and precipitous above their heads  it was larger in its circumference and with much larger space on its summit than those other volcanic rocks in and close to the town but then at the same time it was higher from the ground and quite as inaccessible except by the single path which led up to the chateau  m lacordaire with conspicuous gallantry first assisted mrs thompson from the carriage and then handed down the two young ladies  no lady could have been so difficult to please as to complain of him and yet mrs thompson thought that he was not as agreeable as usual  those horrid boots and those horrid gloves gave him such an air of holiday finery that neither could he be at his ease wearing them nor could she in seeing them worn  they were soon taken in hand by the poor woman whose privilege it was to show the ruins  for a little distance they walked up the path in single file not that it was too narrow to accommodate two but m lacordaires courage had not yet been screwed to a point which admitted of his offering his arm to the widow  for in france it must be remembered that this means more than it does in some other countries  mrs thompson felt that all this was silly and useless  if they were not to be dear friends this coming out feting together those boots and gloves and new hat were all very foolish and if they were the sooner they understood each other the better  so mrs thompson finding that the path was steep and the weather warm stood still for a while leaning against the wall with a look of considerable fatigue in her face  will madame permit me the honour of offering her my arm said m lacordaire  the road is so extraordinarily steep for madame to climb  mrs thompson did permit him the honour and so they went on till they reached the top  the view from the summit was both extensive and grand but neither lilian nor mimmy were much pleased with the place  the elder sister who had talked over the matter with her school companions expected a fine castle with turrets battlements and romance and the other expected a pretty smiling house such as princes in her mind ought to inhabit  instead of this they found an old turret with steps so broken that m lacordaire did not care to ascend them and the ruined walls of a mansion in which nothing was to be seen but the remains of an enormous kitchen chimney  it was the kitchen of the family said the guide  oh said mrs thompson  and this said the woman taking them into the next ruined compartment was the kitchen of monsieur et madame  what two kitchens exclaimed lilian upon which m lacordaire explained that the ancestors of the prince de polignac had been very great people and had therefore required culinary performances on a great scale  and then the woman began to chatter something about an oracle of apollo  there was she said a hole in the rock from which in past times perhaps more than a hundred years ago the oracle used to speak forth mysterious words  there she said pointing to a part of the rock at some distance was the hole  and if the ladies would follow her to a little outhouse which was just beyond she would show them the huge stone mouth out of which the oracle used to speak  lilian and mimmy both declared at once for seeing the oracle but mrs thompson expressed her determination to remain sitting where she was upon the turf  so the guide started off with the young ladies and will it be thought surprising that m lacordaire should have remained alone by the side of mrs thompson  it must be now or never mrs thompson felt and as regarded m lacordaire he probably entertained some idea of the same kind mrs thompsons inclinations though they had never been very strong in the matter were certainly in favour of the now  m lacordaires inclinations were stronger  he had fully and firmly made up his mind in favour of matrimony but then he was not so absolutely in favour of the now  mrs thompsons mind if one could have read it would have shown a great objection to shilly shallying as she was accustomed to call it  but m lacordaire were it not for the danger which might thence arise would have seen no objection to some slight further procrastination  his courage was beginning perhaps to ooze out from his fingers ends  i declare that those girls have scampered away ever so far said mrs thompson  would madame wish that i should call them back said m lacordaire innocently  oh no dear children let them enjoy themselves it will be a pleasure to them to run about the rock and i suppose they will be safe with that woman  oh yes quite safe said m lacordaire and then there was another little pause  mrs thompson was sitting on a broken fragment of a stone just outside the entrance to the old family kitchen and m lacordaire was standing immediately before her  he had in his hand a little cane with which he sometimes slapped his boots and sometimes poked about among the rubbish  his hat was not quite straight on his head having a little jaunty twist to one side with reference to which bythebye mrs thompson then resolved that she would make a change should ever the gentleman become her own property  he still wore his gloves and was very smart but it was clear to see that he was not at his ease  i hope the heat does not incommode you he said after a few moments silence  mrs thompson declared that it did not that she liked a good deal of heat and that on the whole she was very well where she was  she was afraid however that she was detaining m lacordaire who might probably wish to be moving about upon the rock  in answer to which m lacordaire declared that he never could be so happy anywhere as in her close vicinity  you are too good to me said mrs thompson almost sighing  i dont know what my stay here would have been without your great kindness  it is madame that has been kind to me said m lacordaire pressing the handle of his cane against his heart  there was then another pause after which mrs thompson said that that was all his french politeness that she knew that she had been very troublesome to him but that she would now soon be gone and that then in her own country she would never forget his great goodness  ah madame said m lacordaire and as he said it much more was expressed in his face than in his words  but then you can neither accept nor reject a gentleman by what he says in his face  he blushed too up to his grizzled hair and turning round walked a step or two away from the widows seat and back again  mrs thompson the while sat quite still  the displaced fragment lying as it did near a corner of the building made not an uncomfortable chair  she had only to be careful that she did not injure her hat or crush her clothes and throw in a word here and there to assist the gentleman should occasion permit it  madame said m lacordaire on his return from a second little walk  monsieur replied mrs thompson perceiving that m lacordaire paused in his speech  madame he began again and then as he again paused mrs thompson looked up to him very sweetly madame what i am going to say will i am afraid seem to evince by far too great audacity on my part  mrs thompson may perhaps have thought that at the present moment audacity was not his fault  she replied however that she was quite sure that monsieur would say nothing that was in any way unbecoming either for him to speak or for her to hear  madame may i have ground to hope that such may be your sentiments after i have spoken  madameand now he went down absolutely on his knees on the hard stones and mrs thompson looking about into the distance almost thought that she saw the top of the guides capmadame i have looked forward to this opportunity as one in which i may declare for you the greatest passion that i have ever yet felt madame with all my heart and soul i love you  madame i offer to you the homage of my heart my hand the happiness of my life and all that i possess in this world and then taking her hand gracefully between his gloves he pressed his lips against the tips of her fingers  if the thing was to be done this way of doing it was perhaps as good as any other  it was one at any rate which left no doubt whatever as to the gentlemans intentions  mrs thompson could she have had her own way would not have allowed her lover of fifty to go down upon his knees and would have spared him much of the romance of his declaration  so also would she have spared him his yellow gloves and his polished boots  but these were a part of the necessity of the situation and therefore she wisely took them as matters to be passed over with indifference  seeing however that m lacordaire still remained on his knees it was necessary that she should take some step toward raising him especially as her two children and the guide would infallibly be upon them before long  m lacordaire she said you surprise me greatly but pray get up  but will madame vouchsafe to give me some small ground for hope  the girls will be here directly m lacordaire pray get up  i can talk to you much better if you will stand up or sit down on one of these stones  m lacordaire did as he was bid he got up wiped the knees of his pantaloons with his handkerchief sat down beside her and then pressed the handle of his cane to his heart  you really have so surprised me that i hardly know how to answer you said mrs thompson  indeed i cannot bring myself to imagine that you are in earnest  ah madame do not be so cruel  how can i have lived with you so long sat beside you for so many days without having received your image into my heart  i am in earnest  alas  i fear too much in earnest  and then he looked at her with all his eyes and sighed with all his strength  mrs thompsons prudence told her that it would be well to settle the matter in one way or the other as soon as possible  long periods of lovemaking were fit for younger people than herself and her future possible husband  her object would be to make him comfortable if she could and that he should do the same for her if that also were possible  as for lookings and sighings and pressings of the hand she had gone through all that some twenty years since in india when thompson had been young and she was still in her teens  but m lacordaire there are so many things to be considered there  i hear the children coming  let us walk this way for a minute  and they turned behind a wall which placed them out of sight and walked on a few paces till they reached a parapet which stood on the uttermost edge of the high rock  leaning upon this they continued their conversation  there are so many things to be considered said mrs thompson again  yes of course said m lacordaire  but my one great consideration is thisthat i love madame to distraction  i am very much flattered of course any lady would so feel  but m lacordaire  madame i am all attention  but if you would deign to make me happy say that one word i love you  m lacordaire as he uttered these words did not look as the saying is at his best but mrs thompson forgave him  she knew that elderly gentlemen under such circumstances do not look at their best  but if i consented tototo such an arrangement i could only do so on seeing that it would be beneficialor at any rate not injuriousto my children and that it would offer to ourselves a fair promise of future happiness  ah madame it would be the dearest wish of my heart to be a second father to those two young ladies except indeed and then m lacordaire stopped the flow of his speech  in such matters it is so much the best to be explicit at once said mrs thompson  oh yes certainly  nothing can be more wise than madame  and the happiness of a household depends so much on money  madame  let me say a word or two monsieur lacordaire  i have enough for myself and my children and should i every marry again i should not i hope be felt as a burden by my husband but it would of course be my duty to know what were his circumstances before i accepted him  of yourself personally i have seen nothing that i do not like  oh madame  but as yet i know nothing of your circumstances  m lacordaire perhaps did feel that mrs thompsons prudence was of a strong masculine description but he hardly liked her the less on this account  to give him his due he was not desirous of marrying her solely for her moneys sake  he also wished for a comfortable home and proposed to give as much as he got only he had been anxious to wrap up the solid cake of this business in a casing of sugar of romance  mrs thompson would not have the sugar but the cake might not be the worse on that account  no madame not as yet but they shall all be made open and at your disposal said m lacordaire and mrs thompson bowed approvingly  i am in business continued m lacordaire and my business gives me eight thousand francs a year  four times eight are thirtytwo said mrs thompson to herself putting the francs into pounds sterling in the manner that she had always found to be the readiest  well so far the statement was satisfactory  an income of three hundred and twenty pounds a year from business joined to her own might do very well  she did not in the least suspect m lacordaire of being false and so far the matter sounded well   and what is the business she asked in a tone of voice intended to be indifferent but which nevertheless showed that she listened anxiously for an answer to her question   they were both standing with their arms upon the wall looking down upon the town of le puy but they had so stood that each could see the others countenance as they talked  mrs thompson could now perceive that m lacordaire became red in the face as he paused before answering her  she was near to him and seeing his emotion gently touched his arm with her hand  this she did to reassure him for she saw that he was ashamed of having to declare that he was a tradesman  as for herself she had made up her mind to bear with this if she found as she felt sure she would find that the trade was one which would not degrade either him or her  hitherto indeedin her early daysshe had looked down on trade but of what benefit had her grand ideas been to her when she had returned to england  she had tried her hand at english genteel society and no one had seemed to care for her  therefore she touched his arm lightly with her fingers that she might encourage him  he paused for a moment as i have said and became red and then feeling that he had shown some symptoms of shameand feeling also probably that it was unmanly in him to do so he shook himself slightly raised his head up somewhat more proudly than was his wont looked her full in the face with more strength of character than she had yet seen him assume and then declared his business  madame he said in a very audible but not in a loud voice madameje suis tailleur  and having so spoken he turned slightly from her and looked down over the valley towards le puy  there was nothing more said upon the subject as they drove down from the rock of polignac back to the town  immediately on receiving the announcement mrs thompson found that she had no answer to make she withdrew her handand felt at once that she had received a blow  it was not that she was angry with m lacordaire for being a tailor nor was she angry with him in that being a tailor he had so addressed her  but she was surprised disappointed and altogether put beyond her ease  she had at any rate not expected this  she had dreamed of his being a banker thought that perhaps he might have been a wine merchant but her idea had never gone below a jeweller or watchmaker  when those words broke upon her ear madame je suis tailleur she had felt herself to be speechless  but the words had not been a minute spoken when lilian and mimmy ran up to their mother  oh mamma said lilian we thought you were lost we have searched for you all over the chateau  we have been sitting very quietly here my dear looking at the view said mrs thompson  but mamma i do wish youd see the mouth of the oracle  it is so large and so round and so ugly  i put my arm into it all the way said mimmy  but at the present moment her mamma felt no interest in the mouth of the oracle and so they all walked down together to the carriage and though the way was steep mrs thompson managed to pick her steps without the assistance of an arm nor did m lacordaire presume to offer it  the drive back to town was very silent  mrs thompson did make one or two attempts at conversation but they were not effectual  m lacordaire could not speak at his ease till this matter was settled and he already had begun to perceive that his business was against him  why is it that the trade of a tailor should be less honourable than that of a haberdasher or even a grocer  they sat next each other at dinner as usual and here as all eyes were upon them they both made a great struggle to behave in their accustomed way  but even in this they failed  all the world of the hotel des ambassadeurs knew that m lacordaire had gone forth to make an offer to mrs thompson and all that world therefore was full of speculation  but all the world could make nothing of it m lacordaire did look like a rejected man but mrs thompson did not look like the woman who had rejected him  that the offer had been madein that everybody agreed from the senior habitue of the house who always sat at the head of the table down to the junior assistant garcon  but as to reading the riddle there was no accord among them  when the dessert was done mrs thompson as usual withdrew and m lacordaire as usual bowed as he stood behind his own chair  he did not however attempt to follow her  but when she reached the door she called him  he was at her side in a moment and then she whispered in his ear   and i alsoi will be of the same business  when m lacordaire regained the table the senior habitue the junior garcon and all the intermediate ranks of men at the hotel des ambassadeurs knew that they might congratulate him  mrs thompson had made a great struggle but speaking for myself i am inclined to think that she arrived at last at a wise decision
