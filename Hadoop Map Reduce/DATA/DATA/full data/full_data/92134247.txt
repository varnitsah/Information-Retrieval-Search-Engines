   part i  the girl     petticoat rule  chapter i  a farewell banquet   daumont  eh daumont  the voice that of a man still in the prime of life but already raucous in its tone thickened through constant mirthless laughter rendered querulous too from long vigils kept at the shrine of pleasure rose above the incessant babel of womens chatter the din of silver china and glasses passing to and fro  your commands sire  m le duc daumont marshal of france prime and sole responsible minister of louis the wellbeloved leant slightly forward with elbows resting on the table and delicate hands with fingers interlaced white and carefully tended as those of a pretty woman supporting his round and somewhat fleshy chin  a handsome man m le duc still on the right side of fifty courtly and pleasantmannered to all has not boucher immortalized the goodnatured rather weak face with that perpetual smile of unruffled amiability forever lurking round the corners of the fulllipped mouth  your commands sire  his eyesgray and prominentroamed with a rapid movement of enquiry from the face of the king to that of a young man with fair curly hair worn free from powder and eyes restless and blue which stared moodily into a goblet full of wine  there was a momentary silence in the vast and magnificent dining hall that sudden hush whichso the superstitious averdescends three times on every assembly however gay however brilliant or thoughtless the hush which to the imaginative mind suggests the flutter of unseen wings  then the silence was broken by loud laughter from the king  they are mad these english my friend what said louis the wellbeloved with a knowing wink directed at the fairhaired young man who sat not far from him  mad indeed sire replied the duke but surely not more conspicuously so tonight than at any other time  of a truth a hundred thousand times more so here interposed a somewhat shrill feminine voiceand that by the most rigid rules of brainsplitting arithmetic  everyone listened conversations were interrupted glasses were put down eager attentive faces turned toward the speaker this was no less a personage than jeanne poisson now marquise de pompadour and when she opened her pretty mouth louis the wellbeloved descendant of saint louis king of france and of all her dominions beyond the seas hung breathless upon those wellrouged lips whilst france sat silent and listened eager for a share of that smile which enslaved a king and ruined a nation  let us have that rigid rule of arithmetic fair one said louis gaily by which you can demonstrate to us that m le chevalier here is a hundred thousand times more mad than any of his accursed countrymen  nay sire tis simple enough rejoined the lady m le chevalier hath need of a hundred thousand others in order to make his insanity complete a hundred thousand englishmen as mad as april fishes to help him conquer a kingdom of rain and fogs therefore i say he is a hundred thousand times more mad than most  loud laughter greeted this sally mme la marquise de pompadour so little while ago simply jeanne poisson or mme dÉtioles was not yet blasée to so much adulation and such fulsome flattery she looked a veritable heaven of angelic smiles her eyes blueso her dithyrambic chroniclers averas the darktoned myosotis wandered from face to face along the length of that gorgeously spread supper table round which was congregated the flower of the old aristocracy of france  she gleaned an admiring glance here an unspoken murmur of flattery there even the womenand there were manytried to look approvingly at her who ruled the king and france one face alone remained inscrutable and almost severe the face of a womana mere girlwith straight brow and low square forehead crowned with a wealth of soft brown hair the rich tones of which peeped daringly through the conventional mist of powder  mme de pompadours sunny smile disappeared momentarily when her eyes rested on this girls face a frownoh hardly that but a shadow shall we saymarred the perfect purity of her brow the next moment she had yielded her muchberinged hand to her royal worshippers eager grasp and he was pressing a kiss on each rosetipped finger whilst she shrugged her pretty shoulders  brrr she said with a mock shiver here is mlle daumont frowning stern disapproval at me surely chevalier she asked turning to the young man beside her a comfortable armchair in your beautiful palace of st germain is worth a throne in mistbound london  not when that throne is his by right here interposed mlle daumont quietly the palace of st germain is but a gift to the king of england for which he owes gratitude to the king of france  a quick blush now suffused the cheeks of the young man who up to now had seemed quite unconscious of mme de pompadours sallies or of the hilarity directed against himself he gave a rapid glance at mlle daumonts haughty somewhat imperious face and at the delicate mouth round which an almost imperceptible curl of contempt seemed still to linger  la mademoiselle rejoined the marquise with some acerbity do we not all hold gifts at the hands of the king of france  we have no sovereignty of our own madame replied the young girl drily  as for me quoth king louis hastily interposing in this feminine passage of arms i drink to our gallant chevalier de st george his majesty king charles edward stuart of england scotland wales and of the whole of that fogridden kingdom success to your cause chevalier he added settling his fat body complacently in the cushions of his chair and raising his glass he nodded benignly toward the young pretender  to king charles edward of england rejoined mme de pompadour gaily  and to king charles edward of england went echoing all around the vast banquetinghall  i thank you all said the young man whose sullen mood seemed in no way dissipated at these expressions of graciousness and friendship success to my cause is assured if france will lend me the aid she promised  what right have you to doubt the word of france monseigneur retorted mlle daumont earnestly  a truce a truce i entreat here broke in king louis with mock concern par dieu this is a banquet and not a council chamber joy of my life he added turning eyes replete with admiration on the beautiful woman beside him do not allow politics to mar this pleasant entertainment m le duc you are our host i pray you direct conversation into more pleasing channels  nothing loth the brilliant company there present quickly resumed the irresponsible chatter which was far more to its liking than talk of thrones and doubtful causes the flunkeys in gorgeous liveries made the round of the table filling the crystal glasses with wine the atmosphere was heavy with the fumes of past good cheer and the scent of a thousand roses fading beneath the glare of innumerable waxcandles an odour of perfume of powder and cosmetics hovered in the air the mens faces looked red and heated on one or two heads the wig stood awry whilst trembling fingers began fidgeting with the lacecravats at the throat  charles edwards restless blue eyes searched keenly and feverishly the faces around him morose gloomy he was still reckoning in his mind how far he could trust these irresponsible pleasurelovers that descendant of the great louis over there fat of body and heavy of mind lost to all sense of kingly dignity whilst squandering the nations money on the whims and caprices of the exwife of a parisian victualler whom he had created marquise de pompadour  these men who lived only for good cheer for heady wines games of dice and hazard nights of debauch and illicit pleasures what help would they be to him in the hour of need what support in case of failure  what right have you to doubt the word of france was asked of him by one pair of proud lipsa womans only a girls  charles edward looked across the table at mlle daumont like himself she sat silent in the midst of the noisy throng obviously lending a very inattentive ear to the whisperings of the handsome cavalier beside her  ah if they were all like her if she were a representative of the whole nation of france the young adventurer would have gone to his hazardous expedition with a stauncher and a lighter heart but as matters stood what could he expect what had he got as a serious asset in this gamble for life and a throne a few vague promises from that flabby weakkneed creature over there on whom the crown of saint louis sat so strangely and so ill a few smiles from that frivolous and vain woman who drained the very hearts blood of an impoverished nation to its last drop in order to satisfy her costly whims or chase away the frowns of ennui from the brow of an effete monarch  and what besides  a farewell supper ringing toasts good wine expensive food offered by m le duc daumont the prime minister of francea thousand roses now fading which had cost a small fortune to coax into bloom a handshake from his friends in france a godspeed and dieu vous garde chevalier and a few words of stern encouragement from a girl  with all that in hand chevalier st george go and conquer your kingdom beyond the sea     chapter ii  the rulers of france   great activity reigned in the corridors and kitchens of the old château m le chefthe only true rival the immortal vatel ever hadin white cap and apron calm and selfpossessed as a fieldmarshal in the hour of victory and surrounded by an army of scullions and wenches was directing the operations of dishingupthe crowning glory of his arduous labours pies and patties haunches of venison trout and carp from the rhine were placed on gold and silver dishes and adorned with tasteful ornaments of truly architectural beauty and monumental proportions these were then handed over to the footmen who resplendent in gorgeous liveries of scarlet and azure hurried along the marble passages carrying the masterpieces of culinary art to the banquetinghall beyond whilst the butlers more sedate and dignified in sober garb of puce or brown stalked along in stately repose bearing the huge tankards and crystal jugs  all of the best that the fine old château daumont could provide was being requisitioned tonight since m le duc and mlle lydie his daughter were giving a farewell banquet to charles edward stuart by the grace of godif not by the will of the peopleking of great britain and ireland and all her dependencies beyond the seas  for him speeches were made toasts drunk and glasses raised for him the ducal veneries had been ransacked the ducal cellars shorn of their most ancient possessions for him m le chef had raged and stormed for five hours had expended the sweat of his brow and the intricacies of his brain for him the scullions backs had smarted the wenches cheeks had glowed all to do honour to the only rightful king of england about to quit the hospitable land of france in order to conquer that island kingdom which his grandfather had lost  but in the noble salle darmes on the other hand there reigned a pompous and dignified silence in strange contrast to the bustle and agitation of the kitchens and the noise of loud voices and laughter that issued from the banqueting hall whenever a door was opened and quickly shut again  here perfumed candles flickered in massive candelabra shedding dim circles of golden light on carved woodwork marble floor and dulltoned tapestries the majestic lions of daumont frowned stolidly from their high pedestals on this serene abode of peace and dignity one foot resting on the gilded shield with the elaborate coatofarms blazoned thereon in scarlet and azure the other poised aloft as if in solemn benediction  m joseph own body servant to m le duc in magnificent daumont livery his cravat a marvel of costly simplicity his elegant wellturned calvesencased in fine silk stockingsstretched lazily before him was sprawling on the brocadecovered divan in the centre of the room  m bénédict equally resplendent in a garb of motley that recalled the heraldic colours of the comte de stainville stood before him not in an attitude of deference of course but in one of easy friendship whilst m achillea blaze of scarlet and goldwas holding out an elegant silver snuffbox to m joseph who without any superfluous motion of his dignified person condescended to take a pinch  with arm and elbow held at a graceful angle m joseph paused in the very act of conveying the snuff to his delicate nostrils he seemed to think that the occasion called for a remark from himself but evidently nothing very appropriate occurred to him for the moment so after a few seconds of impressive silence he finally partook of the snuff and then flicked off the grains of dust from his immaculate azure waistcoat with a laceedged handkerchief  where does your marquis get his snuff he asked with an easy graciousness of manner  we get it direct from london replied m achille sententiously i am personally acquainted with mme véronique who is cook to mme de la beaume and the sweetheart of jean laurent own bodyservant to general de puisieux the old general is chief of customs at havre so you see we pay no duty and get the best of snuff at a ridiculous price  ah thats lucky for you my good eglinton said m bénédict with a sigh your marquis is a good sort and as he is not personally acquainted with mme véronique i doubt not but he pays full price for his snuff  one has to live friend stainville quoth achille solemnlyand i am not a fool  exactly so and with an english milor your life is an easy one monsieur  commeci commeça nodded achille deprecatingly  le petit anglais is very rich suggested bénédict  boundlessly so quoth the other with conscious pride  now if perchance you could see your way to introducing me to mme véronique eh i have to pay full price for my counts snuff and he will have none but the best but if i could get mme véroniques protection  achilles manner immediately changed at this suggestion made with becoming diffidence he drew back a few steps as if to emphasize the distance which must of necessity lie between supplicant and patron he took a pinch of snuff he blew his nose with stately deliberationall in order to keep the petitioner waiting on tenterhooks  finally he drew up his scarlet and gold shoulders until they almost touched his ears  it will be difficult very very difficult my good stainville he said at last speaking in measured tones you see mme véronique is in a very delicate position she has a great deal of influence of course and it is not easy to obtain her protection still i will see what i can do and you can place your petition before her  do not worry yourself my good eglinton here interposed m bénédict with becoming hauteur i thought as you had asked me yesterday to use my influence with our mlle mariette the fiancée of colonel jauffroys third footman with regard to your nephews advancement in his regiment that perhaps but no matterno matter he added with a deprecatory wave of the hand  you completely misunderstood me my dear stainville broke in m achille eagerly i said that the matter was difficult i did not say that it was impossible mme véronique is beset with petitions but you may rely on my friendship i will obtain the necessary introduction for you if you on the other hand will bear my nephews interests in mind  say no more about it my good eglinton said bénédict with easy condescension your nephew will get his promotion on the word of a stainville  peace and amity being once more restored between the two friends m joseph thought that he had now remained silent far longer than was compatible with his own importance  it is very difficult of course in our position he said pompously to do justice to the many demands which are made on our influence and patronage take my own case for instancemy duke leaves all appointments in my hands in the morning whilst i shave him i have but to mention a name to him in connection with any post under government that happens to be vacant and immediately the favoured one thus named by me receives attention nearly always followed by a nomination  hem hem came very discreetly from the lips of m bénédict  you said queried joseph with a slight lifting of the right eyebrow  oh nothingnothing i pray you continue the matter is vastly entertaining  at the present moment continued m joseph keeping a suspicious eye on the other man i am deeply worried by this proposal which comes from the parliaments of rennes and paris  a new ministry of finance to be formed quoth m achille we know all about it  with direct control of the nations money and responsible to the parliaments alone assented joseph the parliaments bah he added in tones of supreme contempt bourgeois the lot of them  their demands are preposterous so says my milor tis a marvel his majesty has given his consent  i have advised my duke not to listen to the rabble said joseph as he readjusted the set of his cravat a ministry responsible to the parliaments ridiculous i say  i understand though here interposed m achille that the parliaments out of deference for his majesty are willing that the king himself shall appoint this new comptroller of finance  the king my good eglinton calmly retorted m josephthe king will leave this matter to us you may take it from me that we shall appoint this new minister and an extremely pleasant post it will be comptroller of finance all the taxes to pass through the ministers hands par dieu does it not open out a wide field for an ambitious man  hem hem coughed m bénédict again  you seem to be suffering from a cold sir said m joseph irritably  not in the least rejoined bénédict hastilya slight tickling in the throat you were saying m joseph that you hoped this new appointment would fall within your sphere of influence  nay if you doubt me my good stainville and m joseph rose with slow and solemn majesty from the divan where he had been reclining and walking across the room with a measured step he reached an escritoire whereon ink and pens letters tied up in bundles loose papers and all the usual paraphernalia commonly found on the desk of a busy man m joseph sat down at the table and rang a handbell  the next moment a young footman entered silent and deferential  is any one in the anteroom paul asked joseph  yes m joseph  how many  about thirty persons  go tell them then that m joseph is not receiving tonight he is entertaining a circle of friends bring me all written petitions i shall be visible in my dressing room to those who have a personal introduction at eleven oclock tomorrow you may go  silently as he had entered the young man bowed and withdrew  m joseph wheeled round in his chair and turned to his friends with a look of becoming triumph  thirty persons he remarked simply  all after this appointment queried achille  their representatives you see explained m joseph airily oh my antechamber is always fullyou understand i shave my duke every morning and every one it seems to me is wanting to control the finances of france  might one inquire who is your special protégé asked the other  time will show came with cryptic vagueness from the lips of m joseph  hem hem  in addition to a slight tickling of the throat m bénédict seemed to be suffering from an affection of the left eye which caused him to wink with somewhat persistent emphasis  this is the third time you have made that remark stainville said joseph severely  i did not remark my dear daumont rejoined bénédict pleasantlythat is i merely said hem hem  even so i heard you said joseph with some acerbity and i would wish to know precisely what you meant when you said hem hem like that  i was thinking of mlle lucienne said bénédict with a sentimental sigh  indeed  yes i am one of her sweetheartsthe fourth in point of favour mlle lucienne has your young ladys ear my good daumont and we all know that your duke governs the whole of france exactly as his daughter wishes him to do  and you hope through mlle luciennes influence to obtain the new post of comptroller for your own count asked m joseph with assumed carelessness as he drummed a devils tattoo on the table before him  a slight expression of fatuity crept into the countenance of m bénédict he did not wish to irritate the great man at the same time he felt confident in his own powers of blandishments where mlle lucienne was concerned even though he only stood fourth in point of favour in that influential ladys heart  mlle lucienne has promised us her support he said with a complacent smile  i fear me that will be of little avail here interposed m achille we have on our side the influence of mme auguste baillon who is housekeeper to m le docteur dubois consulting physician to mlle daumont m le docteur is very fond of haricots cooked in larda dish in the preparation of which mme baillon excelswhilst on the other hand that ladys son is perruquier to my eglinton i think there is no doubt that ours is the stronger influence and that if this ministry of finance comes into being we shall be the chief comptroller  oh it will come into being without any doubt said bénédict i have it from my cousin françois who is one of the sweethearts of mlle duprez confidential maid to mme aremberg the jewellers wife that the merchants of paris and lyons are not at all pleased with the amount of money which the king and mme de pompadour are spending  exactly people of that sort are a veritable pestilence they want us to pay some of the taxesthe corvée or the taille as if a duke or a minister is going to pay taxes ridiculous  ridiculous i say assented achille though my marquis says that in england even noblemen pay taxes  then well not go to england friend eglinton imagine shaving a duke or a marquis who had paid taxes like a shopkeeper  a chorus of indignation from the three gentleman rose at the suggestion  preposterous indeed  we all know that england is a nation of shopkeepers m de voltaire who has been there said so to us on his return  m achille in view of the fact that he represented the marquis of eglinton commonly styled le petit anglais was not quite sure whether his dignity demanded that he should resent this remark of m de voltaires or not  fortunately he was saved from having to decide this delicate question immediately by the reëntry of paul into the room  the young footman was carrying a bundle of papers which he respectfully presented to m joseph on a silver tray the great man looked at paul somewhat puzzled rubbed his chin and contemplated the papers with a thoughtful eye  what are these he asked  the petitions m joseph replied the young man  oh ah yes quoth the other airily quite so buti have no time to read them now you may glance through them paul and let me know if any are worthy of my consideration  m joseph was born in an epoch when reading was not considered an indispensable factor in a gentlemans education whether the petitions of the thirty aspirants to the new post of comptroller of finance would subsequently be read by m paul or not it were impossible to say for the present he merely took up the papers again saying quite respectfully  yes m joseph  stay you may take cards dice and two flagons of bordeaux into my boudoir  yes m joseph  have you dismissed every one from the antechamber  all except an old man who refuses to go  who is he  i do not know he  further explanation was interrupted by a timid voice issuing from the open door  i only desire five minutes conversation with m le duc daumont  and a wizened little figure dressed in seedy black with lean shanks encased in coarse woollen stockings shuffled into the room he seemed to be carrying a great number of papers and books under both arms and as he stepped timidly forward some of these tumbled in a heap at his feet  only five minutes conversation with m le duc  his eyes were very pale and very watery and his hair was of a pale straw colour he stooped to pick up his papers and dropped others in the process  m le duc is not visible said m joseph majestically  perhaps a little later suggested the lean individual  the duke will not be visible later either  then tomorrow perhaps i can waiti have plenty of time on my hands  you may have but the duke hasnt  in the meanwhile the wizened little man had succeeded in once more collecting his papers together with trembling eager hands he now selected a folded note which evidently had suffered somewhat through frequent falls on dusty floors this he held out toward m joseph  i have a letter to monsieur le valet de chambre of the duke he said humbly  a letter of introductionto me queried joseph with a distinct change in his manner and tone from whom  my daughter agathe who brings monsieurs chocolate in to him every morning  ah you are mlle agathes father exclaimed joseph with pleasant condescension as he took the letter of introduction and without glancing at it slipped it into the pocket of his magnificent coat perhaps a thought subsequently crossed his mind that the timorous person before him was not quite so simpleminded as his watery blue eyes suggested and that the dusty and crumpled little note might be a daring fraud practised on his own influential personality for he added with stern emphasis i will see mlle agathe tomorrow and will discuss your affair with her  then as the little man did not wince under the suggestion m joseph said more urbanely  by the way what is your affair these gentlemenand with a graceful gesture he indicated his two friendsthese gentlemen will pardon the liberty you are taking in discussing it before them  thank you monsieur thank you gentlemen said the wizened individual humbly it is a matter oferfigures  figures  yes this new ministry of financethere will be an auditor of accounts wantedseveral auditors i presumeandand i thought  yes nodded m joseph graciously  my daughter does bring you in your chocolate nice and hot m joseph does she notandand i do know a lot about figures i studied mathematics with the late m descartes i audited the books of the société des comptables of lyons for several years andand i have diplomas and testimonials  and carried away by another wave of anxiety he began to fumble among his papers and books which with irritating perversity immediately tumbled pellmell on to the floor  what in the devils name is the good of testimonials and diplomas to us my good man said m joseph haughtily if on giving the matter my serious consideration i come to the conclusion that you will be a suitable accountant in the new ministerial department ma foi my good man your affair is settled no thanks i pray he added with a gracious flourish of the arm i have been pleased with mlle agathe and i may mention your name whilst i shave m le duc tomorrow erby the way what is your name  durand if you please m joseph  the meagre little person with the watery blue eyes tried to express his gratitude by word and gesture but his books and papers encumbered his movements and he was rendered doubly nervous by the presence of these gorgeous and stately gentlemen and by the wave of voices and laughter which suddenly rose from the distance suggesting that perhaps a brilliant company might be coming this way  the very thought seemed to completely terrify him with both arms he hugged his various written treasures and with many sideway bows and murmurs of thanks he finally succeeded in shuffling his lean figure out of the room closely followed by m paul     chapter iii  pompadours choice   m durands retreat had fortunately occurred just in time mens voices and womens laughter sounded more and more distinct as if approaching toward the salle darmes  in a moment with the swiftness born of long usage the demeanour of the three gentlemen underwent a quick and sudden change they seemed to pull their gorgeous figures together with practised fingers each readjusted the lace of his cravat reëstablished the correct set of his waistcoat and flickered the last grain of dust or snuff from the satinlike surface of his coat  ten seconds later the great doors at the east end of the hall were thrown open and through the embrasure and beyond the intervening marble corridor could be seen the brilliantly lighted supperroom with its glittering company broken up into groups  silent swift and deferential mm joseph bénédict and achille glided on flatheeled shoes along the slippery floors making as little noise as possible effacing their gorgeous persons in window recesses or carved ornaments whenever a knot of gentlemen or ladies happened to pass by  quite a different trio now mm joseph bénédict and achillejust three automatons intent on their duties  from the supperroom there came an incessant buzz of talk and laughter m joseph sought his masters eye but m le duc was busy with the king of england and wanted no service m achille found his english milor le petit anglais engaged in conversation with his portly and somewhat overdressed mamma whilst m bénédicts master was nowhere to be found  the older ladies were beginning to look wearied and hot smothering yawns behind their painted fans paniers assumed a tired and crumpled appearance and feathered aigrettes nodded dismally above the high coiffures  not a few of the guests had taken the opportunity of bringing cards or dice from a silken pocket whilst others in smaller groups younger and not yet wearied of desultory talk strolled toward the salle darmes or the smaller boudoirs which opened out of the corridor  one or two gentlemen had succumbed to m le ducs lavish hospitality the many toasts had proved too exacting the copious draughts altogether too heady and they had somewhat involuntarily exchanged their chairs for the more reliable solidity of the floor where their faithful attendants stationed under the table for the purpose deftly untied a cravat which might be too tight or administered such cooling antidotes as might be desirable  the hot air vibrated with the constant babel of voices the froufrou of silk paniers and brocaded skirts mingled with the clink of swords and the rattle of dice in satinwood boxes  the atmosphere surcharged with perfumes had become overpoweringly close  his majesty flushed with wine and with drowsy lids drooping over his dulled eyes had pushed his chair away from the table and was lounging lazily toward mme de pompadour his idle fingers toying with the jewelled girdle of her fan she amused him she had quaint sayings which were sometimes witty always daring but which succeeded in dissipating momentarily that mortal ennui of which he suffered  even now her whispered conversation interspersed with profuse giggles brought an occasional smile to the lips of the sleepy monarch she chatted and laughed flirting her fan humouring the effeminate creature beside her by yielding her hand and wrist to his flabby kisses but her eyes did not rest on him for many seconds at a time she talked to louis but her mind had gone awandering about the room trying to read thoughts to search motives or divine hidden hatreds and envy as they concerned herself  this glitter was still new to her the power which she wielded seemed as yet a brittle toy which a hasty movement might suddenly break it was but a very little while ago that she had been an insignificant unit in a thirdrate social circle of parisalways beautiful but lost in the midst of a drabby crowd her charms like those of a precious stone unperceived for want of proper setting her ambition was smothered in her heart which at times it almost threatened to consume but it was always there ever since she had learnt to understand the power which beauty gives  an approving smile from the king of france and the world wore a different aspect for jeanne poisson her whims and caprices became the reins with which she drove france and the king why place a limit to her own desires since the mightiest monarch in europe was ready to gratify them  money became her god  spend spend spend why not the nation the bourgeoisieof which she had once been that little insignificant unitwas now the wellspring whence she drew the means of satisfying her everincreasing lust for splendour  jewels dresses palaces gardensall and everything that was rich beautiful costly she longed for it all  pictures and statuary music and of the best constant noise around her gaiety festivities laughter the wit of france and the science of the world all had been her helpmeets these past two years in this wild chase after pleasure this constant desire to kill her royal patrons incurable ennui  two years and already the nation grumbled a check was to be put on her extravagancehers and that of king louis the parliaments demanded that some control be exercised over royal munificence fewer jewels for madame and that palace at fontainebleau not yet completed the parc aux cerfs so magnificently planned and not even begun would the new comptroller put a check on that  at first she marvelled that louis should consent it was a humiliation for him as well as for her the weakness in him which had served her own ends seemed monstrous when it yielded to pressure from others  he had assured her that she should not suffer jewels palaces gardens she should have all as heretofore let parliament insist and grumble but the comptroller would be appointed by daumont and daumont was her slave  daumont yes but not his daughterthat arrogant girl with the severe eyes unwomanly and dictatorial who ruled her father just as she herself pompadour ruled the king  an enemy that lydie daumont mme la marquise whilst framing a witticism at which the king smiled frowned because in a distant alcove she spied the haughty figure of lydie  and there were others the friends of the queen and her clique of course they were not here tonight at least not in great numbers still even the present brilliant company though smiling and obsequious in the presence of the king was not by any means a close phalanx of friends  m dargenson for instancehe was an avowed enemy and marshal de noailles toooh and there were others  one of them fortunately was going away charles edward stuart aspiring king of england he had been no friend of pompadour even now as he stood close by lending an obviously inattentive ear to m le duc daumont she could see that he still looked gloomy and out of humour and that whenever his eyes rested upon her and the king he frowned with wrathful impatience  you are distraite ma mie said louis with a yawn  i was thinking sire she replied smiling into his drowsy eyes  for gods sake i entreat do not think exclaimed the king with mock alarm thought produces wrinkles and your perfect mouth was only fashioned for smiles  may i frame a suggestion she queried archly  no only a command  this comptroller of finance your future master louis and mine  your slave he interrupted lazily and he values his life  why not milor eglinton  le petit anglais and louiss fat body was shaken with sudden immoderate laughter par dieu ma mie of all your witty sallies this one hath pleased us most  why she asked seriously  le petit anglais again laughed the king id as soon give the appointment to your lapdog marquise fido would have as much capacity for the post as the ornamental cypher that hangs on his mothers skirts  milor eglinton is very rich she mused  inordinately so curse him i could do with half his revenue and be a satisfied man  being a cypher he would not trouble us much being very rich he would need no bribe for doing as we wish  his lady mother would trouble us ma mie  bah we would find him a wife  nay i entreat you do not worry your dainty head with these matters said the king somewhat irritably the appointment rests with daumont an you desire the post for your protégé turn your bright eyes on the duke  pompadour would have wished to pursue the subject to get something of a promise from louis to turn his inveterate weakness then and there to her own account but louis the wellbeloved yawned a calamity which the fair lady dared not risk again witty and brilliant forever gay and unfatigued she knew that her power over the monarch would only last whilst she could amuse him  therefore now with swift transition she turned the conversation to more piquant channels an anecdote at the expense of the old duchesse de pontchartrain brought life once more into the eyes of the king she was once more untiring in her efforts her cheeks glowed even through the powder and the rouge her lips smiled without intermission but her thoughts drifted back to the root idea the burden of that control to be imposed on her caprices  she would not have minded milor eglinton the courteous amiable gentleman who had no will save that expressed by any woman who happened to catch his ear she felt that she could with but very little trouble twist him round her little finger his dictatorial mamma would either have to be got out of the way or won over to mme la marquises own views of life whilst milor could remain a bachelor lest another feminine influence prove antagonistic  pompadours bright eyes whilst she chatted to the king sought amidst the glittering throng the slim figure of le petit anglais  yes he would suit her purpose admirably she could see his handsome profile clearly outlined against the delicate tones of the wall handsome yes clearcut and firm with straight nose and the low square brow of the anglosaxon race but obviously weak and yielding a perfect tool in the hands of a clever woman  elegant too always immaculately nay daintily dressed he wore with that somewhat stiff grace peculiar to the english gentleman the showy and effeminate costume of the time but there was weakness expressed in his very attitude as he stood now talking to charles edward stuart the kindly pleasant expression of his goodlooking face in strange contrast to the glowering moodiness of his princely friend  one lord eglinton had followed the deposed james ii into exile his son had risked life and fortune for the restoration of the old pretender and having managed by sheer good luck to save both he felt that he had done more than enough for a cause which he knew was doomed to disaster but he hated the thought of a german monarch in england and in his turn preferred exile to serving a foreigner for whom he had scant sympathy  immensely wealthy a brilliant conversationalist a perfect gentleman he soon won the heart of one of the daughters of france mlle de maille brought him in addition to her own elaborate trousseau and a dowry of three thousand francs yearly pinmoney the historic and gorgeous chateau of beaufort which lord eglintons fortune rescued from the hands of the bailiffs  vaguely he thought that some day he would return to his own ancestral home in sussex when england would have become english once again in the meanwhile he was content to drift on the placid waters of life his luxurious craft guided by the domineering hand of his wife independent owing to his nationality and his wealth a friend alike of the king of france and the stuart pretender he neither took up arms in any cause nor sides in any political intrigue  lady eglinton brought up her son in affluence and luxury but detached from all partisanship her strong personality imposed something of her own national characteristics on the boy but she could not break the friendship that existed between the royal stuarts and her husbands family although charles edward was her sons playmate in the gardens and castle of beaufort she nevertheless succeeded in instilling into the latter a slight measure of disdain for the hazardous attempts at snatching the english crown which invariably resulted in the betrayal of friends the wholesale slaughter of adherents and the ignominious flight of the pretender  no doubt it was this dual nationality in the present lord eglinton this detachment from political conflicts that was the real cause of that inherent weakness of character which mme de pompadour now wished to use for her own ends she was glad therefore to note that whilst charles edward talked earnestly to him the eyes of le petit anglais roamed restlessly about the room as if seeking for support in an argument or help from a personality stronger than his own  lady eglintons voice harsh and domineering often rose above the general hum of talk just now she had succeeded in engaging the prime minister in serious conversation  the king in the meanwhile had quietly dropped asleep lulled by the even ripple of talk of the beautiful marquise and the heavily scented atmosphere of the room pompadour rose from her chair as noiselessly as her stiff brocaded skirt would allow she crossed the room and joined lady eglinton and m le duc daumont  she was going to take king louiss advice and add the weighty influence of her own bright eyes to that of my ladys voluble talk in favour of the appointment of lord eglinton to the newly created ministry of finance     chapter iv  a womans surrender   in a small alcove which was raised above the level of the rest of the floor by a couple of steps and divided from the main banqueting hall by a heavy damask curtain now partially drawn aside mlle daumont sat in close conversation with m le comte de stainville  from this secluded spot these two dominated the entire length and breadth of the room the dazzling scene was displayed before them in a gorgeous kaleidoscope of moving figures in an everdeveloping panorama of vividly coloured groups that came and went divided and reunited now forming soft harmonies of delicate tones that suggested the subtle blending on the palette of a master anon throwing on to the canvas daring patches of rich magentas or deep purples that set off with cunning artfulness the masses of pale primrose and gold  gaston de stainville however did not seem impressed with the picturesqueness of the scene he sat with his broad back turned toward the brilliant company one elbow propped on a small table beside him his hand shielding his face against the glare of the candles but lydie daumonts searching eyes roamed ceaselessly over the gaily plumaged birds that fluttered uninterruptedly before her gaze  with one delicate hand holding back the rich damask curtain the other lying idly in her lap her white brocaded gown standing out in stiff folds round her girlish figure she was a picture well worth looking at  lydie was scarcely twentyone then but already there was a certain something in the poise of her head in every movement of her graceful body that suggested the woman accustomed to dominate the woman of thought and action rather than of sentiment and tender emotions  those of her own sex said at that time that in lydies haughty eyes there was the look of the girl who has been deprived early in life of a mothers gentle influence and who has never felt the gentle yet firm curb of a mothers authority on her childish whims and caprices  m le duc daumont who had lost his young wife after five years of an exceptionally happy married life had lavished all the affection of his mature years on the girl who was the sole representative of his name the child had always been headstrong and selfwilled from the cradle her nurses could not cope with her babyish tempers her governesses dreaded her domineering ways m le duc was deaf to all complaints he would not have the child thwarted and as she grew up lovable in the main she found her fathers subordinates ready enough to bend to her yoke  from the age of ten she had been the acknowledged queen of all her playmates and the autocrat of her fathers house little by little she obtained an extraordinary ascendancy over the fond parent who admired almost as much as he loved her  he was deeply touched when scarce out of the school room she tried to help him in the composition of his letters and more than astonished to see how quick was her intelligence and how sharp her intuition instinctively at first he took to explaining to her the various political questions of the day listening with paternal goodhumour to her acute and sensitive remarks on several important questions  then gradually his confidence in her widened many chroniclers aver that it was lydie daumont who wrote her fathers celebrated memoirs and those who at that time had the privilege of knowing her intimately could easily trace her influence in most of her fathers political moves there is no doubt that the duc himself when he finally became prime minister of france did very little without consulting his daughter and even labbé dalivet in his chroniques de louis xv admits that the hot partisanship of france for the young pretenders illconceived expeditions was mainly due to mlle daumonts influence  when vanloo painted her a little later on he rendered with consummate and delicate skill the haughty look of command which many of lydies most ardent admirers felt to be a blemish on the exquisite purity and charm of her face  the artist too emphasized the depth and earnestness of her dark eyes and that somewhat too severe and selfreliant expression which marked the straight young brow  perhaps it was this same masterful trait in the dainty form before him that gaston de stainville studied so attentively just now there had been silence for some time between the elegant cavalier and the idolized daughter of the prime minister of france she seemed restless and anxious even absentminded when he spoke she was studying the various groups of men and women as they passed frowning when she looked on some faces smiling abstractedly when she encountered a pair of friendly eyes  i did not know that you were such a partisan of that young adventurer said gaston de stainville at last as if in answer to her thoughts noting that her gaze now rested with stern intentness on charles edward stuart  i must be on the side of a just cause she rejoined quietly as with a very characteristic movement of hers she turned her head slowly round and looked m de stainville full in the face  she could not see him very well for his head was silhouetted against the dazzling light beyond and she frowned a little as she tried to distinguish his features more clearly in the shadow  you do believe gaston that his cause is just she asked earnestly  oh he replied lightly ill believe in the justice of any cause to which you give your support  she shrugged her shoulders whilst a slightly contemptuous curl appeared at the corner of her mouth  how like a man she said impatiently  what is like a man he retorted to loveas i love you  he had whispered this hardly above his breath lest he should be overheard by some one in that gay and giddy throng who passed laughingly by the stern expression in her eyes softened a little as they met his eager gaze but the goodhumoured contempt was still apparent even in her smile she saw that as he spoke he looked through the outspread fingers of his hand to see if he was being watched and noted that one pair of eyes distant the whole length of the room caught the movement then was instantly averted  mlle de saint romans is watching you she said quietly  he seemed surprised and not a little vexed that she had noticed and for a moment looked confused then he said carelessly  why should she not why should not the whole world look on and see that i adore you  meseems you protest overmuch gaston she said with a sigh  impossible  you talk of love too lightly  i am in earnest lydie why should you doubt are you not beautiful enough to satisfy any mans ardour  am i not influential enough you mean she said with a slight tremor in her rich young voice to satisfy any mans ambition  is ambition a crime in your eyes lydie  no but  i am ambitious you cannot condemn me for that he said now speaking in more impressive tone when we were playmates together years ago you remember in the gardens at cluny if other lads were there was i not always eager to be first in the race first in the fieldfirst always everywhere  even at the cost of sorrow and humiliation to the weaker ones  he shrugged his shoulders with easy unconcern  there is no success in life for the strong he said save at the cost of sorrow and humiliation for the weak lydie he added more earnestly if i am ambitious it is because my love for you has made me humble i do not feel that as i am i am worthy of you i want to be rich to be influential to be great is that wrong i want your pride in me almost as much as your love  you were rich once gaston she said a little coldly your father was rich  is it my fault if i am poor now  they tell me it is they say that you are overfond of cards and of other pleasures which are less avowable  and you believe them  i hardly know she whispered  you have ceased to love me then  gaston  there as a tone of tender reproach there which the young man was swift enough to note the beautiful face before him was in full light he could see well that a rosy blush had chased away the usual matt pallor of her cheeks and that the full red lips trembled a little now whilst the severe expression of the eyes was veiled in delicate moisture  your face has betrayed you lydie he said with sudden vehemence though his voice even now hardly rose above a whisper if you have not forgotten your promises made to me at clunyin the shadow of those beech trees do you remember you were only thirteena mere childyet already a woman the soft breath of spring fanned your glowing cheeks your loose hair blew about your face framing your proud little head in a halo of goldyou remember lydie  i have not forgotten she said gently  your hand was in minea childs hand lydie but yours for all thatand you promisedyou remember and if you have not forgottenif you do love me not heaven help me as i love you but only just a little better than any one else in the world well then lydie why these bickerings why these reproaches i am poor now but soon i will be rich i have no power but soon i will rule france with you to help me if you will  he had grown more and more vehement as he spoke carried along by the torrent of his own eloquence but he had not moved he still sat with his back to the company and his face shaded by his hand his voice was still low impressive in its ardour then as the young girls graceful head drooped beneath the passionate expression of his gaze bending as it were to the intensity of his earnest will his eyes flashed a look of triumph a premonition of victory close at hand lydies strong personality was momentarily weakened by the fatigue of a long and arduous evening by the heavy atmosphere of the room her senses were dulled by the penetrating odours of wine and perfumes which fought with those of cosmetics  she seemed to be yielding to the softer emotions less watchful of her own dignity less jealous of her own power the young man felt that at this moment he held her just as he wished did he stretch out his hand she would place hers in it the recollections of her childhood had smothered all thoughts of present conflicts and of political intrigues mlle daumont the influential daughter of an allpowerful minister had momentarily disappeared giving way to madcap little lydie with short skirts and flying chestnut curls the comrade of the handsome boy in the old gardens at cluny  lydie if you loved me whispered stainville  if i loved you and there was a world of pathos in that girlish if  you would help me instead of reproaching  what do you want me to do gaston  your word is law with your father he said persuasively he denies you nothing you said i was ambitious one word from youthis new ministry  he realized his danger bit his lip lest he had been too precipitate lydie was headstrong she was also very shrewd the mastermind that guided the destinies of france through the weak indulgence of a father was not likely to be caught in a snare like any lovesick maid her womans instincthe knew thatwas keen to detect selfinterest and if he aroused the suspicions of the wealthy and influential woman before he had wholly subjugated her heart he knew that he would lose the biggest stake of his life  lately she had held aloof from him the playmates had become somewhat estranged the echoes of his reckless life must he thought have reached her ears and he himself had not been overeager for the companionship of this woman who seemed to have thrown off all the lightheartedness of her sex for the sake of a life of activity and domination  she was known to be cold and unapproachable rigidly conscientious in transacting the business of the state which her father with easy carelessness gradually left on her young shoulders since she seemed to find pleasure in it  but her influence of which she was fully conscious had rendered her suspicious even now when the call of her youth of her beauty of the happy and tender recollections of her childhood loudly demanded to be heard she cast a swift inquiring glance at gaston  he caught the glance and with an involuntary movement of impatience his hand which up to now had so carefully masked the expression of his face came crashing down upon the table  lydie he said impetuously in the name of god throw aside your armour for one moment is life so long that you can afford to waste it have you learned the secret of perpetual youth that you deliberately fritter away its golden moments in order to rush after the dead sea fruit of domination and power lydie he whispered with passionate tenderness my little lydie of the crisp chestnut hair of the fragrant woods around cluny leave those giddy heights of ambition come down to earth where my arms await you i will tell you of things my little lydie which are far more beautiful far more desirable than the sceptre and kingdom of france and when i press you close to my heart you will taste a joy far sweeter than that which a crown of glory can give will you not listen to me lydie will you not share with me that joy which renders men the equal of god  his hand had wandered up the damask curtain gently drawing its heavy folds from out her clinging fingers the rich brocade fell behind him with a soft and lingering sound like the murmured hushshsh of angels wings shutting out the noise and glare beyond isolating them both from the world and its conflicts its passions and its ceaseless strife  secure from prying eyes gaston de stainville threw all reserve from him with a laugh of pride and of joy half kneeling wholly leaning toward her his arms encircled her young figure almost pathetic now in its sudden and complete abandonment with his right hand he drew that imperious little head down until his lips had reached her ear  would you have me otherwise my beautiful proud queen he whispered softly should i be worthy of the cleverest woman in france if my ambition and hopes were not at least as great as hers lydie he added looking straight into her eyes if you asked me for a kingdom in the moon i swear to god that i would make a start in order to conquer it for you did you from sheer caprice ask to see my lifes blood ebbing out of my body i would thrust this dagger without hesitation into my heart  hush hush she said earnestly that is extravagant talk gaston do not desecrate love by such folly  tis not folly lydie give me your lips and you too will understand  she closed her eyes it was so strange to feel this great gladness in her heart this abasement of all her being she who had so loved to dictate and to rule she savoured the inexpressible delight of yielding  he demanded a kiss and she gave it because he had asked it of her shyly wondering in her own mind how she came to submit so easily and why submission should be so sweet  up to now she had only tasted the delights of power now she felt that if gaston willed she would deem it joy to obey there was infinite happiness infinite peace in that kiss the first her vestal lips had ever granted to any man he was again whispering to her now with that same eager impetuosity which had subjugated her she was glad to listen for he talked much of his love of the beautiful days at cluny which she had feared that he had wholly forgotten  it was sweet to think that he remembered them during the past year or two when evil tongues spoke of him before her of his recklessness his dissipations his servility to the growing influence of the pompadour she had not altogether believed but her heart faithful to the childlover had ached and rebelled against his growing neglect  now he was whispering explanationsnot excuses for he needed none since he had always loved her and only jealousies and intrigues had kept him from her side as he protested she still did not altogether believeoh the folly of it all the mad glad follybut he said that with a kiss she would understand  he was right she did understand  and he talked much of his ambitions was it not natural men were so different to women he proud of his love for her was longing to show her his power to rule and to command she halfshy of her love for him felt her pride in submitting to his wish in laying down at his feet the crown and sceptre of domination which she had wielded up to now with so proud and secure a hand  men were so different that too she understood with the first touch of a mans kiss on her lips  she chided herself for her mistrust of him was it not natural that he should wish to rule how proud was she now that her last act of absolute power should be the satisfaction of his desire  that new ministry well he should have it as he wished one word from her and her father would grant it her husband must be the most powerful man in france she would make him that since she could and then pillow her head on his breast and forget that she ever had other ambitions save to see him great  smiling through her tears she begged his forgiveness for her mistrust of him her doubts of the true worth of his love  it was because i knew so little she said shyly as her trembling fingers toyed nervously with the lace of his cravat no man has ever loved me gastonyou understand there were flatterers round me and sycophantsbut love  she shook her head with a kind of joyous sadness for the past it was so much better to be totally ignorant of love and then to learn itlike this  then she became grave again  my father shall arrange everything this evening she said with a proud toss of her head tomorrow you may command but tonight you shall remain a suppliant grant me i pray you this fond little gratification of my overburdened vanity ask me again to grant your request to be the means of satisfying your ambition put it into words gaston tell me what it is you want she insisted with a pretty touch of obstinacy it is my whim and remember i am still the arbiter of your fate  on my knees my queen he said curbing his impatience at her childish caprice and striving to hide the note of triumph in his voice he put both knees to the ground and bent his head in supplication i crave of your bountiful graciousness to accord me the power to rule france by virtue of my office as chief comptroller of her revenues  your desire is granted sir she said with a final assumption of pride the last favour i shall have the power to bestow i now confer on you tomorrow i abdicate she continued with a strange little sigh halftearful halfjoyous tomorrow i shall own a master m le comte de stainville minister of the exchequer of france behold your slave lydie bought this night with the priceless currency of your love oh gaston my lord my husband she said with a sudden uncontrollable outburst of tears be a kind master to your slaveshe gives up so much for your dear sake     chapter v  the first trick   a shrill laugh suddenly broke on their ears so absorbed had lydie been in her dream that she had completely forgotten the other world the one that laughed and talked that fought and bickered on the other side of the damask curtain which was the boundary of her own universe  gaston de stainville we may assume was not quite so unprepared for interruption as the young girl for even before the shrill laugh had expended itself he was already on his feet and had drawn the damask curtain back again interposing the while his broad figure between lydie daumont and the unwelcome intruder on their privacy  ah at last you are tracked to earth mauvais sujet said mme de pompadour as soon as the comte de stainville stood fully revealed before her faith i have had a severe task his majesty demanded your presence a while ago sir and hath gone to sleep in the interval of waiting nay nay you need make neither haste nor excuses the king sleeps monsieur else i were not here to remind you of duty  she stood at the bottom of the steps looking up with keen malicious eyes at gastons figure framed in the opening of the alcove and peering inquisitively into the sombre recesses wherein already she had caught a glimpse of a white satin skirt and the scintillation of many diamonds  what say you milady she added turning to the florid somewhat overdressed woman who stood by her side shall we listen to the excuses m de stainville seems anxious to make meseems they are clad in white satin and show a remarkably wellturned ankle  but before lady eglinton could frame a reply lydie daumont had risen and placing her hand on stainvilles shoulder she thrust him gently aside and now stood smiling beside him perfectly selfpossessed a trifle haughty looking down on jeanne de pompadours pert face and on the older ladys obviously illhumoured countenance  nay mme la marquise she said in her own quiet way m le comte de stainvilles only excuse for his neglect of courtly duties stands before you now  ma foi mademoiselle retorted the marquise somewhat testily his majesty being overgallant would perhaps be ready enough to accept it and so no doubt would the guests of m le duc your fatheralways excepting mlle de st romans she added with more than a point of malice and she is not like to prove indulgent  but lydie was far too proud far too conscious also of her own worth to heed the petty pinpricks which the ladies of the court of louis xv were wont to deal so lavishly to one another she knew quite well that gastons name had oft been coupled with that of mlle de st romansla belle brune de bordeaux as she was universally calleddaughter of the gallant maréchal just home from flanders this gossip was part and parcel of that multifarious scandal to which she had just assured her lover that she no longer would lend an ear  therefore she met mme de pompadours malicious look with one of complete indifference and ignoring the remark altogether she said calmly without the slightest tremor in her voice or hint of annoyance in her face  did i understand you to say madame that his majesty was tired and desired to leave  the marquise looked vexed conscious of the snub she threw a quick look of intelligence to lady eglinton which lydie no doubt would have caught had she not at that moment turned to her lover in order to give him a smile of assurance and trust  he however seemed selfabsorbed just now equally intent in avoiding her loving glance and mme de pompadours mocking gaze  the king certainly asked for m de stainville a while ago here interposed lady eglinton and m le chevalier de saint george has begun to make his adieux  well not detain mlle daumont then said mme de pompadour she will wish to bid our young pretender an encouraging farewell come m de stainville she added authoritatively well to his majesty but only for two short minutes then you shall be released man have no fear in order to make your peace with la belle brune de bordeaux brrr i vow i am quite frightened the minxs black eyes anon shot daggers in this direction  she beckoned imperiously to gaston who still seemed ill at ease and ready enough to follow her lydie could not help noting with a slight tightening of her heartstrings with what alacrity he obeyed  men are so different she sighed  she would have allowed the whole world to look on and to sneer whilst she spent the rest of the evening beside her lover talking foolish nonsense planning out the future or sitting in happy silence heedless of sarcasm mockery or jests  her eyes followed him somewhat wistfully as he descended the two steps with easy grace and with a flourishing bow and a mille grâces mlle lydie he turned away without another backward look and became merged with the crowd  her master and future lord the man whose lips had touched her own how strange  she herself could not thus have become one of the throng not just yet she could not have detached herself from him so readily for some few secondsminutes perhapsher earnest eyes tried to distinguish the pale mauve of his coat in the midst of that everchanging kaleidoscope of dazzling colours but the search made her eyes burn and she closed them with the pain  men were so different  and though she had learned much understood much with that first kiss she was still very ignorant very inexperienced and quite at sea in those tortuous paths wherein gaston and mme de pompadour and all the others moved with such perfect ease  in the meanwhile m de stainville and the marquise had reached the corridor from where they now stood they could no longer see the alcove whence lydies aching eyes still searched for them in vain with a merry little laugh madame drew her dainty hand away from her cavaliers arm  there am i not the beneficent fairy you rogue she said giving him a playful tap with her fan fie will you drive in double harness youll come to grief fair sir and meseems twere not good to trifle with either filly  madame i entreat he protested feebly wearied of the jest but he tried not to scowl or to seem impatient for he was loth to lose the good graces of a lady whose power and influence were unequalled even by lydie daumont  pompadour had favoured him from the very day of her first entry in the brilliant court of versailles his handsome face his elegant manners and above all his reputation as a consummate mauvais sujet had pleased mme la marquise gaston de stainville was never so occupied with pleasures or amours but he was ready to pay homage to one more beautiful woman who was willing to smile upon him  but though she flirted with gaston the wily marquise had no wish to see him at the head of affairs the stateappointed controller of her caprices and of the kings munificence he was pleasant enough as an admirer unscrupulous and daring but as a master no  the thought of a marriage between mlle daumont and m de stainville with its obvious consequences on her own future plans was not to be tolerated for a moment and madame wondered greatly how far matters had gone between these two prior to her own timely interference  there she said pointing to an arched doorway close at hand go and make your peace whilst i endeavour to divert his majestys thoughts from your own wicked person and remember she added coquettishly as she bobbed him a short mocking curtsey when you have reached the blissful stage of complete reconciliation that you owe your happiness to jeanne de pompadour  etiquette demanded that he should kiss the hand which she now held extended toward him this he did with as good a grace as he could muster in his heart of hearts he was wishing the interfering lady back in the victuallers shop of paris he was not at all prepared at this moment to encounter the jealous wrath of la belle brune de bordeaux  vaguely he thought of flight but mme de pompadour would not let him off quite so easily with her own jewelled hand she pushed aside the curtain which masked the doorway and with a nod of her dainty head she hinted to gaston to walk into the boudoir  there was nothing for it but to obey  mlle de saint romans said the marquise peeping into the room in order to reassure herself that the lady was there and alone see i bring the truant back to you do not be too severe on him his indiscretion has been slight and he will soon forget all about it if you will allow him to make full confession and to do penance at your feet  then she dropped the curtain behind gaston de stainville and as an additional precaution lest those two in there should be interrupted too soon she closed the heavy folding doors which further divided the boudoir from the corridor  now if milady plays her cards cleverly she murmured she and i will have done a useful evenings work     chapter vi  a false position   gaston  m de stainville shook off his moodiness the vision of la belle irène standing there in the satinhung boudoir the soft glow of wellshaded candles shedding an elusive rosy light on the exquisite figure with head thrown back and arms stretched out in a gesture of passionate appeal was too captivating to permit of any other thought having sway over his brain for the next second or two at any rate  i thought you had completely forgotten me tonight she said as he came rapidly toward her and that i should not even get speech of you  she took his hand and led him gently to a low divan forcing him to sit down beside her she studied his face intently for a moment or two  was it necessary she asked abruptly  you know it was irène he said divining her thoughts plunging readily enough now into the discussion which he knew was inevitable his whole nature rebelled against this situation he felt a distinct lowering of his manly pride his masterful spirit chafed at the thought of an explanation which irène claimed the right to demand  i told you irène he continued impatiently that i would speak to mlle daumont tonight and if possible obtain a definite promise from her  and have you obtained that definite promise she asked  yes  lydie daumont promised you that you should be the new stateappointed minister of finance she insisted  yes i have her word  andwhat was the cost  the cost  yes the cost she said with what was obviously enforced calm lydie daumont did not give you that promise for nothing you gave her or promised her something in return what was it  her lips were trembling and she had some difficulty in preventing her nervous fingers from breaking into pieces the delicate motherofpearl fan which they held but she was determined to appear perfectly calm and that he should in no way suspect her of working up to a vulgar scene of jealousy  you are foolish irène he said with his characteristic nonchalant shrug of the shoulders  foolish she repeated still keeping her temper well under control though it was her voice which was shaking now foolish ma foi when my husband obtains  sh sh sh he said quickly as with rough gesture he grasped her wrist and gave it a warning pressure  bah she retorted no one can hear  the walls have ears  and if they have i cannot keep up this deception for ever gaston  twere worse than foolish to founder within sight of port  you trust lydie daumonts word then  if you will do nothing to spoil the situation he retorted grimly another word such as you said just now too long a prolongation of this charming têteàtête and mlle daumont will make a fresh promise to some one else  i was right then  right in what  mlle daumont promised you the appointment because you made love to her  irène  why dont you tell me she said with passionate vehemence cant you see that i have been torturing myself with jealous fears i am jealouscan i help it i suffered martyrdom when i saw you there with her i could not hear your words but i could see the earnestness of your attitude do i not know every line of your figure every gesture of your hand then the curtain fell at your touch and i could no longer seeonly divineonly tremble and fear mon dieu did i not love you as i do were my love merely foolish passion would i not then have screamed out the truth to all that jabbering crowd that stood between me and you seeming to mock me with its prattle and its irresponsible laughter i am unnerved gaston she added with a sudden breakdown of her selfcontrol her voice trembling with sobs the tears welling to her eyes and her hands beating against one another with a movement of petulant nervosity i could bear it you know but for this secrecy this false position it is humiliating to me andoh be kind to mebe kind to me she sobbed giving finally way to a fit of weeping i have spent such a miserable evening all alone  stainvilles expressive lips curled into a smile be kind to methe same pathetic prayer spoken to him by lydie a very short while ago bah how little women understood ambition even lydie even irène  and these two women were nothing to him lydie herself was only a steppingstone the statuesque and headstrong girl made no appeal to the essentially masculine side of his nature and he had little love left now for the beautiful passionate woman beside him whom in a moment of unreasoning impulse he had bound irrevocably to him  gaston de stainville aspired to military honours a couple of years ago the maréchal de saint romans friend and mentor of the dauphin confidant of the queen seemed allpowerful then unable to win the fathers consent to his union with irènefor the maréchal had more ambitious views for his only daughter and looked with illfavour on the young gallant who had little to offer but his own handsome person an ancient name and a passionate desire for advancementgaston who had succeeded in enchaining the young girls affections had no difficulty in persuading her to agree to a secret marriage  but the wheel of fate proved as erratic in its movements as the flights of stainvilles ambition with the appearance of jeanne poisson dÉtioles at the court of versailles the queens gentle influence over louis xv waned and her friends fell into disfavour and obscurity the maréchal de saint romans was given an unimportant command in flanders there was nothing to be gained for the moment from an open alliance with his daughter gaston de stainville an avowed opportunist paid his court to the newly risen star and was received with smiles but he could not shake himself from the matrimonial fetters which he himself had forged  the rapid rise of the duc daumont to power and the overwhelming ascendancy of lydie in the affairs of state had made the young man chafe bitterly against the indestructible barrier which he himself had erected between his desires and their fulfilment his passion for irène did not yield to the early love of his childhoods days it was drowned in the newly risen flood of more boundless ambition it was merely the casting aside of one steppingstone for another more firm and more prominent  just now in the secluded alcove when the proud reserved girl had laid bare before him the secrets of her virginal soul when with pathetic abandonment she laid the sceptre of her influence and power at his feet he had felt neither compunction nor remorse now when the woman who had trusted and blindly obeyed him asked for his help and support in a moral crisis he was conscious only of a sense of irritation and even of contempt which he tried vainly to disguise  at the same time he knew well that it is never wise to tax a womans submission too heavily irène had yielded to his wish that their marriage be kept a secret for the present only because she too was tainted with a touch of that unscrupulous ambition which was the chief characteristic of the epoch she was shrewd enough to know that her husband would have but little chance in elbowing his way up the ladder of powereach rung of which was wrapped in a petticoat as m de voltaire had pertinently put itif he was known to be dragging a wife at his heels gaston had had no difficulty in making her understand that his personality as a gay and irresponsible butterfly as a man of fashion and a squire of dames was the most important factor in the coming fight for the virtual dominion of france  she had accepted the position at first with an easy grace she knew her gaston and knew that he must not be handled with too tight a curb moreover her secret status pleased her whilst he remained avowedly faithful to her she liked to see him court and smile a preux chevalier with the ladies she relished the thought of being the jailer to that gailyplumaged bird whom bright eyes and smiling lips tried to entice and enchain  but tonight a crisis had come something in gastons attitude toward lydie had irritated her beyond what she was prepared to endure his love for her had begun to wane long ago she knew that but she was not inclined to see it bestowed on another stainville feared that she was losing selfcontrol and that she might betray all and lose all if he did not succeed in laying her jealous wrath to rest he was past master in the art of dealing with a womans tears  irène he said earnestly i have far too much respect for you to look upon this childish outburst of tears as representing the true state of your feelings you are unnervedyou own it yourself will you allow me to hold your hand he said with abrupt transition  then as she yielded her trembling hand to him he pressed a lingering kiss in the icy cold palm  will you not accept with this kiss the assurance of my unswerving faith and loyalty he said speaking in that low deeptoned voice of his which he knew so well how to make tender and appealing to the heart of women irène if i have committed an indiscretion tonight if i allowed my ambition to soar beyond the bounds of prudence will you not believe that with my ambition my thoughts flew up to you and only came down to earth in order to rest at your feet  he had drawn her close to him ready to whisper in her ear as he had whispered half an hour ago in those of lydie he wanted this womans trust and confidence just a very little while longer and he found words readily enough with which to hoodwink and to cajole irène was an easier prey than lydie she was his wife and her ambitions were bound up with his her mistrust only came from jealousy and jealousy in a woman is so easily conquered momentarily if she be beautiful and young and the man ardent and unscrupulous  gaston as yet had no difficult task but every day would increase those difficulties until he had finally grasped the aim of his ambitious desires and had rid himself of lydie  irène he whispered now for he felt that she was consoled and being consoled she was ready to yield irène my wife a little more patience a little more trust two daysa weekwhat matter shut your eyes to all save this one moment tonight when your husband is at your feet and when his soul goes out to yours in one long and tender kiss your lips ma mie  she bent her head to him womanlike she could not resist memory came to his aid as he pleaded the memory of those early days on the vineclad hills near bordeaux when he had wooed and won her with the savour of his kiss     chapter vii  the young pretender   and lydie daumonts eyes had watched his disappearing figure through the crowd until she could bear the sight no longer and closed them with the pain  an even pleasant very courteous voice roused her from her reverie  you are tired mlle daumont may ithat is i should be very proud if you would allow me toer  she opened her eyes and saw the handsome face of le petit anglais turned up to her with a look of humility a deprecatory offer of service and withal a strange mingling of compassion which somehow at this moment in her sensitive and nervous state seemed to wound and sting her  im not the least tired she said coldly i thank you milor the colours and the light were so dazzling for the moment my eyes closed involuntarily  i humbly beg your pardon said eglinton with nervous haste i thought that perhaps a glass of wine  tush child interposed lady eglinton in her harsh dry voice have you not heard that mlle daumont is not fatigued offer her the support of your arm and take her to see the chevalier de saint george who is waiting to bid her goodbye  nay i assure you i can walk alone rejoined lydie taking no heed to the proffered arm which lord eglinton in obedience to his mothers suggestion was holding out toward her where is his majesty the king of england emphasizing the title with marked reproof and looking with somewhat goodnatured contempt at the young englishman who with a crestfallen air had already dropped the arm which she had disdained and stepped quickly out of her way whilst a sudden blush spread over his goodlooking face  he looked so confused and sheepish so like a chidden child that she was instantly seized with remorse as if she had teased a defenseless animal and though the touch of contempt was still apparent in her attitude she said more kindly  i pray you forgive me milor i am loth to think that perhaps our gallant chevalier will never bear his rightful title in his own country i feel that it cheers him to hear uswho are in true sympathy with himcalling him by that name shall we go find the king of england and wish him godspeed  she beckoned to lord eglinton but he had probably not yet sufficiently recovered from the snub administered to him to realize that the encouraging glance was intended for him and he hung back not daring to follow instinctively appealing to his mother for guidance as to what he should do  he is modest said lady eglinton with the air of a proud mother lauding her young offspring a heart of gold my dear mlle daumont she whispered behind her fan under a simple exterior  lydie shrugged her shoulders with impatience she knew whither lady eglintons praises of her son would drift presently the pompous lady looked for all the world like a fussy hen her stiff brocaded gown and voluminous paniers standing out in stiff folds each side of her portly figure like a pair of wings and to lydie daumonts proud spirit it seemed more than humiliating for a man rich young apparently in perfect health to allow himself to be domineered over by so vapid a personality as was milady eglinton  instinctively her thoughts flew back to gaston very different physically to le petit anglais undoubtedly not so attractive from the point of view of manly grace and bearing but a man for all that with a mans weaknesses and failings and just that spice of devilry and uncertainty in him which was pleasing to a woman  so unreliable my dear mlle daumont came in insinuating accents from lady eglinton look at his lengthy entanglement with mlle de saint romans  lydie gave a start sudden had she spoken her thoughts out loudly whilst her own mind was buried in happy retrospect she must have been dreaming momentarily certainly and must have been strangely absentminded for she was quite unconscious of having descended the alcove steps until she found herself walking between lord eglinton and his odious mother in the direction of the corridors whilst milady went prattling on with irritating monotony  you would find such support in my son the chevalier de saint georgeeri mean the king of englandtrusts him absolutely you understandthey have been friends since boyhood harry would do more for him if he could but he has not the power now as comptroller of financeyou understand you have such sympathy with the stuart pretensions mademoiselle and a union of sympathies would do much towards furthering the success of so just a cause and if my sonyou understand  lydies ears were buzzing with the incessant chatter had she not been so absorbed in her thoughts she would have laughed at the absurdity of the whole thing this insignificant nonentity beside her with the strength and character of a chicken pushed into a place of influence and power by that henlike mother and shelydielending a hand to this installation of a backboneless weakling to the highest position of france  the situation would have been supremely ridiculous were it not for the element of pathos in itthe pathos of a young life which might have been so brilliant so full of activity and interest now tied to the apronstrings of an interfering mother  lydie herself though accustomed to rule in one of the widest spheres that ever fell to womans lot wielded her sceptre with discretion and tact in these days when the king was ruled by pompadour when mme du châtelet swayed the mind of voltaire and marie thérèse subjugated the hungarians there was nothing of the blatant petticoat government in lydies influence over her father the obtrusive domination of a woman like milady was obnoxious and abhorrent to her mind proud of its feminity gentle in the consciousness of its strength  now she feared that forgetful of courtly manners she might say or do something which would offend the redoubtable lady there was still the whole length of the banquetinghall to traverse also the corridor before she could hope to be released from so unwelcome a companionship  apparently unconscious of having roused lydies disapproval milady continued to prattle her subject of conversation was still her son and noting that his attention seemed to be wandering she called to him in her imperious voice  harry harry she said impatiently am i to to be your spokesman from first to last ah she added with a sigh men are not what they were when i was wooed and won what say you my dear mlle lydie the age of chivalry of doughty deeds and bold adventures is indeed past and gone else a young man of lord eglintons advantages would not depute his own mother to do his courting for him  a shriek of laughter which threatened to be hysterical rose to lydies throat how gladly would she have beaten a precipitate retreat unfortunately the room was crowded with people who unconsciously impeded progress she turned and looked at le petit anglais the sorry hero of this prosaic wooing wondering what was his rôle in this silly childish intrigue she met his gentle eyes fixed upon hers with a look which somehow reminded her of a st bernard dog that she had once possessed there was such a fund of selfdeprecation such abject apology in the look that she felt quite unaccountably sorry for him and the laughter died before it reached her lips  something prompted her to try and reassure him the same feeling would have caused her to pat the head of her dog  i feel sure she said kindly that lord eglinton will have no need of a proxy once he sets his mind on serious wooing  but this is serious retorted lady eglinton testily lydie shook her head  as little serious as his lordships desire to control the finances of france  oh but who better fitted for the post than my son he is so richthe richest man in france and in these days of bribery and corruptionyou understand andand being partly englishnot wholly i am thankful to sayfor i abominate the english myself but we must own that they are very shrewd where money is concernedand  in the name of heaven milady said lydie irritably will you not allow your son to know his own mind if he has a request to place before m le duc my father or before me let him do so for himself  i thinkerperhaps mlle daumont is right here interposed lord eglinton gently you willeri hope excuse my mother mademoiselle she is so used to my consulting her in everything that perhaps you see he continued in his nervous halting way ii am rather stupid and i am very lazy she thinks i should understand finance because ibut i dont believe i should i  her earnest eyes fixed with goodhumoured indulgence upon his anxious face seemed to upset him altogether his throat was dry and his tongue felt as if it were several sizes too large for his parched mouth for the moment it looked as if the small modicum of courage which he possessed would completely give out but noting that just for the moment his mother was engaged in exchanging hasty greetings with a friend he seemed to make a violent and sudden effort and with the audacity which sometimes assails the preternaturally weak he plunged wildly into his subject  i have no desire for positions which i am too stupid to fill he said speaking so rapidly that lydie could hardly follow him but mademoiselle i entreat you do not believe that my admiration for you is not serious i know i am quite unworthy to be even your lacquey though i wouldnt mind being that since it would bring me sometimes near you please please dont look at mei am such a clumsy fool and i daresay i am putting things all wrong my mother says he added with a pathetic little sigh that i shall spoil everything if i open my mouth and now i have done it and you are angry and i wish to god somebody would come and give me a kick  he paused flushed panting and excited having come to the end of his courage whilst lydie did not know if she should be angry or sorry a smile hovered round her lips yet she would gladly have seen some manlike creature administer chastisement to this foolish weakling her keenly analytical mind flew at once to comparisons  gaston de stainvilleand now this poor specimen of manhood she had twice been wooed in this selfsame room within half an hour but how different had been the methods of courting a look of indulgence for the weak a flash of pride for the strong quickly lit up her statuesque face it was the strong who had won though womanlike she felt a kindly pity for him who did not even dare to ask for that which the other had so boldly claimed as his righther love  fortunately the têteàtête which was rapidly becoming embarrassingfor she really did not know how to reply to this strange and halting profession of lovewas at last drawing to a close at the end of the corridor charles edward stuart surrounded by a group of friends had caught sight of her and with gracious courtesy he advanced to meet her  ah the gods do indeed favour us he said gallantly in answer to her respectful salute and nodding casually to lady eglinton who had bobbed him a grudging curtsey we feared that our enemy time treading hard on our heels would force us to depart ere we had greeted our muse  your majesty is leaving us she asked so soon  alas the hour is late we start tomorrow at daybreak  god speed you sire she said fervently  to my death he rejoined gloomily  to victory sire and your majestys own kingdom she retorted cheerily nay i your humble yet most faithful adherent refuse to be cast down tonight see she added pointing to the group of gentlemen who had remained discreetly in the distance you have brave hearts to cheer you brave swords to help you  would i were sure of a brave ship to rescue me and them if i fail he murmured  she tossed her head with a characteristic movement of impatience  nay i was determined not to speak of failure tonight sire  yet must i think of it he rejoined since the lives of my friends are dependent on me  they give their lives gladly for your cause  i would prefer to think that a good ship from france was ready to take them aboard if evil luck force us to flee  france has promised you that ship monseigneur she said earnestly  if france meant you mademoiselle he said firmly i would believe in her  she almost means lydie daumont retorted the young girl with conscious pride  only for a moment broke in lady eglinton spitefully but girls marry she added and every husband may not be willing to be held under the sway of satin petticoats  if france fails you monseigneur here interposed a gentle voice i have already had the honour of assuring you that there is enough eglinton money still in the country to fit out a ship for your safety ander  then as if ashamed of this outburst the second of which he had been guilty tonight le petit anglais once more relapsed into silence but lydie threw him a look of encouragement  well spoken milor she said approvingly  with her quick intuition she had already perceived that milady was displeased and she took a malicious pleasure in dragging lord eglinton further into the conversation she knew quite well that milady cared naught about the stuarts or their fate from the day of her marriage she had dissociated herself from the cause for the furtherance of which her husbands father had given up home and country  it was her influence which had detached the late lord eglinton from the fortunes of the two pretenders justly perhaps since the expeditions were foredoomed to failure and protestant england rightly or wrongly mistrusted all the stuarts but lydies romantic instincts could not imagine an englishman in any other capacity save as the champion of the forlorn cause one of the principal reasons why she had always disliked the eglintons was because they held themselves aloof from the knot of friends who gathered round charles edward  she was therefore not a little surprised to hear le petit anglais promising at least loyal aid and succour in case of disaster since he could not give active support to the proposed expedition that he had made no idle boast when he spoke of eglinton money she knew quite well nor was it said in vain arrogance merely as a statement of fact miladys vexation proved that it was true  delighted and eager she threw herself with all the ardour of her romantic impulses into this new train of thought suggested by lord eglintons halting speech  ah milor she said joyously and not heeding lady eglintons scowl now that i have an ally in you my dream can become a reality nay sire you shall start for england with every hope every assurance of success but if you fail you and those you care for shall be safe will you listen to my plan  willingly  lord eglinton is your friendat least you trust him do you not  i trust absolutely in the loyalty of his house toward mine replied charles edward unhesitatingly  then do you agree with him and with him alone on a spot in england or scotland where a ship would find you in case of failure  that has been done already said eglinton simply  and if illluck pursues us we will make straight for that spot and await salvation from france  lydie said no more she was conscious of a distinct feeling of disappointment that her own plan should have been forestalled she had fondled the notion born but a moment ago that if her own influence were not sufficiently great in the near future to induce king louis to send a rescue ship for the young pretender if necessary she could then with lord eglintons money fit out a private expedition and snatch the last of the stuarts from the vengeance of his enemies the romantic idea had appealed to her and she had been forestalled she tried to read the thoughts of those around her lady eglinton was evidently ignorant of the details of the plan she seemed surprised and vastly disapproving charles edward was whispering a few hasty words in the ear of his friend whom obviously he trusted more than he did the word of france or the enthusiasm of mlle daumont  le petit anglais had relapsed into his usual state of nervousness and his eyes wandered uneasily from lydies face to that of his royal companion whilst with restless fingers he fidgeted the signet ring which adorned his left hand suddenly he slipped the ring off and charles edward stuart examined it very attentively then returned it to its owner with a keen look of intelligence and a nod of approval  lydie was indeed too late with her romantic plan these two men had thought it all out before her in every detaileven to the ring she too had thought of a token which would be an assurance to the fugitives that they might trust the bearer thereof she felt quite childishly vexed at all this it was an unusual thing in france these days to transact serious business without consulting mlle daumont  you are taking it for granted sire that france will fail you she said somewhat testily  nay why should you say that he asked  oh the ringthe obvious understanding between you and milor  was it not your wish mademoiselle  oh a mere suggestionin case france failed you and i were powerless to remind her of her promise  pa ma foi he rejoined gallantly and youll command me ill believe that contingency to be impossible the whole matter of the ring is a whim of eglintons and i swear that ill only trust to france and to you  no no she said quickly her own sound common sense coming to the rescue just in time to rout the unreasoning petulance of a while ago which truly had been unworthy of her it was foolish of me to taunt and i pray your majestys forgiveness it would have been joy and pride to me to feel that the plans for your majestys safety had been devised by me but i gladly recognize that milor eglinton hath in this matter the prior claim  her little speech was delivered so simply and with such a noble air of selfeffacement that it is small wonder that charles edward could but stand in speechless admiration before her she looked such an exquisite picture of proud and selfreliant womanhood as she stood there tall and erect the stiff folds of her white satin gown surrounding her like a frame of ivory round a dainty miniature tears of enthusiasm were in her eyes her lips were parted with a smile of encouragement her graceful head thrown slightly back and crowned with the burnished gold of her hair stood out in perfect relief against the softtoned gold and veined marble of the walls  i entreat you mademoiselle said the young pretender at last do not render my departure too difficult by showing me so plainly all that i relinquish when i quit the fair shores of france  your majesty leaves many faithful hearts in versailles none the less true because they cannot follow you nay but methinks lord eglinton and i will have to make a pact of friendship so that when your majesty hath gone we might often speak of you  speak of me often and to the king rejoined charles edward with a quick return to his former mood i have a premonition that i shall have need of his help  then he bowed before her and she curtsyed very low until her young head was almost down to the level of his knees he took her hand and kissed it with the respect due to an equal  farewell sire and god speed you she murmured he seemed quite reluctant to go gloom had once more completely settled over his spirits and lydie daumont clad all in white like some graceful statue carved in marble seemed to him the figure of hope on which a relentless fate forced him to turn his back  his friends now approached and surrounded him some were leaving versailles and france with him on the morrow others accompanied him in spirit only with good wishes and anxious sighs charles edward stuart the unfortunate descendant of an unfortunate race turned with a final appealing look to the man he trusted most  be not a broken reed to me eglinton he said sadly try and prevent france from altogether forgetting me  lydie averted her head in order to hide the tears of pity which had risen to her eyes  oh unfortunate prince if thine only prop is this poor weakling whose doglike affection has no moral strength to give it support  when she turned once more toward him ready to bid him a final adieu he was walking rapidly away from her down the long narrow corridor leaning on eglintons arm and closely surrounded by his friends in the far distance king louis the wellbeloved strolled leisurely toward his departing guest leaning lightly on the arm of mme la marquise de pompadour     chapter viii  the last trick   the noise of talk and laughter still filled the old château from end to end though the special guest of the evening had departed and royalty no longer graced the proceedings since his majesty had driven away to versailles after having bidden adieu to the chevalier de saint george m le duc daumonts less important visitors showed no signs as yet of wishing to break up this convivial night  the sound of dance music filled the air and from the salle darmes the merry strains of the gavotte the tripping of innumerable feet the incessant buzz of young voices reached the more distant corridor like an echo from fairyland  lydie had remained quite a little while leaning against the cool marble wall watching with eager intentness the group of gallant english and scotch gentlemen congregated round their young prince louis the wellbeloved with that graciousness peculiar to all the bourbons had severally and individually bidden goodbye to all each in turn had kissed the podgy white hand of the king of france who had been so benignant a host to them all none understood better than louis xv the art of leaving a pleasing impression on the mind of a departing friend he had a smile a jest a word of encouragement for each whilst jeanne de pompadour with one dainty hand on the kings shoulder the other flirting her fan emphasized each token of royal goodwill and of royal favour  ah milor dunkeld a pleasing journey to you m le marquis de perth i pray you do not amidst the fogs of england forget the sunshine of france sir andré seafield your absence will bring many tears to a pair of blue eyes i wot of  she pronounced the foreign names with dainty affectation and louis had much ado to keep his eyes away from that bright smiling face and those everrecurring dimples lydie felt a strange nausea at sight of these noble highborn gentlemen paying such reverential homage to the lowborn adventuress and a deep frown appeared between her eyes when she saw charles edward stuart bending as low before jeanne poisson as he had done just now before herlydie daughter of the duc daumont  bah what did it matter after all this world of irresponsible butterflies of petty machinations and selfseeking intrigues would she not quit it tomorrow for a land of poetry and romance where women wield no sceptre save that of beauty and where but one ruler is acknowledged and his name is love  she made a strenuous attempt to detach herself mentally from her surroundings with a great effort of her will she succeeded in losing sight of the individuality of all these people round her lady eglinton still talking at random beside her mme de pompadour yielding her hand to the kiss of a stuart prince that fat and pompous man whom duty bade her call your majesty all became mere puppetsdolls that laughed and chatted and danced hanging on invisible strings which the mighty hand of some grim giant was dangling for the amusement of his kind  how paltry it seemed all at once what did it matter if france was ruled by that vapid king or by that brainless overdressed woman beside him what did it matter if that young man with the shifty blue eyes and the fair curly hair succeeded in ousting another man from the english throne  what did matter was that gaston was not faithless that he loved her and that she had felt the sweetness of a first kiss  happily back in dreamland now she could once more afford to play her part amongst the marionettes she was willing to yield the string which made her dance and talk and move into the hands of the fiercely humorous giant up aloft no doubt it was he who pulled her along the corridor made her join the group that congregated round departing royalty  m le duc daumontthe perfect courtier and gentlemanwas already formulating his adieux his majesty the king of france would by the rigid rule of etiquette be the first to leave accompanied by mme de pompadour and followed by m le duc he was commencing his progress down the monumental staircase which led to the great entrance hall below  lydie still made to move no doubt by that invisible giant hand found it quite simple and easy to mingle with the crowd to take the kings arm being his hostess whilst m le duc her father and mme de pompadour followed close behind  with her spirit wandering in dreamland she was naturally somewhat distraitenot too much so only sufficiently to cause louis xv to make comparisons betwixt his sprightly jeanne and this animated statue whose cold little hand rested so impassively on the satin of his coat  at the foot of the perron the kings flemish horses as round of body and heavy of gait as himself were impatiently pawing the ground the opening of the great gates sent a wave of sweetscented air into the overheated château lydie was glad that her duty demanded that she should accompany the king down the steps to the door of his coach the cool night breeze fanned her cheeks most pleasingly the scent of june roses and of clove carnations filled the air and from below the terraced gardens there came the softlymurmuring ripple of the seine winding her graceful curves toward the mighty city of paris beyond  far away to the east beyond the grim outline of cedar and poplar trees a fair crescent moon appeared chaste and cold  an emblem of our fair hostess tonight said louis with clumsy gallantry and pointing up to the sky as lydie bent her tall figure and kissed the royal hand  then she stood aside having made a cold bow to mme de pompadour the fair marquise was accompanying his majesty to versailles she stepped into the coach beside him surrounded by murmurs of flattery and adulation even charles edward made her a final speech of somewhat forced gallantry he was the last to kiss her hand and lydie could almost hear the softly whispered words of entreaty with which he bade her not to forget  and jeanne poissondaughter of a kitchen wenchwas condescendingly gracious to a stuart prince then she calmly waved him aside whilst the king apparently was content to wait and called lady eglinton to the door of the coach  you are wasting too much time she whispered quickly an you dont hurry now you will be too late  at last the departure was effected the crowd with backbone bent and tricornes sweeping the ground waited in that uncomfortable position until the gilded coach and the men in gorgeous blue and gold liveries were swallowed in the gloom of the chestnut avenue then it broke up into isolated groups lydie had done her duty as hostess she had taken such leave as etiquette demanded from charles edward stuart and his friends coaches and chairs came up to the perron in quick succession now bearing the adventurers away on this the first stage of their hazardous expedition when would they sup again in such luxury when would the froufrou of silk the flutter of fans the sound of dance music once more pleasantly tickle their ears tomorrow and for many a long day to come it would be hurried meals in outoftheway places the call to horse the clink of arms  puppets puppets all for what did it matter  lydie would have loved to have lingered out on the terrace awhile longer the oakleaved geraniums down at the foot of the terrace steps threw an intoxicating lemonscented fragrance in the air the row of stunted orange trees still bore a few tardy blossoms and in the copse yonder away from the din and the bustle made by the marionettes it must be delicious to wander on the carpet of moss and perchance to hear the melancholy note of a nightingale  do you think not mademoiselle that this night air is treacherous said lord eglinton with his accustomed diffidence you seem to be shivering will you allow me the honour of bringing your cloak  she thanked him quite kindly somehow his gentle voice did not jar on her mood since gaston was not there she felt that she would sooner have this unobtrusive pleasant man beside her than any one else he seemed to have something womanish and tender in his feeble nature which his mother lacked perhaps milady had divested herself of her natural attributes in order to grace her son with them since she had been unable to instil more manly qualities into him  but lydies heart ached for a sight of gaston the clock in the tower of the old château chimed the hour before midnight it was but half an hour since she had parted from him on the steps of the alcove she remembered quite distinctly hearing the bracket clock close by strike halfpast ten at the same moment as pompadours shrill laugh broke upon her ear  half an hour why it seemed a lifetime since then and while she had made her bow to the stuart prince and then to king louis while she had allowed the unseen giant to move her from place to place on a string perhaps gaston had been seeking for her perhaps his heart had longed for her too and a sting of jealousy of her multifarious social duties was even now marring the glory of happy memories  without another moments hesitation she turned her back on the peaceful gloom of the night on the silver crescent moon the fragrance of carnations and orangeblossoms and walked quickly up the perron steps with a hasty you are right milor the night air is somewhat chilling and my guests will be awaiting me thrown over her shoulder at her bashful cavalier  beyond the noble entrance doors the vast hall was now practically deserted save for a group of flunkeys gorgeous and solemn who stood awaiting the departure of their respective masters at the farther end which led to the main corridor lydie to her chagrin caught sight of lady eglintons brobdingnagian back  what an obsession she sighed and hoped that milady would fail to notice her already she was planning hasty flight along a narrow passage when a question authoritatively put by her ladyship to a magnificent person clad in a purple livery with broad white facings arrested her attention  is your master still in the boudoir do you know  i do not know mme la marquise the man replied i have not seen m le comte since half an hour  the purple livery with broad white facings was that of the comte de stainville  i have a message for m le comte from mme de pompadour said lady eglinton carelessly ill find him i daresay  and she turned into the great corridor  lydie no longer thought of flight an unexplainable impulse caught her to change her mind and to follow in lady eglintons wake she could not then have said if le petit anglais was still near her not she had for the moment forgotten his insignificant existence  there was an extraordinary feeling of unreality about herself and her movements about the voluminous person ahead clad in largeflowered azure brocade and closely followed by a stiff automaton in purple and white they seemed to be leading her along some strange and unexpected paths at the end of which lydie somehow felt sure that grinning apes would be awaiting her  anon lady eglinton paused with her hand on the handle of a door she caught sight of mlle daumont and seemed much surprised to see her there she called to her by name in that harsh voice which lydie detested whilst the obsequious automaton came forward and relieved her from the trouble of turning that handle herself  allow me milady  the door flew open the flunkey at the same moment also drew a heavy curtain aside  lydie had just come up quite close in answer to lady eglintons call she was standing facing the door when bénédict threw it open announcing with mechanical correctness of attitude  mme la marquise deglinton m le comte  at first lydie only saw gaston as he turned to face the intruders his face was flushed and he muttered a quicklysuppressed oath but already she had guessed even before lady eglintons strident voice had set her every nerve atingling  mlle de saint romans said milady with a shrill laugh a thousand pardons i had a message from mme de pompadour for m le comte de stainville and thought to find him alone a thousand pardons i begthe intrusion was involuntaryand the message unimportantill deliver it when monsieur is less pleasantly engaged  lydie at that moment could not have stirred one limb if her very life had depended on a movement from her the feeling of unreality had gone it was no longer that it was a grim hideous awful reality that beautiful woman there was reality and real too were the glowing eyes that flashed defiance at milady the lips parted for that last kiss which the flunkeys voice had interrupted the stray black curls which had escaped from the trammels of the elaborate coiffure and lay matted on the damp forehead  and those roses too which had adorned her corsage now lying broken and trampled on the floor the candles burning dimly in their sockets and gastons look of wrath quickly followed by one of fearallall that was real  real to the awful shame of it allmiladys sneer of triumph the oath which had risen to gastons lips the wooden figure of the lacquey standing impassive at the door  instinctively lydies hand flew to her lips oh that she could have wiped out the last lingering memory of that kiss she the proud and reserved vestal a diana chaste and cold with lips now for ever polluted by contact with those of a liar a liar a traitor a sycophant she lashed her haughty spirit into fury the better to feel the utter degradation of her own abasement  she did not speak what could she say one look at gastons face and she understood that her humiliation was complete his eyes did not even seek her pardon they expressed neither sorrow nor shame only impotent wrath and fear of baffled ambition not before all these people would she betray herself before that beautiful rival or that vulgar intrigante not before gaston or his lacquey and beyond that mechanical movement of hand to lips beyond one short flash of unutterable pride and contempt she remained silent and rigid whilst her quick eyes took in a complete mental vision of that never tobeforgotten picturethe dimlylighted boudoir the defiant figure of irène de saint romans the crushed roses on the floor  then with a heartbroken sigh unheard by the other actors in this moving tableaux and covering her face with her hands she began to walk rapidly down the corridor     chapter ix  the winning hand   but lydie daumont had not gone five paces before she heard a quick sharp call followed by the rustle of silk on the marble floor  the next moment she felt a firm hot grip on her wrist and her left hand was forcibly drawn away from her face whilst an eager voice spoke quick vehement words the purport of which failed at first to reach her brain  you shall not go mlle daumont were the first coherent words which she seemed to understandyou cannotit is not just not fair until you have heard  there is nothing which i need hear interrupted lydie coldly the moment she realized that it was irène de saint romans who was addressing her and i pray you to let me go  nay but you shall hear you must rejoined the other without releasing her grasp on the young girls wrist her hand was hot and her fingers had the strength of intense excitement lydie could not free herself strive how she might  do you not see that this is most unfair continued irène with great volubility am i to be snubbed like some kitchen wench caught kissing behind doorways look at milady eglinton and her illnatured sneer ill not tolerate it nor your looks of proud contempt ill notill not gaston gaston she now exclaimed turning to de stainville who was standing silent and sullen whilst he saw his wife gradually lashing herself into wrathful agitation at his own indifference and lydies cold disdain if you have a spark of courage left in you tell that malicious intrigante and this scornful minx that if i were to spend the whole evening in the boudoir en têteàtête with you aye and behind closed doors if i chose who shall have a word to say when i am in the company of my own husband  your husband  the ejaculation came from lady eglintons astonished lips lydie had not stirred she did not seem to have heard and certainly irènes triumphant announcement left her as cold as impassive as before what did it matter after all what special form gastons lies to her had assumed nothing that he or irène said or did could add to his baseness and infamy  aye my husband milady continued the other more calmly as she finally released lydies wrist and cast it laughing from her i am called mme la comtesse de stainville and will be called so in the future openly now you may rejoin your guests mlle daumont my reputation stands as far beyond reproach as did your own before you spent a mysterious half hour with my husband behind the curtains of an alcove  she turned to de stainville who in spite of his wifes provocative attitude had remained silent cursing the evil fate which had played him this trick cursing the three women who were both the cause and the witnesses of his discomfiture  your arm gaston she said peremptorily and you benedict call your masters coach and my chair mlle daumont your servant if i have been the means of dissipating a happy illusion you may curse me now but you will bless me tomorrow gaston has been false to youhe is not over true to mebut he is my husband and as such i must claim him for the sake of his schemes of his ambitions i kept our marriage a secret so that he might rise to higher places than i had the power to give him when your disdainful looks classed me with a flirty kitchenwench i rebelled at last i trust that you are proud enough not to vent your disappointment on gaston but if you do tis no matter ill find means of consoling him  she made the young girl a low and sweeping curtesy in the most approved style demanded by the elabourate etiquette of the time there was a gleam of mocking triumph in her eyes which she did not attempt to conceal and which suddenly stung lydies pride to the quick  it is strange indeed that often at a moment when a womans whole happiness is destroyed with one blow when a gigantic cataclysm revolutionises with one fell swoop her entire mode of thought dispels all her dreams and shatters her illusions it is always the tiny final pinprick which causes her the most acute pain and influences the whole of her subsequent conduct  it was irènes mocking curtsey which roused lydie from her mental torpor because it brought heras it werein actual physical contact with all that she would have to endure openly in the future as apart from the hidden misery of her heart  gastons shamed face was no longer the only image which seared her eyes and brain the world her own social world seemed all at once to reawaken before her that world would sneer even as irène de stainville sneered it would laugh at and enjoy her own discomfiture shelydie daumontthe proud and influential daughter of the prime minister of france whom flatterers and sycophants approached mentally on bended knees for whom suitors hardly dared even to sigh she had been tricked and fooled like any silly country mouse whose vanity had led to her own abasement  half an hour ago in the fullness of her newlyfound happiness she had flaunted her pride and her love before those who hated and envied her tomorrownay within an hourthis humiliating scene would be the talk of paris and versailles lydies burning ears seemed even now to hear the pompadour retailing it with many embellishments which would bring a coarse laugh to the lips of the king and an illnatured jest to those of her admirers she could hear the jabbering crowd could feel the looks of compassion or sarcasm aimed at her as soon at this titbit of society scandal had been bruited abroad  the scene itself had become real and vivid to her the marble corridor the flickering candles the flunkeys impassive face she understood that the beautiful woman before her was in fact and deed the wife of gaston de stainville she even contrived to perceive the humour of lady eglintons completely bewildered expression the blank astonishment of her round bulgy eyes and close to her she saw le petit anglais selfeffaced as usual and looking almost as guilty as shamefaced as gaston  lydie turned to him and placed a cool steady hand upon his sleeve  madame la comtesse de stainville she then said with perfect calm i fear me i must beg of your courtesy to tarry awhile longer whilst i offer you an explanation to which i feel you are entitled just now i was somewhat surprised because your news was suddenand it is my turn to ask your pardon although my faultif fault there berests on a misapprehension m le comte de stainvilles amours or his marriage are no concern of mine true he begged for my influence and fawned upon my favour just now for his ambition soared to the post of high controller of the finances of france that appointment rests with the duc my father who no doubt will bestow it on him whom he thinks most worthy but it were not fair to me if you left me now thinking that the announcement of your union with a gentleman whose father was the friend of mine could give me aught but pleasure permit me to congratulate you madame on the choice of a lord and master a helpmeet no doubt you are indeed well matched i am all the more eager to offer you my good wishes as i have been honoured tonight with a proposal which has greatly flattered me my lord the marquis of eglinton has asked me to be his wife  once more she turned her head toward the young englishman and challenged a straight look from his eyes he did not waver and she was satisfied her instinct had not misled her for he expressed no astonishment only a sort of doglike gratitude and joy as having returned her gaze quite firmly he now slowly raised his arm bringing her hand on a level with his lips  lady eglinton also displayed sufficient presence of mind not to show any surprise she perhaps alone of all those present fully realized that lydie had been wounded to the innermost depths of her heart and that she herself owed her own and her sons present triumph to the revolt of mortified pride  what gaston thought and felt exactly it were difficult to say he held women in such slight esteem and his own vanity was receiving so severe a blow that no doubt he preferred to think that lydie like himself had no power of affection and merely bestowed her heart there where selfinterest called  irène on the other hand heaved a sigh of relief the jealous suspicions which had embittered the last few days were at last dispelled hers was a simple shallow nature that did not care to look beyond the obvious she certainly appeared quite pleased at lydies announcement and if remorse at her precipitancy did for one brief second mar the fullness of her joy she quickly cast it from her not having yet had time to understand the future and more serious consequences of her impulsive avowal  she wanted to go up to lydie and to offer her vapid expressions of goodwill but gaston heartily tired of the prolongation of this scene dragged her somewhat roughly away  from the far distance there came the cry of the flunkeys  the chair of mlle de saint romans  the coach of m le comte de stainville  m bénédict resplendent in purple and white reappeared at the end of the corridor with irènes hood and cloak gaston with his wife on his arm turned on his heel and quickly walked down the corridor  milady puzzled bewildered boundlessly overjoyed yet fearing to trust her luck too far had just a sufficient modicum of tact left in her to retire discreetly within the boudoir  lydie suddenly found herself alone in this wide corridor with the man whom she had so impulsively dragged into her life she looked round her somewhat helplessly and her eyes encountered those of her future lord fixed upon hers with that same air of doglike gentleness which she knew so well and which always irritated her  milor she said very coldly i must thank you for your kind coöperation just now that you expressed neither surprise nor resentment does infinite credit to your chivalry  if i was a little surprised mademoiselle he said haltingly i was too overjoyed to show it andand i certainly felt no resentment  he came a step nearer to her but for this she was not prepared and drew back with a quick movement and a sudden stiffening of her figure  i hope you quite understood milor that there is no desire on my part to hold you to this bond she said icily i am infinitely grateful to you for the kind way in which you humoured my impulse tonight and if you will have patience with me but a very little while i promise you that i will find an opportunity for breaking without too great a loss of dignity these bonds which already must be very irksome to you  nay mademoiselle he said gently you are under a misapprehension believe me you would find it wellnigh impossible totoerto alter your plans now without loss of dignity andereri assure you that the bonds are not irksome to me  you would hold me to this bargain then  for your sake mademoiselle as well as mine we must now both be held to it  it seems unfair on you milor  on me mademoiselle  yes on you she repeated with a thought more gentleness in her voice you are young milor you are richsoon you will regret the sense of honour which ties you to a woman who has only yielded her hand to you out of pique nay ill not deceive you she added quickly noting the sudden quiver of the kind little face at her stinging words i have no love for you milorall that was young and fresh womanly and tender in my heart was buried just here tonight  and with a mournful look she glanced round at the cold marble of the walls the open door to that boudoir beyond the gilded sconces which supported the dimlyburning candles then smitten with sudden remorse she said eagerly with one of those girlish impulses which rendered her domineering nature so peculiarly attractive  but if i can give you no love milor heaven and my fathers indulgence have given me something which i know men hold far greater of importance than a womans heart i have influence boundless influence as you knowthe state appointed controller of finance will be the virtual ruler of france his position will give him power beyond the dreams of any mans ambition my father will gladly give the post to my husband and  but here a somewhat trembling hand was held deprecatingly toward her  mademoiselle i entreat you said lord eglinton softly for the sake of your own dignity andand mine do not allow your mind to dwell on such matters believe me i am fully conscious of the honour which you did me just now in deigning to place your trust in me that i havehave loved you mlle lydie he added with a nervous quiver in his young voice ever since i first saw you at this court ii cannot deny butand here he spoke more firmly seeing that once again she seemed to draw away from him to stiffen at his approach but that simple and natural fact need not trouble you i could not help loving you for you are more beautiful than anything on earth and you cannot deem my adoration an offence though you are as cold and pure as the goddess of chastity herself i have seen catholics kneeling at the shrine of the virgin mary their eyes were fixed up to her radiant image their lips murmured an invocation or sometimes a hymn of praise but their hands were clasped together they never even raised them once toward that shrine which they had built for her and from which she smiled whilst listening coldly to their prayers mlle daumont you need have no mistrust of my deep respect for you you are the madonna and i the humblest of your worshippers i am proud to think that the name i bear will be the shrine wherein your pride will remain enthroned if you have need of me in the future you must command me but though the law of france will call me your husband and your lord i will be your bondsman and serve you on my knees and though my very soul aches for the mere touch of your hand my lips will never pollute even the hem of your gown his trembling voice had sunk down to a whisper if she heard or not he could not say from far away there came to his ears the tender melancholy drone of the instruments playing the slow movement of the gavotte his madonna had not stirred only her hand which he so longed to touch trembled a little as she toyed with her fan  and like the worshippers at the virgins shrine he bent his knee and knelt at her feet     part ii  the statesman     chapter x  the beggar on horseback   monsieur le marquis deglinton comptrollergeneral of finance chevalier of the order of st louis peer of england and of france occupied the west wing of the château of versailles his majesty the king had frequent and urgent need of him mme de pompadour could scarce exist a day without an interview behind closed doors with the most powerful man in france with him who at the bidding of the nation was set up as a bar to the extravagances of her own caprice  and le petit lever of m le contrôleur was certainly more largely attended than that of m le duc daumont or evensoftly be it whisperedthan that of his majesty himself for although every one knew that m le marquis was but a figurehead and that all graces and favours emanated direct from the hand of mme la marquise lydie yet every one waited upon his good pleasure for very much the same reason that those who expected or hoped something from the king invariably kissed the hand of mme de pompadour  m le contrôleur very much enjoyed these petits levers of his which were considered the most important social events in versailles he was very fond of chocolate in the morning and m achillethat prince of valetsbrought it to his bedside with such inimitable grace and withal the beverage itself so aromatic and so hot that this hour between ten and eleven each day had become extremely pleasant  he had no idea that being comptrollergeneral of finance was quite so easy and agreeable an occupation else he had not been so diffident in accepting the post but in reality it was very simple he governed france from the depths of his extremely comfortable bed draped all round with rich satin hangings of a soft azure colour embroidered with motifs of dull gold which were vastly pleasing to the eye here he was conscious of naught save fine linen of a remarkably silken texture of a lace coverlet priceless in value of the scent of his steaming chocolate and incidentally of a good many pleasant faces and some unamiable ones and of a subdued hivelike buzz of talk which went on at the further end of the room whilst m achille administered to his comforts and mme de pompadour or mme la comtesse de stainville told him piquant anecdotes  yes it was all very pleasant and not at all difficult a wave of the hand in the direction of mme la marquise his wife who usually sat in a window embrasure overlooking the park was all that was needed when petitioners were irksome or subjects too abstruse  lydie was so clever with all that sort of thing she had the mind of a politician and the astuteness of an attorney and she liked to govern france in an energetic way of her own which left milor free of all responsibility if anything happened to go wrong  but then nothing ever did go wrong france went on just the same as she had done before some of her more meddlesome parliaments insisted on having a comptroller of finance at the head of affairs mme de pompadour still spent a great deal of money and the king still invariably paid her debts whereupon his pockets being empty he applied to m le contrôleur for something with which to replenish them m le contrôleur thereupon ordered m achille to bring one more cup of aromatic chocolate for mme de pompadour whilst his majesty the king spent an uncomfortable quarter of an hour with mme la marquise deglinton  the usual result of this quarter of an hour was that his majesty was excessively wrathful against mme lydie for quite a fortnight but no one could be angry with le petit anglais for he was so very amiable and dispensed such exceedingly good chocolate  par ma foi it is remarkably easy to govern a country if one happen to have a wifethat at least had been milors experiencea wife and a perfect valetdechambre  m achille since his marquiss elevation to the most important position in france had quite surpassed himself in his demeanour he stood on guard beside the azure and gold hangings of his masters bed like a veritable gorgon turning the most importunate petitioners to stone at sight of his severe and repressive visage  oh achille was an invaluable asset in the governing of this kingdom of france achille knew the reason of each and every individuals presence at the petit lever of milor he knew who was the most likely and most worthy person to fill any post in the country that happened to be vacant from that of examiner of stars and planets to his majesty the king down to that of underscullion in the kitchen of versailles  had he not been the means of introducing baptiste durand to the special notice of m le marquis durands daughter being girlinwaiting to m joseph valetdechambre to m le duc daumont and personal friend of m achille what more natural than when milor wanted a secretary to make notes for him and towell to be present if he happened to be wantedthat the worthy baptiste should with perfect ease slip into the vacant post  and baptiste durand was remarkably useful  a small antechamber had been allotted for his occupation through which all those who were on their way to the petit lever held in milors own bedchamber had of necessity to pass and baptiste knew exactly who should be allowed to pass and who should not without venturing even to refer to his majesty to mme de pompadour to monseigneur le dauphin or persons of equally exalted rank the faithful chroniclers of the time tell us that no gentleman was allowed a private audience with m le contrôleurgénéral if his valetdechambre was not a personal friend of monsieur durand  there sat the worthy baptiste enthroned behind a secretaire which was always littered with papers petitions letters the usual paraphernalia that pertains to a man of influence his meagre person was encased in a coat and breeches of fine scarlet cloth whereon a tiny fillet of gold suggested without unduly flaunting the heraldic colours of the house of eglinton he wore silk stockingsalways and shoes with cutsteel buckles whilst frills of broidered lawn encircled his wrists and cascaded above his waistcoat  he invariably partook of snuff when an unknown and unrecommended applicant presented himself in his sanctum my good friend it is impossible he was saying on this very morning of august 13 1746 with quiet determination to a petitioner who was becoming too insistent milors chamber is overcrowded as it is  ill call againanother day perhaps my master is anxious for a personal interview with yours  whereupon m durands eyebrows were lifted upward until they almost came in contact with his perruque he fetched out a voluminous handkerchief from his pocket and carefully removed a few grains of dust from his cravat then he said without raising his voice in the slightest degree or showing impatience in any way at the mans ignorance and stupidity  my good what is your name i forgot  i am hypolite françois confidential valet to m le maréchal de coigni and  m durands thin and delicately veined hand went up in gentle deprecation  ma foi my worthy coigni tis all the same to me if you are a maréchal or a simple lieutenant as for me young man he added with dignified severity remember in future that i serve no one i assist m le contrôleurgénéral des finances totohe paused a second waving his hand and turning the phrase over in his mouth whilst seeking for its most appropriate conclusionto in fact make a worthy selection amidst the hundreds and thousands of petitions which are presented to him  and with a vague gesture he indicated the papers which lay in a disordered heap on his secretaire  for the rest my good coigni he added with the same impressive dignity let me assure you once again that m le marquiss bedchamber is overcrowded that he is busily engaged at the present moment and is likely to be so for some considerable time to come what is it your maréchal wants  his pension replied hypolite curtly and the vacant post in the ministry of war  impossible we have fourteen likely applicants already  m le maréchal is sure that if he could speak with m le contrôleur  m le contrôleur is busy  tomorrow then  tomorrow he will be even more busy than today  m durand pleaded hypolite  impossible you are wasting my time my good coigni i have hundreds to see today  not for your daughters sake  my daughter  yes didnt you know you remember henriette her great friend  yes yeslittle henriette dessy the milliner assented m durand with vast condescension a pretty wench she was at the ursulines convent school with my daughter they have remained great friends ever since what about little henriette  mlle henriette is my fiancée quoth the other eagerly and i thought  your fiancée little henriette dessy said m durand gaily pardieu my good coigni why did you not tell me so before my daughter is very fond of henriettea pretty minx par ma foi hé hé  you are very kind m durand  mais non mais non said the great man with much affability one is always ready to oblige a friend hé now give me your hand friend coigni shoot your rubbish alongquoiyour maréchal he may pass this way anything one can do to oblige a friend  with the affairs of m le maréchal de coigni the present chronicle hath no further concern but we know that some ten minutes later on this same august 13 1746 he succeeded in being present at the petit lever of m le contrôleurgénéral des finances once within the secret precincts of the bedchamber he like so many other petitioners and courtiers was duly confronted by the stony stare of m achille and found himself face to face with an enormous bedstead of delicately painted satinwood and ormulu mounts draped with heavy azure silk curtains which hung down from a gilded baldachin the whole a masterpiece of the furnituremakers art  the scent of chocolate filled his nostrils and he vaguely saw a goodlooking young man reclining under a coverlet of magnificent venetian lace and listening placidly to what was obviously a very amusing tale related to him by wellrouged lips from the billowy satins and laces of the couch a delicate hand was waved toward him as he attempted to pay his respects to the most powerful man in france the next moment the same stonyfaced gorgon clad in scarlet and gold beckoned to him to follow and he found himself being led through the brilliantly dressed crowd toward a compact group of backs which formed a sort of living wall painted in delicate colours of green and mauve and gray and duly filled up the approach to the main window embrasure  it is interesting to note from the memoirs of m le comte dargenson that the maréchal de coigni duly filled the post of state secretary to the minister of war from the year 1746 onward we may therefore presume that he succeeded in piercing that wall of respectful backs and in reaching sufficiently far within the charmed circle to attract the personal attention of mme la marquise lydie deglinton née daumont  he had therefore cause to bless the day when his valetdechambre became the fiancé of mlle henriette dessy the intimate friend of m baptiste durands dearly beloved daughter     chapter xi  la belle irÈne   monsieur durand had indeed not exaggerated when he spoke of m le contrôleurs bedchamber being overcrowded this same eventful morning  all that france possessed of nobility of wit and of valour seemed to have found its way on this beautiful day in august past the magic portal guarded by baptiste the dragon to the privileged enclosure beyond where milor in elegant robe de chambre reclined upon his gorgeous couch whilst madame clad in hooped skirt and panniers of dovegray silk directed the affairs of france from the embrasure of a window  achille my shoes  we must surmise that his lordship had been eagerly awaiting the striking of the bracket clock which immediately faced the bed for the moment the musical chimes had ceased to echo in the crowded room he had thrown aside the lace coverlet which had lain across his legs and called peremptorily for his valet  only halfpast ten milor came in reproachful accents from a pair of rosy lips  ma foi so it is exclaimed lord eglinton with wellfeigned surprise as he once more glanced up at the clock  were you then so bored in my company rejoined the lady with a pout that you thought the hour later  bored he exclaimed bored did you say madame perish the very thought of boredom in the presence of mme la comtesse de stainville  but in spite of this gallant assertion m le contrôleur seemed in a vast hurry to quit the luxuriance of his azurehung throne m achillethat paragon among flunkeyslooked solemnly reproachful surely milor should have known by now that etiquette demanded that he should stay in bed until he had received every person of high rank who desired an intimate audience  there were still some highborn exalted and much beribboned gentlemen who had not succeeded in reaching the inner precincts of that temple and fount of honours and richesthe bedside of m le contrôleur but monseigneur le prince de courtenai was therehe in whose veins flowed royal blood and who spent a strenuous life in endeavouring to make france recognize this obvious fact he sat in an armchair at the foot of the bed discussing the unfortunate events of june 16th at piacenza and young comte de mailleboiss subsequent masterly retreat on tortone with christian louis de montmorenci duc de luxembourg the worthy son of an able father and newly created marshal of france  close to them monsieur le comte de vermandois grand admiral of france was intent on explaining to m le chancelier daguesseau why england just now was supreme mistress of the seas m disenghien talked poetry to jolyot crébillon and m le duc dharcourt discussed voltaires latest play with excomedian and exambassador néricaultdestouche whilst mme la comtesse de stainville still called la belle brune de bordeaux by her many admirers had been endeavouring to divert m le contrôleurs attention from this multiplicity of abstruse subjects  outside this magic circle there was a gap a barrier of parquet flooring which no one would dare to traverse without a distinct look of encouragement from m achille his majesty had not yet arrived and tongues wagged freely in the vast and gorgeous room with its row of tall windows which gave on the great slopes of the park of versailles through them came the pleasing sound of the perpetual drip from the monumental fountains the twitter of sparrows the scent of lingering roses and of belated lilies no other sound from that outside world no other life save the occasional footstep of a gardener along the sanded walks but within all was chatter and bustle women talked men laughed and argued society scandals were commented upon and the newest fashions in coiffures discussed the men wore cloth coats of sober hues but the women had donned lightcoloured dresses for the summer was at its height and this august morning was aglow with sunshine  mme de stainvilles rosecoloured gown was the one vivid patch of colour in the picture of delicate hues she stood close to m le contrôleurs bedside and unceremoniously turned her back on the rest of the company we must presume that she was a very privileged visitor for no onenot even monseigneur le prince de courtenaiventured to approach within earshot it was understood that in milors immediate entourage la belle irène alone was allowed to be frivolous and we are told that she took full advantage of this permission  all chroniclers of the period distinctly aver that the lady was vastly entertaining even m de voltaire mentions her as one of the sprightliest women of that lighthearted and vivacious court beautiful too beyond cavil her position as the wife of one of the most brilliant cavaliers that eer graced the entourage of mme de pompadour gave her a certain dignity of bearing a selfconscious gait and proud carriage of the head which had considerably added to the charms which she already possessed the stiff ungainly mode of the period suited her somewhat full figure to perfection the tight corslet bodice the wide panniers the ridiculous hooped skirtall seemed to have been specially designed to suit the voluptuous beauty of irène de stainville  m dargenson when speaking of her has described her very fully he speaks of her abnormally small waist which seemed to challenge the support of a masculine arm and of her creamy skin which she knew so well how to veil in transparent folds of filmy lace she made of dress a special study and her taste though daring was always sure even during these early morning receptions when softtoned mauves tender drabs or grays were mostly in evidence irène de stainville usually appeared in brocade of brilliant rosyred turquoise blue or emerald green she knew that these somewhat garish tones mellowed only through the richness of the material set off to perfection the matt ivory tint of her complexion and detached her entire person from the rest of the picture  yet even her most ardent admirers tell us that irène de stainvilles vanity went almost beyond the bounds of reason in its avidity for fulsome adulation consciousness of her own beauty was not sufficient she desired its acknowledgment from others she seemed to feed on flattery breathing it in with every pore of her delicate skin drooping like a parched flower when full measure was denied to her many aver that she marred her undoubted gifts of wit through this insatiable desire for one sole topic of conversationher own beauty and its due meed of praise at the same time her love of direct and obsequious compliments was so ingenuous and she herself so undeniably fascinating that in the heyday of her youth and attractions she had no difficulty in obtaining ready response to her wishes from the highly susceptible masculine element at the court of louis xv  m le contrôleurgénéralwhom she specially honoured with her smileshad certainly no intention of shirking the pleasing duty attached to this distinction and though he was never counted a brilliant conversationalist he never seemed at a loss for the exact word of praise which would tickle la belle irènes ears most pleasantly  and truly no mans heart could be sufficiently adamant to deny to that brilliantlyplumaged bird the titbits which it loved the best milor himself had all the sensitiveness of his race where charmssuch as irène freely displayed before himwere concerned and when her smiling lips demanded acknowledgment of her beauty from him he was ready enough to give it  let them settle the grave affairs of state over there she had said to him this morning when first she made her curtsey before him and with a provocative smile she pointed to the seriouslooking group of grave gentlemen that surrounded his bedside and also to the compact row of backs which stood in serried ranks round mme la marquise deglinton in the embrasure of the central window life is too short for such insignificant trifles  we only seem to last long enough to make love thoroughly to half a dozen pretty women in a lifetime replied m le contrôleur as he gallantly raised her fingers to his lips  half a dozen she retorted with a pout ah milor i see that your countrymen are not maligned the english have such a reputation for perfidy  but i have become so entirely french he protested england would scarce know me now  and with a whimsical gesture he pointed to the satin hangings of his bed the rich point lace coverlet and to his own very elaborate and elegant robe de chambre  is that said in regret she asked  nay he replied there is no more place for regret than there is for boredom in sight of smiles from those perfect lips  she blushed and allowed her handswhich were particularly beautifulto finger idly the silks and laces which were draped so tastefully about his person as her eyes were downcast in dainty and becoming confusion she failed to notice that m le contrôleur was somewhat absentminded this morning and that had he dared he would at this juncture undoubtedly have yawned but of this she was obviously unconscious else she had not now murmured so persuasively  am i beautiful  what a question he replied  the most beautiful woman here present she insisted  par ma foi he protested gaily was ever married man put in so awkward a predicament  married man bah and she shrugged her pretty shoulders  i am a married man fair lady and the law forbids me to answer so provoking a question  this is cowardly evasion she rejoined mme la marquise your wife only acknowledges one supremacythat of the mind she would scorn to be called the most beautiful woman in the room  and m le comte de stainville your lord would put a hole right through my body were i now to speak the unvarnished truth  irène apparently chose to interpret milors equivocal speech in the manner most pleasing to her selflove she looked over her shoulder toward the window embrasure she saw that mme la marquise deglintons court was momentarily dismissed and that m le duc daumont had just joined his daughter she also saw that lydie looked troubled and that she threw across the room a look of haughty reproof  nothing could have pleased irène de stainville more  apart from the satisfaction which her own inordinate vanity felt at the present moment by enchaining milors attention and receiving his undivided homage in full sight of the élite of aristocratic versailles there was the additional pleasure of dealing a pinprick or so to a woman who had once been her rival and who was undoubtedly now the most distinguished as she was the most adulated personality in france  irène had never forgiven lydie gastons defalcations on that memorable night when a humiliating exposure and subsequent scene led to the disclosure of her own secret marriage and thus put a momentary check on her husbands ambitious schemes  from that check he had since then partially recovered mme de pompadours good graces which she never wholly withdrew from him had given him a certain position of influence and power from which his lack of wealth would otherwise have debarred him but even with the uncertain and fickle marquises help gaston de stainville was far from attaining a position such as his alliance with lydie would literally have thrown into his lap such of course as fell to the share of the amiable milor who had succeeded in capturing the golden prey in these days of petticoat government feminine protection was the chief leverage for advancement irène however could do nothing for her husband without outside help conscious of her own powers of fascination she had cast about for the most likely prop on which she could lean gracefully whilst helping gaston to climb upward  the king himself was too deeply in the toils of his fair jeanne to have eyes for any one save for her m le duc daumont prime minister of france was his daughters slave there remained m le contrôleurgénéral himselfa figurehead as far as the affairs of state were concerned but wielding a great deal of personal power through the vastness of his wealth which lydie rather affected to despise  irène thereforefaute de mieuxturned her languishing eyes upon m le contrôleur her triumph was pleasing to herself and might in due course prove useful to gaston if she succeeded presently in counterbalancing lydies domineering influence over milor for the moment her vanity was agreeably soothed although la belle brune de bordeaux herself was fully alive to the fact that while her whispered conversations at milors petits levers her sidelong glances and conscious blushes called forth enough mischievous oglings and equivocal jests from the more frivolous section of society butterflies lydie only viewed her and her machinations with cold and somewhat humiliating indifference  and as m dargenson very pertinently remarked that selfsame morning would any beautiful woman care to engage the attentions of a man unless she aroused at the same time the jealousy or at least the annoyance of a rival     chapter xii  the promises of france   indeed if irène de stainville had possessed more penetration or had at any rate studied lydies face more closely she would never have imagined for a moment that thoughts of petty spite or of feminine pique could find place in the busiest brain that ever toiled for the welfare of france  history has no doubt said the last word on the subject of that brief interregnum when a womans masterful hand tried to check the extravagances of a king and the ruinous caprices of a wanton and when a womans will tried to restrain a nation in its formidable onrush down the steep incline which led to the abyss of the revolution  many historians have sneeredperhaps justly soat this apotheosis of feminity and pointed to the fact that while that special era of petticoat government lasted louis xv in no way stopped his excesses nor did pompadour deny herself the satisfaction of a single whim whilst france continued uninterruptedly to groan under the yoke of oppressive taxation of bribery and injustice and to suffer from the arrogance of her nobles and the corruption of her magistrates  the avowed partisans of lydie deglinton contend on the other hand that her rule lasted too short a time to be of real service to the country and that those who immediately succeeded her were either too weak or too selfseeking to continue this new system of government instituted by her and based on loftiness of ideals and purity of motives a system totally unknown hitherto they also insist on the fact that while she virtually held the reins of government over the heads of her indolent lord and her overindulgent father she brought about many highly beneficent social reforms which would have become firmly established had she remained several years in power there is no doubt that she exercised a wholesome influence over the existing administration of justice and the distribution of the countrys money and this in spite of endless cabals and the petty intrigues and jealousies of numberless enemies  be that as it may the present chronicler is bound to put it on record that at the moment when irène de stainville vaguely wondered whether madame la marquise was looking reprovingly at her when she hoped that she had at last succeeded in rousing the other womans jealousy the latters mind was dwelling with more than usual anxiousness on the sad events of the past few months  her severe expression was only the outcome of a more than normal sense of responsibility the flattering courtiers and meddlesome women who surrounded her seemed to lydie this morning more than usually brainless and vapid her own father to whose integrity and keen sense of honour she always felt that she could make appeal was unusually absent and morose today and she felt unspeakably lonely here in the midst of her immediate entouragelonely and oppressed she wanted to mix more with the general throng the men and women of france arrogant nobles or obsequious churls merchants attorneys physicians savants she cared not which the nation in fact the people who had sympathy and high ideals and a keener sense of the dignity of france  while these sycophants were for ever wanting wanting wanting standing before her as it were with hands outstretched ready to receive bribes commissions places of influence or affluence charles edward stuart lately the guest of the nation the friend of many whom france herself little more than a year ago had feasted and toasted to whom she had wished godspeed was now a miserable fugitive hiding in peasants huts beneath overhanging crags on the deserted shores of scotland a price put upon his head and the devotion of a few helpless enthusiasts a girl an old retainer as sole barrier twixt him and death  and france had promised that she would help him she promised that she would succour him if he failed that she would not abandon him in his distressneither him nor his friends  and now disaster had comedisaster so overwhelming so appalling that france at first had scarce liked to believe every one was so astonished had they not thought that england scotland and ireland were clamouring for a stuart that the entire british nation was wanting him waiting for him ready to acclaim him with open arms the first successesfalkirk prestonpanshad surprised no one the young pretenders expedition was bound to be nothing but a triumphal procession through crowded streets decorated towns and beflagged villages with church bells ringing people shouting deputations both civic and military waiting hat in hand with sheaves of loyal addresses  instead of this culloden derby the hasty retreat treachery and the horrible reprisals all that was common property now  france knew that the young prince whom she had féted was perhaps at this moment dying of want and yet these hands which had grasped his were not stretched out to help him the lips which had encouraged and cheered him which had even gently mocked his gloomy mood still smiled and chatted as irresponsibly as of yore and spoke the fugitives name at careless moments twixt a laugh and a jest  and this in spite of promises  she had dismissed her entourage with a curt nod just now when her father first joined her circle at any rate her position of splendid isolation should give her the right this morning to be alone with him since she so wished it at first glance she saw that he was troubled and her anxious eyes closely scanned his face but he seemed determined not to return her scrutinizing glance and anon when one by one m de coigni the count de bailleul and others who had been talking to lydie discreetly stepped aside he seemed anxious to detain them eager not to be left quite alone with his daughter  seeing his manœuvres lydies every suspicion was aroused something had occurred to disturb her father this morning something which he did not intend to tell her she drew him further back into the window embrasure and made room for him close to her on the settee she looked up impatiently at the dowager lady eglinton who had calmly stood her ground whilst the other intimates were being so summarily dismissed miladi appeared determined to ignore her daughterinlaws desire to be alone with her father and it even seemed to lydie as if a look of understanding had passed between the duke and the old lady when first they met  she felt her nervous system on the jar thoroughly frank and open in all political dealings herself she loathed the very hint of a secret understanding yet she trusted her father even though she feared his weakness  she talked of charles edward stuart for that was her chief preoccupation she lauded him and pitied him in turn spoke of his predicament his flight the devotion of his scotch adherents and finally of frances promise to him  god grant she said fervently that france may not be too late in doing her duty by that illstarred prince  nay my dear child it is sheer madness to think of such a thing said the duke speaking in tones of gentle reproof and soothingly as if to a wilful child  hé pardieu broke in miladis sharp highpitched voice that is precisely what i have been trying to explain to lydie these past two weeks but she will not listen and is not even to be spoken to on that subject now do you scold her well m le duc for i have done my bestand her obstinacy will lead my son into dire disgrace with his majesty who doth not favour her plans  miladi is right lydie said the duke and if i thought that your husband  nay my dear father interrupted lydie calmly i pray you do not vent your displeasure on lord eglinton as you see mme la comtesse de stainville is doing her best to prevent his thoughts from dwelling on the fate of his unfortunate friend  it was the dukes turn to scrutinize his daughters face vaguely wondering if she had spoken in bitterness not altogether sorry if this new train of thought were to divert her mind from that eternal subject of the moribund stuart cause which seemed to have become an obsession with her he halfturned in the direction where lydies eyes were still fixed and saw a patch of bright rose colour clear and vivid against the dull hangings of m le contrôleurs couch whilst the elegant outline of a womans stately form stood between his line of vision and the face of his soninlaw  the duc daumont dearly loved his daughter but he also vastly admired her intellectual power therefore at sight of that graceful roseclad figure he shrugged his shoulders in amiable contempt bah lydie was far too clever to dwell on such foolish matters as the vapid flirtations of a brainless doll even if the object of such flirtations was the subjugation of milor  lady eglinton had also perceived lydies fixity of expression just now when she spoke of irène but whilst m le duc carelessly shrugged his shoulders and dismissed the matter from his mind miladi boldly threw herself across her daughterinlaws new trend of thought  my son for once shows sound common sense she said decisively why should france be led into further extravagance and entangle herself perhaps in the meshes of a hopeless cause by  by fulfilling a solemn promise interrupted lydie quietly whilst she turned her earnest eyes on her motherinlaw in the manner so characteristic of hera promise which the very hopelessness of which you speak has rendered doubly sacred  his majesty is not of that opinion retorted the older woman testily and we must concede that he is the best judge of what france owes to her own honour  to this challenge it was obviously impossible to reply in the negative and if lydies heart whispered not always her lips certainly did not move  she looked appealingly at her father she wanted more than ever to be alone with him to question him to reassure herself as to certain vague suspicions which troubled her and which would not be stilled she longed above all to be rid of her motherinlaws interfering tongue of the platitudes which she uttered and which had the knack of still further jarring on lydies oversensitive nerves  but the duke did not help her usually he too was careful to avoid direct discussions with lady eglinton whose rasping voice was wont to irritate him but this morning he seemed disinclined to meet lydies appealing eyes he fidgeted in his chair and anon he crossed one shapely leg over the other and thoughtfully stroked his wellturned calf  there are moments in diplomacy my dear child he began after a moment of oppressive silence  my dear father interrupted lydie with grave determination let me tell you once for all that over this matter my mind is fully made up while i have a voice in the administration of this kingdom of france i will not allow her to sully her fair name by such monstrous treachery as the abandonment of a friend who trusted in her honour and the promises she made him  her voice had shaken somewhat as she spoke altogether she seemed unlike herself less sure less obstinately dominant that look of understanding between her father and lady eglinton had troubled her in a way for which she could not account yet she knew that the whole matter rested in her own hands no onenot even his majestyhad ever questioned her right to deal with treasury money and money was all that was needed though the final word nominally rested with milor he left her perfectly free and she could act as she thought right without let or hindrance  yet strangely enough she felt as if she wanted support in this matter it was a purely personal feeling and one she did not care to analyse she had no doubt whatever as to the justice and righteousness of her desire but in this one solitary instance of her masterful administration she seemed to require the initiative or at least the approval of her father or of the king  instead of this approval she vaguely scented intrigue  she rose from the settee and went to the window behind it the atmosphere of the room had suddenly become stifling fortunately the tall casements were unlatched they yielded to a gentle push and lydie stepped out on to the balcony already the air was hot and the sun shone glaringly on the marble fountains and drew sparks of fire from the dome of the conservatories the acrid pungent smell of cannas and of asters rose to her nostrils drowning the subtler aroma of tea roses and of lilies the monotonous drip of the fountains was a soothing contrast in her ear to the babel of voices within  at her feet the wellsanded walks of the park stretched out like ribbons of pale gold to the dim vast distance beyond the curly heads of athenian athletes peeped from among the welltrimmed bosquets showing the immaculate whiteness of the polished marble in the sun a couple of gardeners clad in shirts of vivid blue linen were stooping over a bed of monthly roses picking off dead leaves and twigs that spoilt the perfect symmetry of the shrubs whilst two more a few paces away were perfecting the smoothness of a box hedge lest a tiny leaflet were out of place  lydie sighed impatiently even in this vastness and this peace man brought his artificiality to curb the freedom of nature everything in this magnificent park was affected stilted and forced every tree was fashioned to a shape not its own every flower made to be a counterpart of its fellow  this sense of unreality of fighting nature in its every aspect was what had always oppressed her even when she worked at first in perfect harmony with her father when she still had those utopian hopes of a regenerate france with a wise and beneficent monarch an era of truth and of fraternity every one toiling handinhand for the good of the nation  what a child she had been in those days how little she had understood this hydraheaded monster of selfseeking ambition of political wirepulling of petty cabals and personal animosities which fought and crushed and trampled on every lofty ideal on every clean thought and highminded aspiration  she knew and understood better now she had outgrown her childish ideals those she now kept were a womans ideals no less pure no less high or noble but lacking just one great qualitythat of hope she had continued to work and to do her best for this country which she lovedher own beautiful france she hadwith no uncertain handseized the reins of government from the diffident fingers of her lord she still strove to fight corruption to curb excesses and to check arrogance and made vain endeavours to close her eyes to the futility of her noblest efforts  this attitude of king louis toward the young pretender had brought it all home to her the intrigues the lying the falseness of everything the treachery which lurked in every corner of this sumptuous palace the egoism which was the sole moving power of those overdressed dolls  perhaps for the first time sincein all the glory and pride of her young womanhoodshe became conscious of its power over the weaker and sterner vessel she felt a sense of discouragement the utter hopelessness of her desires her heart even suggested contempt of herself of her weakminded foolishness in imagining that all those empty heads in the room yonder could bring forth one single serious thought from beneath their powdered perruques one single wholly selfless aspiration for the good of france any more than that stultified rosetree could produce a bloom of splendid perfection or that stunted acacia intoxicate the air with the fragrance of its bloom  solitude had taken hold of lydies fancy she had allowed her mind to go roaming fancyfree her thoughts were melancholy and anxious and she sighed or frowned more than once the air was becoming hotter and hotter every moment and a gigantic bed of scarlet geraniums sent a curious acrid scent to her nostrils which she found refreshing anon she succeeded in shutting out from her eyes the picture of those gardeners maiming the rosetrees and bosquets and in seeing only that distant horizon with the vague tiny fleecy clouds which were hurrying quite gaily and freely to some unknown destination far no doubt from this world of craft and affectation she shut her ears to the sound of miladis shrill laugh and the chatter of senseless fools behind her and only tried to hear the rippling murmur of the water in the fountains the merry chirrup of the sparrows and far very far away the sweet sad note of a lark soaring upward to the serene morning sky  the sound of a footstep on the flagstones of the balcony broke in on her meditations her father still wearing that troubled look was coming out to join her fortunately miladi had chosen to remain indoors  impulsively now for her nerves were still quivering with the tension of recent introspection she went straight up to this man whom she most fully trusted in all the world and took his hands in both hers  my dear dear father she pleaded with her wonted earnestness you will help me will you not  he looked more troubled than ever at her words almost pathetic in his obvious helplessness as he ejaculated feebly  but what can we do my dear child  send le monarque to meet prince charles edward she urged it is so simple  it is very hazardous and would cost a vast amount of money in the present state of the treasury  my dear father france can afford the luxury of not selling her honour  and the english will be furious with us  the english cannot do more than fight us and they are doing that already she retorted  the risks my dear child the risks he protested again  what risks father dear she said eagerly tell me what do we risk by sending le monarque with secret orders to the scottish coast to a spot known to no one save to lord eglinton and myself confided to my husband by the unfortunate young prince before he started on this miserable expedition captain barre will carry nothing that can in any way betray the secret of his destination nor the object of his journeymy husbands sealring on his finger nothing more this token he will take on shore himselfnot even the ships crew will know aught that would be fatal if betrayed  but the english can intercept le monarque  we must run that risk she retorted once past the coast of england scotland is lonely enough le monarque will meet no other craft and captain barre knows the secrets of his own callinghe has run a cargo before now  this is childish obstinacy lydie and i do not recognize the statesman in this sentimental chit who prates nonsense like a schoolgirl imbued with novelreading said the duke now with marked impatience and pray if his majesty should put a veto on your using one of his ships for this privateering expedition  i propose sending le monarque tomorrow rejoined lydie quietly captain barre will have his orders direct from the ministry of finance and then well obtain his majestys sanction on the following day  but this is madness my child exclaimed the duke you cannot openly set at defiance the wishes of the king  the wishes of the king she cried with sudden vehemence surely surely my dear dear father you cannot mean what you suggest think oh think just for one moment that poor young man who was our guest whom we all likedhe broke bread with us in our own house our beautiful château de la tour daumont which has never yet been defiled by treachery and you talk of leaving him there in that faroff land which has proved so inhospitable to him of leaving him there either to perish miserably of want and starvation or to fall into the hands of that hanoverian butcher whose name has become a byword for unparalleled atrocities  she checked herself and then resumed more calmly  nay my dear father i pray you let us cease this argument for once in the history of our happy life together you and i look at honour from opposite points of view  yes my dear i see that too he rejoined speaking now with some hesitation i wish i could persuade you to abandon the idea  to abandon the unfortunate young prince you mean to break every promise we ever made to himto become the byword in our turn for treachery and cowardice in every country in europeand why she added with helpless impatience trying to understand dreading almost to question why why  then as her father remained silent with eyes persistently fixed on some vague object in the remote distance she said as if acting on a sudden decisive thought  father dear is it solely a question of cost  partly he replied with marked hesitation  partly well then dear we will remove one cause of your unexplainable opposition you may assure his majesty in my name that the voyage of le monarque shall cost the treasury nothing  then as her father made no comment she continued more eagerly  lord eglinton will not deny me as you know he is rich and charles edward stuart is his friend what le monarque has cost for provisioning that we will immediately replace for the moment we will borrow this ship from his majestys navy that he cannot refuse and i give you and his majesty my word of honour that le monarque shall not cost the treasury one single soueven the pay of her crew shall be defrayed by us from the moment that she sails out of le havre until the happy moment when she returns home with prince charles edward stuart and his friends safe and sound aboard  there was silence between them for awhile the duc daumonts eyes were fixed steadily on a distant point on the horizon but lydies eyes never for a second strayed away from her fathers face  will le monarque have a long journey to make asked the duke lightly  yes she replied  to the coast of scotland  yes  the west coast of course  why should you ask dear  she asked him this question quite casually then as he did not reply she asked it again this time with a terrible tightening of her heartstrings suddenly she remembered her suspicions when first she caught the glance of intelligence which passed swiftly from him to miladi  with a quick gesture of intense agitation she placed a hand on his wrist  father she said in a scarce audible murmur  yes my dear what is it  i dont know ii have been much troubled of late i do not think that my perceptions are perhaps as keen as they wereand as you say this matter of the stuart prince has weighed heavily on my mind therefore will you forgive me dear ifif i ask you a question which may sound undutiful disloyal to you  of course i will forgive you dear he said after a slight moment of hesitation what is it  he had pulled himself together and now met his daughters glance with sufficient firmness apparently to reassure her somewhat for she said more quietly  will you give me your word of honour that you personally know of no act of treachery which may be in contemplation against the man who trusts in the honour of france  her glowing eyes rested upon his they seemed desirous of penetrating to the innermost recesses of his soul m le duc daumont tried to bear the scrutiny without flinching but he was no great actor nor was he in the main a dishonourable man but he thought his daughter unduly chivalrous and he held that political considerations were outside the ordinary standards of honour and morality  anyway he could not bring himself to give her a definite reply her hand still grasped his wristhe took it in his own and raised it to his lips  my father she pleaded her voice trembling her eyes still fixed upon him will you not answer my question  it is answered my dear he replied evasively do you think it worthy of meyour fatherto protest mine honesty before my own child  she looked at him no longer and gently withdrew her hand from his grasp she understood that indeed he had answered her question     chapter xiii  the weight of etiquette   perhaps certain characteristics which milor the marquis of eglinton had inherited from his english grandfather caused him to assume a more elaborate costume for his petit lever than the rigid court etiquette of the time had prescribed  according to every mandate of usage and fashion when at exactly halfpast ten oclock he had asked m achille so peremptorily for his shoes and then sat on the edge of his bed with legs dangling over its sides he should have been attired in a flowered dressing gown over a laceruffled chemise de nuit and a highpeaked bonnetdecoton with the regulation tassel should have taken the place of the still absent perruque  then all the distinguished gentlemen who stood nearest to him would have known what to do they had all attended petits levers of kings courtisanes and ministers ever since their rank and dignities entitled them so to do mme la comtesse de stainville for instance would have stepped aside at this precise juncture with a deep curtsey and mayhap a giggle or a smirksince she was privileged to be frivolouswhereupon m achille would with the proper decorum due to so solemn a function have handed m le contrôleurs day shirt to the visitor of highest rank there present who was privileged to pass it over milors head  that important formality accomplished the great mans toilet could be completed by m le valetdechambre himself but who had ever heard of a ministers petitlever being brought to a close without the ceremony of his being helped on with his shirt by a prince of the blood or at least a marshal of france  however le petit anglais had apparently some funny notions of his ownheirlooms no doubt from that fogridden land beyond the seas the home of his ancestorsand vainly had monsieur achille that paragon among flunkeys tried to persuade his marquis not to set the hitherto inviolate etiquette of the court of france quite so flagrantly at defiance  all his efforts had been in vain  monsieur dargenson who was present on this 13th of august 1746 tells us that when milor did call for his shoes at least ten minutes too soon and was thereupon tenderly reproached by madame la comtesse de stainville for this ungallant haste he was already more than half dressed  true the flowered robedechambre was thereand vastly becoming too with its braided motifs and downy lining of a contrasting huebut when milor threw off the coverlet with a boyish gesture of impatience he appeared clad in a daintily frilled dayshirt breeches of fine faced cloth whilst a pair of white silk stockings covered his wellshaped calves  true the perruque was still absent but so was the regulation cotton nightcap instead of these milor with that eccentricity peculiar to the entire british race wore his own hair slightly powdered and tied at the nape of the neck with a wide black silk bow  monsieur achille looked extremely perturbed and had his rigorous features ventured to show any expression at all they would undoubtedly have displayed one of respectful apology to all the highborn gentlemen who witnessed this unedifying spectacle as it was the face of monsieur le valetdechambre was set in marblelike rigidity perhaps only the slightest suspicion of a sigh escaped his lips as he noted milors complete unconsciousness of the enormity of his offense  monsieur le contrôleur had been in the very midst of an animated argument with madame de stainville anent the respective merits of rose red and turquoise blue as a foil to a mellow complexion this argument he had broken off abruptly by calling for his shoes no wonder irène pouted her pout being singularly becoming  had i been fortunate enough in pleasing your lordship with my poor wit she said you had not been in so great a hurry to rid yourself of my company  nay madame permit me to explain he protested gently i pray you try and remember that for the last halfhour i have been the happy yet feeble target for the shafts aimed at me by your beauty and your wit now i always feel singularly helpless without my waistcoat and my shoes i feel like a miserable combatant who when brought face to face with a powerful enemy hath been prevented from arming himself for the fray  but etiquette she protested  etiquette is a jade madame he retorted shall not you and i turn our backs on her  in the meantime m achille had with becoming reverence taken m le contrôleurs coat and waistcoat in his august hands and stood there holding them with just that awed expression of countenance which a village curé would wear when handling a reliquary  with that same disregard for ceremony which had characterized him all along lord eglinton rescued his waistcoat from those insistent hands and heedless of achilles look of horror he slipped it on and buttoned it himself with quick dexterous fingers as if he had never done anything else in all his life  for a moment achille was speechless for the first time perhaps in the history of france a minister of finance had put his waistcoat on himself and this under hisachillesadministration the very foundations of his belief were tottering before his eyes desperately now he clung to the coat ready to fight for its possession and shed his blood if need be for the upkeep of the ancient traditions of the land  will milor take his coat from the hands of monseigneur le prince de courtenaiprince of the blood he asked with a final supreme effort for the reëstablishment of those traditions which were being so wantonly flouted  his majesty will be here directly interposed irène hastily  his majesty never comes later than halfpast ten protested milor feebly and he has not the vaguest idea how to help a man on with his coat he has had no experience and i feel that mine would become a heap of crumpled misery if his gracious hands were to insinuate it over my unworthy shoulders  he made a desperate effort to gain possession of his coat but this time m achille was obdurate it seemed as if he would not yield that coat to any one save at the cost of his own life  then it is the privilege of monseigneur le prince de courtenai he said firmly  but m de courtenai has gone to flirt with my wife ejaculated lord eglinton in despair  in that case no doubt m le duc de luxembourg will claim the right  mais comment donc said the duke with great alacrity as in spite of milors still continued feeble protests he took the coat from the hands of m achille  m de luxembourg was very pompous and very slow and there was nothing that lord eglinton hated worse than what he called amateur valeting but now there was nothing for it but forbearance and resignation patience too of which le petit anglais had no more than a just share he gathered the frills of his shirt sleeves in his hands and tried not to look as if he wished m de luxembourg at the bottom of the nearest pond but at this very moment monseigneur le prince de courtenai who it appeared had not gone to flirt with madame la marquise since the latter was very much engaged elsewhere but had merely been absorbed in political discussions with m de vermandois suddenly realized that one of his numerous privileges was being encroached upon  not that he had any special desire to help m le contrôleurgénéral on with his coat but because he was ever anxious that his proper precedence as quasi prince of the blood should always be fully recognized so he gave a discreet cough just sufficiently loud to attract m achilles notice and to warn m le duc de luxembourg that he was being presumptuous  without another word the coat was transferred from the hands of the maréchal to those of the quasiroyal prince whilst eglinton wearing an air of resigned martyrdom still waited for his coat the frills of his shirt sleeves gripped tightly in his hands  monseigneur advanced his movements were always sedate and he felt pleased that every one who stood close by had noticed that the rank and precedence which were rightfully his had been duly accorded him even in so small a matter by no less a personage than m le contrôleurgénéral des finances  he now held the coat in perfect position and lord eglinton gave a sigh of relief when suddenly the great doors at the end of the long room were thrown wide open and the stentorian voices of the royal flunkeys announced  messieurs mesdames his majesty the king  the buzz of talk died down giving place to respectful murmurs there was a great rustle of silks and brocades a clink of dress swords against the parquet floor as the crowd parted to make way for louis xv the various groups of political disputants broke up as if scattered by a fairy wand soon all the butterflies that had hovered in the further corners of the room fluttered toward the magic centre  here an avenue seemed suddenly to form itself of silken gowns of brocaded panniers of gaily embroidered coats topped by rows of powdered perruques that bent very low to the ground as fat smiling pompous and not a little bored his majesty king louis xv made slow progress along the full length of the room leaning lightly on the arm of the inevitable marquise de pompadour and nodding with great condescension to the perruqued heads as he passed  near the window embrasure he met la marquise deglinton and m le duc daumont her father to lydie he extended a gracious hand and engaged her in conversation with a few trivial words this gave mme de pompadour the opportunity of darting a quick glance that implied an anxious query at the duc daumont to which he responded with an almost imperceptible shake of the head  all the while m le contrôleurgénéral des finances was still standing shirt frills in hand his face a picture of resigned despair his eyes longingly fixed on his own coat which monseigneur de courtenai no longer held up for him  indeed monseigneur a rigid stickler for etiquette himself would never so far have forgotten what was due to the house of bourbon as to indulge in any pursuitsuch as helping a minister on with his coatat the moment when his majesty entered a room  he bowed with the rest of them and thus louis xv at the end of his progress found the group around milors bedside his cousin de courtenai bowing monsieur achille with his nose almost touching his knees and milor eglinton in shirt sleeves looking supremely uncomfortable and not a little sheepish  ah ce cher milor said the king with charming bonhomie as he took the situation in at a glance nay cousin i claim an ancient privilege monsieur le contrôleurgénéral have you ever been waited on by a king of france  never to my knowledge sire stammered le petit anglais  louis xv was quite delightful today so fresh and boyish in his movements and with an inimitable laisser aller and friendliness in his manner which caused many pairs of eyes to stare and many hearts to ponder  let this be an epochmaking experience in your life then he said gaily is this your coat  and without more ado he took that muchtravelled garment from monseigneur de courtenais hands  such condescension such easy graciousness had not been witnessed for years and his majesty was not overfond of that stateappointed ministry of finance of which milor was the nominal head  his majesty must be sorely in need of money was a whispered comment which ran freely enough round the room  withal the king himself seemed quite unconscious of the wave of interest to which his gracious behaviour was giving rise he was holding up the coat smiling benevolently at m le contrôleur who appeared to be more than usually nervous and now made no movement toward that muchdesired portion of his attire  allons milor i am waiting said king louis at last  erthat is murmured lord eglinton pitiably could i have my coat right side out  ohé par ma foi quoth the king with easy familiarity your pardon milor but tis seldom i hold such an article in my hands and i believe by all the saints in the calendar that i was holding it upside down wrong side out sleeves foremost and collar awry  he laughed till his fat sides ached and tears streamed from his eyes then amidst discreet murmurs of admiration at so much condescension such gracious good humour the ceremony of putting on m le contrôleurs coat was at last performed by the king of france and milor now fully clothed and apparently much relieved in his mind was able to present his respects to madame de pompadour     chapter xiv  royal favours   apparently there was to be no end to royal graciousness this morning as every one who looked could see hardly was the coat on m le contrôleurs shoulders than the king engaged him in conversation whilst mme de pompadour dropped into the armchair lately vacated by monseigneur de courtenai the welldrilled circle of courtiers and ladies including la belle irène herself retired discreetly once more there was a barrier of emptiness and parquet flooring round the inner group now composed of his majesty of m le contrôleurgénéral and of mme de pompadour into these sacred precincts no one would have dared to step lydie having paid her respects to his majesty had not joined that intimate circle and it seemed as if louis xv had noted her absence and was duly relieved thereat  anon m le duc daumont approached the king offering him a chair louis took it and in the act of so doing he contrived to whisper four quick words in his prime ministers ear  eh bien your daughter  lord eglinton just then was busy trying to find a suitable place whereon to deposit his own insignificant person and blushing violently because mme de pompadour had laughingly waved her fan in the direction of his monumental bed m le duc therefore whilst adjusting a cushion behind the kings back was able to reply hurriedly  impossible sire  and langlais  i have not yet tried  ah ah ah laughed pompadour merrily m le contrôleurgénéral des finances are all englishmen as modest as you  ii dont know madame i dont know very many he replied  here is m le contrôleur too bashful to sit on the edge of his own bed in my presence she continued still laughing nay milor ill wager that you were reclining on those downy cushions when you were flirting with mme de stainville  only under the compulsion of my valetdechambre madame he protested or id have got up hours ago  is he such a tyrant then asked louis  terrible your majesty  you are afraid of him  i tremble at his look  ah it is well m le contrôleurgénéral des finances should tremble sometimes even if only before his valetdechambre sighed louis xv with comic pathos  but sire i tremble very often protested lord eglinton  i faith he speaks truly laughed mme de pompadour since he trembles before his wife  and we tremble before m le contrôleur concluded the king gaily  before me sire  aye indeed since our parliaments have made you our dragon  a goodtempered meek sort of dragon sire youll graciously admit  that we will milor and gladly said louis xv now with somewhat too exuberant goodhumour and youll not have cause to regret that meekness for your king hath remained your friend  then as lord eglinton seemed either too much overcome by the amazing condescension or too bashful to respond his majesty continued more sedately  we are about to prove our friendship milor  your majestyfinds meerquite unprepareder stammered milor who in verity appeared distinctly confused for his eyes roamed round the room as if in search of help or support in this interesting crisis  nay nay rejoined the king benignly this we understand milor it is not often the king of france chooses a friend amongst his subjects for we look upon you as our subject now m le contrôleur since we have accepted your oath of allegiance you have only just enough english blood left in your veins to make you doubly loyal and true to your king nay nay no thankswe speak as our royal heart moves us just now we spoke of proofs of our friendship milor tell us frankly are you so very rich  the question came so abruptly at the end of the sentimental peroration that lord eglinton was completely thrown off his balance he was not used to private and intimate conversations with king louis his wife saw to all affairs of state and the present emergency found him unprepared  ii believe so sire he stammered  but surely not so rich insisted the king that a million or so livres would come amiss hé  i dont rightly know sire it a little depends  on what  on the provenance of the million  more than one good milortwo mayhap said the king exultantly  then he drew his chair in somewhat closer lord eglinton had taken mme de pompadours advice and was sitting on the edge of the bed we may presume that that edge was very hard and uncomfortable for milor fidgeted and looked supremely unhappy anon the kings knees were close to his own and madames brocaded skirt got entangled with his feet the buzz of talk in the large room drowned the kings whispers effectually the wide barrier of empty floor was an effectual check on eavesdropping obviously no one would hear what louis was about to confide to his minister he leaned forward and dropped his voice so that eglinton himself could scarcely hear and had to bend his head so that he got louiss hot excited breath full on the cheek being general comptroller of finance and receiving the confidences of a king had its drawbacks at times  milor whispered his majesty tis a good affair we would propose one which we could carry through without your help but in which we would wish to initiate you seeing that you are our friend  i listen sire  the duke of cumberlandyou know him  yes  he has quelled the rebellion and humbled the standard of that arrogant stuart pretender  your majestys friendyes said eglinton innocently  bah our friend and louis xv shrugged his shoulders whilst mme de pompadour gave a short contemptuous laugh  oh i am sorry i thought said milor gently i pray your majesty to continue  charles edward stuart was no friend to us milor resumed louis decisively observe i pray you the trouble which he hath brought about our ears we had had peace with england ere now but for that accursed adventurer and his pretensions and now that he has come to disaster and ruin  i understand said eglinton with a little sigh of sympathy it is indeed awkward for your majesty the solemn promise you gave him  bah man prate not to me of promises interrupted louis irritably i promised him nothing he knows that well enoughthe young fool  do not let us think of him sire it seems to upset your majesty  it does milor it does for even my worst enemies concede that louis the wellbeloved is a creature of sympathy  a heart of gold sirea heart of goldershall we join the ladies  milor said the king abruptly putting a firm hand on eglintons wrist we must not allow that young fool to thwart the external politics of france any longer the duke of cumberland though our own enemy on the field of battle has shown that england trusts in our honour and loyalty even in the midst of war but she wants a proof from us  oh let us give it sire by all means prince charles edward stuart  exactly milor said louis xv quietly that is the proof which england wants  i am afraid i dont quite understand said lord eglinton a little bewildered you see i am very stupid andand perhaps my wife  then as king louis gave a sharp ejaculation of impatience mme de pompadour broke in in tones which she knew how to render velvety and soothing to the ear whilst her delicate fingers rested lightly on m le contrôleurs hand  it is quite simple milor she whispered just as confidentially as the king had done this charles edward stuart is a perpetual worry to england his grace the duke of cumberland has been accused of unnecessary cruelty because he has been forced to take severe measures for the suppression of that spirit of rebellion which is only being fostered in scotland because of that young pretenders perpetual presence there he fans smouldering revolt into flame he incites passions and creates misguided enthusiasms which lead to endless trouble to all  then as she paused somewhat breathless and eager her bright myosotiscoloured eyes anxiously scanning his face he said mildly  how beautifully you put things mme la marquise i vow i have never heard such a perfect flood of eloquence  tis not a matter of madames eloquence interposed louis with impatience though she hath grasped the subject with marvellous clearness of judgment  then tis a matter of what sire  the duke of cumberland has appealed to our loyalty though we are at war with england we bear no animus toward her reigning house and have no wish to see king georges crown snatched from him by that beardless young adventurer who has no more right to the throne of england than you milor to that of france  and his grace of cumberland has asked his majestys help added mme de pompadour  how strange just as prince charles edward himself hath done  the duke of cumberland desires the person of the pretender she said without heeding the interruption so that he may no longer incite misguided enthusiasts to rebellion and cease to plunge scotland and england into the throes of civil war  his grace asks but little methinks said lord eglinton slowly  oh england is always ready to pay for what she wants said the marquise  and on this occasion asked milor mildly  his grace hath offered us as man to man fifteen millions livres for the person of the pretender said the king with sudden decision and looking m le contrôleur straight in the face  ah as man to man  louis xv and mme la marquise de pompadour both drew a quick sigh of relief m le contrôleur had taken the proposal with perfect quietude he had not seemed startled and his kindly face expressed nothing but gentle amazement very natural under the circumstances whilst his voiceeven and placid as usualwas not above a whisper  as man to man he repeated and nodded his head several times as if pondering over the meaning of this phrase  how extremely fortunate milor had raised no objection what a pity to have wasted quite so much thought anxiety and a wealth of eloquence over a matter which was so easily disposed of jeanne de pompadour gave her royal patron an encouraging nod  there was a world of wisdom in that nod and in the look which accompanied it he takes it so easily that look seemed to say he thinks it quite natural we must have his help since we do not know where the fugitive prince is in hiding this little milor alone can tell us that and give us a token by which charles edward would trustingly fall into the little ambush which we have prepared for him but he thinks the affair quite simple we need not offer him quite so large a share in the pleasant millions as we originally had intended  all this and more mme de pompadours nod conveyed to the mind of louis the wellbeloved and he too nodded in response before he continued speaking now more casually in a calmer more businesslike tone  tis a fair offer he said at last though the affair will not be quite so easy to conduct as his grace supposes he suggests our sending a ship to the coast of scotland to meet the young adventurer and his friends take them on board and convey them to an english port where they will be handed over to the proper authorities tis fairly simple methinks  remarkably simple your majesty  of course we need a little help from you milor oh nothing muchadvice as to the spot where our good ship will be most like to find charles edward stuarta token which if shown to that young firebrand will induce him to trust its bearer and come on board himself with at least some of his friends you follow me milor  the question seemed necessary for lord eglintons face wore such a look of indifference as to astonish even the king who had been prepared for some measure of protest at any rate from this man who was being asked to betray his friend although louis was at this period of his life quite deaf to every call of honour and loyalty through that constant everpresent and exasperating want of money for the satisfaction of his extravagant caprices nevertheless there was bourbon blood in him and this cried out loudly now that he was suggestingnay more contemplatinga deed which would have put any of his subjects to shame and which would have caused some of his most unscrupulous ancestors in mediæval times to writhe with humiliation in their graves therefore he had expected loud protest from lord eglinton arguments more or less easy to combat indignation of course but this ready acceptance of this ignoble bargainso strange is human naturefor the moment quite horrified louis milor took the selling of his friend as calmly as he would that of a horse  you follow me milor reiterated the king  yes yes sire replied eglinton readily enough i follow you  you understand the service we ask of you  yes yes i understand  for these services milor you shall be amply rewarded we would deem one million livres a fair amount to fall to your share  your majesty is generous said eglinton quite passively  we are just milor said the king with a sigh of satisfaction  m le contrôleur seemed satisfied and there was little else to say louis xv began to regret that he had offered him quite so much apparently five hundred thousand would have been enough  then well call that settled concluded his majesty pushing back his chair preparatory to ending this conversation which he had so dreaded and which had turned out so highly satisfactory pity about that million livres of course five hundred thousand might have done certainly seven nathless m le contrôleurs private fortune was not so large as popular rumour had it or did mme lydie actually hold the purse strings  cest entendu milor repeated louis once more we will see to commissioning the ship and to her secret orders as you see there is no riskand we shall be glad to be in the good graces of m le duc de cumberland to oblige an enemy eh milor an act of peace and goodwill in the midst of war chivalry whatworthy of our ancestor henri of navarre methinks it will make history  i think so too sire said eglinton with obvious conviction  ah then well see to the completion of the affair wethe king and m le duc daumont you are lucky milor your share of the work is so simple as soon as the ship is ready to sail well call on you for the necessary instructions par ma foi tis a fine business for us all milor one million in your pocket for a word and a token the residue of the fifteen millions in our royal coffers and the thanks of his grace of cumberland to boot not to mention the moral satisfaction of having helped to quell an unpleasant rebellion and of placing ones enemy under lasting obligation all for the good of france  louis the wellbeloved had risen he was more than contented an unctuous smile a beaming graciousness of expression pervaded his entire countenance he groped in the wide pocket of his coat bringing forth a letter which bore a large red seal  his graces letter milor he said with final supreme condescension and holding the document out to m le contrôleur who took it without a word do you glance through it and see that we have not been mistaken that the whole thing is clear straightforward and  and a damned accursed dirty piece of business sire  it was undoubtedly lord eglinton who had spoken for his right hand as if in response to his thoughts was even now crushing the paper which it held whilst the left was raised preparatory to tearing the infamous proposal to pieces yes it had been milors even gentle voice which had uttered this sudden decisive condemnation in the same impassive tones and still scarce audible even to these two people near him without passion without tremor seemingly without emotion just a statement of an undisputable fact a personal opinion in answer to a question put to him  louis completely thrown off his balance stared at milor as if he had been suddenly shaken out of a dream for the moment he thought that his ears must have played him a trick that he must have misunderstood the words so calmly uttered instinctively his hand sought the support of the chair which he had just vacated it seemed as if he needed a solid a materialistic prop else his body would have reeled as his brain was doing now mme de pompadour too had jumped to her feet pushing her chair away with an angry impatient movement the disappointment was so keen and sudden coming just at the moment when triumph seemed so complete but whilst louis stared somewhat blankly at m le contrôleur she the woman flashed rage contempt vengeance upon him  he had tricked and fooled her her as well as the king leading them on to believe that he approved the better to laugh at them both in his sleeve  the contemptible arrogant wretch  he was still half sitting half leaning against the edge of his bed and staring straight out before him through the big bay window which gave on to the park passively gently as if the matter had ceased to concern him as if he were quite unconscious of the enormity of his action  aa damnedwhataccursedwhat stammered the king but milor  nay sire i pray you broke in a grave voice suddenly my lord seems to have angered your majesty will you deign to explain     chapter xv  diplomacy   the buzz of talk was going on as loudly and incessantly as before the whispered conversation around m le contrôleurs bedside had excited no violent curiosity the first surprise occasioned by his majestys unparalleled condescension soon gave way to indifference it was obvious that the kings assiduity beside the minister of finance was solely due to a more than normal desire for money and these royal demands for renewed funds were too numerous to cause more than passing interest  eavesdropping was impossible without gross disrespect the latter far more unpardonable than the most insatiable curiosity lydie alone privileged above all had apparently not heeded the barrier which isolated louis xv pompadour and milor from the rest of the vast apartment for she now stood at the foot of the beda graceful imposing figure dressed in somewhat conventual gray with one hand resting on the delicate panelling her grave luminous eyes fixed on the kings face  louis shook himself free from the stupor in which milors unexpected words had plunged him surprise yielded now to vexation lydies appearance her interference in this matter would be the final deathblow to his hopes those tantalizing millions had dangled close before his eyes his royal hands had almost grasped them his ears heard their delicious clink milors original attitude had brought them seemingly within his grasp now everything was changed the whole affair would have to be argued out again at full length and though le petit anglais might prove amenable mme lydie was sure to be obdurate  louis xv scowled at the picture of youth and beauty presented by that elegant figure in dovegray silk with the proud head carried high the unconscious look of power and of strength in the large gray eyes so grave and so fixed in his mind there had already flashed the thought that milors sudden change of attitudefor it was a change of that his majesty had no doubtwas due to a subtle sense of fear which had made him conscious of his wifes presence although from her position and his own he could not possibly have seen her approach  this made him still more vexed with lydie and as she seemed calmly to be waiting for an explanation he replied quite gruffly  nay madame you mistake i assure you milor and ourselves are perfectly at onewe were so until a few moments ago  until i came she said quietly i am glad of that for twill be easy enough i hope to convince your majesty that my presence can have made no difference to m le contrôleurs attitude of deep respect  pardi we hope not interposed mme de pompadour acidly but we hope milor hath found his tongue at last and will do the convincing himself  but louis xv was not prepared to reopen the discussion in the presence of mme lydie he knew quite as well as m le duc daumont himself that she would have nothing but contempt and horror for that infamous proposal which he was more determined than ever to accept  it was tiresome of course not to have the coöperation of lord eglinton that weak fool now would no doubt be overruled by his wife at the same timeand louis hugged the thought as it sprang to his mindthere were other ways of obtaining possession of charles edward stuarts person than the direct one which he had proposed to milor just now the young pretender was bound sooner or later to leave the shores of scotland unbeknown to king louis a ship might be sent by private friends to rescue the fugitive but that ship could be intercepted on her way home and after all charles edward was bound to land in france some dayand then  and there were other means besides of earning the tempting millions but these would have to be thought out planned and arranged they would be difficult and not nearly so expeditious which was a drawback when royal coffers were clamouring to be filled still it would be distinctly unadvisable to broach the subject with mme la marquise deglinton and unnecessarily humiliating since a rebuff was sure to be the result  therefore whenas if in placid defiance of pompadours challengelord eglinton handed the duke of cumberlands letter silently back to the king the latter slipped it into his pocket with a gesture of ostentatious indifference  nay we need not trouble mme la marquise with the discussion now he said she is unacquainted with the subject of our present conversation and it would be tedious to reiterate  i crave your pardon sire rejoined lydie if i have transgressed but my zeal in the service of france and in that of your majesty has rendered my senses preternaturally acute my eyes see in the gloom my ears hear across vast spaces  in a word mme la marquise has been listening said pompadour with a sneer  i did not listen said lydie quietly i only heard  then you know said louis with wellassumed indifference  oh yes  she smiled at him as she replied this was apparently a day of surprises for the smile seemed distinctly encouraging  andand what do you say asked his majesty somewhat anxiously yet emboldened by that encouraging smile  of a truth was he about to find an ally there where he expected most bitter opposition  meseems that milor was somewhat hasty replied lydie quietly  ah  it was a sigh of intense deep heartfelt satisfaction breathed by louis the wellbeloved and unrestrainedly echoed by mme de pompadour  this proposal sire continued lydie tis from england i understand  from his grace of cumberland himself madame assented the king once more drawing the letter from out his pocket  may i be permitted to see it she asked  for a moment louis hesitated then he gave her the letter there was no risk in this since she practically owned to knowing its contents  and the whole affair would be so much easier so much more expeditious with the coöperation of the eglintons  lydie read the letter through seemingly deeply engrossed in its contents she never once raised her eyes to see how she was being watched she knew quite well that the kings eyes were fixed eagerly upon her face that pompadours cupidity and greed for the proposed millions were plainly writ upon her face but she had not once looked at her husband she did not look at him now he had not spoken since that sudden burst of indignation when his slender hand crushed the infamous document which she now studied so carefully crushed it and would have torn it to ribbons in loathing and contempt  when first she interposed he had turned and faced her since then she knew that his eyes had remained fixed on her face she felt the gaze yet cared not to return it he was too weak too simple to understand and of her own actions she would be sole mistress that had been the chief clause in the contract when she placed her hand in his  her intuitive knowledge of this court in which she moved her suspicions of this feeble monarch whose extravagant caprices had led him to deeds at which in his earlier days he had been the first to blush her dread of intrigues and treachery all had whispered in her ear the word of prudencetemporize  the whole infamous plan had been revealed to her through those same supernaturally keen senses which her strong domineering nature had coerced until they became the slaves of her will mingling with the crowd her graceful body present in the chattering throng her mind had remained fixed on that group beside the bed she had noticed the kings expression of face when he engaged milor in conversation his extraordinary bonhomie his confidential attitude his whispers all backed and seconded by pompadour gradually she manœuvred and still forming a unit with the rest of the crowd she had by degrees drawn nearer and nearer until she saw her husbands movement his almost imperceptible change of expression as he clutched the letter which was handed him by the king  then she boldly entered the inner precincts being privileged she could do even that without creating attention milors words of contempt the royal arms of england on the seal of the letter coupled with her fathers attitude with her just now and his veiled suggestions told her all she wanted to know and quick as flashes of summer lightning her womans intuition whispered words of wisdom in her ear  know everything firstthen temporize diplomacy will do more than defiance  having read the letter through she of course knew all it was simple enougha monstrous proposal which the king of france was ready to adopt she felt real physical nausea at contact with so much infamy  but she folded the document neatly and carefully then looked quietly at the king  the duke of cumberland is generous she said forcing herself to smile  heu heu assented louis lightly with a return of his wonted bonhomie matters were shaping themselves to a truly satisfactory end  do i understand that your majesty would desire us to accept his graces proposal  what think you yourself madame  it is worth considering she mused  parbleu and you are a true woman exclaimed louis xv beaming with delight full of wisdom as a statesman should be to think that we could ever have mistrusted so clear a head and so sound a judgment  your majesty i hope will always remember that my sole desire is to serve france and her king  par ma foi well not forget your help in this madame he exclaimed wholeheartedly then we may rely on your help  what does your majesty desire me to do  he came quite close to her and she forced herself not to draw back one inch for the sake of the fugitive prince and his friends who had trusted in the honour of france for the sake of that honour which in her peculiar position was as dear to her as her own she would not flinch now she would show no repulsion no fear though her whole being rose in revolt at contact with this man  a man not a king par dieu not a king of france  his face to her looked hideous the eyes seemed to leer and there was lust for money and ignoble treachery writ on every feature  we have explained it all to milor whispered louis under his breath a ship to be commissioned and sent to meet the stuart she will have secret ordersno one shall know but her captainand he will be a man whom we can trusta man whom we shall have to payyou understand  i understand  then from you we want to know the place in scotland where we will find charles edwardeh and also a tokena ring a word perhaps by which that young adventurer will be made to trust his own person and that of his friends to our good ship it is very simple you see  quite simple your majesty  the ships orders will be that once the stuart and his faction are on board she shall make straight for the first english portandandthat is all he added complacently  yes that is all your majesty  and on the day that charles edward stuart is handed over to the english authorities there will be fifteen millions for your king madame and a million livres pin money for the most able statesman in europe  and with consummate gallantry louis bowed very low and took her hand in his it rested cold and inert between his hot fingers but he was far too eager far too triumphant to notice anything beyond the fact that he had succeeded in enlisting the help of lydie deglinton without whom his project was bound to have been considerably delayed if not completely frustrated he had indeed not wasted this glorious morning  i am eternally your debtor madame he said gaily and tis well believe me to serve the king of france  i have done nothing as yet sire she rejoined  nay but you will he said confidently  she bowed her head and he interpreted the movement according to his will but he was impatient longing to see this matter finally settled to his entire satisfaction  will you not give me a definite answer now  in the midst of so much chatter sire she said forcing herself to smile gaily nay but tis a serious matterand i must consult with my father  louis smiled contentedly m le duc daumont was at one with him in this the letter had been originally sent to the prime minister and the duke who was weak who was a slave to the bourbon dynasty and who alas was also tainted with that horrible canker which was gradually affecting the whole of the aristocracy of france the insatiable greed for money had been bribed to agree with the king  therefore louis was content it was as well that lydie should speak with the duke the worthy daumont would dissipate her last lingering scruples  and your husband he added casting a quick glance over his shoulder at milor and smiling with goodnatured sarcasm  oh my husband will think as i do she replied evasively  at thought of her father and the kings complacent smile lydie had winced for a moment her outward calm threatened to forsake her she felt as if she could not keep up this hideous comedy any longer she would have screamed aloud with horror or contempt aye and deep sorrow too to think that her father wallowed in this mire  she too cast a quick glance at milor his eyes were no longer fixed on her face he stood quietly beside madame de pompadour who leaving the king to settle with lydie had engaged lord eglinton in frivolous conversation he was quite placid again and in his face gentle and diffident as usual there was no longer the faintest trace of that sudden outburst of withering contempt  the duke of cumberlands letter was still in her hand it seemed to scorch her fingers with its loathsome pollution but she clung to it and after a violent effort at self control she contrived to look louis straight in the face and to give him a reassuring smile as she slipped the letter into the bosom of her gown  i will consult with my father sire she repeated and will read the letter when i am alone and undisturbed  and you will give me a final answer  the day after tomorrow  why not sooner he urged impatiently  the day after tomorrow she reiterated with a smile i have much to think about andthe only token which charles edward would trust without demur must come from lord eglinton  i understand said the king knowingly par ma foi but we shall want patience two whole days in the meanwhile well busy ourselves with preparations for the expedition we had thought of le monarque what say you  le levantin would be swifter  ah yes le levantinand we can trust her captain he is under deep obligation to madame de pompadour and m de lugeac madames nephew you knowwe had thought of him to carry the secret orders to brest to the captain of le levantin directly she is ready to sail methinks we could trust him his interests are bound up with ours and there is another too but more of that anon the secret orders will bear our own royal signature and you might place them yourself with the token in our chosen messengers hands  once more he gave her a gracious nod and she curtseyed with all the deference all the formality which the elaborate etiquette of the time demanded louis looked at her long and searchingly but apparently there was nothing in the calm serene face to disturb his present mood of complacent satisfaction he put out his podgy hand to her the short thick fingers were covered with rings up to their first joint and lydie contrived to kiss the large signetan emblem of that kingship to which she was true and loyalwithout letting her lips come in contact with his flesh  what happened during the next ten minutes she could not afterward have said her whole mind was in a turmoil of thought and every time the infamous letter crackled beneath her corselet she shuddered as with fear quite mechanically she saw the kings departure and apparently she acted with perfect decorum and correctness equally mechanically she saw the chattering throng gradually disperse the vast room became more and more empty the buzz less and less loud she saw milor as through a mist mostly with back bent receiving the adieux of sycophants she heard various murmurs in her own ears mostly requests that she should remember and be ready to give or at least to promise she saw the procession of courtiers of flatterers of friends and enemies pass slowly before her in the midst of them she vaguely distinguished mme de stainvilles brightly coloured gown  la belle irène lingered a long time beside milor she was one of the last to leave and though lydie forced herself not to look in that direction she could not help hearing the other womans irritating giggle and lord eglintons even pleasant voice framing compliments that pandered to that brainless dolls insatiable vanity  and this when he knew that his friend was about to be betrayed  the taint the horror the pollution of it all  fortunately she had not seen her father for her fortitude might have broken down if she read that same awful thought of treachery in his face that had so disgusted her when louis stood beside her  the last of that senseless indifferent crowd had gone the vast room was empty milor had accompanied mme de stainville as far as the door the murmur of talk and laughter came now only as a faint and lingering echo anon it died away in the distant corridors  lydie shivered as if with cold     chapter xvi  strangers   and now she was alone  torpor had left her even that intensity of loathing had gone which for the past halfhour had numbed her very senses and caused her to move and speak like an irresponsible automaton she felt as if she had indeed seen and touched a filthy evil reptile but that for the moment it had gone out of her sight presently it would creep out of its lair again but by that time she would be prepared  she must be prepared therefore she no longer shuddered at the horror of it but called her wits to her aid her cool judgment and habitual quick mode of action to combat the monster and render it powerless  she knew of course that the king would not allow himself to be put off with vague promises within the two days delay which she had asked of him he would begin to realize that she had only meant to temporise and never had any intention of helping him in his nefarious schemes then he would begin to act for himself  having understood that she meant to circumvent him if she could he was quite shrewd enough to devise some means of preventing those tempting millions from eluding his grasp though he did not know at the present moment where or how to lay his hands on prince charles edward and his friends he knew that they would of necessity seek the loneliness of the west coast of scotland  vaguely that particular shore had always been spoken of in connection with any expedition for the succour of the unfortunate prince and although the commissioning of ships was under the direct administration of the comptrôlleurgénéral of finance louis with the prospective millions dangling before him could easily enough equip le levantin and send her on a searching expedition without having recourse to state funds whilst it was more than likely that charles edward wearied of waiting and in hourly fear of detection and capture would be quite ready to trust himself and his friends to any french ship that happened to come on his track whether her captain brought him a token from his friend or not  all this and more would occur to king louis of course in the event of her finally refusing him coöperation or trying to put him off longer than a few days just as she had thought it all out visualized his mind as it were so these various plans would present themselves to him sooner of later it was a great thing to have gained two days fortyeight hours start of that ignoble scheme would she hoped enable her to counteract it yet  so much for king louis and his probable schemes now her own plans  to circumvent this awful treachery to forestall it that of course had become her task and it should not be so difficult given that two days start and some one whom she could trust  plans now became a little clearer in her head they seemed gradually to disentangle themselves from a maze of irrelevant thoughts  le monarque was ready to start at any moment captain barre her commander was the soul of honour a messenger swift and sure and trustworthy must ride to le havre forthwith with orders to the captain to set sail at once to reach that lonely spot on the west coast of scotland known only to herself and to her husband where charles edward stuart and his friends were even now waiting for succour  the signetringlord eglintonsentrusted to captain barre should ensure the fugitives immediate confidence there need be no delay and with favourable wind and weather le monarque should have the prince and his friends on board her before le levantin had been got ready to start  then le monarque should not return home direct she should skirt the irish coast and make for brittany by a circuitous route a grave delay perhaps but still the risks of being intercepted must be minimised at all costs  a lonely village inland would afford shelter to the young pretender and his adherents for a while until arrangements could be made for the final stage of their journey into safetyaustria spain or any country in fact where louis treachery could not overtake them  it was a big comprehensive scheme of course one which must be carried to its completion in defiance of king louis it was never good to incur the wrath of a bourbon and unless the nation and the parliaments ranged themselves unequivocally on her side it would probably mean the sudden ending of her own and her husbands career the finality of all her dreams but to this she hardly gave a thought  the project itself was not difficult of execution provided she had the coöperation of a man whom she could absolutely trust this was the most important detail in connection with her plans and it alone could ensure their success  her ally whoever he might be would have to start this very afternoon for le havre taking with him the orders for captain barre and the signet ring which she would give him  there were one hundred and fifty leagues between versailles and le havre as the crow flies and lydie was fully aware of the measure of strength and endurance which a forced ride across country and without drawing rein would entail  it would mean long gallops at breakneck speed whilst slowly the summers day yielded to the embrace of evening and anon the glowing dusk paled and swooned into the arms of night it would mean a swift and secret start at the hour when the scorching afternoon sun had not yet lifted its numbing weight from the journeymans limbs and still lulled the brain of the student to drowsiness and the siesta the hour when the luxurious idler was just waking from sleep and the labourer out in the field stretched himself after the noonday rest  it would mean above all youth and enthusiasm for le havre must be reached ere the rising sun brought the first blush of dawn on cliffs and crags and sea le monarque must set sail for scotland ere france woke from her sleep  twelve hours in the saddle a good mount the strength of a young bullock and the astuteness of a fox  lydie still sat in the window embrasure her eyes closed her graceful head with its wealth of chestnut hair resting against the delicate coloured cushions of her chair her perfectly modelled arms bared to the elbow lying listlessly in her lap one hand holding the infamous letter written by the duke of cumberland to king louis she herself a picture of thoughtful repose statuesque and cool  it was characteristic of her whole personality that she sat thus quite calmly thinking out the details of her plan apparently neither flustered nor excited the excitement was within the desire to be up and doing but she would have despised herself if she had been unable to conquer the outward expressions of her agitation the longing to walk up and down to tear up that ignoble letter or to smash some inoffensive article that happened to be lying by  her thoughts then could not have been so clear she could not have visualized the immediate future the departure of le monarque at dawncaptain barre receiving the signetringthat breakneck ride to le havre  then gradually from out the rest of the picture one figure detached itself from her mindher husband  le petit anglais the friend of charles edward stuart weak luxurious tactless but surely loyal  lydie half smiled when the thought first took shape she knew so little of her husband just now when she heard him condemn the kings treacherous proposals with such unequivocal words of contempt she had half despised him for this blundering want of diplomatic art manlike he had been unable to disguise his loathing for louis perfidy and by trying to proclaim his loyalty to his friend all but precipitated the catastrophe that would have delivered charles edward stuart into the hands of the english but for lydies timely interference the king angered and huffed would have departed then and there and matured his own schemes before anything could be done to foil them  but with her feeling of goodnatured disdain there had even then mingled a sensation of trust this she recalled now when her mind went in search of the man in whom she could confide she would in any case have to ask her husband for the token agreed on between him and the stuart prince and also for final directions as to the exact spot where the fugitives would be most surely found by captain barre  then why should he not himself take both to le havre  again she smiled at the thought the idea had occurred to her that she did not even know if milor could ride and if perchance he did sit a horse well had he the physical strength the necessary endurance for that flight across country without a halt with scarce a morsel of food on the way  she knew so little about him their lives had been spent apart one brief year of wedded life and they were more strange to one another than even they had been before their marriage he no doubt thought her hard and unfeminine she of a truth deemed him weak and unmanly  still there was no one else and with her usual determination she forced her wellschooled mind to dismiss all those thoughts of her husband which were disparaging to him she tried not to see him as she had done a little while ago giving himself over so readily to the artificial life of this court of versailles and its enervating etiquette yielding to the whispered flatteries of irène de stainville pandering to her vanity admiring her femininity no doubt in direct contrast to his wifes more robust individuality  afterward whenever she thought the whole matter over she never could describe accurately the succession of events just as they occurred on that morning she seemed after a while to have roused herself from her meditations having fully made up her mind to carry her project through from beginning to end and with that infamous letter still in her hand she rose from her chair and walked across the vast audience chamber with the intention of going to her own study there to think out quietly the final details of her plans  her mind was of course intent on the stuart prince and his friends on le monarque and captain barre and also very much now on her husband but she could never recollect subsequently at what precise moment the actual voice of lord eglinton became mingled with her thoughts of him  certain it is that when in crossing the room she passed close to the thronelike bedstead whereupon her strangely perturbed imagination wilfully conjured up the picture of milor holding his court with la belle irène in a brilliant rosecoloured gown complacently receiving his marked attentions she suddenly heard him speak  one second i entreat you madame if you can spare it  her own hand at the moment was on that gilded knob of the door through which she had been about to pass his voice came from somewhere close behind her  she turned slightly toward him and saw him standing there looking very fixedly at her with a gaze which had something of entreaty in it and also an unexplainable subtle something which at first she could not quite understand  i was going to my study milor she said a little taken aback for she certainly had not thought him in the room  therefore i must crave your indulgence if i intrude he said simply  can i serve you in any way  your ladyship is pleased to be gracious  yes  she was accustomed to his diffident manner and to his halting speech which usually had the knack of irritating her but just now she seemed inclined to be kind she felt distinctly pleased that he was here to her keenly sensitive nature it seemed as if it had been her thoughts which had called to him and that something in him responded to her wish that he should be the man to take her confidential message to the commander of le monarque  now his eyes dropped from her face and fixed themselves on the hand which had fallen loosely to her side  that paper which you hold madame  yes  i pray you give it to me  to you why she asked as the encouraging smile suddenly vanished from her face  because i cannot bear the sight of mme la marquise deglinton my wife sullying her fingers one second longer by contact with this infamy  he spoke very quietly in that even gentle diffident voice of his whilst his eyes once more riveted themselves on her face  instinctively she clutched the letter tighter and her whole figure seemed to stiffen as she looked at him full now a deep frown between her eyes her whole attitude suggestive of haughty surprise and of lofty contempt there was dead silence in the vast room save for the crackling of that paper which to a keenly sensitive ear would have suggested the idea that the dainty hand which held it was not as steady as its owner would have wished  it seemed suddenly as if with the speaking of a few words these two people who had been almost strangers had by a subtle process become antagonists and were unconsciously measuring one anothers strength mistrustful of one anothers hidden weapons but already the woman was prepared for a conflict of will a contest for that hitherto undisputed mastery which she vaguely feared was being attacked and which she would not give up be the cost of defence what it may whilst the man was still diffident still vaguely hopeful that she would not fight for his armour was vulnerable where hers was not and she owned certain weapons which he knew himself too weak to combat  therefore i proffer my request again madame he said after a pause that paper  a strong request milor said lydie coldly  it is more than a request madame  a command perhaps  he did not reply obviously he had noted the sneer for a very slight blush rose to his pale cheeks lydie satisfied that the shaft had gone home paused awhile just long enough to let the subtle poison of her last words sink well in then she resumed with calm indifference  you will forgive me milor when i venture to call your attention to the fact that hitherto i have considered myself to be the sole judge and mentor of my own conduct  possibly this has worked very well in all matters madame he replied quite unruffled by her sarcasm but in this instance you see me compelled to ask youreluctantly i admitto give me that letter and then to vouchsafe me an explanation as to what you mean to do  you will receive it in due course milor she said haughtily for the moment i must ask you to excuse me i am busy and  she was conscious of an overwhelming feeling of irritation at his interference and fearing to betray it beyond the bounds of courtesy she wished to go away but now he deliberately placed his hand on the knob and stood between her and the door  milor she protested  yes i am afraid i am very clumsy madame he said quite gently let us suppose that french good manners have never quite succeeded in getting the best of my english boorishness i know it is against every rule of etiquette that i should stand between you and the door through which you desire to pass but i have humbly asked for an explanation and also for that letter and i cannot allow your ladyship to go until i have had it  allow she said with a short mocking laugh surely milor you will not force me to refer to the compact to which you willingly subscribed when you asked me to be your wife  tis not necessary madame for i well remember it i gave you a promise not to interfere with your life such as you had chosen to organize it i promised to leave you free in thought action and conduct just as you had been before you honoured me by consenting to bear my name  well then milor she asked  this is a different matter mme la marquise he replied calmly since it concerns mine own honour and that of my name of that honour i claim to be the principal guardian  then as she seemed disinclined to vouchsafe a rejoinder he continued with just a shade more vehemence in his tone  the proposal which his majesty placed before me awhile ago that same letter which you still hold in your hand are such vile and noisome things that actual contact with them is pollution as i see you now with that infamous document between those fingers which i have had the honour to kiss it seems to me as if you were clutching a hideous and venomous reptile the very sight of which should have been loathsome to you and from which i should have wished to see you turn as you would from a slimy toad  as you did yourself milor she said with a contemptuous shrug of the shoulders thinking of his blunder of the catastrophe which he all but precipitated and which her more calm diplomacy had perhaps averted  as i did though no doubt very clumsily he admitted simply the moment i grasped its purport to the full to see you my wifeyes my wife he repeated with unusual firmness in answer to a subtle indefinable expression which at his words had lit up her face to see you pause if only for one brief half hour with that infamy before your eyes with that vile suggestion reaching and dwelling in your brain the man who made itbe he king of france i care notkissing those same fingers which held the abominable thing was unspeakably horrible in my sight it brought real physical agony to every one of my senses i endured it only for so long as etiquette demanded hoping against hope that every second which went by would witness your cry of indignation your contempt for that vile and execrable letter which had you not interposed i myself would have flung in the lying face of that kingly traitor but you smiled at him in response you took the letter from him my god i saw you put it in the bosom of your gown  he paused a moment as if ashamed of this outburst of passion so different to his usual impassiveness it seemed as if her haughty look her illconcealed contempt was goading him on beyond the bounds of restraint which he had meant to impose on himself she no longer now made an attempt to go she was standing straight before him leaning slightly back against the portièrea curtain of rich heavy silk of that subtle brilliant shade twixt a scarlet and a crimson which is only met with in certain species of geranium  against this glowing background her slim erect figure stiff with unbendable pride stood out in vivid relief the red of the silk cast ardent reflections into her chestnut hair and against the creamy whiteness of her neck and ear the sober almost conventual gray of her gown the primly folded kerchief at her throat the billows of lace around the graceful arm formed an exquisite note of tender colour against that glaring geranium red in one hand she still held the letter the other rested firmly against the curtain the head was thrown back the lips slightly parted and curled in disdain the eyeshalf veiledlooked at him through long fringed lashes  a picture worthy to inflame the passion of any man lord eglinton with a mechanical movement of the hand across his forehead seemed to brush away some painful and persistent thought  nay do not pause milor she said quietly believe me you interest me vastly  he frowned and bit his lip  your pardon madame he rejoined more calmly now i was forgetting the limits of courtly manners i have little more to say i would not have troubled you with so much talk knowing that my feeling in such matters can have no interest for your ladyship when awhile ago this great bare room was at last free from the bentbacked mouthing flatterers that surround you i waited patiently for a spontaneous word from you something to tell me that the honour of my name one of the oldest in england was not like to be stained by contact with the diplomatic byways of france i had not then thought of asking for an explanation i waited for you to speak instead of which i saw you take that miserable letter once more in your hand sit and ponder over it without a thought or look for me i saw your face serene and placid your attitude one of statesmanlike calm as without a word or nod you prepared to pass out of my sight  then you thought fit to demand from me an explanation of my conduct in a matter in which you swore most solemnly a year ago that you would never interfere  demand is a great word madame he said now quite gently i do not demand i ask for an explanation on my knees  and just as he had done a year ago when first she laid her hand in his and he made his profession of faith he dropped on one knee and bent his head until his aching brow almost touched her gown  she looked down on him from the altitude of her domineering pride she saw his broad shoulders bent in perfect humility his chestnut hair free from the conventional powder the slender hands linked together now in a strangely nervous clasp and she drew back because her skirt seemed perilously near his fingers  will the gods ever reveal the secret of a womans heart lydie loathed the kings proposal the letter which she held just as much as lord eglinton did himself awhile ago she had hardly been able to think or to act coherently while she felt the contact of that noisome paper against her flesh if she had smiled on louis if she had taken the letter away from him with vague promises that she would think the matter over it had been solely because she knew the man with whom she had to deal better than did milor eglinton who had but little experience of the court of versailles since he had kept away from it during the major part of his life she had only meant to temporize with the king because she felt sure that that was the only way to serve the stuart prince and to avert the treachery  nay more in her heart she felt that milor was right she knew that when a thing is so vile and so abominable as louis proposed scheme all contact with it is a pollution and that it is impossible to finger slimy mud without some of it clinging to flesh or gown  yet with all that in her mind a subtle perversity seemed suddenly to have crept into her heart a perversity and also a bitter sense of injustice she and her husband had been utter strangers since the day of their marriage she had excluded him from her counsels just as she had done from her heart and mind she had never tried to understand him and merely fostered that mild contempt which his diffidence and his meekness had originally roused in her yet at this moment when he so obviously misunderstood her when he thought that her attitude with regard to the kings proposals was one of acceptance or at least not of complete condemnation her pride rose in violent revolt  he had no right to think her so base he had invaded her thoughts at the very moment when they dwelt on his friend and the best mode to save him nay more was she not proposing to associate him who now accused her so groundlessly with her work of devotion and loyalty  he should have known he should have guessed and now she hated him for his thoughts of her she who had kept herself untainted in the midst of the worst corruption that ever infested a court whose purity of motives whose upright judgments had procured her countless enemies amongst the imbecile and the infamous she to be asked and begged to be loyal and to despise treachery  nay she was too proud now to explain an explanation would seem like a surrender an acknowledgmentpar dieu of what and certainly a humiliation  according to milor her husband was there not one single upright and loyal soul in france except his own no honour save that of his own name  she laughed suddenly laughed loudly and long manlike he did not notice the forced ring of that merriment he had blundered of course but this he did not know in the simplicity of his heart he thought that she would have been ready to understand that she would have explained and then agreed with him as to the best means of throwing the nefarious proposal back into the kings teeth  at her laugh he sprang to his feet every drop of blood seemed to have left his cheeks which were now ashy pale  nay milor she said with biting sarcasm but tis a mountain full of surprises that you display before my astonished fancy who had eer suspected you of so much eloquence i vow i do not understand how your lordship could have seen so much of my doings just now seeing that at that moment you had eyes and ears only for irène de stainville  mme de stainville hath naught to do with the present matter madame he rejoined nor with my request for an explanation from you  i refuse to give it milor she said proudly and as i have no wish to spoil or mar your pleasures so do i pray you to remember our bond which is that you leave me free to act and speak aye and to guide the destinies of france if she have need of me without interference from you  and with that refinement of cruelty of which a womans heart is sometimes capable at moments of acute crises she carefully folded the english letter and once more slipped it into the bosom of her gown she vouchsafed him no other look but gathering her skirts round her she turned and left him calm and erect she walked the whole length of the room and then passed through another doorway finally out of his sight     part iii  the woman     chapter xvii  splendid isolation   m durand looked flustered when lydie suddenly entered his sanctum but she was hardly conscious of his presence or even of where she was  the vast audience chamber which she had just quitted so abruptly had only the two exits the one close to which she had left milor standing and the other which gave into this antechamber where m durand usually sat for the express purpose of separating the wheat from the chaffor in other words the suppliants who had letters of introduction or passports to le petit lever of m le contrôleurgénéral from those who had not  it was not often that mme la marquise came this way at all no doubt this accounted in some measure for m durands agitation when she opened the door so suddenly had lydie been less absorbed in her own thoughts she would have noticed that his hands fidgeted quite nervously with the papers on his bureau and that his pale watery eyes wandered with anxious restlessness from her face to the heavy portière which masked one of the doors but indeed at this moment neither m durand nor his surroundings existed for her she crossed the antechamber rapidly without seeing him she only wanted to get away to put the whole enfilade of the next reception rooms between herself and the scene which had just taken place  something was ringing in her ears she could not say for certain whether she had really heard it or whether her quivering nerves were playing her a trick but a cry had come to her across the vastness of the great audiencechamber and rang now even through the closed door  a cry of acute agony a cry as of an animal in pain the word lydie the tone one of reproach of appeal of aching wounded passion  she fled from it unwilling to admit its reality unwilling to believe her ears she felt too deeply wounded herself to care for the pain of another she hoped indeed that she had grievously hurt his pride his selfrespect that very love which he had once professed for her and which apparently had ceased to be  once he had knelt at her feet comparing her to the madonna to the saints whom catholics revered yet dared not approach then he talked of worship and now he spoke of pollution of stained honour and asked her to keep herself free from taint what right had he not to understand if he still loved her he would have understood but constant intercourse with irène de stainville had blurred his inward vision the image of the madonna serene and unapproachable had become faded and out of focus and he now groped earthwards for less unattainable ideals  that this was in any way her fault lydie would not admit she had become his wife because he had asked her and because he had been willing to cover her wounded vanity with the mantle of his adoration and the glamour of his wealth and title he knew her for what she was statuesque and cold either more or less than an ordinary woman since she was wholly devoid of sentimentality but with a purpose in her mind and a passion for work for power and influence work for the good of france power to attain this end  thus he had found her thus he had first learned to love her she had denied him nothing that he had ever dared to ask this had been a bond between them which now he had tried to break but if he had loved her as heretofore he would not have asked he would have known how and by what subtle process of his mind lydie did not care to analyze  he would have known he would have understood if he still loved her  these two phrases went hammering in her brain a complement to that cry which still seemed to reach her senses although the whole enfilade of reception rooms now stretched their vastness between her and that persistent echo  of course his love had been naught to her it was nothing more at best than mute somewhat doglike adoration a love that demanded nothing that was content to be to exist passively and to worship from afar  womanlike she apprised it in inverse ratio to its obtrusiveness the less that was asked of her the less she thought it worth while to give but the love had always been there at great social functions in the midst of a crowd or in the presence of royalty whenever she looked across a room or over a sea of faces she saw a pair of eyes which rested on her every movement with rapt attention and unspoken admiration  now she would have to forego that the love was no longer there on this she insisted repeating it to herself over and over again though this seemed to increase both the tension of her nerves and the strange tendency to weakness from which her proud spirit shrank in rebellion  she was walking very rapidly now and as she reached the monumental staircase she ran down the steps without heeding the astonished glances of the army of flunkeys that stood about on landing and corridors in a moment she was out on the terrace breathing more freely as soon as she filled her lungs with the pure air of this glorious summers day  at first the light the glare the vibration of water and leaves under the kiss of the midday sun dazzled her eyes so that she could not see but she heard the chirrup of the sparrows the call of thrush and blackbird and far away the hymn of praise of the skylark her nostrils drew in with glad intoxication the pungent fragrance of oakleaved geraniums and her heart called out joyfully to the secluded plantation of young beech trees there on her left where she often used to wander  thither now she bent her steps it was a favourite walk of hers and a cherished spot for she had it always before her when she sat in her own study at the angle of the west wing the tall windows of her private sanctum gave on this plantation and whenever she felt wearied or disheartened with the great burden which she had taken on her shoulders she would sit beside the open casements and rest her eyes on the brilliant emerald or copper of the leaves and find rest and solace in the absolute peace they proclaimed  and at times like the present one when the park was still deserted she liked to wander in that miniature wood crushing with delight the moist bed of moss under her feet letting the dewcovered twigs fall back with a swish against her hands she found her way to a tiny glade where a rough garden seat invited repose the glade was circular in shape a perfect audience chamber wherein to review a whole army of fancies on the ground a thick carpet of brilliant green with designs of rich sienna formed by last years leaves and flecks of silver of young buds not yet scorched by the midday sun all around walls of parallel slender trunks of a tender graygreen colour with bold patches of glaring viridian and gold intermixed with dull blue shadows and then a dado of tall bracken fantastic in shape and almost weird in outline through which there peeped here and there with insolent luxuriance clumps of purple and snowwhite foxgloves  lydie sank on to the rough bench leaning well back and resting her head against the hard uneven back of the seat her eyes gazed straight upwards to a patch of vivid blue sky almost crude and artificiallooking above the canopy of the beeches  she felt unspeakably lonely unspeakably forsaken the sense of injustice oppressed her even more than the atmosphere of treachery  her father false and weak her husband fickle and unjust prince charles edward abandoned and she now powerless probably to carry through the work of rescue which she had planned until this moment she had not realized how much she had counted on her husband to help her now that she could no longer ask him to ride to le havre and take her message to the commander of le monarque she cast about her in vain for a substitute some one whom she could trust her world was made up of sycophants of flatterers of pleasureloving fops where was the man who would cover one hundred and eighty leagues in one night in order to redeem a promise made by france  her head ached with the agony of this thought it was terrible to see her most cherished hope threatened with annihilation oh had she been a man     tears gathered in her eyes at other times she would have scorned the weakness now she welcomed it for it seemed to lift the load of oppression from her heart the glare of that vivid blue sky above weighed down her lids she closed her eyes and for the space of a few seconds she seemed to forget everything the world and its treachery the palace of versailles the fugitives in scotland  everything except her loneliness and the sound of that cry lydie     chapter xviii  clever tactics   as soon as m durand had recovered from the shock of madame la marquises sudden invasion of his sanctum he ran to the portière which he had been watching so anxiously and pushing it aside he disclosed the door partially open  monsieur le comte de stainville he called discreetly  has she gone came in a whisper from the inner room  yes yes i pray you enter m le comte said m durand obsequiously holding the portière aside madame la marquise only passed through very quickly she took notice of nothing i assure you  gaston de stainville cast a quick searching glance round the room as he entered and fidgeted nervously with a lace handkerchief in his hand no doubt his enforced sudden retreat at lydies approach had been humiliating to his pride but he did not want to come on her too abruptly and was chafing now because he needed a menials help to further his desires  you were a fool man to place me in this awkward position he said with a scowl directed at m durands meek personality or else a knave in which case     ten thousand pardons m le comte rejoined the little man apologetically madame la marquise scarcely ever comes this way after le petit lever she invariably retires to her study and thither i should have had the honour to conduct you according to your wish  you seem very sure that madame la marquise would have granted me a private audience  i would have done my best to obtain one for m le comte said m durand with becoming modesty and i think i should have succeeded    with tact and diplomacy monsieur le comte we who are privileged to     yes yes interrupted gaston impatiently but now  ah now it will be much more difficult madame la marquise is not in her study and     and you will want more pay quoth gaston with a sneer  oh monsieur le comte    protested durand  well how much more said the comte impatiently  what does m le comte desire  to speak with madame la marquise quite alone  heu    heu    it is difficult     but gaston de stainvilles stock of patience was running low he never had a great deal with a violent oath he seized the little man by the collar  two louis you knave for getting me that audience now at once or my flunkeys stick across your shoulders if you fool me any longer  m durand apparently was not altogether unprepared for this outburst perhaps his peculiar position had often subjected him to similar onslaughts on the part of irate and aristocratic supplicants anyway he did not seem at all disturbed and as soon as the comtes grip on his collar relaxed he readjusted his coat and his cravat and holding out his thin hand he said meekly  the two louis i pray you monsieur le comte and he added when gaston with another oath finally placed the two gold pieces on the meagre palm will you deign to follow me  he led the way through the large folding doors and thence along the enfilade of gorgeous reception rooms the corridors landings and staircase which lydie herself had traversed just now gaston de stainville followed him at a close distance acknowledging with a curt nod here and there the respectful salutations of the many lackeys whom he passed  m le comte de stainville was an important personage at court madame de pompadours predilection for him was well known and his majesty himself was passing fond of the gallant gentlemans company whilst madame la comtesse was believed to hold undisputed sway over m le contrôleurgénéral des finances  thus gaston met with obsequiousness wherever he went and this despite the fact that he was not lavish with money m durand would have expected a much heavier bribe from any one else for this service which he was now rendering to the comte  anon the two men reached the terrace m durand then pointed with one clawlike finger to the spinney on the left  m le comte will find madame la marquise in yonder plantation he said as for me i dare not vacate my post any longer for m le contrôleur might have need of me nor would monsieur le comte care mayhap to be seen by madame la marquise in my company  gaston assented he was glad to be rid of the mealymouthed creature of whose necessary help in this matter he was heartily ashamed unlike lydie he was quite unconscious of the beauty of this august day neither the birds nor the acrid scent of late summer flowers appealed to his fancy and the clump of young beech trees only interested him in so far as he hoped to find lydie there alone  when he reached the little glade he caught sight of the graceful figure halfsitting halfreclining in the unconscious charm of sleep overcome by the heat and the glare lydie had dozed off momentarily  presently something caused her to open her eyes and she saw gaston de stainville standing there looking at her intently  she was taken at a disadvantage since she had undoubtedly been asleepif only for a momentand she was not quite sure if her pose when gaston first caught sight of her was sufficiently dignified  i am afraid i have disturbed you he said humbly  i was meditating she replied coldly as she smoothed down her skirts and mechanically put a hand to her hair lest a curl had gone astray  then she made as if she would rise  surely you are not going he pleaded  i have my work to do i only stayed here a moment in order to rest  and i am intruding  oh scarcely she replied quietly i was about to return to my work  is it so urgent  the business of a nation m le comte is always urgent  so urgent that you have no time now to give to old friends he said bitterly  she shrugged her shoulders with a quick sarcastic laugh  old friends    oh     yes old friends he rejoined quietly we were children together lydie  much has occurred since then monsieur le comte  only one great and awful fault which meseems hath been its own expiation  need we refer to that now she asked calmly  indeed indeed we must he replied earnestly lydie am i never to be forgiven  is there aught for me to forgive  yes an error a grave error    a fault if you will call it so     i prefer to call it a treachery she said  without one word of explanation without listening to a single word from me is that just  there is nothing that you could say now monsieur le comte that i should have the right to hear  why so he said with sudden vehemence as he came nearer to her and in a measure barred the way by which she might have escaped even a criminal at point of death is allowed to say a few words in selfdefence yet i was no criminal if i loved you lydie was that wrong    i was an immeasurable fool i own that he added more calmly being quick to note that he only angered her by his violence and it is impossible for a highminded woman like yourself to understand the pitfalls which beset the path of a man who has riches good looks mayhap and a great name all of which will tempt the cupidity of certain designing women bent above all on matrimony on influence and independence into one of these pitfalls i fell lydie    fell clumsily stupidly i own but not inexcusably  you seem to forget m le comte she said stiffly that you are speaking of your wife  nay he said with a certain sad dignity i try not to forget it i do not accuse i merely state a fact and do so before the woman whom i most honour in the world who was the first recipient of my childish confidences the first consoler of my boyhoods sorrows  that was when you were free m le comte and could bring your confidences to me now they justly belong to another and     and by the heavens above me he interrupted eagerly i do that other no wrong by bringing my sorrows to you and laying them with a prayer for consolation at your feet  he noted that since that first desire to leave him lydie had made no other attempt to go she was sitting in the angle of the rough garden seat her graceful arm resting on the back her cheek leaning against her hand a gentle breeze stirred the little curls round her head and now when he spoke so earnestly and so sadly about his sorrow a swift look of sympathy softened the haughty expression of her mouth  quick to notice it gaston nevertheless in no way relaxed his attitude of humble supplication he stood before her with head bent his eyes mostly riveted on the ground  there is so little consolation that i can give she said more gently  there is a great one if you will but try  what is it  do not cast me out from your life altogether am i such a despicable creature that you cannot now and then vouchsafe me one kind look    i did wrong you    i know it    call it treachery if you must yet when i look back on that night meseems i am worthy of your pity blinded by my overwhelming love for you i forgot everything for one brief hour    forgot that i had sunk deeply in a pitfallby heaven through no fault of mine own    forgot that another now had a claim on that love which never was mine to give since it had always been wholly yours    yes i forgot    the music the noise the excitement of the night your own beauty lydie momentarily addled my brain    i forgot the past i only lived for the present am i to blame because i am a man and that you are exquisitely fair  he forced himself not to raise his voice not to appear eager or vehement lydie only saw before her a man whom she had once loved who had grievously wronged her but who now stood before her ashamed and humbled asking with utmost respect for her forgiveness of the past  let us speak of it no longer she said believe me gaston i have never borne you illwill  for the first time she had used his christian name the layer of ice was broken through but the surface of the lake was still cold and smooth  nay but you avoid me he rejoined seeking to meet her eyes you treat me with wholehearted contempt whilst i would lay down my life to serve you and this in all deference and honour as the martyrs of old laid down their life for their faith  protestations gaston she said with a quick sigh  let me prove them true he urged lydie i watched you just now while you slept it was some minutes and i saw much your lips were parted with constant sighs there were tears at the points of your lashes at that moment i would have gladly died if thereby i could have eased your heart from the obvious burden which it bore  emboldened by her silence and by the softer expression of her face he sat down close beside her and anon placed his hand on hers she withdrew it quietly and serenely as was her wont but quite without anger  she certainly felt no anger toward him strangely enough the anger she did feel was all against her husband that gaston had seen her grief was in a measure humiliating to her pride and this humiliation she owed to the great wrong done her by milor and gaston had been clever at choosing his words he appealed to her pity and asked for forgiveness there was no attempt on his part to justify himself and his selfabasement broke down the barrier of resentment which up to now she had set up against him his respectful homage soothed her wounded pride and she felt really sincerely sorry for him  the fact that her own actions had been so gravely misunderstood also helped gastons cause she felt that after all she too might have passed a hasty unconsidered judgment on him and knew now how acutely such a judgment can hurt  and he spoke very earnestly very simply remember that she had loved him once loved and trusted him he had been the ideal of her girlhood and though she had remorselessly hurled him down from his high pedestal since then there remained nevertheless somewhere in the depths of her heart a lingering thought of tenderness for him  lydie he now said appealingly  yes  let me be the means of easing your heart from its load of sorrow you spoke of my wife just now see i do not shirk the mention of her name i swear to you by that early love for you which was the noblest purest emotion of my life that i do not wrong her by a single thought when i ask for your friendship you are so immeasurably superior to all other women lydie that in your presence passion itself becomes exalted and desire transformed into a craving for sacrifice  oh how i wish i could believe you gaston she sighed  try me  how  let me guess what troubles you now oh i am not the emptyheaded fop that you would believe i have ears and eyes and if i hold aloof from court intrigues it is only because i see too much of their inner workings do you really believe that i do not see what goes on around me now do i not know how your noble sympathy must at this very moment be going out to the unfortunate young prince whom you honour with your friendship surely surely you cannot be a party to the criminal supineness which at this very moment besets france and causes her to abandon him to his fate  not france gaston she protested  and not you surely i would stake my life on your loyalty to a friend  of course she said simply  i knew it he ejaculated triumphantly as if this discovery had indeed caused him joyful surprise every fibre in my soul told me that i would not appeal to you in vain you are clever lydie you are rich you are powerful i feel as if i could turn to you as to a man prince charles edward stuart honoured me with his friendship i am not presumptuous when i say that i stood in his heart second only to lord eglinton    but because i hold a secondary place i dared not thrust my advice my prayers my help forward whilst i firmly believed that his greater friend was at work on his behalf but now i can bear the suspense no longer the crisis has become overacute the stuart prince is in deadly danger not only from supineness but from treachery  clever gaston how subtle and how shrewd she would never have to come to meet him on this ground but he called to her he came to fetch her as it were and led her along the road he did not offer to guide her faltering footsteps he simulated lameness and asked for assistance instead of offering it  so clever was this move that lydie was thrown off her guard at the word treachery she looked eagerly into his eyes  what makes you think     she asked  oh i have scented it in the air for some days the king himself wears an air of shamefacedness when the stuart prince is mentioned madame de pompadour lately hath talked freely of the completion of her château in the parc aux cerfs as if money were forthcoming from some unexpected source then a letter came from england which his majesty keeps hidden in his pocket whilst whispered conversations are carried on between the king and madame which cease abruptly if any one comes within earshot then today     yes    today she asked eagerly  i hardly dare speak of it  why  i fear it might give you pain  i am used to pain she said simply and i would wish to know  i was in the antechamber when his majesty arrived for le petit lever of m le contrôleur i had had vague hopes of seeing you this morning and lingered about the reception rooms somewhat listlessly my thoughts dwelling on all the sad news which has lately come from scotland in the antechamber his majesty was met by m le duc daumont your father  he paused again as if loth to speak but she said quite calmly  and you overheard something which the duke my father said to the king and which confirmed your suspicions what was it  it was his majesty who spoke obviously not aware that i was within earshot he said quite airily oh if we cannot persuade milor we must act independently of him the stuart will be tired by now of living in crags and will not be so chary of entrusting his valuable person to a comfortable french ship then m le duc placed a hand on his majestys arm warning him of my presence and nothing more was said  then you think that the king of france is about to deliver prince charles edward stuart to his enemies she asked calmly  i am sure of it and the thought is more than i can bear and i am not alone in this lydie the whole of france will cry out in shame at such perfidy heaven knows what will come of it ultimately but surely surely we cannot allow that unfortunate young prince whom we all loved and fêted to be thus handed over to the english authorities that is why i have dared intrude on you today lydie he added now in a passionate appeal for the sake of that noble if misguided young prince will you try and forget the terrible wrong which i in my madness and blindness once did you do not allow my sin to be expiated by him    i crave your help for him on my knees    hate me an you will despise me and punish me but do not deny me your help for him  his voice though sunk now almost to a whisper was vibrating with passion he half dropped on his knees took the edge of her skirt between his fingers and raised it to his lips  clever clever gaston he had indeed moved her her serenity had gone and her cold impassiveness she sat up erect palpitating with excitement her eyes glowing her lips parted all her senses awake and thrilling with this unexpected hope  in what manner do you wish for my help gaston  i think the king and m le duc will do nothing for a day or two at any rate i hoped i could forestall them with your help lydie if you will give it i am not rich but i have realized some of my fortune my intention was to charter a seaworthy boat equip her as well as my means allowed and start for scotland immediately and then if possible to induce the prince to cross over with me to ireland or with great good luck i might even bring him back as far as brittany but you see how helpless i was for i dared not approach you and i do not know where i can find the prince  and if i do not give you that help which you need she asked  i would still charter the vessel and start for scotland he replied quietly i cannot stay here in inactivity whilst i feel that infamous treachery is being planned against a man with whom i have often broken bread if you will not tell me where i can find charles edward stuart i will still equip a vessel and try and find him somehow if i fail i will not return but at any rate i shall then not be a party or a witness to the everlasting shame of france  your expedition would require great pluck and endurance  i have both and boundless enthusiasm to boot two or three friends will accompany me and my intention was to start for brest or le havre tonight but if you will consent to help me lydie     nay she interrupted eagerly ill not help you tis you who shall help me  lydie  the plan which you have formed i too had thought on it the treachery of the king of france my god i knew it too but my plans are more mature than yours less noble and selfsacrificing for as you say i have power and influence yet with all that power i could not serve prince charles edward as i would wish to do because though i have pluck and endurance i am not a man  and you want me to help you thank god thank god for that tell me what to do  to start for le havrenot brest  yes  this afternoon    reaching le havre before dawn  yes  there to seek out le monarque she lies in the harbour and her commander is captain barre  yes yes  you will hand him over a packet which i will give you anon and then return here as swiftly as you went  is that all he asked in obvious disappointment and i who had hoped that you would ask me to give my life for you  the faithful and speedy performance of this errand gaston is worth the most sublime selfsacrifice if this be purposeless the packet will contain full instructions for captain barre how and where to find prince charles edward le monarque is ready equipped for the expedition but    she paused a moment as if half ashamed of the admission i had no one whom i could entrust with the message  gaston de stainville was too keen a diplomatist to venture on this delicate ground he had never once mentioned her husbands name fearing to scare her or to sting her pride he knew her to be far too loyal to allow condemnation of her lord by the lips of another man all he said now was a conventional  i am ready  then she rose and held out her hand to him he bowed with great deference and kissed the tips of her fingers his face expressed nothing but the respectful desire to be of service and not one thought of treachery disturbed lydies serenity historians have we know blamed her very severely for this unconditional yielding of anothers secret into the keeping of a man who had already deceived her once but it was the combination of circumstances which caused her to act thus and gastons masterly move in asking for her help had completely subjugated her she would have yielded to no other emotion but that of compassion for him and the desire to render him assistance in a cause which she herself had so deeply at heart she had no love for gaston and no amount of the usual protestations would have wrung a confidence from her but he had so turned the tables that it appeared that he was confiding in her and her pride which had been so deeply humiliated that selfsame morning responded to his appeal if she had had the least doubt or fear in her mind she would not have given up her secret but as he stood so coldly and impassively before her without a trace of passion in his voice or look she had absolutely no misgivings  i can be in the saddle at four oclock he said in the same unemotional tones when and how can i receive the packet from you  will you wait for me here she replied the packet is quite ready and the walls of the palace have eyes and ears  thus they parted she full of confidence and hope not in any way attempting to disguise before him the joy and gratitude which she felt he the more calm of the two fearing to betray his sense of triumph still trembling lest her present mood should change  her graceful figure quickly disappeared among the trees he gave a sigh of intense satisfaction his majesty would be pleased and madame de pompadour would be more than kind never for a moment did the least feeling of remorse trouble his complacent mind the dominant thought in him was one of absolute triumph and pride at having succeeded in hoodwinking the keenest statesman in france he sat down on the garden seat whereon had been fought that close duel between himself and the woman whom he had once already so heartlessly betrayed he thought over every stage of the past scene and smiled somewhat grimly he felt quite sure that he individually would never have trusted for the second time a woman who had once deceived him but lydie had no such misgivings as she now sped through the park she no longer saw its artificiality its stunted rose trees and the stultified plantations the air was invigorating to breathe the fragrance of the flowers was sweet the birds twitter was delicious to the ear there were good and beautiful things in this world but the best of all was the loyalty of a friend     chapter xix  a crisis   lydie returned to the palace in a very different frame of mind than when half an hour ago she had run along corridor and staircase her nerves on the jar her whole being smarting under the sense of wrong and of injustice  hope had consoled her since then and the thought that her own cherished plan need not fail for want of a loyal mans help had in a measure eased that strange obsession which had weighed on her heart and caused foolish tears to start to her eyes she was also conscious of a certain joy in thinking that the companion of her childhood the man who had been her earliest ideal was not so black a traitor as she had believed  gaston had spoken of pitfalls he owned to having been deceived and there is no woman living who will not readily admit that her successful rival is naught but a designing minx gaston had always been weak where women were concerned and lydie forgave him his weakness simply because he had owned to it and because she liked to think of his fault as a weakness rather than as a deliberate treachery  now she only thought of her project when first she had talked of commissioning le monarque milor had entrusted her with all necessary directions by which captain barre could most easily reach the stuart prince and his friends it was but a very few weeks nay days ago that she had been quite convinced that the king himself would be foremost in the general desire to fit out an expedition for the rescue of the unfortunate jacobites and naturally the fittingout of such an expedition would have been entrusted primarily to herself and incidentally to her husband  these directions she still had all she had to do now was to embody them in the secret orders which gaston de stainville would hand over to the commander of le monarque further orders would be anent getting the prince and his friends on board and the route to be taken homeward the better to ensure their safety  beyond that she would need some sort of token which when shown to charles edward stuart by captain barre would induce the young prince to trust himself and his friends unconditionally to le monarque lord eglintons signet ring had been spoken of for this object the day of the young pretenders departure but now of course she could not ask milor for it on the other hand she felt quite sure that a written word from her would answer the necessary purpose a brief note sealed with the eglinton arms  the thought of the seal as an additional message of good faith first occurred to her when she once more reached the west wing of the palace  from the great square landing where she now stood a monumental door on her right gave on her own suite of apartments on the left was the long enfilade of reception rooms with the vast audience chamber and milors own withdrawing room beyond  she deliberately turned to the left and once more traversed the vast and gorgeous halls where half an hour ago she had suffered such keen humiliation and such overwhelming disappointment she forced herself not to dwell on that scene again and even closed her eyes with a vague fear that the mental vision might become materialized  beyond the audience chamber there were two or three more reception rooms and from the last of these a door masked by a heavy portière gave on milors study all these apartments were now deserted save for a few flunkeys who stood about desultorily in the window embrasures from one of them lydie asked if m le contrôleur des finances was within but no one remembered having seen milor since the petit lever and it was generally thought that he had gone to trianon lydie hesitated a moment before she opened the door she scarcely ever entered this portion of the palace and had never once been in milors private rooms but she wanted that seal with the eglinton arms and would not admit even to herself that her husbands presence or absence interested her in the least  but on the threshold she paused milor was sitting at a gigantic escritoire placed squarely in front of the window he had obviously been writing at the slight sound of the creaking door and the swish of lydies skirts he raised his head from his work and turned to look at her  immediately he rose  your pardon for this intrusion milor she said coldly your lacqueys gave me to understand that you were from home  is there anything that you desire  only a seal with the eglinton arms she replied quite casually i have need of it for a private communication  he sought for the seal among the many costly objects which littered his table and handed it to her  i am sorry that you should have troubled to come so far for it he said coldly one of my men would have taken it to your study  and i am sorry that i should have disturbed you she rejoined i was told that you had gone to trianon  i shall be on my way thither in a few moments to place my resignation in the hands of his majesty  your resignation  as i have had the honour to tell you  then you will leave versailles  to make way for my successor as soon as his majesty hath appointed one  and you go    whither she asked  oh what matter he replied carelessly so long as i no longer trouble your ladyship with my presence  then you will have no objection if i return to my father until your future plans are more mature  objection he said with a pleasant little laugh nay madame you are pleased to joke  she felt a little bewildered this unexpected move on his part had somehow thrown all her plans out of gear for the moment she scarcely had time to conjecture even vaguely what her own future actions would be if her husband no longer chose to hold an important position in the ministry the thought that his resignation would of necessity mean her own suddenly rushed into her mind with overwhelming violence but she was too confused at present to disentangle herself from the maze of conflicting emotions which assailed her when first she realized the unexpected possibility  she was toying with the seal forgetful somehow of the purpose and the plans which it represented these not being in jeopardy through milors extraordinary conduct she could afford to dismiss them from her mind  it was the idea of her husbands resignation and her own future which troubled her and strangely enough there was such an air of finality about his attitude that for the moment she was somewhat at a loss how to choose a line of argument with which to influence him that she could make him alter his decision she never doubted for a moment but since the first day of their married life he had never taken any initiative in an important matter and his doing so at this moment found her at first wholly unprepared  am i to understand that my wishes in so vital a decision are not to be consulted in any way she asked after a momentary pause  you will honour me madame by making me acquainted with them he replied  you must reconsider your resignation she said decisively  that is not possible  i have much important business of the nation in hand which i could not hand over to your successor in an incomplete state she said haughtily  there is no necessity for that madame nor for depriving the nation of your able guiding hand the post of comptroller of finance need not be filled immediately it can remain in abeyance and under your own matchless control at the pleasure of his majesty and m le duc daumont neither of whom will i am sure desire to make a change in an administration which is entirely for the benefit of france  she looked at him very keenly through narrowed lids scanning his face and trying to read his intent but there was obviously no look of sarcasm in his eyes nor the hint of a sneer in the even placidity of his voice once more that unaccountable feeling of irritation seemed to overmaster her the same sense of wrath and of injustice which had assailed her when she first spoke to him  but this is senseless milor she said impatiently you seem to forget that i am your wife and that i have a right to your protection and to a fitting home if i am to leave versailles  i am not forgetting that you are my wife madame but my protection is worth so little scarcely worthy of your consideration as for the rest my château of vincennes is entirely at your disposal a retinue of servants is there awaiting your orders and my notary will this day prepare the deed which i have commanded wherein i humbly ask you to accept the château its lands and revenues as a gift from me albeit these are wholly unworthy of your condescension  it is monstrous milor and ill not accept it she retorted think you perchance i am so ready to play the rôle of a forsaken wife  a strange thought had been gradually creeping into her mind a weird kind of calculation whereby she put certain events in juxtaposition to one another the departure of gaston de stainville for he had told her that he was prepared to go to scotland whether she helped him in his expedition or not then irène would be temporarily free almost a widow since gastons return under those circumstances would have been more than problematical and now milor calmly expressing the determination to quit versailles and to give away his château and lands of vincennes forsooth as a sop to the forsaken wife whilst madame de stainvilles provocative attitude this morning more than bore out this conclusion  lydie felt as if every drop of blood in her body rushed up violently to her cheeks which suddenly blazed with anger whilst his at her suggestion had become a shade more pale  i am free to suppose milor that madame de stainville has something to do with your sudden decision she said haughtily therefore believe me i have no longer a wish to combat it as the welfare of france the work which i have in hand interests you so little i will not trouble you by referring to such matters again by all means place your resignation in his majestys hands i understand that you desire to be free i only hope that you will assist me in not washing too much of our matrimonial linen in public i have many enemies and i must refuse to allow your whims and fantasies to annihilate the fruits of my past labours for the good of my country i will confer with monsieur le duc my father you will hear my final decision from him  she turned once more toward the door he had not spoken one word in interruption as with a harsh and trenchant voice she thus hurled insult upon insult at him she only saw that he looked very pale although his face seemed to her singularly expressionless whilst she herself was conscious of such unendurable agony that she feared she must betray it in the quiver of her mouth and the tears which threatened to come to her eyes  when she ceased speaking he bowed quite stiffly but made no sign of wishing to defend himself she left the room very hurriedly in another second and she would have broken down sobs were choking her an intolerable anguish wrung her heartstrings to that extent that if she had had the power she would have wounded him physically as she hoped that she had done now mentally oh if she had had the strength if those sobs that would not be denied had not risen so persistently in her throat she would have found words of such deadly outrage as would at least have stung him and made him suffer as she was suffering now  there are certain pains of the heart that are so agonizing that only cruelty will assuage them lydies strong passionate nature perpetually held in check by the force of her great ambition and by her will to be masculine and firm in the great purpose of her life had for once broken through the trammels which her masterful mind had fashioned round it it ran riot now in her entire being she was conscious of overwhelming of indomitable hate  with burning eyes and trembling lips she hurried through the rooms and along the interminable corridors the flunkeys stared at her as she passed she looked so different to her usual composed and haughty self her cheeks were flaming her bosom heaving beneath the primlyfolded kerchief and at intervals a curious moanlike sound escaped her lips  thus she reached her own study a small square room at the extreme end of the west wing two of its walls formed an angle of the structure with great casement windows which gave on that secluded spinney with its peaceful glade which she loved  as soon as she entered the room her eyes fell on that distant beech plantation a great sigh rose from her oppressed heart for suddenly she had remembered her great purpose the one project which was infinitely dear to her  the graceful beech trees far away with their undergrowth of bracken and foxgloves gleaming in the sun recalled to her that gaston was waiting in their midst for her message to le monarque  thank god this great joy at least was not denied her she still had the power and the will to accomplish this allpervading object of her life the rescue of the stuart prince from the hands of his enemies and from the perfidy of his whilom friends  this thought the recollection of her talk with gaston the work which still remained for her to do eased the tension of her nerves and stilled the agonizing pain of her heart  with a tremendous effort of will she chased away from her mental vision the picture of that pale expressionless face which seemed to haunt her she forced herself to forget the humiliation the injustice the affront which she had suffered today and not to hear the persistent echo of the deadly insults which she had uttered in response  her study was cool and dark heavy curtains of softtoned lavender fell beside the windows partially shutting out the glare of the midday sun her secretaire stood in the centre of the room she sat down near it and unlocked a secret drawer for the next quarter of an hour her pen flew across two sheets of paper she had in front of her a map of a certain portion of the west coast of scotland with directions and other sundry notes carefully written in the margins and she was writing out the orders for the commander of le monarque to reach that portion of the coast as quickly as possible to seek out prince charles stuart who would probably be on the lookout for a french vessel and having got him and as many friends of his as accompanied him safely aboard to skirt the west coast of ireland and subsequently to reach morlaix in brittany where the prince would disembark  there was nothing flustered or undetermined about her actions she never paused a moment to collect her thoughts for obedient to her will they were already arrayed in perfect order in her mind she had only to transfer them to paper  having written out the orders for captain barre she carefully folded them together with the map and fastened and sealed them with the official seal of the ministry of finance then she took one more sheet of paper and wrote in a bold clear hand        the bearer of this letter is sent to meet you by your       true and faithful friends you may trust yourself and       those you care for unconditionally to him  to this note she affixed a seal stamped with the eglinton arms and across the words themselves she wrote the name eglinton  there was no reason to fear for a moment that the stuart prince would have any misgivings when he received this message of comfort and of hope  then with all the papers safely tied together and hidden in the folds of her corselet she once more found her way down the great staircase and terraces and into the beech wood where m de stainville awaited her     chapter xx  a farewell   gaston de stainville had been sitting idly on the garden seat vaguely wondering why lydie was so long absent ignorant of course of the acute crisis through which she had just passed for the last quarter of an hour of this weary waiting anxiety began to assail him  women were so fickle and so capricious which remark inwardly muttered came with singular inappropriateness from gaston de stainville his keen judgment however fought his apprehensions he knew quite well that lydie was unlike other women at once stronger and weaker than those of her own sex more firm in her purpose less bendable in her obstinacy and he knew also that nothing could occur within the gorgeous walls of that palace to cause her to change her mind  but as the moments sped on his anxiety grew apace he no longer could sit still and began walking feverishly up and down the little glade like an animal caged within limits too narrow for its activity he dared not wander out of the wood lest she should return and not finding him there think at once of doubting  thus when she once more appeared before him he was not so calm as he would have wished nor yet so keen in noting the subtle indefinable change which had come over her entire personality desirous of masking his agitation he knelt when she approached and thus took the packet from her hand  the action struck her as theatrical her mind being filled with another picture that of a man motionless and erect with pale expressionless face which yet had meant so much more of reality to her  and because of this theatricality in gastons attitude she lost something of the fullness of joy of this supreme moment she ought to have been happier more radiant with hope for the future and with gratitude to him she tried to say something enthusiastic something more in keeping with the romance of this sudden and swift departure the prospective ride to le havre the spirit of selfsacrifice and courage which caused him to undertake this task so different to his usual avocation of ease and luxury  i pray you gaston she said guard the packet safely and use your best endeavours to reach le havre ere the night hath yielded to a new dawn  she could not say more just now feeling that if she added words of encouragement or of praise they would not ring true and would seem as artificial as his posture at her feet  i will guard the packet with my life he said earnestly and if perchance you wake tonight from dreams of the unfortunate prince whom your devotion will save from death send one thought wandering far away across the rich fields of normandy for they will be behind me by that time and i will sight the port of le havre long before its church spires are tipped with gold  god speed you then she rejoined ill not detain you  she chided herself for her coldness noting that gaston on the other hand seemed aglow now with excitement as he unbuttoned his coat and slipped the papers into an inner pocket then he sprang to his feet and seemed ready to go  just at the moment of actual parting when he asked for her hand to kiss and she giving it to him felt his lips trembling on her fingers some measure of his excitement communicated itself to her and she repeated more warmly  god speed you gaston and farewell  god bless you lydie for this trust which you have deigned to place in me two days hence at even i shall have returned where shall i see you then  in my study ask for an audience i will see that it is granted  the next moment he had gone she saw the rich purple of his coat gradually vanish behind the tall bracken even then she had no misgivings she thought that she had done right and that she had taken the only course by which she could ensure the safety of the stuart prince to whom france whom she guided through the tortuous paths of diplomacy and for whose honour she felt herself to be primarily responsible had pledged her word and her faith     chapter xxi  royal thanks   in one of the smaller rooms of the palace of trianon his majesty king louis xv received m le comte de stainville in private audience madame la marquise de pompadour was present she sat in an armchair close beside the one occupied by his majesty her dainty feet resting on a footstool her hand given up to her royal patron so that he might occasionally imprint a kiss upon it  gaston de stainville sat on a tabouret at a respectful distance he had in his hand a letter with a seal attached to it and a map which had a number of notes scribbled in the margin his majesty seemed in a superlatively good humour and sat back in his chair his fat body shaking now and again with bursts of merriment  eh eh this gallant count he said jovially par ma foi to think that the minx deceived us and our court all these years with her prim ways and prudish manner even her majesty the queen looks upon madame lydie as a pattern of all the virtues  he leaned forward and beckoned to gaston to draw his chair nearer  voyons m le comte continued louis with a humorous leer there is no need for quite so much discretion we are all friends together    eh tell us how you did it  gaston de stainville did draw his chair nearer to his majesty such a proffered honour was not to be ignored his face wore an air of provocative discretion and a fatuous smile curled his sensual lips  nay he said unctuously your majesty who is galant homme par excellence will deign to grant me leave to keep inviolate the secret of how i succeeded in breaking through the barrier of prudery set up by the most unapproachable woman in france enough that i did succeed and that i have been made thrice happy by being allowed to place the result with mine own hands at the feet of the most adored of her sex  and with an elegant and graceful flourish of the arm he rose from his tabouret and immediately dropped on one knee at madames feet offering her the letter and the map which he held she took them from him regarding him with a smile which fortunately the amorous but highly jealous monarch failed to see he had just taken the papers from pompadour and was gloating over their contents  you had best see m le duc daumont at once said his majesty with a quick return to gravity as soon as gaston de stainville had once more resumed his seat go back to the palace now monsieur le comte madame will allow you to take her chair and then by using our own private entrance on the south side you will avoid being seen from the west wing needless to say i hope that discretion and wariness must be your watchword until the affair is brought to a successful conclusion  gaston de stainville bent himself nearly double and placed one hand there where his heart was supposed to be all in token that he would be obedient to the letter and the spirit of every royal command  we do not think said louis with somewhat forced carelessness that our subjects need know anything about this transaction  certainly not sire rejoined de stainville most emphatically whilst madame too nodded very decisively  most people have strange ideas about politics and diplomacy continued the king just as if those complicated arts could be conducted on lines of antiquated mediæval codes therefore the whole business must be kept between our three selves now present m le comte and of course m le duc daumont who has helped us throughout and without whom we could not now proceed  i quite understand sire assented gaston  we are of course presuming that your happy influence over madame lydie will not cease with her giving you those papers said louis with another of his unpleasant leers  i think not your majesty  she will hold her tongue i should imagine    for very obvious reasons said madame with a malicious sneer  anyhow you had best make our recommendations known to monsieur le duc daumont tell him that we suggest not relying on le monarque even though she be ready to put to sea as her commander may be for aught we know a secret adherent of the stuart we should not care to trust him since the eglintons seem to have been already to do so a delay of five or six days while le levantin is being commissioned is better than the taking of any risk though we are doing nothing that we are ashamed of added louis the wellbeloved airily we have no wish that the matter be bruited abroad lest we be misunderstood  we must suppose that monsieur le comte de stainville had been denied at his birth the saving gift of a sense of humour for in reply to this long tirade from the king he said quite seriously and emphatically  your majesty need not be under the slightest apprehension neither m le duc daumont i feel sure nor i myself will in any way endanger the absolute secrecy of the transaction lest we be misunderstood as for madame lydie    he paused a moment whilst carefully examining his welltrimmed nails a smile wherein evil intent now fought with fatuity played round the corners of his lips madame lydie will also hold her tongue he concluded quietly  that is well assented the king m le duc daumont will see to the rest in five or six days le levantin should be ready her secret orders have been drafted and already bear our royal signature now with this map and directions and the private note for the stuart all so kindly furnished by madame lydie the expedition should be easy and above all quite swift the sooner the affair is concluded and the money paid over the less likelihood there is of our subjects getting wind thereof we must stipulate m le comte since you are the youngest partner in this undertaking and the least prominent in the public eye that you take the secret orders yourself to le levantin we should not feel safe if they were in any one elses hands  i thank your majesty for this trust  for this special task and for your work this afternoon you shall be rewarded with two out of the fifteen millions promised by his grace of cumberland m le duc daumont will receive three whilst we shall have the honour and pleasure of laying the remainder at the feet of madame la marquise de pompadour  he cast an amorous glance at madame who promptly rewarded him with a gracious smile  i think that is all which we need say for the present m le comte concluded his majesty within six days from now you should be on your way to brest where le levantin should by then be waiting her orders and ready to put to sea a month later if wind weather and circumstances favour us that young adventurer will have been handed over to the english authorities and we who had worked out the difficult diplomatic problems so carefully will have shared between us the english millions  with his habitual airy gesture louis now intimated that the audience was at an end he was obviously more highly elated than he cared to show before gaston and was longing to talk over plans and projects for future pleasures and extravagances with the fair marquise madame who had the knack of conveying a great deal by a look succeeded in intimating to gaston that she would gladly have availed herself a little longer of his pleasant company but that royal commands must prevail  gaston therefore rose and kissed each hand as it was graciously extended to him  we are pleased with what you have done monsieur le comte said the king as m de stainville finally took his leave but tell me he whispered slily did the unapproachable lydie yield with the first kiss or did she struggle much    eh    brr    my dear comte are your lips not frozen by contact with such an icicle  nay your majesty all icicles are bound to melt sooner or later said gaston de stainville with a smile whichhad lydie seen itwould have half killed her with shame  and with that same smile of fatuity still lurking round his lips he bowed himself out of the room     chapter xxii  paternal anxiety   m le duc daumont prime minister of his majesty king louis xv of france was exceedingly perturbed he had just had two separate interviews each of half an hours duration and he was now busy trying to dissociate what his daughter had told him in the first interview from that which m de stainville had imparted to him in the second and he was not succeeding  the two sets of statements seemed inextricably linked together  lydie certainly had been very strange and agitated in her manner totally unlike herself but this mood of course though so very unusual in her did not astonish m le duc so much once he realized its cause  it was the cause which was so singularly upsetting  milor eglinton his soninlaw had sent in his resignation as comptrollergeneral of finance and this without giving any reason for so sudden and decisive a step at any rate lydie herself professed to be ignorant of milors motives for this extraordinary line of action as she was of his future purpose all she knewor all that she cared to tell her fatherwas that her husband had avowedly the intention of deserting her he meant to quit versailles immediately thus vacating his post without a moments notice and leaving his wife whom he had allowed to conduct all state affairs for him for over a year to extricate herself out of a tangle of work and an anomalous position as best she might  the only suggestion which milor had cared to put forward with regard to her future was that he was about to make her a free gift of his château and lands of vincennes the yearly revenues of which were close upon a million livres this gift she desired not to accept  in spite of strenuous and diplomatic efforts on his part m le duc daumont had been unable to obtain any further explanation of these extraordinary events from his daughter lydie had no intention whatever of deceiving her father and she had given him what she believed to be a perfectly faithful exposé of the situation all that she had kept back from him was the immediate cause of the grave misunderstanding between herself and her husband and we must do her the justice to state that she did not think that this was relevant to the ultimate issue  moreover she was more than loath to mention the stuart prince and his affairs again before m le duc she knew that he was not in sympathy with her over this matter and she dreaded to know with absolute certainty that there was projected treachery afoot and that he perhaps would have a hand in it what gaston de stainville had conjectured had seen and overheard what she herself had guessed was not to her mind quite conclusive as far as her fathers share in the scheme was concerned  she was deeply attached to her father and her heart found readily enough a sufficiency of arguments which exonerated him from actual participation in such wanton perfidy at any rate in this instance she chose ignorance rather than heartrending certainty and as by her quick action and gastons timely and unexpected help the actual treachery would be averted she preferred to dismiss her fathers problematical participation in it entirely from her mind  thus she told him nothing of milors attitude with regard to the duke of cumberlands letter in fact she never once referred to the letter or to the young pretender she merely gave m le duc to understand that her husband seemed desirous of living his future life altogether apart from hers  m le duc daumont was sorely disquieted two eventualities presented themselves before him and both were equally distasteful one was the scandal which would of necessity spread around his daughters name the moment her matrimonial differences with her husband became generally known m le duc daumont was too well acquainted with this court of versailles not to realize that lydies position as a neglected wife would subject her to a series of systematic attentions which she could but regard in the light of insults  on the other hand m le duc could not even begin to think of having to forego his daughters help in the various matters relating to his own administration he had been accustomed for some years now to consult her in all moments of grave crises to rely on her judgment on her able guidance worth ten thousand times more to him than an army of masculine advisers  in spite of the repeated sneers hurled at this era of petticoat government lydie had been of immense service to him and if she were suddenly to be withdrawn from his official life he would feel very like louis xiii had done on that memorable journée des dupes when richelieu left him for twentyfour hours to conduct the affairs of state alone he would not have known where to begin  but lydie told him that her decision was irrevocable or what was more to the point milor had left her no alternative his resignation was by now in his majestys hands and he had not even suggested that lydie should accompany him when he quitted versailles in order to take up life as a private gentleman  it was all very puzzling and very difficult m le duc daumont strongly deprecated the idea of his daughter vacating her official post because of this sudden caprice of milor he had need of her and so had france and the threads of national business could not be snapped in a moment the post of comptrollergeneral of finance could remain in abeyance for awhile after that one would see  then with regard to the proposed gifts of the château and revenues of vincennes m le duc daumont would not hear of a refusal madame la marquise deglinton must have a private establishment worthy of her rank and an occasional visit from milor would help to keep up an outward appearance of decorum and to throw dust in the eyes of the scandalmongers  the interview with his daughter had upset m le duc daumont very considerably the whole thing had been so unexpected it was difficult to imagine his usually so impassive and yielding soninlaw displaying any initiative of his own m le duc was still puzzling over the situation when m le comte de stainville specially recommended by his majesty himself asked for a private audience  and the next halfhour plunged m le duc into a perfect labyrinth of surmises conjectures doubts and fears that gaston de stainville was possessed not only of full knowledge with regard to the stuart princes hidingplace but also of a letter in lydies handwriting addressed to the prince and sealed with her private seal was sufficiently astonishing in itself but the young mans thinly veiled innuendoes his fatuous smiles his obvious triumph literally staggered m le duc even though his palm itched with longing for contact with the insolent braggarts cheek every one of his beliefs was being forcibly uprooted his daughter whom he had thought so unapproachable so pure and so loyal who had this very morning shamed him by her indignation at the very thought of this treachery which she now so completely condoned that she should have renounced her opinions her enthusiasm for the sake of a man who had already betrayed her once was more than m le duc could and would believe at first  yet the proofs were before him at this very moment they had been placed in his hand by gaston de stainville the map with the marginal notes which lydie had so often refused to show even to her own father and the letter in her handwriting with the bold signature right across the contents bidding the unfortunate young prince trust the traitor who would deliver him into the hands of his foes  but m le duc would have had to be more than human not to be satisfied in a measure at the result of gaston de stainvilles diplomacy he stood in for a goodly share of the millions promised by england but it was the diplomacy itself which horrified him he had vainly tried to dissuade lydie from chivalrous and misguided efforts on behalf of the young prince or at any rate from active interference if his majesty had plans other than her own but whilst she had rejected his merest suggestions on that subject with unutterable contempt she had not only listened to gaston de stainville but actually yielded her will and her enthusiasms to his pleadings  m le duc sighed when he thought it all out though lydie had done exactly what he himself wanted her to do he hated the idea that she should have done it because gaston de stainville had persuaded her  later on in the afternoon when an excellently cooked dinner had softened his mood he tried to put together the various pieces of the mental puzzle which confronted him  gaston de stainville had obtained a certain ascendancy over lydie and lydie had irretrievably quarrelled with her husband milor was determined to quit versailles immediately lydie was equally bent on not relinquishing her position yet gaston de stainville was obviously triumphant and somewhat openly bragged of his success whilst milor kept to his own private apartments and steadily forbade his door to every one  it was indeed a very difficult problem for an indulgent father to solve fortunately for his own peace of mind m le duc daumont was not only indulgent to his own daughter whom he adored but also to every one of her sex he was above all a preux chevalier who held that women were beings of exceptional temperament not to be judged by the same standards as the coarser fibred male creatures their beauty their charm the pleasure they afforded to the rest of mankind placed them above criticism or even comment  and of course lydie was very beautiful    and milor a fool    and    gaston    well who could blame gaston  and it was most amazingly lucky that lydie had given up her absurd ideas about that stuart prince and had thus helped those english millions to find their way comfortably across the channel into the pockets of his majesty the king of france and of one or two others including her own doting father  and after that m le duc daumont gave up worrying any more about the matter     chapter xxiii  the queens soirÉe   what chronicler of true events will ever attempt to explain exactly how rumour succeeds in breaking through every bond with which privacy would desire to fetter her and having obtained a perch on the swiftest of all currents of air travels through infinite space and anon observing a glaringly public spot wherein to alight she descends with amazing rapidity and mingles with the crowd  thus with the news anent milor eglintons resignation of the general control of finance  by the time the court assembled that evening for the queens reception every one had heard of it and also that milor having had a violent quarrel with his wife had quitted or was about to quit versailles without further warning  the news was indeed exceedingly welcome not from any illwill toward lord eglinton of course who was very popular with the ladies and more than tolerated by the men nor from any sense of triumph over madame lydie although she had not quite so many friends as milor but because it happened to be thursday and every thursday her majesty the queen held her court from seven oclock till nine oclock which function was so deadly dull that there was quite an epidemic of dislocated jawscaused by incessant yawningamong the favoured few who were both privileged and obliged to attend a piece of real gossip wellauthenticated and referring to a couple so highly placed as lord and lady eglinton was therefore a great boon even her majesty could not fail to be interested as lydie had always stood very highly in the good graces of the prim and melancholy queen whilst milor was one of that very small and very select circle which the exalted lady honoured with her conversation on public occasions  now on this same thursday evening queen marie leszcynska entered her throneroom precisely at seven oclock madame lydie was with her as she entered and it was at once supposed that her majesty was already acquainted with lord eglintons decision for she conversed with the neglected wife with obvious kindliness and sympathy  his majesty was expected in about a quarter of an hour as madame de pompadour and her immediate entourage were excluded from these solemn functions the king showed his disapproval of the absence of his friends by arriving as late as etiquette allowed and by looking on at the presentations and other paraphernalia of his wifes receptions in morose and silent ennui  this evening however the proceedings were distinctly enlivened by that subtle and cheerful breath of scandal which hovered all over the room whilst noble dowagers presented débutante daughters to her majesty and grave gentlemen explained to fledgling sons how to make a first bow to the king groups of younger people congregated in distant corners well away from the royal dais and discussed the great news of the day  lydie did not mingle with these groups in addition to her many other dignities and functions she was grande maréchale de la cour to queen marie leszcynska and on these solemn thursday evenings her place was beside her majesty and her duty to present such ladies of high rank who had either just arrived at court from the country or who for some other reason had not yet had the honour of a personal audience  chief among these reasons was the queens own exclusiveness the proud daughter of stanislaus of poland with her semireligious education her narrow outlook on life her unfortunate experience of matrimony had a wholesome horror of the frisky matrons and flirtatious minxes whom louis xivs taste had brought into vogue at the court of france and above all she had an unconquerable aversion for the various scions of that mushroom nobility dragged from out the gutter by the catholic fancies of le roi soleil  though she could not help but receive some of these people at the monster court functions which the elaborate and rigid etiquette of the time imposed upon her and whereat all the tatterdemalions that had eer filched a handle for their name had by that same unwritten dictum the right of entry she always proudly refused subsequently to recognize in private a presentation to herself unless it was made by her special leave at one of her own intimate audiences and through the mediation either of her own grande maréchale de la cour or of one of her privileged lady friends  thus madame la comtesse de stainville though formally presented at the general court by virtue of her husbands title and position had never had the honour of an invitation to her majestys private throneroom queen marie had heard vague rumours anent the early reputation of la belle brune de bordeaux this very nickname freely bandied about grated on her puritanic ear irène de stainville chafing under the restrictions which placed her on a level with the pompadours of the present and the montespans or la vallières of the past had more than once striven to enlist lydies help and protection in obtaining one of the coveted personal introductions to her majesty  lydie however had always put her off with polite but ambiguous promises until today when her heart overfilled with gratitude for gaston de stainville prompted her to do something which she knew must please him and thus prove to him that she was thinking of him at the very time when he was risking his entire future and probably his life in an attempt to serve her  her own troubles and sorrows in no way interfered with the discharge of her social duties whilst she still occupied certain official positions at court she was determined to fill them adequately and with perfect dignity a brief note to irène de stainville acquainted the latter lady with the pleasing fact that madame la grande maréchale would have much pleasure in introducing her personally to her majesty the queen that very same evening and la belle brune de bordeaux was therefore present at this most exclusive of all functions on thursday august 13 1746 and duly awaited the happy moment when she could make her curtsey before the proudest princess in all europe in the magnificent gown which had been prepared some time ago in view of this possible and delightful eventuality  she stood somewhat isolated from the rest of the throng between two or three of her most faithful admirers holding herself aloof from the frivolity of the surrounding gossip and wearing a sphinxlike air of detachment and of hidden and sorrowful knowledge  to every comment as to the nonappearance of her lord at the soirée she had mutely replied by a slight shrug of the shoulders  up in the gallery behind a screen of exotic plants the band of musicians was playing one of m lullis most famous compositions the beautiful motet in e flat which alone amongst the works of that master of melody was sufficiently serious and sedate for the queens taste anon her majesty gave the signal that dancing might begin she liked to watch it if it was decorously performed though she never joined in it herself therefore a measured and stately gavotte was danced by the young people every thursday and perhaps a majestic pavane afterward but the minuet was thought unbecoming her majesty sat in one of the heavy gilded chairs underneath the canopy the other being reserved for king louis  lydie watched the gavotte with dreamy abstracted eyes every now and then the queen spoke to her and the force of habit caused her to reply coherently and with that formality of expression which her majesty liked to hear but her mind was very far from her surroundings it was accompanying gaston de stainville on his reckless ride through the rich plains of normandy her wishes sped him on his way her gratitude for his noble selfsacrifice would have guarded him from the perils of the road  the monotonous tune of the gavotte with its distinct and sharply defined beat sounded to her like the measured clink of a horses hoofs on rough hard ground she was quite unconscious that from every corner of the room inquisitive and sarcastic eyes were watching all her movements     chapter xxiv  gossip   whilst the younger people danced the older ones gossiped and the absence of any known facts rendered the gossip doubly interesting  there was one group most especially so engaged at the further corner of the room and with sixteen dancing pairs intervening between it and the royal daïs there was little fear of her majesty overhearing any frivolous comments on the allabsorbing topic of the day or of madame lydie herself being made aware of their existence  here madame de la beaume a young and pretty matron possessed of a goodlooking husband who did not trouble her much with his company was the centre of a gaily cackling little crowd not unlike an assemblage of geese beside a stream at eventide young m de louvois was there and the old duchesse de pontchartrain also m crébillon the most inveterate scandalmonger of his time and several others  they all talked in whispers glad that the music drowned every echo of this most enjoyable conversation  i have it from my coiffeur whose son was on duty in an adjacent room that there was a violent quarrel between them said madame de la beaume with becoming mystery the man says that madame lydie screamed and raged for half an hour then flew out of the room and along the passages like one possessed  these english are very peculiar people said m crébillon sententiously i have it on m de voltaires own authority that english husbands always beat their wives and he spent some considerable time in england recently studying their manners and customs  we may take it for granted that milor eglinton though partly civilized through his french parentage hath retained some of his native brutality added another cavalier gravely  and it is quite natural that madame lydie would not tolerate his treatment of her concluded the old duchess  ah sighed madame de la beaume pathetically i believe that english husbands beat their wives only out of jealousy at least so i have been told whereas ours are too often unfaithful to feel any such violent and uncomfortable pangs  surely quoth young m de louvois casting an admiring glance at madames bold décolletage you would not wish m de la beaume to lay hands on those beautiful shoulders  heu heu nodded madame enigmatically  m crébillon cast an inquisitorial look at madame de stainville who was standing close by  nay from what i hear he said mysteriously milor eglinton had quite sufficient provocation for his jealousy and like an englishman he availed himself of the privileges which the customs of his own country grant him and he frankly beat his wife  every one rallied round him for he seemed to have fuller details than any one else and madame de la beaume whispered eagerly  you mean m de stainville     hushshsh interrupted the old duchess quickly here comes miladi  the dowager marchioness of eglinton miladi as she was always called was far too shrewd and too well versed in the manners and customs of her friends not to be fully aware of the gossip that was going on all round the room very irate at having been kept in ignorance of the facts which had caused her sons sudden decision and lydies strange attitude she was nevertheless determined that whatever scandal was being bruited abroad it should prove primarily to the detriment of her daughterinlaws reputation  therefore whenever tonight she noted groups congregated in corners and conversations being obviously carried on in whispers she boldly approached and joined in the gossip depositing a poisoned shaft here and there with great cleverness all the more easily as it was generally supposed that she knew a great deal more than she cared to say  nay i beg of you mesdames and messieurs she now said quite cheerfully do not let me interrupt your conversation alas do i not know its subject    my poor son cannot be to blame in the unfortunate affair lydie though she may be wholly innocent in the matter is singularly obstinate  then you really think that queried madame de la beaume eagerly and then paused half afraid that she had said too much  alas what can i say rejoined miladi with a sigh i was brought up in the days when we women were taught obedience to our husbands wishes  madame lydie was not like to have learnt the first phrase of that wholesome lesson quoth m de louvois with a smile  exactly cher monsieur assented miladi as she sailed majestically on to another group  what did miladi mean exactly asked m crébillon  oh she is so kindhearted such an angel sighed pretty madame de la beaume she wanted to palliate madame lydies conduct by suggesting that milor merely desired to forbid her future intercourse with m de stainville    i have heard that version of the quarrel already but i must own that it bears but little resemblance to truth we all know that so simple a request would not have led to a really serious breach between milor and his wife  it was more than that of course or milor would not have beaten her came in unanswerable logic from m crébillon  hushshsh admonished the old duchess here comes his majesty  he looks wonderfully goodhumoured said madame de la beaume and doth not wear at all his usual thursdays scowl  then we may all be sure mesdames and messieurs said the irrepressible crébillon that rumour hath not lied again  what rumour  you have not heard  no came from half a dozen eager and anxious lips  they say that his majesty the king of france has agreed to deliver the chevalier de saint george to the english in consideration of a large sum of money  impossible  that cannot be true  my valet had it from monsieur de stainvilles man protested m crébillon and he declares the rumour true  a king of france would never do such a thing  a palpable and clumsy lie  and the same people who five minutes ago had hurled the mud of scandal at the white robes of an exceptionally highminded and virtuous woman recoiled with horror at the thought of any of it clinging to the person of that fat and pompous man whom an evil fate had placed on the throne of france     chapter xxv  the first doubt   his majesty certainly looked far less bored than he usually did on his royal consorts reception evenings he entered the room with a goodnatured smile on his face which did not leave him even whilst he kissed the frigid queens hand and nodded to her entourage every one of whom he cordially detested  but when he caught sight of lydie he positively beamed at her and astonished all the scandalmongers by the surfeit of attentions which he bestowed on her directly after he had paid his respects to his wife and received the young scions of ancient aristocratic houses that were being presented to him he turned with great alacrity to lydie and engaged her in close conversation  will you honour us by stepping the pavane with us marquise he asked in sugary tones alas our dancing days should be over yet par ma foi we could yet tread another measure beside the tiniest feet in france  lydie would perhaps have been taken aback at the kings superlative amiability but instinctively her mind reverted to the many occasions when he had thus tried to win her good graces in the hope of obtaining concessions of money from the virtual chief of the department of finance she saw that inquisitive eyes were watching her overkeenly asunable to refuse the kings invitationshe placed a reluctant hand in his and took her position beside him for the opening of the pavane  she was essentially graceful even in the studied stiffness of her movements a stiffness which she had practised and then made entirely her own and which was somehow expressive of the unbendable hauteur of her moral character  the stately pavane suited the movements of her willowy figure which appeared quite untrammelled easy and full of spring even within the narrow confines of the fashionable corslet she was dressed in white tonight and her young shoulders looked dazzling and creamy beside the matt tone of her brocaded gown she never allowed the ridiculous coiffure which had lately become the mode to hide entirely the glory of her own chestnut hair and its rich warm colour gleamed through the powder scantily sprinkled over it by an artists hand  she had not forgotten even for a moment the serious events of this nevertobeforgotten day but amongst the many memories which crowded in upon her as with slow step she trod the grave measure of the dance none was more vivid than that of her husbands scorn when he spoke of her own hand resting in that of the treacherous and perfidious monarch who would have sold his friend for money she wondered how he would act if he could see her now her fingers very frequently meeting those of king louis during the elaborate figures of the dance  strangely enough although everything milor had said to her at that interview had merely jarred upon her mood and irritated her nerves without seemingly carrying any conviction yet now when she was obliged to touch so often the moist hot palm of king louis she felt something of that intolerable physical repugnance which her husband had as it were brought to actuality by the vigour of his suggestions  otherwise she took little heed of her surroundings during the preliminary movement of the dance the march past with its quaint artificial gestures and steps and the slow majesty of its music she could not help seeing the looks of malevolent curiosity of satisfied childish envy and of sarcastic triumph which were levelled at her from every corner of the room  the special distinction bestowed on her by the kingwho as a rule never danced at his wifes soiréesseemed in the minds of all these gossiplovers to have confirmed the worst rumours anent the cause of lord eglintons unexpected resignation his majesty did not suffer like his wife from an unconquerable horror of frisky matrons on the contrary his abhorrence was chiefly directed against the starchy dowagers and the prudish dévotes who formed the entourage of the queen the fact that he distinguished lydie tonight so openly showed that he no longer classed her among the latter  his majesty hath at last found a kindred spirit in the unapproachable marchioness was the universal comment which thoroughly satisfied the most virulent disseminator of illnatured scandal  lydie knew enough of court life to guess what would be said up to now she had been happily free from louiss compromising flatteries save at such times when he required money but his attentions went no furtherand they invariably ceased the moment he had obtained all that he wanted but tonight he was unswerving in his adulation and in the brief pause between the second and third movement of the dance he contrived to whisper in her ear  ah madame how you shame your king shall we ever be able to adequately express the full measure of our gratitude  gratitude sire she murmured somewhat bewildered and rather coldly i do not understand    why gratitude  you are modest madame as well as brave and good he rejoined taking one more opportunity of raising her hand to his lips he had succeeded in gradually leading her into a window embrasure somewhat away from the rest of the dancers he did not admire the statuesque grace of lydie in the least and had always secretly sneered at her for her masculine strength of will and the rigidity of her principles but it had been impossible for any man alive to a sense of what was beautiful not to delight in the exquisitely harmonious picture formed by that elegant woman in her stiff white brocaded gown and with her young head crowned by its wreath of ardent hair standing out brilliantly against the pale buttercup colour of the damask curtain behind her there was nothing forced therefore in the look of admiration with which the king now regarded lydie conscious of this she deeply resented the look and perhaps because of it she was not quite so fully alive to the hidden meaning of his words as she otherwise might have been  and as beautiful as you are brave added louis unctuously it is not every woman who would thus have had the courage of her convictions and so openly borne witness to the trust and loyalty which she felt  indeed sire she said coldly and suddenly beginning to feel vaguely puzzled i am afraid your majesty is labouring under the misapprehension that i have recently done something to deserve special royal thanks whereas  whereas you have only followed the dictates of your heart he rejoined gallantly seeing that she had paused as if in search of a word and shown to the sceptics in this illnatured court that beneath the rigid mask of iron determination this exquisitely beautiful personality hid the true instincts of adorable womanhood  the musicians now struck the opening chords to the third and final measure of the pavane there is something dreamy and almost sad in this movement of the stately dance and this melancholy is specially accentuated in the composition of rameau which the players were rendering with consummate art tonight the kings unctuous words were still ringing unpleasantly in lydies ears when he put out his hand claiming hers for the dance  mechanically she followed him her feet treading the measure quite independently of her mind which had gone wandering in the land of dreams a vague sense of uneasiness crept slowly but surely into her heart she pondered over louiss words not knowing what to make of them yet somehow beginning to fear them or rather to fear that she might after all succeed in understanding their full meaning she could not dismiss the certitude from her mind that he was in some hidden sense referring to the stuart prince and his cause when he spoke of convictions and of her courage but at first she only thought that he meant in a vague way to recall her interference of this morning lord eglintons outburst of contempt and her own promise to give the matter serious consideration  this in a measure reassured her the kings words had already become hazy in her memory as she had not paid serious attention to them at the time and she gradually forced those vague fears within her to subside and even smiled at her own cowardice in scenting danger where none existed  undoubtedly that was the true reason of the rapacious monarchs flatteries tonight truth to tell her mind had been so absorbed with actual events her quarrel with her husband the departure of gaston the proposed expedition of le monarque that she had almost forgotten the promise which she had made to the king earlier in the day with a view to gaining time  how admirably you dance madame said king louis the poetry of motion by all the saints ah believe me i cannot conquer altogether a feeling of unutterable envy  envy sire of whomor of what she asked forced to keep up a conversation which sickened her since etiquette did not allow her to remain silent if the king desired to talk methinks fate leaves your majesty but little to wish for  envy of the lucky man who obtained a certitude whilst we had to be content with vague if gracious promises he rejoined blandly  she looked at him keenly inquiringly a deep line of doubt even of fear now settling between her brows  certitude of what sire she asked suddenly pausing in the dance and turning to look him straight in the eyes i humbly crave your majestys pardon but meseems that we are at crosspurposes and that your majesty speaks of something which i on the other hand do not understand  nay nay then well not refer to the subject again rejoined louis with consummate gallantry for of a truth we would not wish to lose one precious moment of this heavenly dance enough that you understand madame that your king is grateful and will show his gratitude even though his heart burn with jealousy at the good fortune of another man  there was no mistaking the sly leer which appeared in his eye as he spoke lydie felt her cheeks flaming up with sudden wrath wrath which as quickly gave way to an awful an unconquerable horror  still she did not suspect her feet once more trod the monotonous measure but her heart beat wildly against the stiff corslet the room began to whirl round before her eyes a sickening sense of dizziness threatened to master her every drop of blood had left her cheeks leaving them ashen pale  she was afraid and the fear was all the more terrible as she could not yet give it a name but the sense of an awful catastrophe was upon her impending not yet materialized but which would overwhelm her inevitably when it came     chapter xxvi  the awful certitude   then all at once she understood  there at the further end of the room against the rich gold of the curtain she saw gaston de stainville standing beside his wife and one or two other women the centre of a gaily chattering crowd he himself chattering with them laughing and jesting whilst from time to time his white and slender hand raised a goldrimmed glass to his eye with a gesture of fatuity and affectation  something in her look though it had only lasted a few seconds must then and there have compelled his own for he suddenly dropped his glass and their eyes met across the room lydies inquiring only just beginning to doubt and fearful as if begging for reassurance his mocking and malicious triumphant too and selfflattering whilst la belle irène intercepting this exchange of glances laughed loudly and shrugged her bare shoulders  lydie was not that type of woman who faints or screams at moments of acute mental agony even now when the full horror of what she had so suddenly realized assailed her with a crushing blow that would have stunned a weaker nature she contrived to pull herself together and to continue the dance to the end the kingbeginning to feel bored in the company of this silent and obviously absentminded womanmade no further effort at conversation she had disappointed him for monsieur le comte de stainvilles innuendoes had led him to hope that the beautiful marble statue had at last come to life and would henceforth become a valuable addition to the lighthearted circle of friends that rallied round him helping to make him forget the ennui of his matrimonial and official life  thus the dance was concluded between them in silence louis was too dull and vapid to notice the change in his partners attitude the icy touch of her fingers the deathly whiteness of her lips but presently he too caught sight of gaston de stainville and immediately there crept into his face that malicious leer which awhile ago had kindled lydies wrath  whether she noted it now or not it were difficult to say only a great determination kept her from making a display before all these indifferent eyes of the agonizing torture of her mind and heart  with infinite relief she made her final curtsey to her partner and allowed him to lead her back to her official place beside the royal daïs she could not see clearly for her eyes had suddenly filled with burning tears of shame and bitter selfaccusation she bit her lips lest a cry of pain escaped them  you are ill my dear come away  the voicegentle and deeply concernedwas that of her father she did not dare look at him lest she should break down but she allowed him to lead her away from the immediate noise and glare  what is it lydie queried m le duc again more anxiously as soon as they had reached a small and secluded alcove has anything further happened par dieu if that man has again dared     what man father she interrupted  her voice had no tone in it she wondered even if m le duc would hear but he was talking ambiguously and she had had enough of misunderstandings today  what man rejoined monsieur le duc daumont irritably your husband of course i have heard rumours about his behaviour to you and by all the heathen gods     he paused astonished and almost awed for lydie had laughed suddenly laughed loudly and long and there was such a strange ring in that unnatural mirth that monsieur le duc feared lest excitement had been too much for his daughters brain  lydie what is it you must tell me    lydie    he urged listen to me    do you hear me lydie  she seemed to be collecting her scattered senses now but great sobs of hysterical laughter still shook her from head to foot and she leaned against her fathers arm almost as if she feared to fall  yes father dear she said fairly coherently i do hear you and i pray you take no heed of me much hath occurred today to disturb me and my nerves seem to be on the jar perhaps i do not see quite clearly either father tell me she added with a voice almost steady but harsh and trenchant and with glowing eyes fixed on the dukes face did i perceive gaston de stainville in the crowd just now  you may have done my dear he replied with some hesitation i do not know  she had been quick enough to note that at mention of gastons name his eyes suddenly wore a curious shamefaced expression and avoided meeting her own she pressed her point more carelessly feeling that there was something that he would only tell her if she was perfectly calm and natural in her questionings  then he is here she asked  yes    i believe so    why do you ask  i thought him gone she said lightly that was all methought there was an errand he had meant to perform  oh there is no immediate hurry for that  monsieur le duc damont never a very keen observer was feeling quite reassured by her calmer mood his daughter had been overwrought events had crowded in upon her thick and fast some of them of an unpleasant nature her final surrender to gaston de stainville could not have occurred without a wrench sentimenthe supposedhaving conquered friendship and loyalty no doubt remorse had held sway for awhile he certainly thought his daughter quite at one with him and his confederates in the treacherous plan it never entered his head for a moment to blame her for this volteface nor did he realize that gastons attitude had been one of lying infamy he knew her for a pureminded and exceptionally proud woman and his paternal heart had no fear that she would stoop to a vulgar intrigue at the same time he had no reason to doubt that she had yielded to the persuasive powers of a man whom she had certainly loved at one time who and of necessity would still exercise a certain influence over her  and now she was no doubt anxious to know something of future plans she had probably not heard what had been decided with regard to the expedition and perhaps fretted as to how her own actions had been interpreted by her father and the king it was with a view to reassuring her on all these points that he now added  we are not thinking of sending le monarque  ah i thought that she would have been the most likely vessel    le levantin will be safer he explained but she will not be ready to put to sea for five or six days so gaston will not start until then but you need have no fear dear the orders together with the map and the precious letter which you have given him are quite safe in his hands he is too deeply concerned in the success of the expedition to think of betraying you even if his regard were less genuine    and we are all deeply grateful to you my dear    it was all for the best    he patted her hand with kindly affection much relieved now for she seemed quite calm and the colour even was coming back to her cheeks all the afternoon he had been dreading this meeting with his daughter for he had not seen her since he learned from gaston that she had yielded to his entreaties and given him the map and letter which would help the king of france to betray his friend now he was glad to find thatsave for an unusual hysterical outburstshe took the whole matter as coolly as he did himself  there is no doubt that there are moments in life when a crisis is so acute a catastrophe so overwhelming that all our faculties become completely deadened our individuality goes out of us and we become mere dolls moving automatically by muscular action and quite independently of our brain  thus it was with lydie  her fathers words could not be misunderstood they left her without that last faint shadow of doubt which almost unbeknown to herself had been her main support during the past few minutes of this intense agony now the tiny vestige of hope had vanished blank despair invaded her brain and she had the sensation as if sorrow had turned it into a pulpy mass a great deal too bulky for her head causing it to throb and to ache intolerably beyond that the rest of herself as it were became quite mechanical she was glad that her father said nothing more about the scheme she knew all that she wanted to know gastons hideous horrible treachery the clumsy trap into which she had fallen and above all the hopeless peril into which she had plunged the very man whom she had wished to save  she had been the most perfidious traitor amongst them all for the unfortunate prince had given her his friendship and had trusted her more fully than he had others  and then there was her husband  of him she would not think for that way lay madness surely  she managed to smile to her father and to reassure him presently she would tell him all    tomorrow perhaps but not just yet    she did not hate him somehow she could not have hated him for she knew him and had always loved him but he was weak and easily misguided  heavens above had anyone been more culpably weak more misguided than she herself  monsieur le duc fully satisfied in his mind now by her outward calm and the steady brilliance of her eyes recalled her to her official duties  dancing is over lydie he said have you not a few presentations to her majesty to effect  oh yes she said perfectly naturally of a truth i had almost forgotten    the first time for many years eh my dear father   how some people will gossip at this remissness of madame la grande maréchale de la cour    will you conduct me straight away to her majesty    i hope she has not yet noticed my absence  she leaned somewhat heavily on her fathers arm for she was afraid that she could not otherwise have walked quite straight she fully realized what it meant when men talked of drunkenness amongst themselves copious libations must produceshe thoughtjust this same sensation of swaying and tottering and hideous painful giddiness  already monsieur de louvois her majestys chamberlain was waiting whilst the ladies who were to receive the honour of special presentation were arraigned in a semicircle to the left of the dais beneath the canopy the king and queen were standing louis looking as usual insufferably bored and the queen calmly dignified not a little disdainful and closely scrutinizing the bevy of womenmore or less gorgeously apparelled some old some young mostly rather dowdy and stiff in their appearancewho were waiting to be introduced  quickly and with a respectful curtsey indicative of apology lydie now took her stand beside her royal mistress and the ceremony of presentations began the chamberlain read out a name one unit thereupon detached itself from the feminine group approached with sedate steps to the foot of the throne and made a deep obeisance whilst madame la grande maréchale said a few appropriate words that were meant to individualize that unit in the mind of the queen  madame de balincourt your majesty will deign to remember the brave general who fought at fontenoy madame has eschewed country life momentarily for the honour of being presented to your majesty  enchantée madame the queen would reply graciously offering her hand for a respectful kiss  madame helvetius the wife of our renowned scientist and philosopher your majesty is acquainted with his works  enchantée madame  and mademoiselle helvetius striving to become as learned as her distinguished father and almost succeeding so tis said  the queen deigned to say a few special words to this shy débutante and to her mother both primly clad in badlyfitting gowns which proclaimed the country dressmaker but in their simplicity and gaucherie peculiarly pleasing to her majesty  and thus the procession filed past elderly women and young girls some twenty in all mostly hailing from distant parts of france where the noise and frivolity of the court of versailles had not even roused an echo the queen was very gracious she liked this select little circle of somewhat dowdy provincials who she felt would be quite at one with her in her desire for the regeneration of social france the uglier and less fashionable were the women the more drabby and illfitting their clothes the sweeter and more encouraging became her majestys smile she asked lengthy questions from her grande maréchale and seemed to take a malicious delight in irritating the king by protracting this ceremony which she knew bored him to distraction until he could scarcely manage to smother the yawns which continually assailed his jaws  suddenly lydie felt her limbs stiffen and her throat close as if iron fingers had gripped it she had been saying the usual platitudes anent the wife sister or aunt of some worthy general or country squire when monsieur de louvois called out a name  madame la comtesse de stainville  and from out the group of dowdy country matrons and starchylooking dévotes a brilliant figure now detached itself and glided forward with consummate grace irène de stainville was approaching for presentation to the queen her eyes becomingly cast down a rosy flush on her cheeks for she was conscious that she was beautiful and that the kings wearied eyes had lighted up at sight of her  there was something almost insolent in the gorgeousness of her gown it was of a rich turquoise blue that stood out glaring and vivid against the buttercupcoloured hangings of the room her stiff corslet was frankly décolleté displaying her fine shoulders and creamy bosom on which reposed a delicately wrought turquoise necklet of exquisite design her hair was piled up over her head in the monumental and outré style lately decreed by dame fashion and the brocade of her panniers stood out in stiff folds each side of her like balloonshaped supports on which her white arms rested with graceful ease it seemed as if a gaudy exotic butterfly had lost its way and accidentally fluttered into an assembly of moths  gaston de stainville stood a little behind his wife etiquette demanded that he should be near her when she made her obesiance to the queen he too somehow looked out of place among these more sedate cavaliers there had always been a very distinct difference between the dress worn by the ladies and gentlemen of the queens entourage and the more ornate style adopted by the gayer frequenters of the court of versailles this difference was specially noticeable now when this handsome young couple stood before her majesty she not unlike a glittering jewel herself he in a satin coat of pale mauve that recalled the delicate shades of a bank of candytuft in midjune  the queen no longer looked down from her daïs with an indulgent somewhat melancholy smile her eyescold and gray as those of king stanislaus had beenregarded with distinct disapproval these two people who in her rigid judgment were naught but gaudily deckedout dolls and who walked on highheeled shoes that made an unpleasant noise on the polished floor  lydie had during the last agonizing halfhour wholly forgotten irène de stainville and the presentation which on an impulse of gratitude toward gaston she had promised to bring about and she certainly had not been prepared for this meeting face to face with the man who for the second time in her life had so bitterly and cruelly wronged her  gaston did not seem anxious to avoid her gaze there was insolent triumph and mockery in every line of his attitude in the head thrown a little to one side in the eyes narrowed until they were slits gazing at her over the barrier of his wifes elaborate coiffure in the slender wellkept hand toying with the goldrimmed eyeglass and above all in the sensual sneering mouth and the full lips parted in a smile  lydie was hardly conscious of irènes presence of any one in fact save of gaston de stainville of whom she had dreamed so romantically a few hours ago speeding him on his way prayinggod help herthat he might be well and safe an intense bitterness surged up in her heart a deadly contempt for him awhile ago she would not have believed that she could hate anyone so she would at this moment have gladly bartered her life for the joy of doing him some awful injury all softness gentleness went out of her nature just while she looked at gaston and caught his mocking smile  it was the mockery that hurt her so the awful humiliation of it all  and there was also in lydie that highly sensitive sense of loyalty which revolted at the sight of these traitors approaching with a smile of complacency on their lips this proud queen who was ignorant of their infamy  women have often been called petty in their hates rightly perhaps but let us remember that their power to punish is limited and therefore they strike as best they can lydie in spite of her influence and her high position could do so little to punish gaston now that by his abominable treachery he had filched every trump card from her  she had been such an unpardonable fooland she knew itthat her very selfabasement whipped up her sense of retaliation her desire for some sort of revenge into veritable fury and thus when la belle irène triumphant in the pride of her universally acknowledged beauty came to the foot of the royal daïs whenthrough some unexplainable and occult reasona hush of expectancy descended on all spectators lydies voice was suddenly raised trenchant and decisive  this is an error on monsieur le chambellans part she said loudly so that everyone in the vast audiencechamber might hear there is no one here to present this lady to her majesty  a gasp went round the room a sigh of astonishment of horror of anticipation and in the silence that immediately followed the proverbial pin would have been heard to drop every rustle of a silken gown every creak of a shoe sounded clear and distinct as did the quicklysuppressed sneer that escaped gaston de stainvilles lips and the froufrou of his satin coat sleeve as he raised the goldrimmed glass to his eye  what were the joys of gossip in comparison with this unexpected sensation which moreover would certainly be the prelude to an amazing scandal anon everyone drew instinctively nearer all eyes were fixed on the several actors of this palpitating little scene  already irène had straightened her graceful figure with a quick jerk as if she had been struck the terrible affront must have taken her completely unawares but now that it had come she instantly guessed its cause nevertheless there was nothing daunted or bashful about her attitude the colour blazed into her cheeks and her fine dark eyes responded to lydies scornful glance with one of defiance and of hate  the queen looked visibly annoyed she disliked scenes and unpleasantness and all incidents which disturbed the even placidity of her official life the king on the other hand swore an unmistakable oath obviously he had already taken sides in favour of the gailyplumaged butterfly against the duller moths whilst monsieur de louvois looked hopelessly perturbed he was very young and had only lately been appointed to the onerous position of queens chamberlain though the post was no sinecure a scandal such as threatened now was quite unprecedented he scented a violent passage of arms between two young and beautiful women both of high social position and manlike he would sooner have faced a charge of artillery than this duel between two pairs of rosy lips wherein he feared that he might be called upon to arbitrate  lydie alone among all those present had retained her outward serenity this was her hour and she meant to press her triumph home to the full all the pentup horror and loathing which had wellnigh choked her during the whole of this terrible day now rose clamouring and persistent in this opportunity for revenge though gaston stood calm and mocking by though irène looked defiant and her cheeks flamed with wrath they would glow with shame anon for lydie had deliberately aimed a blow at her vanity the great and vulnerable spot in the armour of la belle brune de bordeaux  lydie knew marie leszcynska well enough to be sure that the very breath of scandal which she had deliberately blown on gastons wife was enough to cause the rigid puritanicallyminded queen to refuse all future intercourse with her rightly or wrongly without further judgment or appeal the queen would condemn irène unheard and ban her and her husband for ever from her intimacy thus setting the mark of a certain social ostracism upon them which they could never live down  less than three seconds had elapsed whilst these conflicting emotions assailed the various actors of this drawingroom drama the queen now turned with a frown halfinquiring wholly disapproving toward the unfortunate louvois  monsieur le chambellan she said sternly how did this occur we do not allow any error to creep in the list of presentations made to our royal person  these few words recalled irène to the imminence of her peril she would not allow herself to be humiliated without a protest nor would she so readily fall a victim to lydies obvious desire for revenge she too was shrewd enough to know that the queen would never forgive and certainly never forget the esclandre of this presentation but if she herself was destined to fall socially at least she would drag her enemy down with her and bury lydies influence power and popularity beneath the ruins of her own ambitions  your majesty will deign i hope to pause a moment ere you sweep me from before your royal eyes unheard she said boldly the error is on the part of madame la grande maréchale my name was put on monsieur le chambellans list by her orders  but marie leszcynska would not at this juncture take any direct notice of irène until it was made quite clear that madame la comtesse de stainville was a fit and proper person to be presented to the queen of france she absolutely ignored her very existence lest a word from her be interpreted as implying encouragement or at least recognition therefore she looked beyond irène straight at monsieur de louvois and addressed herself directly to him  what are the true facts monsieur le chambellan she said  i certainly    er    had the list as usual    er    from madame la grande maréchale    and    poor monsieur de louvois stammered in a fit of acute nervousness  then tis from you madame la marquise that we require an explanation for this unseemly disturbance rejoined her majesty turning her cold gray eyes on lydie  the explanation is quite simple your majesty replied lydie calmly it had been my intention to present madame la comtesse de stainville to your majesty but since then events have occurred which will compel me to ask madame la comtesse to find some other lady to perform the office for her  the explanation is not quite satisfactory to us rejoined her majesty with all the rigid hauteur of which she possessed the stinging secret and it will have to be properly and officially amplified tomorrow but this is neither the place nor the moment for discussing such matters monsieur de louvois i pray you to proceed with the other names on your list the queen has spoken  with these arrogant words culled from the book of etiquette peculiar to her own autocratic house the daughter of the deposed king of poland waved the incident aside as if it had never been a quickly repressed murmur went all round the room lydie swept a deep and respectful curtsey before her majesty and indicated by her own manner that as far as she was concerned the incident was now closed by royal command  but irène de stainvilles nature was not one that would allow the matter to be passed over so lightly whichever way the queen might choose to act she felt that at any rate the men must be on her side and though king louis himself was too indolent and egotistical to interfere actively on her behalf and her own husband could not do more than pick a quarrel with some wholly innocent person yet she was quite sure that she detected approval and encouragement to fight her own battles in the looks of undisguised admiration which the masculine element there present freely bestowed upon her monsieur le duc daumont for one looked stern disapproval at his daughter whilst monsieur de louvois was visibly embarrassed  it was therefore only a case of two female enemies one of whom certainly was the queen of francea prejudiced and obstinate autocrat if ever there was one within the narrow confines of her own intimate circleand the other exceptionally highly placed both in court favour and in official status  still irène de stainville felt that her own beauty was at least as powerful an asset when fighting for social prestige as the political influence of her chief adversary  therefore when the queen of france chose to speak as if madame la comtesse de stainville did not even exist and monsieur de louvois diffidently but firmly begged her to stand aside she boldly refused  nay the queen shall hear me she said in a voice which trembled a little now with suppressed passion surely her majesty will not allow a jealous womans caprice     silence wench interrupted marie leszcynska with all the authority the pride the dictatorial will which she had inherited from her polish ancestors you forget that you are in the presence of your queen  nay madame i do not forget it said irène nothing daunted and firmly holding her ground i remember it with every word i utter and remember that the name of our queen stands for purity and for justice your majesty she added being quick to note the slightly yielding look which at her cleverly chosen words crept in marie leszcynskas eyes and gracefully dropping on her knees on the steps of the throne will you at least deign to hear me i may not be worthy to kiss your majestys hand we none of us are that i presume for you stand infinitely above us by right of your virtues and your dignity but i swear to the queen of france that i have done nothing to deserve this public affront  she paused a moment to assure herself that she held the attention of the queen and of every one there present then she fixed her dark eyes straight on lydie and said loudly so that her clear somewhat shrill young voice rang out triumphantly through the room  my husband was made a tool of by madame la marquise deglinton for the purpose of selling the stuart prince to england  once more there was dead silence in the vast reception hall a few seconds during which the loudly accusing voice died away in an almost imperceptible echo but in one heart at least those seconds might have been a hundred hours for the wealth of misery they contained  lydie stood as if turned to stone though she had realized gastons treachery she had not thought that it would mean all this the utter infamy of it left her paralyzed and helpless she had delivered her soul her mind her honour her integrity to the vilest traitor that ever darkened the face of the earth if a year ago she had humiliated him if today she had tried to thwart all his future ambitions he was fully revenged now  she did not hear even the loyal queens protest  it is false for marie leszcynska sickened and horrified was loth to believe the truth of this terrible indictment against the one woman she had always singled out for royal trust and royal friendship  it is true your majesty said irène firmly as she once more rose to her feet deign to ask madame la marquise deglinton if today in the loneliness of the park of versailles she did not place in the hands of monsieur le comte de stainville the secret of the stuart princes hiding place so that he might be delivered over to the english for a large sum of money madame is beautiful and rich and influential monsieur de stainville being a man dared not refuse to obey her orders but monsieur de stainville is also handsome and young madame honoured him with her regard and i the wife was to be publicly ostracised and swept aside for i was in the way and might have an indiscreet tongue in my mouth that your majesty is the truth concluded irène now with triumphant calm deign to look into her face and mine and see which is the paler she or i  marie leszcynska had listened in silence at the awful accusation thus hurled by one woman against the other at irènes final words she turned and looked at lydie saw the marblelike hue of the face the rigidity of the young form the hopeless despair expressed in the halfclosed eyes it is but fair to say that the queen even now did not altogether believe madame de stainvilles story she instinctively was still drawing a comparison between the gaudily apparelled doll with the shrill voice and the impudently bared shoulders and the proud graceful woman in robes of virginal white of whom during all these years of public life unkind tongues were only able to say that she was cold rigid dull uninteresting perhaps but whose vestal robes the breath of evil scandal had never dared to pollute  the queen did not feel that guilt was written now on that straight pure brow but she had a perfectly morbid horror of any esclandre occurring in her presence or at one of her courts moreover irène had certainly struck one chord which jarred horribly on the puritanical queens nerves and unfortunately at the very moment when madame de stainville made this final poisoned suggestion marie lesczynskas eyes happened to be resting on the kings face in louis expression she caught the leer the smile halfmocking half indulgent which was habitual to him when womans frailty was discussed and her whole pride rose in revolt at contact with these perpetual scandals which disgraced the court of versailles and which she was striving so hard to banish from her own entourage  because of this she felt angered now with every one quite indiscriminately a few years ago her sense of justice would have caused her to sift this matter through to test for herself the rights or wrongs of an obviously bitter quarrel but lately this sense of justice had become blunted through many affronts to her personal dignity as a queen and as a wife it had left her with a morbid egotistical regard for the majesty of her court this she felt had been attainted and now she only longed to get away and leave behind her all this vulgarity these passions these petty quarrels which she so cordially abhorred  enough she said sternly our royal cheeks glow with shame at thought that this indecent brawl should have occurred in our presence your majesty she added turning haughtily to the king your arm i pray we cannot endure this noisy bickering which is more fitting for the slums of paris than for the throneroom of the queen of france  louis bewilderment was almost comical it would have been utterly impossible for him and quite unseemly in his wifes presence to interfere in what was obviously a feminine quarrel even if he had desired to do so and he had not altogether made up his mind how madame la comtesse de stainvilles indiscreet outburst would affect him personally which was all that really interested him in the matter on the whole he was inclined to think favourably of the new aspect of affairs when the fact of the stuart princes betrayal into his enemies hands became knownwhich it was bound to do sooner or laterit was not unpleasant that the first hint of the treachery should have come in such a form as to implicate lydie and that so deeply that ever afterward the public clinging to the old proverb that there is no smoke without fire would look upon her as the prime mover in the nefarious scheme  louis the wellbeloved possessed par excellence the subtle knack of taking care of his august person and above all of his august reputation it would certainly be as well for the sake of the future that his overindulgent subjects should foster the belief that in this vile treachery their king had been misled more sinned against than sinning  but of course he too was anxious to get away that the present feminine altercation would lead to a more serious quarrel he already guessed from the fact that his shrewd eyes had perceived lord eglinton standing close to one of the great doors at the further end of the room vaguely louis wondered how much the husband had heard and what he would do if he had heard everything then he mentally shrugged his shoulders thinking that after all it did not matter what milors future actions might be louis was quite convinced that madame lydie had thrown her bonnet over the mills and that as a gallant gentleman milor would above all things have to hold his peace  his majesty therefore was not angered against any one he smiled quite affably at the comte and comtesse de stainville and bestowed a knowing wink on lydie who fortunately was too dazed to notice this final insult  every one else was silent and awed the queen now descended the steps of the daïs on the arm of the king irène was a little disappointed that nothing more was going to happen she opened her lips ready to speak again but marie leszcynska threw her such a haughty scornful glance that gaston de stainville realizing the futilitynay the dangerof prolonging this scene placed a peremptory hand on his wifes arm forcibly drawing her away  at the foot of the steps her majesty once more turned to lydie  we shall expect an explanation from you marquise she said haughtily but not tonight see that our audience chamber is cleared from all this rabble  and with this parting shot hurled recklessly at her faithful adherents just as much as at those who had offended her the descendant of a proud line of kings sailed majestically out of the room whilst a loud hushshshsh    caused by the swish of brocaded skirts on the parquet floor as every one made a deep obeisance accompanied the royal lady in her short progress toward the door and then softly died away     chapter xxvii  a fall   irène de stainville was quite right when she thought that sympathy would be on her side in the grave affront which had been put upon her and for which she had revenged herself somewhat drastically but under the circumstances quite naturally  although in this circleknown as the queens setthe young marchioness of eglinton had always been looked up to as a leader and an especial favourite the accusation which irène had brought against her was so awful her own attitude of passive acquiescence so incomprehensible that it was small wonder that after the departure of their majesties when the crowd broke up into isolated groups most people there present held themselves aloof from her  the words a jealous womans caprice which at the outset had so angered the queen expressed fully the interpretation put upon lydies conduct by those who witnessed the scene from beginning to end that irène de stainville had inflicted on her the humiliation of a terrible public indictment was reckoned only as retributive human justice  lydie knew well enough that the crowd which surrounded herthough here usually composed of friendswas only too ready to believe evil however crying against a woman placed so highly in royal and social favour as she herself had been for years already she could hear the murmur of condemnation round her and that from people who should have known that she was quite incapable of committing the base treachery attributed to her  of course she had not denied it she could not have denied it in the face of the wording of the accusation itself  and she felt herself hideously and morally guilty guilty in the facts though not in the spirit as irène had put it crudely and simply she had handed over to gaston de stainville in the privacy of the park of versailles the secret which would deliver the stuart prince into the hands of his enemies  how could she begin to explain to all these people that her motive had been good and pure her orders to gaston altogether different from those imputed to her by irène no one would have believed her explanation unless gaston too spoke the truth and gaston meant to be an infamous liar to the end  she had been the tool of that clique it was they now who were ready to cast her aside to break her power and ultimately to throw her on the heap of social refuse where other traitors liars and cheats mouldered away in obscurity  already she knew what the end would be already she tasted the bitter fruit of waning popularity  quite a crowd of obvious sympathizers gathered round the comte and comtesse de stainville gastons avowedly base conduct wasit seemsto be condoned at best he stood branded by his own wifeunwittingly perhapsas having betrayed a woman who for right or wrong had trusted him but it is strange to record that in this era of petticoat rule the men were always more easily forgiven their faults than the women  lydie found herself almost alone only monsieur de louvois came and spoke to her on an official matter and presently monsieur le duc daumont joined them  will you let me take you back to your apartments lydie urged monsieur le duc i fear the excitement has seriously upset you  you think i have been to blame father dear she asked quite gently  oh    he murmured vaguely  you did not speak up for me when that woman accused me     my dear child he said evasively you had not taken me into your confidence i thought     you still think she insisted that what madame de stainville said was true  isnt it he asked blandly  he did not understand this mood of hers at all was she trying to deny impossible surely she was a clever woman and with the map and her own letter sealed and signed with her name what was the good of denying  your own letter and the map my child he added with gentle reproach thinking that she feared to trust him completely  ah yes my own letter she murmured the map    i had forgotten  no she did not mean to deny she could not deny    her own father believed her guilty    and all she could have done would have been to urge the purity of her motive gaston had of course destroyed her orders to the command of le monarque and there was only the map    and that awful awful letter  monsieur le duc thought that his daughter had been very unwise having trusted gaston and placed herself as it were in his hands she was foolish to anger him no manif he have the faintest pretension to being called an honourable gentlemanhowever smitten he might be with another womans charms will allow his wife to be publicly insulted by her rival no doubt lydie had been jealous of irène whose somewhat indiscreet advances to milor eglinton had aroused universal comment but lydie did not even pretend to care for her own husband and she had yielded her most treasured secret to gaston de stainville there she should have remained content and not have provoked irènes wrath and even perhaps a revulsion of feeling in gaston himself  unlike king louis monsieur le duc daumont did not approve of his daughters name being associated with the treacherous scheme from which he was ready enough to profit financially himself although in the innermost depths of his heart he disapproved of it he knew his royal master well enough to be fully aware of the fact that when the whole nefarious transaction came to light louis would find means of posing before the public as the unwilling tool of a gang of moneygrabbers when that happened every scornful finger would of necessityremembering the events of this nightpoint at lydie and incidentally at her father as the prime movers of the scheme  it had been far better to have conciliated irène and not to have angered gaston  but women were strange creatures and jealousy their most autocratic master even his daughter whom he had thought so exceptional so clever and so clearheaded was not free from the weaknesses of her sex  methinks my dear he said kindly you have not acted as wisely as i should have expected madame de stainville on my honour hath not wronged you so as to deserve a public affront and gaston himself only desired to serve you  monsieur le duc must have raised his voice more than he intended or else perhaps there had occurred quite suddenly in the crowd of sympathizers that now stood in a dense group round madame de stainville one of those inevitable moments of complete silence when angels are said to be fluttering round the room certain it is that monsieur le ducs words sang out somewhat loudly and were heard by those whose names had been on his lips  nay i entreat you monsieur le duc came in light bantering accents from gaston de stainville do not chide your fair daughter believe me we who have suffered most are not inclined to be severe as to me the psychology of madame la marquises mood has been profoundly interesting since it hath revealed her to the astonished gaze of her many admirers as endowed with some of the weaknesses of her adorable sex why should we complain of these charming weaknesses for though we might be very hard hit thereby they are but expressions of flattery soothing to our pride  the groups had parted somewhat as he spoke leaving him face to face with lydie towards whom he advanced with an affected gait and mincing steps looking at her with mocking eyes whilst toying gracefully with the broad black ribbon that held his eyeglass  but gastons were not the only sarcastic glances that were levelled at lydie his fatuous innuendoes were unmistakable and bore out the broader and more shameful accusation hurled by irène lydies own attitude her every action tonight the expression of her face at this moment seemed to prove them true she retreated a little as he advanced and doing so she raised her head with that proud toss which was habitual to her  thus her eyes travelled swiftly across the room and she saw her husband standing some distance away she too like king louis wondered how much he had heard how much he knew and knowing all what he meant to do instinctively when she caught sight of him and then once more saw gaston de stainville drawing nearer to her she remembered that warning which milor had given her that morning and which she had thought so futile anent the loathsome reptile that once touched would pollute for ever  madame said gaston now as he boldly approached her my friends here would tell me no doubt that by every code of social honour my duty is to punish you or someone who would represent you in this matter for the affront done to my wife but how can i do that since the offender is fair as well as frail my desire is not to punish but rather to thank you on my knees for the delicate compliment implied by your actions tonight i knew that you honoured me by trusting in me he added with obvious significance but i had not hoped to provoke such flattering jealousy in the heart of the most statuesque woman in france  a titter went round the room gastons attitude seemed suddenly to have eased the tension as of an impending tragedy which had hung over the brilliant assembly for the last half hour monsieur le comte was such a dreadful mauvais sujet but so delightful in his ways so delicately refined in his wickedness he was quite right to take the matter lightly and a murmur of approval followed the titter at the tact with which he had lifted the load of apprehension from the minds of the company  madame la marquise deglinton was something of a fool to take the matter so thoroughly au tragique no doubt the affairs of the stuart prince would right themselves presently and she certainly should have had more regard for her willing and obviously devoted accomplice  he looked so superlatively elegant and handsome now the younger women sighed whilst they admired him he pointed his toe and held out his tricorne in the manner prescribed by fashion for the making of a bow and it was most unfortunate that he was so suddenly stopped in the very midst of his graceful flourish by a quiet and suave voice which came immediately from behind him  i would not do that were i in your redheeled shoes my good stainville a slip on this highlypolished floor is certain to be the result  but even before the gentle echo of these blandly spoken words had penetrated to the further ends of the room monsieur le comte de stainville had measured his full length face downward on the ground  his fall was so instantaneous that he had not the time to save himself with his hands and he was literally sprawling now at lydies feet with arms and legs stretched out his face having come in violent contact with the polished floor quite close to him lord eglinton was standing laughing softly and discreetly and looking down on the prostrate and distinctly inelegant figure of the handsome cavalier  a ripple of merry laughter followed this unexpected turn of events one or two spectators who had stood quite close at the very moment that the catastrophe occurred declared subsequently that milor had with a quick action of his foot thrown monsieur de stainville off his balance the intense slipperiness of the parquet having merely done the rest  be that as it may the laughter of necessity was prudently suppressed for already gaston had picked himself up and there was that in his face which warned all those present that the farcesuch as it waswould prove the prelude to real and serious tragedy  there now said lord eglinton blandly did i not warn you monsieur le comte graceful flourishes are apt to be treacherous  milor   said gaston who was livid with rage  hushshsh interrupted milor in the same even and gentle voice not in the presence of ladies    an you desire monsieur le comte ill be at your service later on  then he turned toward his wife bowing low but not in the least as gaston de stainville would have bowed for he had inherited from his father all the stiffness of manner peculiar to the anglosaxon race  thus at this moment he looked distinctly gauche though not without dignity as his back slightly bent his left arm outstretched he waited until lydie chose to place her hand on his sleeve  your seconds milor shouted gaston who seemed quite unable to control himself and who had to be distinctly and even determinedly held back by two of his friends from springing then and there at lord eglintons throat  they will wait on yours tonight monsieur le comte replied le petit anglais affably madame la marquise will you honour me  and lydie took his arm and allowed him to lead her out of the room     chapter xxviii  husband and wife   monsieur achille was waiting in the vestibule of the queens apartments as soon as lord and lady eglinton appeared his majestic figure detached itself from the various groups of flunkeys who stood about desultorily pending the breaking up of her majestys court he had a cloak over his arm and at a sign from his master he approached and handed him the cloak which milor then placed round his wifes shoulders  do you desire to sleep in versailles tonight madame he asked my coach is below in case you wished to drive to château daumont  i thank you milor she said i would wish to remain in versailles  then she added with a pathetic sigh of bitterness  my father would prefer it i think he is not prepared for my visit and i do not interfere with your lordships arrangements     not in the least madame he rejoined quietly the corridors are interminable would you like a chair  no    let us walk she said curtly  without further comment he once more offered her his arm she took it and together they descended the monumental staircase and then turned along the endless vast corridors which lead to the west wing monsieur achille followed at a respectful distance and behind him walked two flunkeys also in the gorgeous scarlet and gold eglinton livery whilst two more bearing torches preceded monsieur le marquis and madame lighting them on their way  on the way to the west wing milor talked lightly of many things of monsieur de voltaires latest comedy and the quaint new fashion in headgear of his majesty the king of prussia and of the pictures of monsieur claude gelée he joked about the duchesse de pontchartrains attempts at juvenility and monsieur crébillons pretensions to a place among the immortals lydie answered in monosyllables she could not bring herself to speak although she quite appreciated milors desire to appear natural and unconcerned before his own lacqueys  a great resolution was taking root in her mind and she only wanted the privacy and the familiarity of her own apartments to put it into execution thus they reached the west wing  arrived in the antechamber whence her rooms branched off to the right and milors to the left lord eglinton stopped disengaged her arm from his and was about to bid her an elaborate goodnight when she said abruptly  may i speak with you privately and in your own study milor  certainly madame he replied seemingly a little astonished at her request  he dismissed all the flunkeys with the exception of monsieur achille who led the way through the reception rooms toward milors private suite lord and lady eglinton followed in silence now the rooms seemed strangely silent and deserted ghostlike too for there was no artificial light and the moon peered in through the tall windows throwing patches of pale mauve and weird translucent greens on the parquet floor and the brocade coverings of the chairs  in milors study monsieur achille lighted the candles in two massive candelabra which stood on the secrétaire then at a nod from his master he walked backward out of the room  the heavy portière fell back with a curious sound like a moan and for the third time today husband and wife stood face to face alone the gaucherie of his manner became at once apparent now yet he seemed in no way bashful or ill as ease only very stiff and awkward in his movements as he drew a chair for her at a convenient angle and when she had sat down placed a cushion to her back and a footstool at her feet he himself remained standing  i pray you sit milor she said with a quick sigh that trembled as it escaped her lips and if i have not angered you beyond the bounds of your patience i earnestly ask you to bear with me for if i have been at fault i have also suffered much and     madame he said quite gently if somewhat coldly might i entreat of you not to insist on this interview if it distresses you very much as to a fault    on my honour madame the very thought of selfaccusation on your part seems to me wildly preposterous  he did not sit as she had asked him to do but stood looking down at her and thinkingthinking alasthat she never had been quite so beautiful she was almost as white as her gown the powder still clung to her hair which in the dim light of the candles chose to hide the glory of its ardent colour beneath the filmy artificial veil she wore some exquisite pearls his gift on the day of her marriage row upon row of these exquisite gems fell on her throat and bosom both as white as glittering and pure as the priceless treasures from the deep  the chair in which she sat was covered with damask of a rich dull gold and against this background with its bright lights and impenetrably dark shadows the white figure stood out like what he had always pictured her a cold and unapproachable statue  but tonight though so still and white the delicate marble had taken unto itself life the life which means sorrow all the haughtiness of the look had vanished there were deep shadows under the eyes and lines of suffering round the perfectly chiselled lips  henry dewhyrst marquis of eglinton was not yet thirty he loved this exquisitely beautiful woman with all his heart and soul and she had never been anything more to him than a perfectly carved image would be on the high altar of a cathedral she had been neither helpmate nor wife only an ideal an intangible shadow which his love had not succeeded in materializing  as he looked at her now he wondered for the first time in the course of their married life if it had been his own fault that they had remained such complete strangers this was because for the first time today a great sorrow a still greater shame had breathed life into the marblelike statue  all at once he felt deeply unutterably sorry for her he had no thought of her wrongs toward him only of those done to herself by her pride and the faults of the epoch in which she lived  milor she said trying to steady her voice it would ease me a littleand ease the painfulness of this interviewif you were to tell me at what precise moment you entered her majestys throneroom tonight  i cannot say madame he replied with the ghost of a smile i did not look at the clock but i was in attendance on his majesty and therefore     you heard what passed between madame la comtesse de stainville and myself she interrupted hastily  every word  somehow she felt relieved she would have hated to recapitulate that vulgar scene the mutual recriminations the insults culminating in her majestys contemptuous exit from the room she could not now see her husbands face for he had contrived to stand so as to allow the light from the candelabra to fall full upon her whilst he himself silhouetted against the light remained in the shadow but there was a certain dignified repose about the whole figure the white slender hand resting lightly on the bureau the broad shoulders square and straight suggesting physical strength and the simple somewhat sober style and cut of the clothes  the room too appeared as a complete contrast to the other apartments of the palace of versailles where the mincing fancies of watteau and the artificialities of boucher had swept aside the nobler conceptions of girardon and mansard it was quite plainly furnished with straightback chairs and hangings of dull gold and the leather covering of the bureau gave ample signs of wear  the turmoil in lydies heart subsided yielding itself to peace in the midst of these peaceful surroundings she was able to conquer the tremor of her voice the twitch of her lips and to swallow down the burning tears of humiliation which blinded her eyes and obscured her judgment  then milor it will indeed be easier for me you understand of what i am charged the awful load of disgrace and shame which by my own folly i have placed upon my shoulders    you understand and her voice though steady sunk to a whisper that i have proved unworthy of the confidence which the unfortunate stuart prince who was your friend placed in me as well as in you  he did not reply waiting for her to continue her head had drooped and a heavy tear fell from her sunken lids upon her hands to him who loved her and whom she had so deeply wronged there was a strange yet painful joy in watching her cry  what madame de stainville said tonight is true she added tonelessly i gave into monsieur de stainvilles hands the map with full marginal notes and description of the place where the stuart prince is hiding i also gave him a letter written and signed by me addressed to prince charles edward stuart begging him to trust implicitly his own royal person and that of his friends to the bearer of my note that letter and the plan are even now in the hands of his majesty who purposes to accept the proposals of his grace the duke of cumberland and to sell the stuart prince to his foes for the sum of fifteen million livres and that is all true  knowing men the men of her world she fully expected that this confession of hers would cause her husbands just wrath to break through that barrier of courteous goodbreeding and selfrestraint imposed on all men of honour when in the presence of women and which she firmly believed had alone prevented him from interfering between herself and irène she would not have been astonished if he had stormed and raged loudly accused and condemned her nayshe had heard of such thingsif he had laid hands on her but when hearing nothing she looked up she saw that he had scarcely moved only the hand which still rested on the secrétaire trembled a little perhaps her look made him conscious of that for he withdrew it and then seemed to pull himself together and draw himself up straight and rigid like a soldier on parade  having told you this milor she resumed after a slight pause i should like to add that i am fully aware that in your eyes there can be no excuse possible for what i did since in doing it i have sacrificed the life of a man who trusted usyou and me milormore even than he did france he and his friends by my act will leave the shelter of their retreat and will be delivered into the hands of those who cannot do aught for political and selfprotective reasons but send them to the scaffold you see milor i do not palliate my offence nor do i seek your pardonalthough i know that you will look on what i have done as a disgrace brought by your wife upon your name i deserve no pardon and i ask for none but if there is no excuse for my conduct at least do i owe you an explanation and for this i crave your attention if you would care to listen  nay madame you do but jest he rejoined you owe me nothing    not even an explanation  yet you will listen she urged  it would be only painful to us both madame  you prefer to think of me as ignoble treacherous and base she said with sudden vehemence you do not wish to know for certain and from my own lips that gaston de stainville     she paused abruptly and bit her lips he watching her keenly she not knowing that she was watched  this was going to be a fight and he knew it a dire conflict between distress and pride at first he had hoped that she was prepared to yield that she had sought this interview because the load of sorrow and of humiliation being more than she could bear she had turned instinctively to the only man in the world who could ease and comfort her whose boundless untiring love was ready to share the present pain as it had shrunk from participating in the glories of the past but as she spoke as she sat there before him now white passive disdainful even in her selfabasement he knew that his hourloves hourhad not yet struck pride was not yet conquered  the dominant ruler of a lifetime will not abdicate very readily and though distress and sorrow are powerful opponents they are more transient more easily cast aside than pride  as you say milor she now said more quietly the matter is only painful to us both i understand that your estimate of me is not an exalted one you despiseyou probably hate me well so be it let us not think of our own feelings in this matter milor i entreat you to ignore my very existence for the time being only thinking of the stuart prince and of his dire peril  tis because of him i have begged for this interview she resumed with just a thought of that commanding manner which she was wont to assume whenever matters of public import were discussed i need not reiterate the fact that he is in deadly danger le levantin a fast brigantine milor is even now being equipped by his majesty for the nefarious expedition le levantin or perhaps le monarquethe latter is quite ready to sail at any time and with the map and my letter it will be easy    oh so easy    oh she added with a sudden uncontrollable outburst of passionate appeal milor he was your friend    can nothing be done    can nothing be done  i do not know madame he replied coldly how should i  but surely surely you remember your promise to him milor she said impatient at his coldness unable to understand this lack of enthusiasm you remember that night in the château daumontthe banquet    his farewell to you    his trust his confidence    the assurance you gave him     so much has occurred since then madame he said simply the guidance of affairs has been in your hands    i have lost what little grasp i ever had of the situation    as you know i am neither clever nor strongand i have only too gladly relied on abler wits than mine own     but your promise she urged with real passion ringing in her voice your promise to him     i made a far more solemn one to you madame never to interfere in matters of state  ill release you of that she cried impulsively think milor    i entreat you to think    there must be some way out of this terrible labyrinth    there must be some one whom you can trust     she checked herself and a quick hot blush rose to her cheeks she thought that she had detected a quick flash in his eyes at these last words of hers a flash which had caused that sudden rush of blood to her temples but which was extinguished almost as soon as it arose he said quite naturally and tonelessly  there is no one how could there be  but surely surely she repeated with growing obstinate vehemence you can think of something to do    you have the means    you are rich    have you no enthusiasms milor  oh    he said deprecatingly so few    they are scarce worthy of the name     no thought how to help your friend who is in fear and peril of his life    heavens above us what are the men of france wooden dolls or     that what the women of france have made them madame he said quietly  then you have no thought or initiative how to help your friend she retorted  he had noted the ring of scorn in her voice the return of that haughty and obstinate selfwill which would for ever stand between her and happiness his expression suddenly hardened as he looked at her flashing eyes and the contemptuous curl of the exquisite lips all the gentleness went out of his face the latent tenderness which she had wilfully ignored and his voice no longer softly mocking became hard and bitter in its tones  i he said with a slight uplifting of his brow and a selfdeprecating droop of the lip surely madame you are pleased to jest i am no statesman no politician i scarce have a sufficiency of brains to be a figure head in an administration i have never been taught to think  you are mocking me milor she said haughtily  nothing is further from my thoughts i have far too much respect for your ladyship to venture on either mockery or individual thought  she paused awhile frowning and impatient angered beyond bounds too at his attitude which she was quite clever enough to see did not represent the true state of his mind no doubt he desired to punish her for her contempt of him that morning she would have liked to read the expression in his face to know something of what was going on behind that straight handsome brow and the eyes always so gentle yet so irritating now in this semblance of humility she thought certainly that the outline of the jaw suggested obstinacythe obstinacy of the inherently weak if she had not wanted his help so much she would have left him then and there in scorn and in wrath only too glad that sentiment had not led her into more excuses or explanationsa prayer for forgiveness mayhap she was not a little irritated with herself too for she felt that she had made a wrong start she was quite sure that his supineness at any rate with regard to the fate of the stuart prince was assumed there must be a way of appealing to that loyalty which she knew he cherished for his friend some means of breaking down that barrier of resentment which he had evidently set up against her  oh if it had been a few months ago when he still loved her before irène de stainville   she paused in this train of thought her mind not daring to travel further along it it was such a wide such a glorious possibility that that one little if suggested that her heart quivered with renewed agony and the weak tears of which she was so ashamed insisted on coming to her eyes  if only his love for her was not dead how easy her task would have been it would have fired him to enthusiasm now caused him to forget his resentment against her in this great work yet to be accomplished and instead of asking him for passive help she could have incited him to a deed of loyalty and of courage but now she was too proud to continue her appeal she thought that she had done her best and had not even succeeded in breaking through the icy reserve and resentment which in his heart had taken the place of silent and humble worship  milor she said with sudden determination and in the authoritative manner which was more habitual to her than the more emotional passionately appealing mood with your leave well cease these unworthy bickerings i may have been hasty in my actions this morning if so i pray you not to vent your anger against your friend if i have wronged you by taking you at your word when a year ago you told me that you would never wish to interfere in my official work well i humbly beg you pardon and again entreat you not to allow your friend to expiate the sins of your wife you say that the men of france are what the women have made them there i think that you are wrongat least in this that in your mind the word woman stands for those of the sex who are pure and loyal as well as those for who are not it is not the women of france who have made the men milor rather it is the men wholooking to the pompadours the irène de stainvilles not only for companionship and for pleasure but also heaven help them for idealshave made the women what they are but enough of this you no doubt think me wordy and tedious and neither understand nor wish to understand that there may be honour and chivalry in a far greater degree in the heart of a woman than in that of the more selfish sex i have asked for your advice in all simplicity and loyalty acknowledging the sin i have committed and asking you to help me in atoning for it in a way useful to your friend this appeal for advice you have met with sneers and bitter mockery on my soul milor if i could now act without your assistance i would do so for in all the humiliation which i have had to endure today none has been more galling or more hard to bear believe me than that which i must now endure through finding myself in a matter essentially vital to my heart and even to my reason dependent upon your help  he could hear her voice trembling a little in spite of her efforts at selfcontrol he knew quite well that at this moment she spoke the truth and these last words of hers which for many a long day afterward rang persistently in his ears represented to him ever afterward the very acme of mentalaye and physicalpain which one human being could inflict on another at the time it absolutely seemed unendurable it seemed to him that under the blow thus coldly dealt by those same beautiful lips for which his own ached with an intensity of passionate longing either his life or his reason must give way the latter probably for life is more tenacious and more cruel in its tenacity yet if reason went then heaven alone could help him for he would either kill her or outrage her beyond the hope of pardon  therefore milor she resumed after a slight pause unconscious evidently of the intense cruelty of her words i will beg of you not to make it harder for me than need be i must ask this help from you in order to succeed if humanly possible in outwitting the infamous work of a gang of traitors will you at least give me this help i need  if it lies within my power he replied i pray you to command madame  i am thinking of sending a messenger post haste to the commander of le monarque with orders to set sail at once for scotland she continued in matteroffact tones i should want a fresh copy of the map where prince charles edward is in hiding and to make assurance doubly sure a letter from you to the prince asking him to trust captain barre implicitly le monarque i know can reach scotland long ere le levantin is ready for sea and my idea had been originally to commission her to take the prince and his friends on board and then to skirt the west coast of ireland reaching brittany or mayhap the pyrenees by a circuitous route i have firm belief that it is not too late to send this messenger milor and thus to put my original plan into execution and if you will give me a new map and full directions and your signet ring for the prince i feel confident that i can find someone whom i could thoroughly trust     there is no one whom you could thoroughly trust with such an errand madame he said drily  i must risk that milor the crisis has become so acute that i must do something to avert that awful catastrophe  betrayal would be the inevitable result  i entreat you to leave that to me she urged firmly i know i can find someone all i ask is for the map and a word and signet ring from you  she was leaning forward now eager and enthusiastic again selfwilled and domineering determined that he should do what she wished her eyes were glowing the marble was indeed endowed with life she gleamed like a jewel white and fragilelooking in this dull and sombre room and he forgetting for the moment her cruelty of awhile ago was loth to let her go to speak the harsh words which anon would have to be said and which would send her resentful contemptuous perhaps heartbroken out of his sight again  would it not have been ten thousand times more simple to throw pride just anger reason to the winds to fall at those exquisite feet to encircle that glittering marble with passionately tremulous arms to swear fealty slavery obedience to her whims  how she would smile and how softly and tenderly would the flush of victory tinge those pale cheeks with delicate rose to see it gradually chase away the pearllike tone of her skin to see her eyes brighten at his word to feel perhaps the tiny hand tremble with joy as it lay for sheer gratitude a few brief seconds in his was not that well worth the barren victory of a mans pride over a womans selfwill  she had thought that he would have yielded at her first word would at once have fawned at her feet kissing her hand swearing that he was her slave he had done it once    a year ago and why not now again then she had smiled on him had allowed him to kneel to kiss her gown anon had yielded her cold fingers to his kiss he had reaped a year of misery for that one moments joy and now just for the space of a few seconds he was again assailed with an awful temptation to throw prudence and pride away to enjoy one golden hourless perhapsbut glorious and fulsome whilst it lasted until it gave way once more to humiliation far worse to bear than heretofore  the temptation for those few brief seconds was overwhelming and twas fortunate that he stood in shadow else she had seen signs of an awful conflict in that young and handsome face which she had been wont to see so gentle and so placid but he knew that in her pride had by now absolutely got the upper hand sorrow had laid down her arms and constituted herself a prisoner of war following meekly behind the triumphal chariot of her conquering rival  and because of that because he knew that there was not one spark yet in her heart which love had kindled that love itself was still lying dormant within her gagged and bound even in his sleep kept in subjection thus pinioned and helpless by masterful selfwill and by obstinate pride he would not yield to the temptation of culling the dead sea fruit that would inevitably turn to ashes even as his lips first tasted its fleeting if intoxicating savour  she had half risen from her chair leaning across the bureau eager excited tremulous sure of victory paper and pen lay close to her hand smiling she pointed to these  oh i pray you milor she said with passionate fervour do not delay every hour every minute is precious    i swear to you that ill find a messenger hell not know the purport of his errand    oh i assure you ill play the part of indifference to perfection    the packet to the commander of le monarque will seem of the most insignificant kind    ill not even order the messenger to hurry    just to guard the packet as inviolate as any secret of state    nay hundreds of such messages have to be trusted to indifferent hands in the course of a single transaction of the nations business believe me milor there is not cause for fear le monarque can put to sea within an hour of receiving my orders and prince charles edward stuart and his friends will be safely out of reach ere le levantin unfurls her sails and pins to her masthead the pennant of traitors     but you do not speak milor she said suddenly changing the tone of her voice all eagerness gone from her manner a strange nameless anxiety gripping her heart will you not do this little i ask     it is impossible madame he said curtly  impossible    why     her voice now was harsh trenchant as it had been when she hurled a loud insult at gaston de stainville through his wife she was on her feet tall and erect a statue once more white to the lips cold and haughty rigid too save for the slight trembling of her hands and the tremulous quiver of her mouth when she spoke  as he did not reply to her question she said impatiently  will you give me a reason for this unexplainable refusal milor  no i refuse that is all  this is not your last word  it is my last word  would you have me think that you are at one with the treacherous scheme milor and that you do not desire the safety of the stuart prince  she had raised her voice boldly accusing him inwardly knowing that the accusation was groundless yet wishing to goad him now into passion into explanation above all into acquiescence if it still lay in her power to force it  but he took the insult with apparent calm shrugged his shoulders and said quietly  as you please  or is it    is it that you do not trust me    that you think i      she could not finish the sentence nor put into words the awful suggestion which had sprung like a stinging viper straight across the train of her thoughts her eyes dazed and burning tried to pierce the gloom wherein he stood but the flickering light of the candles only threw weird fantastic gleams upon his face which suddenly seemed strange unknown incomprehensible to her his figure appeared preternaturally tall the sober gray of his coat looked like the pall of an avenging ghost he was silent and had made no sign of protest when she framed the terrible query  a bitter an awful humiliation overwhelmed her she felt as if right within her heart something had snapped and crumbled which nothing on earth could ever set up again  she said nothing more but she could not altogether repress a heartbroken moan which rose from the intensity of her mental agony  then she turned and with head thrown back with silent trembling lips and halfclosed eyes she walked slowly out of the room     chapter xxix  the fate of the stuart prince   lydie hardly knew how she reached her apartments earlier in the day she had thought once or twice that she had reached the deepest abyss of sorrow and humiliation into which it was possible for a woman of pride to descend when her husband first asked an explanation from her and taxed her with lending an ear to the kings base proposals when she found that her own father whom she respected and loved had himself delved deeply in the mire of treachery when she stood face to face with gaston de stainville and realized that he was an infamous liar and she a weak confiding fool when irène had accused her publicly of scheming that which she would have given her lifes blood to avert all these were moments when she felt that the shame of them was more than she could bear  yet how simple and childish how paltry seemed the agony of those mental tortures in comparison with that she endured now  she felt as if she had received a blow in the face a blow which had left a hideous disfiguring mark on her which everyone henceforth would see the scarlet letter of ignominy with which in the new world beyond the seas a puritanic inquisition branded the shameless outcasts by her husbands silence rather than by his words she had been branded with a mark of infamy  ye saints and angels above how terribly it hurt  yet why did she suffer so was it only because she had failed to obtain that which she almost begged for on her knees lydie proud dictatorial domineering lydie felt that she had humiliated herself beyond what she would have thought possible less than twelve hours ago and she had been refused  was it that that made her heart her head her very limbs ache with almost unendurable agony  her mindthough almost on the verge of madnessretained just one glimmer of reason it answered no the pain has deeper roots more mysterious at present incomprehensible and deathdealing in their tenacity  her husband thought that if he entrusted her with a letter for the stuart prince she might use that letter for treacherous ends that was the reason of his refusal he so hated so despised her that his mind classed her as one of the most ignoble of her sex  well awhile ago in the queens antechamber irène de stainville had publicly accused her of selling her royal friend for gold most people there had believed irène readily enough that had hurt too but not so much  then why this why these terrible thoughts which went hammering in her mind whispers of peace to escape from this racking torture peace that could only be found in death  great god am i going mad  monsieur achille had been accompanying madame la marquise on her way along the corridors he was carrying a candelabrum wherein four wax candles spluttered and flickered in the incessant draught lydie had been unconscious of the mans presence but she had followed the light mechanically her eyes fixed on the four yellowish flames which looked like mocking mouths that laughed and emitted a trail of black smoke foul as the pestilential breath of shame  arrived at the door of her own antechamber she was met by one of her liveried servants who told her that monsieur le duc daumont was within and awaiting to see her to her hastily put query the man replied that monsieur le duc had arrived about half an hour ago and hearing that madame la marquise was closeted with milor he had elected to wait  this visit from her father at this hour of the night meant a grave crisis of course at once lydies mind flew back to the stuart prince she had almost forgotten him since she left her husbands room it seemed as if the overwhelming misery of that silent and deadly indictment had weighed down all other thoughts until they sank into complete insignificance  vaguely too she had the sensation that there was no immediate necessity for her to rack her overtired brain tonight on the subject of the jacobites fate she had at least six clear days before her before le levantin which was to start on the dire expedition could be ready to put to sea there was le monarque on the other hand quite ready to sail within an hour of receiving her orders and captain barre was an honest man a gallant sailor he would only be too willing to make top speed in order to circumvent a treacherous plot which he would abhor if he knew of it  true lydie had now no means of locating the fugitives exactly but with a six days start of le levantin this want of precise knowledge need not necessarily prove fatal she could trust to her memory somewhat for she had repeatedly studied and fingered the map she could draw something approximate from memory and captain barres determination and enthusiasm would surely do the rest  these suggestions all rushed into her mind directly she heard that her father had come to visit her at this late hour at first her desire was to avoid seeing him at risk even of offending him but in spite of all that she had gone through lydie still retained sufficient presence of mind not to allow any impulse to rule her at such a critical moment she forced herself to reflect on the stuart prince and on him alone on his danger and the treacherous plot against him for at least twenty seconds time enough to realize that it was absolutely necessary that she should see her father in order to glean from him if possible every detail of the proposed expedition she would indeed be helpless if she remained in ignorance of what had been planned between the king gaston and her father perhapswho knowsin accordance with the habits of a lifetime the duke might even at this moment be anxious to consult his daughterhis helpmeet in all such mattersas to the final arrangements for the equipment of le levantin  satisfied with her conclusions she therefore went straight into the boudoir where the lacquey said that monsieur le duc was waiting  the first look at his benign face proved to her that he at least was not in any trouble whatever his daughters views on the subject might be he evidently was not altogether dissatisfied with the events of the day he still wore a perturbed look certainly the scene which had occurred in her majestys throneroom would not tend to decrease his mental worry but beyond the slightly troubled look in his kindly eyes and the obvious solicitude with which he took her hand and led her to a low divan he seemed fairly serene  well he said in a tone of anxious query  well father dear  your husband    what did he say  she looked at him a little bewildered with a stupid vacant stare which puzzled him  what should he have said father dear she asked i do not understand  about the fracas tonight my child was he there when irène de stainville spoke up so indiscreetly  no    no    i mean yes    she said vaguely yes milor was there he heard every word which irène de stainville said  well what did he say he repeated with marked impatience lydie my child this is not like you    cannot you see that i am anxious    i have been waiting here for over an half hour in a perfect agony of uncertainty    your servants told me you were closeted with milor    you must tell me what he said  he said nothing father she replied simply  nothing  nothing  monsieur le duc looked at her very keenly but her eyes were clear now and met his straight and full there was obviously no deceit there no desire to conceal more serious matters from him he shrugged his shoulders in token that he gave up all desire to understand his soninlaw had always been a shadowy personality to him and this attitude of his now in face of the public scandal resting on his wifes name was quite beyond monsieur le ducs comprehension  had lydie told him that her husband had heaped torrents of abuse on her and had concluded a noisy scene by striking her he would have been very angry but he would have understood  hm he said placidly these english are mad of a truth we men of honour here cannot really comprehend them nevertheless my dear lydie i suppose i as your father must be thankful that he did not lay hands on you for english husbands are notoriously brutal you are quite sure that you have nothing to complain of in your husbands conduct  quite sure father dear  i had come prepared to take you away with me my coach is below and i am driving to château daumont tonight would you like to come  not tonight dear she replied serenely and her father was glad to note that a slight smile hovered round her lips i am a little tired and will go straight to bed    but tomorrow ill come  permanently  if you will have me  well until you go to your château of vincennes you know my views on that subject  yes father dear    we will talk of that another time    i am very tired tonight  i understand that my child said monsieur le duc rather fussily now and clearing his throat as if there was something which still oppressed him and of which he would have liked to speak before leaving her  there was that awkward pause the result of a want of mutual understanding between two people who hitherto have been all in all to each other but whom certain untoward events have suddenly drawn apart lydie sincerely wished that her father would go she had much to think about a great deal to do and the strain of keeping up a semblance of serenity was very trying to her overwrought nerves he on the other hand felt uncomfortable in her presence he left quite angry with himself for not being able to discuss freely with her the subject matter which was uppermost in his mind there were one or two details in connection with the expedition to the scottish coast that he very much wanted to talk over with his daughter the habits of a lifetime gave him the desire to consult her about these details just as he had been wont to do on all public and official matters he had come to her apartments chiefly for that purpose was she not at one with him with the king and gaston over the scheme she had given substantial proof that she favoured the expedition his majesty had thanked her for her help she had rendered such assistance as now made the whole affair not only feasible but easy of accomplishment  it was therefore passing strange that monsieur le duc daumont still felt an unaccountable bashfulness in her presence when referring to the stuart prince at all  so he went to work in a circuitous way for there was another matter that troubled him but less so than the expedition therefore perhaps he spoke of it first  i presume my dear child he said lightly that you are sufficiently a woman of the world to understand that some sort of reparation is due from your husband to monsieur de stainville  reparation    she asked for what  again she stared at him blankly and with that vague expression of puzzlement which irritated whilst it halffrightened him  you were there my dear he said impatiently you know    and of course you must have seen     what  milor jeered at gaston then tripped him up with his foot so that monsieur de stainville measured his full length on the floor  i did not notice    she said simply  but many people did    enough at all events to give monsieur de stainville the initiative in the necessary reparation he was the insulted party  oh a duel you mean she said indifferently yes i suppose my husband will fight monsieur de stainville if his majesty will grant them leave  gaston will not appeal to his majesty and milor cannot very well refuse to meet him the king has oft declared his intention of permanently suppressing all duelling just as it has been done in england even tonight after the unfortunate fracas when i had the honour of paying my final respects his majesty said to me if milor eglinton and monsieur de stainville fight and one of them is killed well hang the survivor  then theyll not fight you think  monsieur le duc stared at his daughter such complete indifference as to her husbands actions in so grave a matter passed the bounds of correct behaviour  mais oui they will fight my dear he said sternly you know as well as i do that gaston could not pocket the slight put upon him by milor without covering himself with ridicule but the duel need not be serious    a scratch or two and no more    gaston is a perfect swordsman    he never misses his man added the duke hesitatingly is milor clever with the foils  i do not know  he has never fought a duel to your knowledge  i think never  whilst gastons skill is famous    but my dear you need have no anxiety    it was also with a view to reassuring you on the subject that i have sought you so late    you will believe your fathers word lydie if he tells you that your husband is in no grave danger at the hands of gaston  i thank you father dear she rejoined with the same natural even tone of voice which should have tranquillised him as to her mental condition but which somehow failed to do so  gaston must take up the matter    you understand that    it is quite public and    he would be laughed at if he appealed for leave to fight from his majesty    the matter was not serious and the result will be likewise    gaston will administer a slight punishment to milor    such a perfect swordsman you understand can select the very place on his opponents body where he will inflict the scratch    it will be the shoulder perhaps    or    or    the cheek    nothing to be anxious about    i am not anxious father dear she said with a serene smile amused in spite of herself at his many circumlocutions his obvious confusion and his still quite apparent wish to speak of one more matter which seemed to be weighing on his mind  is that all that you wished to say to me dear she said gently for if so i can assure you that you need not be troubled on my account i am neither anxious nor upset    milor i feel confident will take tender care of his shoulder    or of his cheek just as he does of his comfort and of his    his dignity  and you will not take it amiss from me my dear if i do not offer to be one of your husbands seconds in the affair he asked suddenly throwing off his hesitation and speaking more frankly  certainly not father dear    i feel sure that milor himself would not have suggested it     my position near his majesty    you understand my dear he explained volubly and also my    our association with gaston     certainlycertainly she repeated emphasizing her words our association with gaston     and he really is acting like a perfect gentleman    a man of honour     indeed  his enthusiasm his courage and devotion have been quite marvellous and though we shall primarily owe the success of our enterprise to you my dear yet his majesty feels as i do that we also owe much to monsieur de stainville ah mon dieu what it is to be young  what has monsieur de stainville done dear to arouse your special enthusiasm she asked  you shall judge of it yourself my dear after the esclandre provoked by irène tonight the publicity given to our scheme we held a hurried boudoir meeting at which his majesty and madame de pompadour were present as well as myself and gaston we all felt that you too should have been there dear but you had gone with milor and     yes yes never mind about me father she interrupted impatiently seeing that he was getting lost in the mazes of his polite apologies you held a boudoir meeting what did you decide     that after the publicity given to the main idea of our scheme you understand he rejoined it would be no longer safe to wait for its execution until le levantin was ready for sea something had to be risked of course but on the whole we all thought that now that the matter had become le secret de polichinelle a six days delay would be dangerous if not fatal to success you were not there lydie he repeated diffidently we could not consult you     no no then what did you decide  that we must send le monarque off at once  le monarque    at once     yes she is quite ready so you told me this morning and though we feared that captain barre might be too firm an adherent of the stuart cause to be altogether reliable stillas we had your own letterwe finally decided that we had better trust him now rather than wait for le levantin    i think we did right do you not    lydie    lydie    child what is it  the desperately anxious query had its justification in lydies terrible pallor the wild dilation of her pupils the dark purple rings which circled her eyes  as her father spoke she had risen from the divan and now she seemed unable to stand she was trembling from head to foot her hands were held out before her as in a pathetic appeal for physical support in a moment his arm was round her and with gentle force he drew her back to the couch pressing her head against his shoulder  lydie    lydie dear    i am sure you are ill  but already she had recovered from this sudden attack of faintness and dizziness of which with characteristic impatience for all feminine weaknesses she was now thoroughly ashamed her nervous system had received so many severe shocks in the course of this terrible and memorable day that it was small wonder that this last awful blow struck her physically as well as mentally  no no dear father she said as lightly as she could for she still felt very faint and ill i am quite well i assure you    please    please    she urged earnestly do not worry about me now but tell me quite clearlyand as briefly as you canexactly what are your plans at this moment    yours and gastons with regard to the expedition against the stuart prince    you spoke of a duel just now    and then of monsieur de stainvilles enthusiasm and courage    i    i am a little confused    and i would like to understand  i will tell you as briefly as i can my dear he rejoined not feeling altogether reassured and regarding her with loving anxiety we decided that instead of waiting for le levantin to be ready for sea we would send le monarque and instruct captain barre in accordance with the plan and the letter which you gave us and the secret orders framed by his majesty and myself le monarque having got the stuart and his friends on board will make straight for the northwest coast of england and land the jacobites at the first possible port where they can be handed over to the english authorities once this was settled gaston immediately offered to start for le havre at dawn with the secret orders we are not really afraid of captain barres possible disloyaltyand of course he is compelled to obey orders or suffer for his insubordination which he is not likely to contemplate on the whole i think we may safely say that we run far less risk by sending le monarque than by waiting for le levantin and gaston has full powers to promise captain barre a heavy bribe in accordance with the speed which le monarque will make after that his majesty was pleased to dismiss monsieur de stainville and myself being most specially gratified with gastons enthusiastic offer to ride at breakneck speed to le havre as soon as he could get to horse outside the boudoir gaston explained to me however that he could not shirk the duel with lord eglinton his seconds monsieur de belleisle and monsieur de lugeac already had his instructions and would wait on milor tonight to put it off now would be to cover himself with ridicule and to risk social ostracism the affront put upon his wife could not be allowed to rest until after his own return but the duel could take place at dawn and then he could get to horse half an hour later    so you see my dear that the duel cannotbecause of these weighty reasonshave any serious consequences as for our expedition methinks everything now is most satisfactorily arranged as gaston swears that he will reach le havre ere the shades of the evening fall upon the sea  lydie had listened quite quietly to this long explanation taking in every detail of the project lest anything should escape her her father could indeed be completely reassured she was perfectly calm apparently cheerful and when he had finished speaking she thanked him quite naturally and expressed approval of all that had been done  everything is beautifully planned and arranged my dear father she said pleasantly methinks i cannot do better than take a rest i fear i have been overwrought all day and have caused you much anxiety all is for the best now is it not    shall we both go to bed  monsieur le duc sighed with satisfaction he seemed to have found a longlost daughter this was the one he knew selfpossessed clearheaded a comfort and a guide  he drew her to him and kissed her tenderly and if there was a suggestion of shrinking of withdrawal in the young body he was certainly too preoccupied to notice it he bade her goodnight and then with obvious relief and a light elastic step he finally went out of the room     chapter xxx  m de stainvilles seconds   when monsieur achille having escorted madame la marquise as far as her apartments once more retraced his sedate footsteps toward those occupied by lord eglinton he was much surprised to find the worthy baptiste durand in the octagonal room which gave immediately on milors study  the wizened little man looked singularly upset he had a couple of heavy books under his arm and two large white quills one behind each ear gave him the look of a frightened stork  it was long past the usual hour when m durand laden with his bulky books habitually entered the marquiss private room and remained closeted therein with milor until long past midnight every evening at the selfsame hour he came to the octagonal room passed the time of day with monsieur achille and then went in to milor he always carried a leather bag filled with papers neatly tied in bundles and he wore a somewhat anxious look when he entered and one of relief when he finally departed monsieur achille had often bent his broad and majestic back in order to bring his ear down to the level of the keyhole of the door through which monsieur durand invariably disappeared at ten oclock in the evening but all the satisfaction which his curiosity obtained was the sound of two voices one steady and low and the other somewhat shrill without any individual or comprehensible sentence detaching itself from the irritating babel  and when m durand came out of the room after midnight he bade monsieur achille a curt goodnight and invariably refused any information with regard to the work he did for milor at that late hour of the night  when closely pressed he would vaguely say accounts which of course was ridiculous monsieur achille had never heard of a nobleman troubling himself about accounts at the time when most people of consideration were either at petits soupers or else comfortably in bed  as time went on monsieur achille ceased to take any interest in these nightly proceedings they were so monotonous and so regular that they were no longer exciting but tonight everything seemed changed m durand instead of marching straight through with his books into the study stood in the middle of the room a veritable picture of helpless perturbation  why m durand said achille greatly astonished what ails you you look as if you had seen a ghost  shshsh whispered the timorous little man indicating with a jerk of his lean shoulder the distant door of the study do you hear that  monsieur achille bent his ear to listen but strive how he might he could hear nothing but the great bracketclock on the wall ticking monotonously he shrugged his shoulders to indicate that the worthy baptiste had been dreaming but there was a certain look in the wizened face which caused him to tiptoe toward the study door and once more to bring his ear down to the level of the keyhole  then he shook his head and tiptoed back to the centre of the room  i can hear nothing he whispered are you sure he is in there  quite quite sure replied durand  then why dont you go in as usual  i    i cant  why not  i    i dont know    i seemed to hear such a funny sound as if    he paused a moment searching for the words that would best render his impression of what he had heard finding none apparently he reiterated  it is a very funny sound  perhaps milor was asleep and snoring suggested the practical achille  no no protested durand very energetically  or ill     ah yes    perhaps    stammered the little man perhaps milor is ill  then ill to him at once  and before m durand could prevent himwhich undoubtedly he would have doneachille had gone back to the study door and loudly knocked thereat  at first there was no answer m achille knocked again and yet again until a voice from within suddenly said  who is it  achille m le marquise responded the worthy with alacrity  i want nothing said the voice tell durand that i shall not need him tonight  m durand nearly dropped his heavy books on the floor  not want me he ejaculated we shall get terribly in arrears  will milor go to bed again queried m achille  no came somewhat impatiently from within do not wait up for me if i want you later i will ring  achille looked at m durand and the worthy baptiste returned the look of puzzlement and wonder both shrugged their shoulders  theres nothing to be done my good baptiste said achille at last you had best take your paraphernalia away and go to bed i know that tone of voice i have heard it once before when    but never mind that he added abruptly checking himself as if he feared to commit an indiscretion enough that i know if milor says in that tone of voice that he does not want you and that you are to go awaywell then my good durand he does not want you and you are to go away    do you see  and having delivered himself of this phrase of unanswerable logic he pointed toward the door  m durand was about to take his friends sound advice when a loud ring broke in upon the silence which had fallen over this portion of the stately palace  a visitor at this late hour mused monsieur achille ma foi methinks perhaps milor was expecting a fair and tardy visitor    eh m durand    and that perhaps this was the reason why you and i were to go away    eh    and why you were not wanted tonight    what  m durand was doubtful as to that but there was no time to discuss that little matter for a second ring louder and more peremptory than the first caused m achille to pull himself together to flick at his cravat and to readjust the set of his coat whilst m durand loath to retire before he knew something of the tardy visitor withdrew with books bag and papers into a dark corner of the room  already the sound of approaching footsteps drew nearer the visitor had been admitted and was now being escorted through the reception rooms by the two footmen carrying torches the next moment the doors leading to the official suite of apartments were thrown open m achille put himself in position in the centre of the room whilst a loud voice from the distant hall announced  m le marquis de belleisle m le comte de lugeac  achilles broad back was bent nearly double the names were well known to him and represented if not exactly the flower of aristocratic france at least the invisible power which swayed her destinies m le marquis de belleisle was madame de pompadours best friend and m de lugeac was her nephew  your master    is he within  it was m de belleisle who spoke his voice was loud and peremptory the voice of a man who only recently had been in a position to command  milor is    er    within m le marquis said achille with slight hesitation it is not often that he was taken aback when in the exercise of his duties but the situation was undoubtedly delicate and he had not yet made up his mind exactly how he ought to deal with it  neither of the two gentlemen however seemed to have any intention of leaving him much longer in doubt  go and tell him at once said m de lugeac that monsieur le marquis de belleisle and myself will have to trouble him for about two minutes  then as achille seemed to be hesitatingfor he did not move with any alacrity and his wellkept hand stroked his smooth heavy chinm de belleisle added more loudly  go knave and at once    par le diable man    how dare you hesitate  indeed monsieur achille dared do that no longer m le marquis de belleisle was not a gentleman to be trifled with so he shrugged his majestic shoulders and rubbed his hands together in token that the affair had passed out of their keeping and that he no longer held himself responsible for any unpleasant consequences which might accrue from such unparalleled intrusion  he strode with becoming majesty to the study door his broad straight back emphasising the protest of his whole attitude once more he knocked but more loudly less diffidently than before  the voice from within queried with marked impatience  what is it now  an urgent call monsieur le marquis replied achille in a firm voice  i can see no one i am busy said the voice from within  m de belleisle felt that this little scene was not quite dignified neither he nor m de lugeac was accustomed to stand behind a lacqueys back parleying with a man through closed doors therefore when monsieur achille turned to him now with a look which strove to indicate respectfully but firmly that the incident was closed he pushed him roughly aside and himself called loudly  pardi marquis methinks you are overanxious to forbid your door tonight i andré de belleisle and my friend le comte de lugeac desire a word with you we represent m le comte de stainville and unless you are closeted with a lady i summon you to open this door  then as the door remained obstinately closedtoo long at any rate for m le marquiss impatiencehe boldly placed his hand on the knob and threw it open the heavy panels flew back revealing lord eglinton sitting at his secrétaire writing his head was resting on his hand but he turned to look at the two gentlemen as they stood momentarily silent and subdued in the doorway itself he rose to greet them but stared at them somewhat astonished and not a little haughtily and he made no motion requesting them to enter  we crave your pardon milor began monsieur de belleisle feeling as he afterward explained unaccountably bashful and crestfallen we would not have intruded m de lugeac and i only that there was a slight formality omitted this evening without which we cannot proceed and which we must pray you to fulfill  what formality monsieur asked milor courteously i am afraid i do not understand  the whole incident occurred very rapidly we must admit continued m de belleisle still standing in the doorway still unwilling apparently to intrude any further on this man whom he had known for some time yet who seemed to have become an utter stranger to him now haughty grave and courteous with an extraordinary look of aloofness in the face which repelled the very suggestion of familiarity and that is no doubt the reason milor why you omitted to name your seconds to monsieur de stainville  my seconds repeated milor i am afraid you must think me very stupid    but i still do not understand     but surely milor    protested m de belleisle a little taken aback  would you be so kind as to explain    if it is necessary  necessary pardi i should not have thought that it had been necessary you milor in yourself also and through madame la marquise your wife have insulted m le comte de stainville and madame la comtesse too we represent m le comte de stainville in this affair wherein we presume that you are prepared to give him satisfaction and we have come tonight milor to ask you kindly to name your own representatives so that we may arrange the details of this encounter in the manner preeminently satisfactory to m le comte de stainville since he is the aggrieved party  gradually m de belleisle had raised his voice his feeling of bashfulness had entirely left him and he felt not a little wrathful at this strange rôle which he was being made to play it was quite unheard of that a gentleman who had so grossly insulted another as lord eglinton had insulted m de stainville should require such lengthy explanations as to what the next course of events would necessarily be  therefore milor he continued with some acerbity as lord eglinton had vouchsafed no reply to his tirade we pray you to name your seconds to us without delay so that we may no longer intrude upon your privacy  i need not do that m le marquis said milor quietly i require no seconds  no seconds gasped the two gentlemen with one breath  i am not going to fight m de stainville  if lord eglinton had suddenly declared his intention of dethroning king louis and placing the crown of france on his own head he could not more have astonished his two interlocutors both m de belleisle and m de lugeac were in fact absolutely speechless in all their vast experience of court life such a situation had never occurred before and literally neither of them knew exactly how to deal with it m de lugeac young and arrogant was the first to recover his presence of mind like his successful relative jeanne poisson de pompadour he had been born in the slums of paris his exalted fortune following so quickly in the wake of the exvictuallers wife had given him an assurance and an amount of impudence which the older de belleisle lacked and which stood him in good stead in the present crisis  are we to look on this as a formal refusal milor he now asked boldly  as you please  you will not give m le comte de stainville the satisfaction usually agreed upon between men of honour  i will not fight m de stainville repeated milor quietly i am busy with other things  but milor here interposed m de belleisle testily you cannot have reflected on the consequences of such an act which i myself at this moment would hardly dare to characterize  you will excuse me gentlemen said lord eglinton with seeming irrelevance but is there any necessity for prolonging this interview  none at all sneered m de lugeac it is not our business to comment on milors conduct    at present he added with audacious significance  but m de belleisle who in spite of his undignified adherence to the pompadour and her faction was a sprig of the old noblesse of france was loath to see the humiliation of a highborn gentlemanwhatever his faults might bebefore such an upstart as de lugeac a kindly instinct not altogether unexplainable caused him to say encouragingly  let me assure you milorthough perhaps in this i am overstepping my official powersthat m le comte de stainville has no desire to deal harshly with you the fact that he is the most noted swordsman in france may perhaps be influencing you at this moment but will you trust to my old experience when i assure you that m le comtes noted skill is your very best safeguard he will be quite content to inflict a slight punishment on youbeing a past master with his sword he can do that easily without causing you graver injury i am telling you this in confidence of course because i know that these are his intentions moreover he starts on an important journey tomorrow and would propose a very brief encounter with you at dawn in one of the spinneys of the park a mere scratch i assure you you need fear no more less he could not in all honour concede  a whimsical smile played round the corners of milors mouth chasing momentarily the graver expression of his face  your assurance is more than kind m de belleisle he said with perfect courtesy but i can only repeat what i said just now that i will not fight m de stainville  and instead of repeating what i said just now milor    said de lugeac with a wicked leer  you will elect to hold your tongue said m de belleisle authoritatively placing his hand on the younger mans wrist  de lugeac who lived in perpetual fear of doing or saying something which would inevitably betray his plebeian origin meekly obeyed m de belleisles command the latter though very bewildered would be sure to know the correct way in which gentlemen should behave under these amazing circumstances  lord eglinton standing beside his secrétaire his face in shadow was obviously waiting for these intruders to go m de belleisle shrugged his shoulders partly in puzzlement partly in contempt then he nodded casually to milor turned on his heel and walked out of the doorway into the octagonal room beyond whilst m de lugeac imitated as best he could the careless nod and the look of contempt of his older friend m achille stepping forward now closed the study doors behind the two gentlemen shutting out the picture of that grave haughty man who had just played the part of coward with such absolute perfection  bah these english said young de lugeac as he made the gesture of spitting on the ground i had not believed it par tous les diables had i not heard with mine own ears  but de belleisle gravely shook his head  i fear me the young man is only putting off the evil day his skin will have to be tough indeed if he can put up with    well with what he will get when this business becomes known  and it will become known asserted de lugeac spitefully he had always hated what he called the english faction madame lydie always snubbed him unmercifully and milor had hitherto most conveniently ignored his very existence by gd i hope that my glove will be the first to touch his cheek  shshsh admonished de belleisle nodding toward achille who was busy with the candelabrum  nay what do i care retorted the other had you not restrained me id have called him a dirty coward then and there  that had been most incorrect my good lugeac rejoined de belleisle drily and wilfully ignoring the language which in moments of passion so plainly betrayed the vulgar origin the right to insult lord eglinton belongs primarily to gaston de stainville and afterward only to his friends  and although m le marquis de belleisle expressed himself in more elegant words than his plebeian friend there was none the less spite and evil intent in the expression of his face as he spoke  then giving a sign to achille to precede them with the light the two representatives of m le comte de stainville finally strode out of the apartments of the excomptroller general of finance  m durand with his bulky books and his papers under his arms followed meekly repeatedly shaking his head     chapter xxxi  the final disappointment   lydie waited a few moments while her fathers brisk steps died away along the stoneflagged corridors in the silence of the evening the quietude which rested on this distant portion of the palace she could hear his brief word of command to the valet who had been stationed in the antechamber then the dukes quick alert descent down the marble staircase and finally the call for his coach oft repeated when he reached the terrace and began skirting the building on his way to the main paved yard where no doubt his horses were awaiting his return  when everything in and around the palace seemed quiet again lydie rang for her maid  a dark hood and cloak she ordered as soon as the girl appeared and speaking very rapidly  madame la marquise goes out again asked the maid a little anxiously seeing that the hour was late and she herself very sleepy  only within the palace replied lydie quick girl the cloak  within two or three minutes she was enveloped from head to foot in a cloak of dark woollen material that effectually hid the beautiful gown beneath then she bade the girl wait for her in her boudoir and not heeding the latters anxious protestations she walked quickly out of the room  the corridors and reception halls were now quite deserted even from the main building of the palace where the king himself was wont to sup copiously and long there no longer came the faintest echo of revelry of laughter or of music the vast château built at the cost of a nations hearts blood kept up at the cost of her tears and her humiliation now lay wrapped in sleep  in this remote west wing the silence was almost oppressive from her own apartments lydie could reach those occupied by milor without going through the antechamber and corridors where a few nightwatchmen were always stationed thus she could pass unperceived a dark ghostlike figure silent and swift gliding through an enchanted castle inhabited mayhap only by a sleeping beauty and her court from outside not a sound save the occasional hoot of an owl or the flap of a bats wings against the projecting masonry  lydie drew her cloak closely round her figure though the august night was hot and heavy with the acrid scent of late summer flowers she felt an inward shivering whilst her temples throbbed and her eyes seemed made of glowing charcoal a few more rooms to traverse a few moments longer wherein to keep her trembling knees from giving way beneath her and she would be in milors rooms  she was a little astonished to find them just as deserted as the rest of the palace the great audience chamber with its monumental bed the antechamber wherein m durands wizened figure always sat enthroned behind the huge secrétaire and the worthy baptiste himself was wont to hold intrusive callers at bay all these rooms were empty silent and sombre  at last she reached the octagonal room out of which opened the study here too darkness reigned supreme save for a thin streak of light which gleamed thin and weird from beneath the study door darkness itself fought with absolute stillness lydie came forward walking as if in her sleep  she called to milors valet achille but only in a whisper lest milor from within should hear then as there was no sound no movement she called once more  achille is milor still awake achille are you here  she had raised her voice a little thinking the man might be asleep but no sound answered her save from outside the cry of a bird frightened by some midnight prowler  then she walked up to the door there behind it in that inner sanctum hung with curtains of dull gold the man still sat whom she had so often so determinedly wronged and who had wounded her tonight with a cruelty and a surety of hand which had left her broken of spirit bruised of heart a suffering and passionate woman she put her hand on the knob of the door nothing stirred within milor was writing mayhap perhaps he had dropped asleep and gaston preparing to ride to le havre in order to send the swiftest ship to do its deed of treachery  no no anything but that  at this moment lydie had nerved herself to endure every rebuff to suffer any humiliation to throw herself at her husbands feet embrace his knees if need be beg pray and entreat for money for help anything that might even now perhaps avert the terrible catastrophe  boldly now she knocked at the door  milor milor open    it is i     lydie      then as there was no answer from within she knocked louder still  milor milor awake milor in the name of heaven i entreat you to let me speak with you  at first she had thought that he slept then that obstinate resentment caused him to deny her admittance she tried to turn the knob of the door but it did not yield  milor milor she cried again and then again  naught but silence was the reply  excitement grew upon her now a febrile nervousness which caused her to pull at the lock to bruise her fingers against the gilt ornaments of the panel whilst her voice hoarse and broken with sobs rent with its echoes the peace and solemnity of the night  milor milor  she had fallen on her knees exhausted mentally and physically the blood beating against her temples until the blackness around her seemed to have become a vivid red in her ear was a sound like that of a tempestuous sea breaking against gigantic rocks with voices calling at intervals voices of dying men loudly accusing her of treachery the minutes were speeding by anon would come the dawn when gaston would to horse bearing the hideous message which would mean her lifelong infamy and the death of those who trusted her  milor milor awake she now put her lips to the keyhole breathing the words through the tiny orifice hoping that he would hear gaston will start at dawn    they will send le monarque and she is ready to put to sea    milor your friend is in deadly peril    i entreat you to let me enter  she beat her hands against the door wounding her delicate flesh she was not conscious of what she was doing a mystic veil divided her reasoning powers from that terrible mental picture which glowed before her through the bloodred darkness the lonely shore the angry sea the french ship le monarque flying the pennant of traitors  then suddenly an astonished and deeply horrified voice broke in upon her ears  madame la marquise in the name of heaven madame la marquise  she heard quick footsteps behind her and left off hammering against the door left off screaming and moaning but she had not the power to raise herself from her knees  madame la marquise came in respectful yet frightened accents will madame la marquise deign to allow me to raise heri fear madame la marquise is not well  she recognized the voice of achille milors valet yet it never entered her mind to feel ashamed at being found by a lacquey thus kneeling before her husbands door the worthy achille was very upset etiquette forbade him to touch madame la marquise but could he leave her there in that position he advanced timidly his behaviour was superlatively correct even in this terrible emergency and there was nothing in his deferential attitude to indicate that he thought anything abnormal had occurred  i thought i heard madame la marquise calling he said and i thought perhaps madame la marquise would wish to speak with milor     but at the word she quickly interrupted him rising to her feet even as she spoke  yes yes     milor    i do wish to speak with him    open the door achille    quick     the door is locked on the outside madame la marquise but i have the key by me said m achille gravely i had fortunately recollected that mayhap milor had forgotten to put out the lights and would in any case have come to see that all was safe    if madame la marquise will deign to permit me     it was a little difficult to reconcile utmost respect of movement and demeanour with the endeavour to open the door against which madame la marquise was still standing however everything that was deferential and correct was possible to monsieur achille he fitted the key in the lock and the next moment had thrown the door wide open whilst he himself stood immediately aside to enable madame la marquise to enter  four candles were burning in one of the candelabra milor had evidently forgotten to extinguish them everything else in the room was perfectly tidy on the secrétaire there were two or three heavy books similar to those monsieur durand usually carried about with him when he had to interview milor also the inkpot and sandwell with two or three quills methodically laid on a silver tray one window must have been open behind the drawn curtains for the heavy damask hangings waved gently in the sudden current of air caused by the opening of the door the candles too flickered weirdly in the draught in the centre of the room was the armchair on which lydie had sat a while ago the cushion of red embroidery which milor had put to her back and below the little footstool covered in gold brocade on which her foot had rested    a while ago  and beside the secrétaire his own empty chair and on the table the spot where his hand had rested white and slightly tremulous when she proffered her selfaccusation  milor she murmured inquiringly turning glowing eyes dilated with the intensity of disappointment and despair on the impassive face of achille milor     where is milor  milor has been gone some little time madame la marquise replied achille  gone whither  i do not know madame la marquise    milor did not tell me    two gentlemen called to see him at about ten oclock as soon as they had gone milor asked for his outdoor clothes and hector booted and spurred him    whilst i dressed his hair and tied his cravat    milor has been gone about half an hour i think  enough    that will do  that is all that she contrived to say this final disappointment had been beyond the endurance of her nerves physically now she completely broke down a mist gathered before her eyes the candles seemed to flicker more and more weirdly until their lights assumed strange ghoullike shapes which drew nearer to her and nearer faces in the gloom grinned at her and seemed to mock the walls of the room closed in around her her senses reeled her very brain felt as if it throbbed with pain and without a cry or moan only with one long sigh of infinite weariness she sank lifeless to the ground     chapter xxxii  the dawn   m le comte de stainville only shrugged his shoulders when m de belleisle and young de lugeac brought him milors reply  bah he said with a sneer hell have to fight me later on or ill hound him out of france never fear gentlemen well have our meed of fun very soon  on the whole gaston was not sorry that this stupid socalled affair of honour would not force him to rise before dawn he had no special illwill against le petit anglais for whom he had always tried to cultivate a modicum of contempt he had not always succeeded in this praiseworthy endeavour for milor as a rule chose to ignore m de stainville as far as and often more than courtesy permitted  the two men had not often met since the memorable evening when milor snatched the golden prize which gaston had so clumsily cast aside their tastes were very dissimilar and so was their entourage milor was officially considered to belong to the queens set whilst gaston clung to the more entertaining company of madame de pompadour and her friends nor had m de stainville had the bad grace to interfere with his wifes obvious predeliction for lord eglintons company  the memorable day which was just drawing to its close had seen many changeschanges that were almost upheavals of old traditions and of habitual conditions of court life gaston had deceived and then hideously outraged the woman whom long ago he had already wronged a year ago she had humiliated him had snatched from him the golden prize which his ambition had coveted and which she made him understand that he could not obtain without her today had been his hour he had dragged her down to the very mire in which he himself had grovelled he had laid her pride to dust and shaken the pinnacle of virtue and integrity on which she stood  that she had partly revenged herself by a public affront against irène mattered little to gaston he had long ago ceased to care for la belle brune de bordeaux the beautiful girl who had enchained his early affections and thereby become a bar to his boundless ambition the social ostracismapplicable only by a certain set of puritanical dévotesand the disdain of queen marie leszcynska which his wife might have to endure would be more than compensated by the gratitude of pompadour and of his majesty himself for the services rendered by gaston in the cause of the proffered english millions  but for him the expedition against the stuart prince could never have been undertaken at any rate it had been fraught with great difficulties delays and subsequent failure would probably have resulted gaston de stainville felt sure that in the future he could take care that the king should never forget his services  after his wifes indiscreet outburst he feared once more for the success of the plan remembering lydies reliance on le monarque and her commander he declared himself prepared to start for le havre immediately he was quite ready to display that endurance and enthusiasm in the breakneck ride across the fields of normandy which lydie had thought to find in him for the good of a noble cause  gaston de stainvilles pockets were always empty the two millions which the king had promised him would be more than welcome his majesty had even offered to supplement these by an additional half million if le monarque sailed out of le havre before sunset on the morrow  the incident of the duel with milor would have delayed matters andwho knowsperhaps have made that pleasant half million somewhat problematical therefore gaston received the news of the refusal with a sardonic grin but not with real impatience  he felt really no great illwill toward lord eglinton but for that incident when he was forcibly made to measure his length on the parquet floor gaston would have willingly extended a condescending hand to the man whose wife he had so infamously wronged  the incident itself had angered him only to the extent of desiring to inflict a physical punishment on milor sure of his own wrist as the most perfect swordsman in france he had fondled the thought of slicing off a finger or two mayhap a thumb from the hand of le petit anglais or better still of gashing milors face across nose and cheek so as to mar for ever those good looks which the ladies of versailles had so openly admired  well all these pleasant little occurrences could happen yet m de stainville was quite sure that on his return from le havre he could provoke the englishman to fight milor might be something of a cowardobviously he was one else he had accepted so mild a challengebut he could not always refuse to fight in the face of certain provocation which would mean complete social ruin if disregarded  the hour was late by the time gaston de stainville had bade goodnight to belleisle and lugeac together the three men had drunk copiously had laughed much and sneered continually at the pusillanimous englishman  this comes of allowing all these aliens to settle amongst us said de lugeac impudently soon there will be neither honour nor chivalry left in france  whereupon de stainville and belleisle both of whom bore ancient aristocratic names bethought themselves that it was time to break up the little party and to turn their backs on this arrogant guttersnipe  the three men separated at midnight de lugeac had a room in the palace and stainville and belleisle repaired to their respective lodgings in the little town itself  soon after dawn gaston de stainville was on horseback he started alone for that extra half million was dangling before his eyes and he was afraid that companionshipeven that of a servantmight cause unlookedfor delay he had a hundred and eighty leagues by road and field to cover and soon the day would become very hot he meant to reach le havre before five oclock in the afternoon within an hour after that he could have handed over his instructions to captain barre and seen le monarque unfurl her sails and glide gracefully out of the harbour an argosy anon to be laden with golden freight  the little town of versailles had scarce opened its eyes to the new day when the clink of a horses hoofs on her cobble stones roused her from her morning sleep  a few farmers bringing in their produce from their gardens gazed with keen interest at the beautiful animal and her gallant rider the hour was indeed early for such a fine gentleman to be about  soon the rough paving of the town was left behind the sun who at first had hidden his newlyawakened glory behind a bank of clouds now burnt his way through these heavy veils and threw across the morning sky living flames of rose of orange and of vivid gold and tipped the towers and spires of distant paris with innumerable tongues of fire  far away the clock of notre dame tolled the hour of five gaston cursed inwardly it was later than he thought later than he had intended to make a start that business of the duel had kept him up longer than usual and he had felt lazy and tired in the morning now he would have to make top speed and he did not feel as alert nor so well prepared for the fatigues of a long days ride as he would have been two years ago before the enervating dissipations of court life at versailles had undermined the activity of his youth  fortunately the ground was soft and dry the air keen and pure and gaston spurred his horse to a canter across the fields     chapter xxxiii  the ride   it is one hundred and fifty leagues from versailles to the harbour of le havre as the crow flies one hundred and eighty most like by road and across fields  gaston had twelve hours in which to cover the ground a good horse and the enthusiasm born of empty pockets when two and a half million livres loom temptingly at the end of the journey  the fields after the corn harvest were excellent for a gallop yielding just sufficiently to the mares hoofs to give her a pleasant foothold but not in any way spongy with good stubble to give resistance and the sandy soil below to prevent the slightest jar riding under such conditions in the cool hours of the morning was distinctly pleasant  gaston reached nantes soon after seven having covered close on forty leagues of his journey without unduly tiring belle amie he was a good rider and knew how to ease her and there was arab blood in her she made light of the work and enjoyed her gallops being of the breed that never shows fatigue own daughter to jedran who had carried maurice de saxe on his famous ride from paris to saargemund three hundred leagues in eighteen hours  at nantes stainville partook of a frugal breakfast and belle amie had a rest and a mouthful of corn he was again to horse within half an hour crossing the seine here by the newly constructed stone bridge thence on toward elboeuf by ten oclock the sun was high in the heavens and was pouring heat like molten lead down on horse and rider progress had become much slower several halts had to be made at tiny wayside inns for a cooling drink and a rub down for belle amie the enjoyment had gone out of the ride it was heavy arduous work beside which despatch riding with message of life and death was mere childs play  but this was not a case of life and death but of that which was far dearer to gaston than life without it money money at the end of it all even if belle amie dropped on the roadside and he himself had to cover the rest of the distance on foot an extra half million if la monarque set sail before sunset today  at rouen horse and rider had to part company belle amie who had covered close on a hundred leagues and most of it in the full glare of the midday sun wanted at least a couple of hours rest if she was to get to le havre at all and this her rider was unwilling to give her at the posting hostelry which stands immediately at the rear of the cathedral stainville bargained for a fresh horse and left belle amie in charge of mine host to be tended and cared for against his return probably on the morrow  here too he partook of a light midday meal whilst the horse was being got ready for him a good solid normandy mare this time a perfect contrast to belle amie short and thick in the legs with a broad crupper and a sleepy look in her eye but she was a comfortable mount as gaston soon found out with a smooth even canter and though her stride was short she got over the ground quickly enough it was still very hot but the roads beyond rouen were sandy and light the lanes were quite stoneless and shaded by tall trees the normandy mare settled down along them to an easy amble she had not the spirit of belle amie but she made up in stolidity what she had lacked in swiftness gastons first impatience at the slowness of her gait soon yielded to content for she needed no checking and urging being uselesssince she could go no fasterthe rider was soon able to let his mind rest and even to sink into semisomnolence trusting himself to the horse entirely  at halfpast five the towers of notre dame du havre were in sight an hour later than gaston had dared to hope but still far from the hour of sunset and if he could infuse a sufficiency of enthusiasm into the commander of le monarque the gallant ship could still negotiate the harbour before dusk the tide being favourable and be out in the open ere the first stars appeared in the heavens  the little seaport town whose tortuous unpaved and narrow streets were ankle deep in slimy mud in spite of the persistent heat and dryness of the day appeared to gaston like the golden city of his dreams on his left the wide mouth of the seine with her lonely shore beyond was lost in the gathering mist which rose rapidly now after the intense heat of the day on his right a few isolated houses were dotted here and there built of mud thatched and plastered over and with diminutive windows not more than a few inches square because of the tax which was heavy they testified to the squalor and misery of their inhabitants a few families earning an uncertain livelihood with their nets soon along the length of the river as it gradually widened toward its mouth a few isolated craft came to view fishing boats these mostly with here and there a graceful brigantine laden with timber and a few barges which did a precarious coastingtrade with salted fish and the meagre farm produce of the environs  gaston de stainville took no heed of these though the sceneif somewhat mournful and desolatehad a certain charm of rich colouring and hazy outline in the glow of the afternoon sun the heat had altogether abated and the damp which rose from the spongy soil peculiar to the bed of the river was already making itself felt gaston shivered beneath the light cloth coat which he had donned in the morning in view of the fatigues of a hot summers day his eyes peered anxiously ahead and to the left of him his mare who had borne him stolidly for over five hours was quite ready to give way there was no arab blood in her to cause her to go on until she dropped she had settled down to a very slow jogtrot which was supremely uncomfortable to the rider whose tired back could scarcely endure this continuous jar fortunately the straggling outlying portions of the townlet were already far behind the little mud houses appeared quite frequently now and from them wizened figures came out to the doorway women in ragged kirtles and children halfnaked but for a meagre shift gazed wideeyed at the mudbespattered cavalier and his obviously wornout mount  from the fine old belfry the chime had long tolled the half hour gaston vainly tried to spur the mare to a final effort she had reached a stage of fatigue when blows would not have quickened her steps whilst her rider roused from his own somnolent weariness was suddenly alert and eager goal was indeed in sight the mud huts even had been left behind and one or two stone houses testified to the importance of the town and the wellbeing of its inhabitants the first inna miserable wooden construction quite uninviting even after a days ridehad already been passed ahead was the church of notre dame the fish market and the residence of the governor beyond were some low wooden buildings suggestive of barracks whilst the seine ever widening until her further shore was finally lost in the mist now showed an evervarying panorama of light and heavy craft upon her breast brigantines and fishing boats and the newfashioned topsail schooners and far ahead majestic and sedate one or two threedeckers of his majestys own navy  gaston strained his eyes wondering which of these was le monarque     chapter xxxiv  le monarque   a few minutes later he had reached the principal inn of the town lauberge des trois matelots immediately opposite the rough wooden jetty and from the bay window of which gaston immediately thought that a magnificent view must be obtainable of the stretch of the river and the english channel far away  he turned into the gate the house itself was low onestoried only and built entirely of wood round a central courtyard which was as deep in slime as the rest of the town of le havre opposite gaston as he rode in were some primitive stablings and on his right some equally primitive open sheds the remaining two sides apparently stood for the main portion of the building as several doors gave upon a covered verandah to which some four or five steps gave access  a wearyeyed ostler in a blue blouse and huge wooden sabots from which bunches of straw protruded at the heel came leisurely forward when gaston drew rein he seemed to have emerged from nowhere in particular risen out of the mud mayhap but he held the mare none too clumsily when m le comte dismounted  the next moment a portly figure appeared in one of the doorways under the verandah clad precisely like the ostler save for the gorgeous scarlet kerchief round the gargantuan neck whilst another equally bright in hue peeped out of the pocket of the blouse  above the scarlet neckerchief a round face red as a normandy apple was turned meditatively on the mudstained cavalier whilst a pair of small beady eyes blinked drowsily at the afternoon sun  see that the mare gets a good rub down at once then a feed of corn with a dash of eaudevie in it a litter of straw and a drink of water she is done to death said gaston peremptorily to the sleepylooking ostler ill be round in a quarter of an hour to see if she is comfortable and give you a taste of my whip if she is not  the ostler did not reply neither did he touch his forelock in token of obedience he smothered a yawn and with slow dragging steps he led the overtired mare toward the rough stabling in the rear gaston then turned toward the verandah and to the few wooden steps which led up to the doorway wherein the applefaced man still stood with his hands behind him drowsily blinking at the unexpected visitor  are you the innkeeper asked gaston curtly  yes msieu replied the other with great deliberation  i shall want a good room for the night and a wellcooked supper see to it at once  mine hosts placidity gave way somewhat at these peremptory orders which were accompanied by a loud and significant tapping of a whip across a riding boot but the placidity did not yield to eagerness only to a certain effort at sulky protest as gaston having mounted the steps now stood facing him in his own doorway  my house is full msieu    he began  i am on the kings business shouted gaston now with angry impatience so none of this nonsense understand  evidently mine host not only understood but thought it best to obey with as good grace as he could muster he stepped aside still somewhat grudgingly and allowed gaston de stainville to enter but he did not condescend to bow nor did he bid msieu the visitor welcome in his house  gaston however was not minded to notice the fat mans sulky temper the moodiness of provincial innkeepers had become proverbial in france they seemed to look upon all guests who brought money into their pockets as arrogant intruders and treated them accordingly  see to a decent supper at once repeated de stainville now with that peremptoriness which he knew would alone ensure civility and send a wench into my room to see that it is properly aired and that clean linen is put upon the bed  the warning was no doubt necessary judging by the appearance of the room in which gaston now found himself it was low and stuffy in the extreme he was conscious of nothing else for the moment as only two diminutive windows hermetically closed admitted a tiny modicum of light through four dirty and thick panes of rough glass on the left there was a door evidently leading to another and larger room from whichas this door was ajarcame the sound of voices and also suffocating gusts of very pungent tobacco  obviously there was some light and air in that further room whereas here it seemed to gaston as if only cavedwellers and moles could live and breathe  you had best serve my supper in there he said pointing with his riding whip toward that halfopen door and without waiting for the protests which mine host was obviously preparing himself to make he strode boldly toward it and pushed it fully open  the place was certainly very different to the one which he had just quitted the floor was strewn with clean white sand and though the air was thick with the fumes of that same pungent tobacco which already had offended gastons nostrils it was not hopelessly unpleasant as the deep and square oriel window at the extreme end of this long low room was wide open freely admitting the sweet salt breeze which blew straight from the english channel affording tooas gaston had originally surmiseda magnificent view of a panorama which embraced the mouth of the seine the rough harbour and tiny jetty with the many small craft lying at anchor on the calm bosom of the river and the graceful schooners and majestic threedeckers further away all lit by the slanting rays of the slowlysinking sun  gaston without hesitation walked straight up to a bench and trestle table which to his pleasurable surprise he found was unoccupied these were just inside the bay of the window and he deliberately placed his hat coat and whip upon the table in token that he took possession of it then he once more turned to mine host who much torn between respect for a man who travelled on the kings businessa nobleman mayhapand pride of peasant at contact with an unwelcome visitor had slowly followed gaston lolling with that peculiar gait which betrays the exsailor whilst firm if deferential protest was writ all over his rubicund countenance  jean marie palisson was born at le havre he had been armateur ere the welcome death of a relative put him in possession of the most frequented inn in the town together with a very comfortable competence and the best furnished cellars this side of rouen he greatly resented the appearance of a stranger in the midst of his usual habitués which distinguished circle embraced m le général commanding the fortress m the military governor of the port m the civil governor of the town mm the commanders on his majestys ships not to speak of m le maire and m le député of the parliament of rouen in fact all the notabilities and dignitaries of the town and the harbour  these gentlemen were wont to assemble in this the best room of les trois matelots at five oclock lheure de lapéritif when eaudevie punch or mulled wine were consumed in order to coax recalcitrant appetites to a pleasurable anticipation of supper it was an understood thing between the worthy jean marie palisson and his distinguished customers that no strangers were to be admitted within this inner sanctum save by the vote of the majority nor had it ever occurred before that any one had thus forced an entrance past that magic door which mine host guarded with jealous care  now when gaston thus arrogantly took possession of the best table in the best portion of the best room in les trois matelots jean marie was so taken aback and so awed by the masterfulness which could rise to such complete disregard of the etiquette pertaining to the social circles of le havre that he found himself unable to do aught but shrug his broad shoulders at intervals and blink his beady eyes in token of helpless distress  and this in spite of the fact that several pairs of eyebrows were lifted in token of pained surprise  gaston was equally unconscious of the disapproval which his entry had evoked as of jean maries want of alacrity in his service when he entered he noted that the several occupants of the room were gentlemen like himself and he always felt thoroughly at home and unabashed amongst his kind as for the landlord of a tumbledown provincial inn gaston thought him quite unworthy of close attention he sat himself down on the edge of the table dangling one wellbooted leg with easy nonchalance and from this elevated position he surveyed leisurely and with no small amount of impertinence the company there assembled he had scarce time to note the scowling looks of haughty disapproval which were levelled at him from every side when the door was vigorously pushed open and an aggressively cheerful young man loud of voice jocose of manner boisterously entered the room  par ma foi my worthy jean marie he said in stentorian tones is this the latest fashion in le havre the host not at the door to receive his guests    hé    he added suddenly realizing the presence of a stranger in the room whom have we here  but already at the first words uttered by the newcomer gaston de stainville had jumped to his feet and as soon as the young man ceased talking he went forward to greet him  none other than gaston de stainville my good mortémar and pleased indeed to look into a friends face  gaston de stainville exclaimed the other gaily par tous les diables but this is a surprise who would have thought to see you in this damned and godforsaken hole  the kings business my good mortémar said gaston and if youll forgive me ill see to it at once and then well sup together eh    palsambleu and i who thought id die of ennui during this enforced halt on this lonely shore  ennui perish the thought gentlemen added the young comte de mortémar with a graceful flourish of the arm which embraced the entire company allow me to present unto you the most accomplished cavalier of the day whom i have the honour to call my friend and whom i hope we will all have the honour to call our guest tonight m le comte gaston amédé de stainville  gaston had no cause now to complain of want of welcome once the stranger duly accredited and presented by a member of the intimate circle he was cheered to the echo every one rose to greet him many pressed forward to shake him by the hand the presence of a cavalier of versailles with all the court gossip the little intrigues the laughable anecdotes which he would of necessity bring with him was indeed a veritable godsend to the little official world of le havre who spent most of its life in mortal ennui  as for thee my good jean marie now interposed mortémar with mock severity let me tell thee at once that if within an hour this table here doth not groan under the weight of the finest and best cooked capon that normandy can produce neither i nor these gentlemen here will eer darken thy doors again what say you gentlemen  there was loudly expressed assent accompanied by much laughter and vigorous clinking of pewter mugs against the deal tables  and in the meanwhile continued mortémar who seemed to have taken the lead in this general desire to bid the visitor a substantial welcome a bowl of punch with half a glass of eaudevie and a dozen prunes soaked in kirsch therein never fear friend stainville he added slapping gaston boisterously on the shoulder i tell you mine host knows how to brew a bowl of punch which will send you reeling under one of his tables in less than half an hour  a round of applause greeted this cheerful sally  nay in that case said gaston on whom the strenuous fatigues of the day were telling severely after the preliminary excitement of arrival ill to my business ere your good cheer friend render me quite helpless  perish the thought of business retorted mortémar your head in a bucket of cold water after the punch and you can meet the most astute notary on even ground and beat him at his own game the punch knave he shouted to the fat landlord the punch this instant m le comte de stainville is wearied and is waiting for refreshment  but gastons frame of mind was far too grave his purpose far too important to allow himself to be led into delaying business with captain barre a moment longer than was necessary mortémar and his convivial friends could not know that half a million livres would be the price paid for that bowl of punch since it might mean an hours carousing and the full of dusk before le monarque received her orders he was deadly fatigued undoubtedly faint too from the heat and want of proper food but when money was at stake gaston de stainville always displayed an enthusiasm and an amount of courageous endurance worthy of a better cause  a thousand thanks my good mortémar and to you all gentlemen he now said courteously but firmly do not i beseech you think me churlish if i must momentarily refuse your kind hospitality one glass of eaudevie to give me a modicum of strength and i must to my business first gentlemen i see by your coats that most of you serve the king in some capacity or other you know as well as i do that the laws which govern the kings commands cannot be broken i will not be gone long half an hour at most after that i am at your commands and will be the most grateful as well as the most joyous of you all  well spoken friend stainville declared mortémar and you jean marie serve a small refreshment to m le comte immediately nay friend he added pleasantly i fear i have been importunate    twas the joy of seeing so elegant a cavalier grace this unhallowed spot  every one nodded approval as gaston had surmised there were soldiers sailors there present all of whom understood duty and obedience to the kings commands  perhaps some of us could be of assistance to m le comte de stainville suggested a grave gentleman who wore his majestys colours if he is a stranger at le havre he might be glad of help  indeed well said spoke another could one of us here accompany you anywhere monsieur le comte  i am more than grateful gentlemen replied gaston to whom the host was even now offering a cup of mulled wine he drank the liquor at one draught then set down the cup ere he spoke further  and gladly will i accept these kindly offers of assistance he now said i am indeed a stranger here and did feel doubtful how i could most speedily accomplish my business i must have speech with captain barre gentlemen commanding his majestys ship le monarque and that with as little delay as possible     to his intense astonishment he was interrupted by a ringing laugh from his friend mortémar  nay then my good stainville said the lively young man youll have plenty of time for that bowl of punch aye and for getting right royally drunk and fully sober again if your business is with captain barre  what do you mean queried gaston with a sudden frown  le monarque sailed out of le havre an hour ago methinks you can still see her sails against the evening sun  and the young man pointed through the open window out toward the west mechanically gastons eyes followed the direction in which his friend pointed there far away in the mistladen distance a graceful threedecker with sails unfurled was distinctly visible in the glow of the setting sun she was gaily riding the waves the soft southeasterly breeze having carried her swiftly and lightly already far out to sea  gaston felt an awful dizziness in his head an icy sweat broke out upon his brow he passed a hand across his eyes for he did not feel that he could trust them  that is not le monarque he murmured  by my faith but it is said mortémar a little perturbed for he had not thought to be conveying evil news i was bidding her captain godspeed myself little more than an hour ago a gallant sailor and a personal friend he added and he seemed mighty glad to get on the way  whither was he bound asked gaston mechanically  nay that i do not know barre had received secret orders only an hour before he started     but now gaston felt his senses reeling  she must be stopped    she must be stopped he shouted wildly i have orders for her    she must be stopped at any cost  and breaking through the compact group of his newly found friends he made a wild dash for the door  but the excitement the terrible keenness of this disappointment had been too much for him after the strenuous fatigues and the overpowering heat of the day the dizziness turned to an intolerable feeling of sickness the walls of the room spun round and round him he felt as if a stunning blow had been dealt him on the head and with a final shriek of stop her he staggered and would have fallen headlong but that a pair of willing arms were there to break his fall     chapter xxxv  the stranger   it was m des couturesa middleaged man military governor of le havrewho had caught gaston de stainville in his arms when the latter all but lost consciousness a dozen willing pairs of hands were now ready to administer to the guests comforts from the loosening of his cravat to the pulling off of his heavy riding boots  the mulled wine was too heavy for him said m le maire valledieu no doubt he had been fasting some hours and his stomach refused to deal with it  tell the kitchen wench to hurry with that supper jean marie said mortémar to mine host hell be himself again when he has eaten  if theres a plate of soup ready bring that added m valledieu anythings better than an empty paunch  i thank you friends now murmured stainville feebly i fear me i must have turned giddy    the heat and     he was recovering quickly enough it had been mere dizziness caused by fatigue and then that awful blow which had staggered him physically as well as mentally his newly found friends had dragged him back to the table close to the open window the keen seabreeze quickly restored him to complete consciousness  already he had turned his head slowly round to watch that fast disappearing threedecker gleaming golden now in the distant haze  his argosy which he had hoped to see returning from her voyage laden with golden freight somehow as first the hulk and then the graceful sails were gradually merged into the western glow gaston knewby one of those inexplainable yet absolutely unerring instincts which baffle the materialistthat all hopes of those coveted millions were vanishing as surely as did the ship now from before his gaze he was still weak in body as well as in mind and it was as if in a dream that he listened to de mortémars carelessly given explanations of the event which meant the wreckage of so many fondly cherished hopes  captain barre broke his fast in this very room this morning said the young man lightly several of these gentlemen here as well as myself had speech with him he had no idea then that he would have to start on a voyage quite so soon he left here at eleven oclock and went back to his ship an hour later when i was strolling along the shore i met him again he seemed in a vast hurry and told me in a few curt words that le monarque had received orders to be under way as soon as the tide permitted  you did not ask him whither the ship was bound queried gaston speaking hoarsely like a man who has been drinking  he could not tell me replied the other her orders were secret  do you know who was the bearer of these secret orders  no but i heard later that a stranger had ridden into le havre at midday today his marea beautiful creature so i understanddropped not far from here she had been ridden to her death poor thing and her rider so they say was near to dropping too  i saw him here interposed a young soldier he was just outside that godforsaken hole le gros normand and politely asked me if it were the best inn in le havre  i hope you told him it was said des coutures with a growl we want no stranger here  nor do we want le havre to have a reputation for dirt and discomfort corrected m le maire  and i certainly could not allow a gentlemenfor he was thatill lay any wager on it with any oneto be made superlatively uncomfortable on the broken beds of le gros normand asserted the young soldier hotly  you advised him to come here gasped mortémar with genuine horror he was the chief of that clique which desired to exclude with utmost rigour from the sacred precincts of les trois matelots every stranger not properly accredited  ma foi what would you have me do retorted the other sulkily  you did quite right lieutenant le tellier rejoined m le maire who was jealous of the reputation of le havre gentlemen must be under no misapprehension with regard to the refinement and hospitality of this town  the entrance of mine host carrying a steaming bowl of soup broke up the conversation for awhile jean marie was followed by a fat and joviallooking wench who quickly spread a white cloth for monsieur le comtes supper and generally administered to his wants  de mortémar général des coutures and m le maire valledieu had constituted themselves the nominal hosts of gaston they too sat round the table and anon when jean marie brought huge jugs of red wine they fell to and entertained their guest plying him with meat and drink  this broke up the company somewhat the other gentlemen had withdrawn with all the respect which frenchmen always feel for the solemnity of a meal they had once more assumed their old places at the various tables about the room but no one thought yet of returning home lheure de lapéritif was being indefinitely prolonged  conversation naturally drifted back again and again to le monarque and her secret orders every one scented mystery for was it not strange that a noble cavalier like monsieur le comte de stainville should have ridden all the way from versailles on the kings business in order to have speech with the commander of one of his majestys own ships only to find that he had been forestalled the good ship had apparently received orders which the king knew naught about else his majesty had not sent monsieur de stainville all this way on a fools errand  eager prying eyes watched him as he began to eat and drink dreamily at first almost drowsily obviously he was absorbed in thought he too must be racking his brains as to who the stranger might be who had so unexpectedly forestalled him  his three genial hosts plied him continually with wine and soon the traces of fatigue in him began to yield to his usual alertness and vigour the wellcooked food the rich liquors were putting life back into his veins and with renewed life came a seething an ungovernable wrath  he had lost a fortune the gratitude of the king the goodwill of pompadour two and a half millions of money through the interference of a stranger  he tried to think to imagine to argue with himself treacherous and false himself he at once suspected treachery he imagined that some sycophant hanging to the pompadours skirts had succeeded in winning her good graces sufficiently to be allowed to do this errand for her instead of himself  or had the king played him false and sent another messenger to do the delicate business and to share in the spoils  or had lydie     but no this was impossible what could she have done at a late hour of the night how could she have found a messenger whom she could trust when earlier in the day she had herself admitted that there was no one in whom she could confide and thus turned almost unwillingly to the friend of her childhood  jean maries favoured customers sat at the various tables sipping their eaudevie some had produced dice and cards whilst others were content to loll about still hoping to hear piquant anecdotes of that distant court of versailles toward which they all sighed so longingly  but the elegant guest was proving a disappointment even after the second bumper of wine gaston de stainvilles tongue had not loosened he was speculating on the identity of that mysterious stranger and would not allow his moodiness to yield to the joys of good cheer tomorrow he would have to ride back to versailles hardly more leisurely than he had come for he must find out the truth of how he came to be forestalled but he could not start before dawn even though fiery impatience and wrath burned in his veins  to all inquisitive queries and pointed chaff he replied with a sulky growl and very soon the delight of meeting an interesting stranger gave place to irritation at his sullen mood he was drinking heavily and did not seem cheerful in his cups and anon even mortémars boisterous hilarity gave way before his persistent gloom  after an hour or two the company started yawning every one had had enough of this silent and illtempered stranger who not only had brought no new life and animation into the sleepy town but was ill repaying the lavish hospitality of les trois matelots by his reticence and sulky humour  one by one now the habitués departed nodding genially to mine host as they settled for their consommations and bidding as hearty a goodnight to the stranger as their disappointment would allow  de mortémar and valledieu had tried to lure m le comte de stainville to hazard or even to a more sober game of piquet but the latter had persistently refused and sat with legs stretched out before him hands buried in breeches pockets his head drooping on his chest and a meditative scowl between his eyes  the wine had apparently quite dulled his brilliant wit and now he only replied in curt monosyllables to queries addressed directly to him  anon valledieu and old général de coutures pleading the ties of family and home begged to be excused now de mortémar alone was left to entertain his surly guest bored to distraction and dislocating his jaws in the vain efforts which he made to smother persistent yawns  it was then close on halfpast seven the final glory of the setting sun had yielded to the magic wand of night which had changed the vivid crimson and orange first to delicate greens and mauves and then to the deep the gorgeous blue of a summers evening sky the stars one by one gleamed in the firmament and soon the crescent moon chaste and cold added her incomparable glory to the beauty and the silent peace of the night  tiny lights appeared at masthead or prow of the many craft lying at anchor in the roadsteads and from far away through the open window there came wafted on the sweet salt breeze the melancholy sound of an old normandy ditty sung by a pair of youthful throats  fatigue and gloom had oppressed gaston at first now it was unconquerable rage seething and terrible which caused him to remain silent de mortémar was racking his brains for an excuse to break up this wearisome têteàtête without overstepping the bounds of goodbreeding whilst cursing his own impetuosity which had prompted him to take this surly guest under his wing  jean marie now entered with the candles causing a welcome diversion he placed one massive pewter candelabrum on the table occupied by gaston and de mortémar the other he carried to the further end of the room having placed that down too he lolled back toward de mortémar his rubicund face looked troubled great beads of perspiration stood out upon his forehead and his fat fingers wandered along the velvety surface of his round closelycropped crown  msieu le comte    he began hesitatingly  what is it asked mortémar smothering a yawn  a stranger msieu le comte    stammered jean marie  what another    i mean added the young man with a nervous little laugh feeling that the sudden exclamation of undisguised annoyance was not altogether courteous to his guest i mean a    an    an    unknown stranger    altogether different to m le comte de stainville of course  a stranger msieu repeated jean marie curtly he came at midday     and you told us nothing about him  i did not think it was necessary nor that the stranger would trouble msieu le comte he asked for a clean room and a bed and said nothing about supper at the time    he seemed very tired and gave me a couple of louis just if as they were half livres  no doubt twas the stranger with whom lieutenant tellier had speech outside le gros normand suggested de mortémar  mayhap mayhap rejoined jean marie thoughtfully i took him up a bowl of sack and half a cold capon but what he wanted most was a large washtub and plenty of water    it seems he needed a bath  then he was english commented mortémar decisively  but at these words gaston who had been listening with half an ear to mine hosts explanations roused himself from his heavy torpor  the stranger who had forestalled him and sent le monarque on her secret voyage today was english  then it was     where is that stranger now he demanded peremptorily  thats just it msieu le comte replied jean marie obstinately ignoring gaston and still addressing de mortémar he slept all the afternoon now he wants some supper he throws louis about as if they were dirt and i cant serve him in there he added with unanswerable logic and pointing to the stuffy room in the rear  pardi    began mortémar  but gaston de stainville was fully alert now with sudden vigour he jumped to his feet and brought his fist crashing down on the table so that the candelabrum the mugs and decanters of wine shook under the blow  i beseech you friend admit the stranger into this room without delay he said loudly ma foi you have found me dull and listless illhumoured in spite of your lavish hospitality i swear to you by all the devils in hell that youll not yawn once for the next halfhour and that gaston de stainville and the mysterious stranger who thwarts his will and forestalls his orders will afford you a measure of amusement such as youll never forget  his face was flushed and his eyes somewhat hazy from the copiousness of his libations had an evil leer in them and an inward glow of deadly hate there was no longer any weakness nor yet illhumour visible in his attitude his hands were clenched one resting on the table the other roughly pushing back the chair on which he had been sitting  admit the stranger friend host he shouted savagely ill vouch for it that your patron will not regret his presence in this room  ma foi i trust not said a quiet voice which seemed to come suddenly from out the gloom gentlemen your servant  mortémar turned toward the door whence had proceeded that gentle courteous voice lord eglinton was standing under the lintel elegantly attired in full riding dress with top boots and closelyfitting coat he wore no sword and carried a heavy cloak on his arm  he made a comprehensive bow which included every one there present then he stepped forward into the room     chapter xxxvi  revenge   we must surmise that surprise and rage had rendered gaston speechless for the moment  of all the conjectures which had racked his brains for the past two hours none had come near this amazing reality gaston was no fool and in one vivid flash he saw before his mental vision not only his own discomfiture the annihilation of all his hopes but also the failure of king louis plans the relegation of those fifteen millions back into the pockets of his grace the duke of cumberland  that eglinton had not ridden to le havre on the kings business but on his own that he had not sent le monarque to scotland in order that he might share in those millions was of course obvious  no no it was clear enough lydie having found that gaston had failed her had turned to her husband for help and he still nominally comptrollergeneral of finance had found it quite easy to send captain barre on his way with secret orders to find charles edward stuart and ensure the safety of the jacobites at once and at any cost  milor was immensely rich that had helped him too of course bribes promises presents of money were nothing to him mentally he was weakreasoned gastons vanityand lydie had commanded him  but physically he was as strong as a horse impervious to fatigue and whilst gaston rested last night preparing for his journey le petit anglais was in the saddle at midnight and had killed a horse under him ere de stainville was midway  what king louis attitude would be over this disappointment it were premature to conjecture royal disfavour coupled with pompadours illhumour would make itself felt on innocent and guilty alike  that he himself was a ruined man and that through the interference of that weakkneed young fop whom it had been the fashion in versailles mildly to despise was the one great allabsorbing fact which seemed to turn gastons blood into living fire within his veins  and the man who had thus deliberately snatched a couple of millions or more from his grip stood there not twenty paces away calm somewhat gauche in manner yet with that certain stiff dignity peculiar to englishmen of high rank and withal apparently unconscious of the fact that the rival whom he had deprived of a fortune was in this same room with him burning with rage and thirsting for revenge  gaston watched his enemy for awhile as he now settled himself at the table with jean marie ministering obsequiously to his wants soon mine host had arranged everything to his guests liking had placed a dish of stewed veal before him a bottle of wine some nice fresh bread then retired walking backwards so wonderfully deferential was he to the man who dealt with gold as others would with tin  one grim thought had now risen in stainvilles mind the revival of a memory halffaded an insult a challenge refused by that man who had thwarted him  a coward eh  these english would not fight twas well known in battle yes but not in single combat not in a meeting twixt gentlemen after a heady bottle of wine when tempers wax hot and swords skip almost of themselves out of the scabbard  aye he would ride a hundred and eighty leagues to frustrate a plan or nathless to dip into the wellfilled coffers of the jacobite alliancesuch things were possiblebut he would not fight  gaston hugged the thought it was grim but delicious revenge bitter awful complete revenge was there quite easy of accomplishment fortune was lost to him but not revenge not before his hand had struck the cheek of his enemy  this was his right no one could blame him not even the king sworn foe of duelling though he might profess to be  a long laugh now broke from gastons burning throat was it not all ridiculous senseless and puerile  his majesty the king pompadour the duc daumont prime minister of france and he himself gaston de stainville the most ruthlessly ambitious man in the kingdom all fooled stupidly fooled and tricked by that man who was too great a coward to meet the rival whom he had insulted  at gastons laugh eglinton turned to look in his direction and his eyes met those of de mortémar fixed intently upon him  surely it is m le contrôleurgénéral said the latter jumping to his feet  he had paid no heed to his guests curious outburst of merriment putting it down as another expression of his strange humour else to the potency of jean maries wine but he had been deeply interested in the elegant figure of the stranger that perfect type of a highborn gentleman which the young man was quick enough to recognise the face the quaintly awkward manner brought back certain recollections of two days spent at the court of versailles  now when eglinton turned toward him he at once recognised the handsome face and those kind eyes which always looked grave and perfectly straight at an interlocutor  milor eglinton a thousand pardons he now said as he moved quickly across the room i had failed to recognise you at first and had little thought of seeing so great a personage in this sleepy old town  eglinton too had risen at his first words and had stepped forward with his habitual courtesy to greet the young man de mortémars hand was cordially stretched out toward him the next moment he would have clasped that of the young englishman when with one bound and a rush across the room and with one wild shout of rage gaston de stainville overtook his friend and catching hold of his arm he drew him roughly back  nay de mortémar my friend he cried loudly be warned in time lest your honest hand come in contact with that of a coward  his words echoed along the vast empty room then there was dead silence instinctively mortémar had stepped back as if he had been stung he did not of course understand the meaning of it all and was so taken aback that he could no nothing but stare amazed at the figure of the young man before him eglintons placidity had in no sense given way before the deadly insult only his face had become pale as death but the eyes still looked grave earnest and straight at his enemy  aye a coward said gaston who during these few moments of silence had fought the trembling of his limbs the quiver of his voice he saw the calm of the other man and with a mighty effort smothered the cryings of his rage leaving cool contempt free play or will you deny here before my friend le comte de mortémar who was about to touch your hand that last night having insulted me you refused to give me satisfaction coward you have no right to touch anothers hand    the hand of an honourable gentleman    coward    do you hear me ill say it againcowardand coward again ere i shout it on the housetops of versaillescowardeven now when my hand has struck your cheekcoward  how it all happened mortémar himself could not afterward have said the movement must have been extraordinarily quick for even as the last word coward rose to gastons lips it was drowned in an involuntary cry of agony whilst his hand raised ready to strike was held in a grip which indeed seemed like one of steel  tis done man tis done said the gentle perfectly even voice but in the name of heaven provoke me no further or it will be murder instead of fight there he added releasing the other mans wrist who staggered back faint and giddy with the pain tis true that i refused to meet you in combat yester een the life of my friend lonely and betrayed out there in faroff scotland had been the price of delay if i did not ride out of versailles before cockcrow but now tis another matter he added lightly and i am at your service  aye sneered gaston still writhing with pain at my service now when you hope that my broken wrist will ensure your impunity  nay sir but at your service across the width of this table responded eglinton coldly a pair of pistols one unloaded    and well both use the left hand  an exclamation of protest broke from mortémars lips  impossible     why so monsieur le comte  twere murder milor  does m le comte de stainville protest queried the other calmly  no damn you    where are the pistols  yours m le comte an you will surely you have not ridden all the way from versailles without a pair in your holster  well guessed milor quoth gaston lightly mortémar i pray you in the pocket of my coat    a pair of pistols  mortémar tried again to protest  silence said gaston savagely do you not see that i must kill him  tis obvious as the crescent moon yonder m de mortémar said eglinton with a whimsical smile i entreat you the pistols  the young man obeyed in silence he strode across the room to the place lately vacated by gaston and near which his cloak was lying close to his hat and whip mortémar groped in the pockets he found the two pistols and then rejoined the antagonists  i used one against a couple of footpads in the early dawn said gaston as he took the weapons from mortémars hands and placed them on the table  twas lucky monsieur le comte rejoined eglinton gravely then all we need do is to throw for the choice  dice said stainville curtly  on a table close by there was a dicebox left there by one of jean maries customers mortémar without a word handed it to eglinton he could not understand the placidity of the man gastons attitude was simple enough primitive animal rage blinding him to the possibility of immediate death excitement too giving him a sense of bravado an arrogant disregard of the consequences of his own provocation  eglinton was within his rights he was now the insulted party he could make his own conditions but did he wish to die or was he so supremely indifferent to life that he could view with perfect serenity that pair of pistols one of which deathdealing of a surety across a narrow table and that box of dice the arbiter of his fate  of a truth eglinton was perfectly indifferent as to the issue of the combat he did not care if he killed gaston nor did he care to live lydie hated him so what mattered if the sky was blue or if the sun ceased to shed radiance over the earth  it was the supreme indifference of a man who with life had nothing else to lose  his hand was absolutely steady as he took the dicebox and threw  blank murmured mortémar under his breath as he saw the result of the throw yet the face of milor was as impassive as before even though now by all the rules of chance gastons was the winning hand  three he said calmly as the dice once more rolled on to the table monsieur le comte the choice of weapon rests with you  once more mortémar tried to interpose this was monstrous horrible a shocking brutal murder  monsieur de stainville knows his own weapons he said impulsively he discharged one this morning and     milor should have thought of this before retorted stainville savagely  the remark did not come from me monsieur rejoined eglinton passively an you will choose your weapon i am fully satisfied  but his grave eyes found occasion to send a kindly glance of gratitude to young de mortémar the latter felt a tightening of his very heart strings he would at this moment have willingly given his fortune to avert the awful catastrophe  mortémar an you interfere said gaston divining his thoughts ill brand you as a meddler before the court of versailles an you are afraid to see bloodshed get you gone in the name of hell  by all the unwritten laws which governed such affairs of honour mortémar could not interfere he did not know the right or wrong of the original enmity between these two men but had already guessed that mere disappointment with regard to the voyage of le monarque had not been sufficient to kindle such deadly hate vaguely he surmised that somewhere in the background lurked the rustle of a silk petticoat  without the slightest hesitation now gaston took one of the pistols in his left hand his right still caused him excruciating pain and every time he felt the agony his eyes gleamed with more intense savagery the lust of a certain revenge  he had worked himself up into a passion of hate money has the power to do that sometimes that vanished hope of fortune had killed every instinct in the man save that of desire for vengeance he was sure of himself the pistols were his as de mortémar had said and he had handled them but a few hours ago he could apprise their weightloaded or unloadedand he was quite satisfied  it was hatred alone that prompted him to a final thrust a blow he thought to a dying man eglinton was as good as dead with the muzzle of a loaded pistol a foot away from his breast and an empty weapon in his own hand but his serenity irritated gaston the blood which tingled in his own veins which had rushed to his head almost obscuring his vision clamoured for a sight of a shrinking enemy not of a wooden puppet calm impassive even before certain death  the agony as he lifted the halfbroken wrist to his coat was intolerable but he almost welcomed it now for it added a strange lustful joy to the excitement of this deed his eyes glowing and restless with fumes of wine and passion of hate were fixed upon the marblelike face of his enemy then from the breastpocket of his coat he drew a packet of papers  and although he was nigh giddy with the pain in his wrist he clutched that packet tightly toyed with it for a while smoothed out the creases with a hand which shook with the intensity of his excitement the intensity of his triumph  the proofs in madame la marquise deglintons own writing that she was at one with the gang who meant to sell the stuart prince for gold the map revealing his hidingplace and her letter to him bidding him trust the bearer whose ordersnow affixed to map and letterwere that he deliver the young pretender into the hands of the english authorities  that these orders to le monarque had been forestalled by milor eglinton could not exonerate madame la marquise from having been at one with gaston de stainville and madame de pompadour and others who might remain nameless in the blackest treachery ever planned against a trusting friend  no wonder gaston de stainville forgot physical suffering when he toyed lovingly with this packet of papers in his hand the consummation of his revenge  at last twas done a subtle indefinable change had come over the calm face of lord eglinton an ashen grey hue which had chased the former pallor of the cheeks and the slender hand which held the pistol trembled almost imperceptibly  serenity had given way at sight of that packet of papers  friend de mortémar said gaston lightly but with glowing eyes still fixed on his opponent the chances of my demise being at least equal to those of milorsseeing that i know not on my honour which is the loaded pistol and that methinks at this moment i can read murder in his eyei pray you to take charge of this packet it is a sacred trust in case of my death promise me that you will deliver it into the hands of my wife and into no other madame la comtesse de stainville will know how to deal with it  the young comte de mortémar took the packet from gaston  i will do as you desire he said coldly  you promise that no one shall touch these papers except my wife irène comtesse de stainville reiterated gaston solemnly  on my word of honour rejoined the young man  the request was perfectly proper and natural very usual in such cases de mortémar could not help but comply he could not know that the fulfilment of this promise would mean public dishonour to an innocent and noble woman and the supreme revenge of a baffled traitor  if gaston expected protest rage or excitement from his foe he was certainly disappointed eglinton had all the characteristics of his race perfect sangfroid in the face of the inevitable and an almost morbid consciousness of pride and dignity he could not filch those papers from gaston nor prevent de mortémar from accepting and fulfilling a trust which had all the appearance of being sacred  he knew that by this act he had wrested a fortune from a man whose fetish was money and the power which money gives true that being an honest man himself he had never thought of such an infamous revenge  if he died now heaven help his proud lydie but if he lived then heaven help them both     chapter xxxvii  the letter   de mortémar had stowed the packet carefully away inside his coat gaston keenly watching his antagonist the while  are you ready milor he asked now with marked insolence of manner  at your service replied the other quietly m de mortémar will you give the word  the two men stood opposite to one another a table not four feet wide between them each held a pistol in his left hand of these one was loaded the other not de mortémar had cleared the table pushing aside the decanter of wine the tureen of soup the glasses the window was still open and from that outside world which to these men here present seemed so far away there came the sound of the old church belfry tolling the hour of eight and still from afar that melancholy tune the norman ditty sung by young throats      cest les normands quà dit ma mère     cest les normands quont conquis langleterre  fire said de mortémar  two arms were raised eye was fixed to eye for one brief second then lowered for the aim there was a slight dull sound then a terrible curse muttered below the breath as the pistol which gaston de stainville had vainly tried to fire dropped from his hand  had his excitement blinded him when he chose his weapon or was it just fate ruthless inscrutable that had placed the loaded pistol in lord eglintons hand  a blank he shouted with a blasphemous oath À vous milor curse you why dont you fire  fire milor in heavens name said mortémar who was as pale as death tis cruelty to prolong  but eglinton too had dropped his arm  m le comte de stainville he said calmly before i use this weapon against you as i would against a mad dog ill propose a bargain for your acceptance  youd buy that packet of precious documents from me eh sneered gaston savagely nay milor tis no use offering millions to a dying man    shoot shoot milor the widowed comtesse de stainville will deal with those documents and no one else    they are not for sale i tell you not for all your millions now  not even for this pistol m le comte  and calm serene with that whimsical smile again playing round the corners of his expressive mouth lord eglinton offered the loaded pistol to his enemy  my life    stammered gaston you would     nay mine m le comte rejoined milor ill not stir from this spot i offer you this pistol and you shall use it at your pleasure after you have handed me that packet of letters  instinctively gaston had drawn back lost in a maze of surprise  an youll not take the weapon m le comte said eglinton decisively i shoot  there was a moments silence whilst gastons pride fought a grim battle with that awful instinct of selfpreservation that strange love of fleeting life to which poor mortals cling  men were not cowards in those days life was cheap and oft sold for the gratification of petty vanity yet who shall blame gaston if with certain death before him he chose to forego his revenge  give me that pistol milor he said dully de mortémar hand over that packet to lord eglinton  he took the pistol from milor and it was his own hand that trembled  silently de mortémar obeyed milor took the packet of papers from him then held them one by one to the flame of the candle first the map then the letter which bore lydies name writ so boldly across it the black ash curled and fell from his hand on to the table he gripped the paper until his seared fingers could hold it no longer  then he once more stood up turning straight toward gaston  i am ready m le comte he said simply  gaston raised his left arm and fired there was a wild an agonized shriek which came from a womans throat coupled with one of horror from de mortémars lips as le petit anglais stood for the space of a few seconds quite still firm and upright with scarce a change upon his calm face then sank forward without a groan  madame you are hurt shouted de mortémar who was almost dazed with surprise at the sight of a woman at this awful and supreme moment he had just seen her in the vivid flash when gaston raised his arm and fired she had rushed forward then with the obvious intention of throwing herself before the murderous weapon and now was making pathetic and vain efforts to raise her husbands inanimate body from the table against which he had fallen  coward coward she sobbed in anguish you have stilled the bravest heart in france  pray god that i have not murmured gaston fervently as impelled by some invisible force he threw the pistol from him then sank on his knees and buried his face in his hands  but mortémar had soon recovered his presence of mind and had already reached his wounded friend calling quickly to jean marie who apparently had followed in the wake of madame la marquise in her wild rush from her coach to the inner room  together the two men succeeded in lifting lord eglinton and in gently insinuating his body backward into a recumbent position thus lydiestill on her kneesreceived her lord in her arms her eyes were fixed upon his pallid face with passionate intensity it seemed as if she would wrest from those closed lids the secret of life or death  hell not die    she whispered wildly tell me that hell not die  a deep red stain was visible on the left side spreading on the fine cloth of the coat with clumsy though willing fingers mortémar was doing his best to get the waistcoat open and to stop temporarily the rapid flow of blood with lydies scarf which she had wrenched from her shoulders  quick jean marie the leech he ordered and have the rooms prepared     then as jean marie obeyed with unusual alacrity and anon his stentorian voice calling to ostler and maids echoed through the silence of the house lydies eyes met those of the young man  madame madame i beseech you he said appalled at the terrible look of agony expressed on the beautiful marblelike face let me attend you    i vow that you are hurt  no no she rejoined quickly only my hand    i tried to clutch the weapon    but twas too late     but she yielded her hand to him the shot had indeed pierced the fleshy portion between thumb and forefinger leaving an ugly gash the wound was bleeding profusely and already she felt giddy and sick de mortémar bound up the little hand with his handkerchief as best he could she hardly heeded him beyond that persistent appeal terrible in its heartrending pathos  hell not die    tell me that hell not die  whilst not five paces away gaston de stainville still knelt praying that the ugly stain of murder should not for ever sully his hand     chapter xxxviii  the home in england   the first words which milor uttered when presently consciousness returned were  the letter    madonna    tis destroyed    i swear     he was then lying in jean maries best bed between lavenderscented sheets on his right a tiny open window afforded a glimpse of sea and sky and of many graceful craft gently lolling on the breast of the waves but on his left when anon he turned his eyes that way there was a picture which of a truth was not of this earth and vaguely with the childish and foolish fancy of a sick man who hath gazed on the dark portals he allowed himself to think that all the old tales of his babyhood about the first glimpse of paradise after death must indeed be true  he was dead and this was paradise  what he saw was a womans face with grave anxious eyes fixed upon him and a womans smile which revealed an infinity of love and promised an infinity of happiness  madonna he murmured feebly then he closed his eyes again for he was weak from loss of blood and from days and nights of fever and delirium and he was so afraid that the vision might vanish if he gazed at it too long  the leecha kindly manvisited him frequently apparently the wound was destined to heal life was to begin anew with its sorrows its disappointments its humiliations mayhap  yet a memory haunted him persistentlya vision oh twas a mere flashof his madonna standing with her dear white hand outstretched betwixt him and death  it was a vision of course such as are vouchsafed to the dying and the other picturenay that was a fevered dream there had been no tender grave eyes that watched him no womans smile to promise happiness  one day m le duc daumont came to visit him he had posted straight from paris and was singularly urbane and anxious when he pressed the sick mans hand  you must make a quick recovery milor he said cordially par dieu you are the hero of the hour mortémar hath talked his fill  i trust not rejoined eglinton gravely  m le duc looked conscious and perturbed  nay he is a gallant youth he said reassuringly and knows exactly how to hold his tongue but belleisle and de lugeac had to be taught a lesson    and twas well learned ill warrant you    as for gaston     yes m le duc what of m le comte de stainville  he hath left the court momentarily    somewhat in disgrace    twas a monstrous encounter milor added the duke gravely had gaston killed you it had been murder for you never meant to shoot so says de mortémar  the sick mans head turned restlessly on the pillow  de mortémars tongue hath run away with him he said impatiently  the account of the duel    nothing more on my honour rejoined the duke no womans name has been mentioned but i fear me the court and public have got wind of the story of a conspiracy against the stuart prince and connect the duel with that eventhence your popularity milor continued the older man with a sigh and gastons disgrace  his majestys whippingboy eh the scapegoat in the aborted conspiracy  poor gaston you bear him much illwill milor no doubt  i none on my honour  m le duc hesitated a while a troubled look appeared on his handsome face  lydie he said tentatively milor she left paris that night alone    and travelled night and day to reach le havre in time to help you and to thwart gaston    she had been foolish of course but her motives were pure    milor she is my child and     she is my wife m le duc interrupted lord eglinton gravely i need no assurance of her purity even from her father  there was such implicit trust such complete faith expressed in those few simple words that instinctively m le duc daumont felt ashamed that he could ever have misunderstood his daughter he was silent for a moment or two then he said more lightly  his majesty is much angered of course  against me i hope rejoined eglinton  aye sighed the duke king louis is poorer by fifteen million livres by your act milor  and richer by the kingdom of honour as for the millions m le duc ill place them myself at his majestys service my château and dependencies of choisy are worth that added milor lightly as soon as this feeble hand can hold a pen ill hand them over to the crown of france as a free gift  you will do that milor gasped the duke who could scarce believe his ears  tis my firm intention rejoined the sick man with a smile  a great weight had been lifted from m le ducs mind royal displeasure would indeed have descended impartially on all the friends of le petit anglais and above all on milors fatherinlaw whose very presence at court would of a surety have become distasteful to the disappointed monarch now this unparalleled generosity would more than restore louis confidence in a prime minister whose chief virtue consisted in possessing so wealthy and magnanimous a soninlaw  indeed we know that m le duc daumont continued for some time after these memorable days to enjoy the confidence and gratitude of louis the wellbeloved and to bask in the sunshine of madame de pompadours smiles whilst the gift of the château and dependencies of choisy by milor the marquis of eglinton to the crown of france was made the subject of a public fête at versailles and of an ode by m jolyot crébillon of the institut de france writ especially for the occasion  but after the visit of m le duc daumont at his bedside in the auberge des trois matelots the munificent donor of fifteen millions livres felt overwearied of life  the dream which had soothed his fevered sleep no longer haunted his waking moments and memory had much ado to feed love of life with the rememberance of one happy moment  milor the marquis of eglinton closed his eyes sighing for that dream the little room was so still so peaceful and from the tiny window a gentle breeze from across the english channel fanned his aching brow bringing back with its soothing murmur the memory of that stately home in england for which his father had so often sighed  how peaceful it must be there among the hills  the breeze murmured more persistently and anon with its dreamlike sound there mingled the froufrou of a womans skirts  the sick man ventured to open his eyes  lydie his wife was kneeling beside his bed her delicate hands clasped under her chin her eyes large glowing and ever grave fixed upon his face  am i on earth he murmured quaintly  of a truth milor she replied and her voice was like the most exquisite music he had ever heard it was earnest and serious like her own self but there was a tremor in it which rendered it unspeakably soft  the leech saith theres no longer any danger for your life she added  he was silent for awhile as if he were meditating on a grave matter then he said quietly  would you have me live lydie  and as she did not reply he repeated his question again  do you wish me to live lydie  she fought with the tears which against her will gathered in her eyes  milor milor are you not cruel now she whispered through those tears  cruel of a truth he replied earnestly since you would have saved me at peril of your own dear life    yet would i gladly die to see you happy  will you not rather live milor she said with a smile of infinite tenderness for then only could i taste happiness  yet if i lived you would have to give up so much that you love  that is impossible milor for i only love one thing  your work in france he asked  no my life with you  her hands dropped on to the coverlet and he grasped them in his own how oft had she drawn away at his touch now she yielded drawing nearer to him still on her knees  would you come to england with me lydie to my home in england amongst the hills of sussex far from court life and from politics would you follow me thither  to the uttermost ends of the world good milor she replied   the end
