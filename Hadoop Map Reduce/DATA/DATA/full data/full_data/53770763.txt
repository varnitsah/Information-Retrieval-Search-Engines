mill     preface   the development of the moral sentiments in the human heart in early lifeand every thing in fact which relates to the formation of characteris determined in a far greater degree by sympathy and by the influence of example than by formal precepts and didactic instruction if a boy hears his father speaking kindly to a robin in the springwelcoming its coming and offering it foodthere arises at once in his own mind a feeling of kindness toward the bird and toward all the animal creation which is produced by a sort of sympathetic action a power somewhat similar to what in physical philosophy is called induction on the other hand if the father instead of feeding the bird goes eagerly for a gun in order that he may shoot it the boy will sympathize in that desire and growing up under such an influence there will be gradually formed within him through the mysterious tendency of the youthful heart to vibrate in unison with hearts that are near a disposition to kill and destroy all helpless beings that come within his power there is no need of any formal instruction in either case of a thousand children brought up under the former of the abovedescribed influences nearly every one when he sees a bird will wish to go and get crumbs to feed it while in the latter case nearly every one will just as certainly look for a stone thus the growing up in the right atmosphere rather than the receiving of the right instruction is the condition which it is most important to secure in plans for forming the characters of children  it is in accordance with this philosophy that these stories though written mainly with a view to their moral influence on the hearts and dispositions of the readers contain very little formal exhortation and instruction they present quiet and peaceful pictures of happy domestic life portraying generally such conduct and expressing such sentiments and feelings as it is desirable to exhibit and express in the presence of children  the books however will be found perhaps after all to be useful mainly in entertaining and amusing the youthful readers who may peruse them as the writing of them has been the amusement and recreation of the author in the intervals of more serious pursuits     contents    chapter                                          page      ithe cavern                                11

summer   principal persons  mrs henry a lady residing at franconia  alphonzo commonly called phonny about nine years old  malleville phonnys cousin from new york seven years old  wallace mallevilles brother a college student visiting franconia at this season  stuyvesant wallaces brother about nine years old  antoine bianchinette commonly called beechnut a french boy now about fourteen years old living at mrs henrys     stuyvesant     chapter i  the cavern   one pleasant summer morning alphonzo was amusing himself by swinging on a gate in front of his mothers house his cousin malleville who was then about eight years old was sitting upon a stone outside of the gate by the roadside in a sort of corner that was formed between the wall and a great tree which was growing there malleville was employed in telling her kitten a story  the kitten was sitting near malleville upon a higher stone malleville was leaning upon this stone looking the kitten in the face the kitten was looking down but she seemed to be listening very attentively  now kitty said malleville if you will sit still and hark i will tell you a storya story about a mouse i read it in a book once there was a mouse and he was white and he lived in a cage no i forgotthere were three mice ill begin again  once there was a boy and he had three white mice and he kept them in a cage  here mallevilles story was interrupted by phonny who suddenly called out  here comes beechnut malleville  i dont care said malleville im telling a story to kitty and you must not interrupt me  here the kitten jumped down from the stone and ran away  now phonny said malleville see what you have doneyou have made my kitty go away  i didnt make her go away said phonny  yes you did said malleville you interrupted my story and that made her go away  phonny laughed aloud at this assertion though malleville continued to look very serious phonny then repeated that he did not make the kitten go away and besides he said he thought that it was very childish to pretend to tell a story to a kitten  malleville said that she did not think it was childish at all for her kitten liked to hear stories phonny at this laughed again and then malleville appearing to be still more displeased said that she was not any more childish than phonny himself was  by this time beechnut as phonny called him had come up he was driving a cart the cart was loaded with wood the wood consisted of small and dry sticks which beechnut had gathered together in the forest  beechnut said phonny are you going into the woods again for another load  yes said beechnut  and may i go with you said phonny  yes said beechnut  and i said malleville  yes said beechnut  beechnut drove on into the yard and at length stopped near a great woodpile beechnut began to throw off the wood phonny climbed up into the cart too to help beechnut unload malleville sat down upon a log lying near to see  while they were at work thus throwing off the wood phonny instead of taking the smallest sticks that came in his way tried always to get hold of the largest he had three motives for doing this all mingled together the first was a pleasure in exercising his own strength the second a desire to show malleville that he was no child and the third to make a display of his strength to beechnut  after a while when the load had been about half thrown off phonny stopped his work straightened himself up with an air of great selfsatisfaction and said  malleville says i am childish do you think i am beechnut  no said malleville i did not say so she began to be a little frightened at this appeal to beechnut  yes said phonny you certainly did  no said malleville  what did you say asked phonny  i said i was not childish myself any more than you  well that is the same thing said phonny  malleville was silent she thought that it was a different thing but she did not know very well how to explain the difference  in the mean time beechnut went on unloading the wood  do you think i am childish at all beechnut said phonny  why i dont know said beechnut doubtfully i dont know how many childish things it is necessary for a boy to do in order to be considered as childish in character but i have known you to do two childish things within half an hour  phonny seemed a little surprised and a little confused at this and after a moments pause he said  i know what one of them is i guess  what asked beechnut  swinging on the gate  no said beechnut i did not mean that you have done things a great deal more childish than that  what said phonny  the first was said beechnut making a dispute with malleville by appealing to me to decide whether you were childish  why i ought to know if i am childish said phonny so that if i am i may correct the fault  i dont think that that was your motive said beechnut in asking if you had wished to know my opinion in order to correct yourself of the fault you would have asked me some time privately i think that your motive was a wish to get a triumph over malleville  oh beechnut said phonny  although phonny said oh beechnut he still had a secret conviction that what beechnut had said was true he was silent a moment and then he asked what was the other childishness which beechnut had seen within half an hour  in unloading this wood said beechnut you tried to get hold of the biggest sticks even when they were partly buried under the little ones and thus worked to great disadvantage men take the smaller ones off first and so clear the way to get at the larger ones but boys make a great ado in getting hold of the largest ones they can see by way of showing the bystanders how strong they are  well said phonny i will throw off the little ones after this  so phonny went to work again and in throwing off the remainder of the load he acted in a much more sensible and advantageous manner than he had done before the cart was soon empty beechnut then went into the house and brought out a small chair this he placed in the middle of the cart for malleville he also placed a board across the cart in front in such a manner that the ends of the board rested upon the sides of the cart the board thus formed a seat for beechnut and phonny beechnut then gave the reins to phonny who had taken his seat upon the board while he himself went to help malleville in  he led malleville up to the cart behind and putting his hands under her arms he said jump malleville jumpedbeechnut at the same time lifting to help her she did not however quite get up and so beechnut let her down to the ground again  once more said beechnut  so malleville tried again she went a little higher this time than before but not quite high enough  that makes twice said beechnut the rule is       try it once try it twice      and then once more and that makes thrice  the third time malleville seemed to be endowed with some new and supernatural strength in her jumping for she bounded so high that her feet rose almost to a level with the top of the seat and then as she came down gently upon the floor of the cart beechnut released his hold upon her and she walked to her chair and sat down beechnut then mounted to his place by the side of phonny and the whole party rode away  illustration going out the gate  after riding along for some distance phonny asked beechnut if he really thought that he was childish  why no said beechnut not particularly you are a little boyish sometimes and i suppose that that is to be expected since you are really a boy but you are growing older every year and i see some marks of manliness in you now and then how old are you now  i am nine years and five months said phonny that is i am about halfpast nine  that is pretty old said beechnut but then i suppose i must expect you to be a boy some time longer  beechnut said phonny did you know that my cousin wallace was coming here pretty soon  is he said beechnut from college  yes said phonny it is his vacation he is coming here to spend his vacation  i am glad of that said beechnut i like to have him here  and my cousin stuyvesant is coming too said phonny  stuyvesant is my brother said malleville  how old is he asked beechnut  he is only nine said phonny  then he is not so old as you are said beechnut  not quite said phonny  and i suppose of course he will be more of a boy than you said beechnut  i dont know said phonny  we shall see said beechnut  just then phonny heard the sound of wheels behind him he turned round and saw a wagon coming along the road  here comes a wagon said he i am going to whip up so that they shall not go by us  no said beechnut turn out to one side of the road and walk the horse and let them go by  why asked phonny  ill tell you presently said beechnut after the wagon has got before us  phonny turned out of the road and let the wagon drive by and then beechnut told him that the reason why he was not willing to have him whip up and keep ahead was that he wanted to use the strength of the horse that day in hauling wood and not to waste it in galloping along the road racing with a wagon  at length the party reached a place where there was a pair of bars by the roadside and a way leading in to a sort of pasture phonny knew that this was where beechnut was going and so he turned in the road was rough and malleville had to hold on very carefully to the side of the cart as they went along presently the road went into a wood and after going on some way in this wood beechnut directed phonny to stop and they all got out  now phonny said beechnut you can have your choice either to work or play  what do you think that i had better do said phonny  play i rather think said beechnut  i thought you would say work said phonny  you had better play in order to keep malleville company said beechnut  well said phonny i will  so while beechnut went to work to get a new load of wood phonny and malleville went away to play  there was a precipice of rocks near the place where beechnut was loading his cart with a great many large rocks at the foot of it the top of the precipice was crowned with trees and there were also a great many bushes and trees growing among the rocks below it was a very wild and romantic place and phonny and malleville liked to play there very much indeed  after a time phonny called out to beechnut to inquire whether he had any matches in his pocket he said that he and malleville were going to build a fire  yes said beechnut i have come here and i will give you some  so phonny sent malleville after the matches while he collected dry wood for a fire when malleville returned she gave phonny the matches and told him that beechnut said that they must make the fire on the rocks somewhere or in some other safe place so that it should not spread into the woods  well said phonny i will look about and find a good place  accordingly he began to walk along at the foot of the precipice examining every recess among the rocks and all the nooks and corners which seemed to promise well as places of encampment malleville could not quite keep up with him on account of the roughnesses and inequalities of the way  at last malleville who had fallen a little behind heard phonny calling to her in tones of great delight she hastened on in a moment she saw phonny before her just coming out from among the bushes and calling to her  malleville malleville come here quicki have found a cavern  malleville went on and presently she came in view of what phonny called a cavern it was a place where two immense fragments of rock leaned over toward each other so as to form a sort of roof beneath which was an inclosure which phonny called a cavern he might perhaps have more properly called it a grotto there was a great flat stone at the bottom of the cavern which made an excellent floor and there was an open place in the top behind where phonny thought that the smoke would go out if he should make a fire  there malleville said phonny when she came where she could see the cavern that is what i call a discovery we will play that we are savages and that we live in a cavern  phonny rolled two large stones into the cavern and placed them in the back part of it where he intended to build his fire these stones were for andirons then he began to bring in logs and sticks and branches of trees such as he found lying upon the ground dead and dry these he piled up inside of the cavern in a sort of corner where there was a deep recess or crevice which was very convenient for holding the wood  malleville helped him do all this when a sufficient supply of wood was gathered phonny laid some of it across his stone andirons and then prepared to light the fire  he rubbed one of his matches against a dry log and the match immediately kindled phonny looked at the blue flame a moment and then as if some sudden thought had struck him he blew it out again and said  on the whole i will go and ask beechnut we may as well be sure  so he ran down from the entrance of the cavern and thence along by the way that they had come through the thicket until he came in sight of beechnut  beechnut said he calling out very loud we have found a cavernmay we build a fire in it  yes said beechnut  then phonny went back and telling malleville that beechnut had said yes he proceeded to kindle his fire  it happened that there were two large stones tolerably square in form each of them and flat upon the upper side which were lying in the cavern in such places as to be very convenient for seats when the fire began to burn phonny sat down upon one of these seats and gave malleville the other the fire blazed up very cheerily and the smoke and sparks winding their way up the side of the rock which formed the back of the cavern escaped out through the opening at the top in a very satisfactory manner  there said phonny this is what i call comfortable if we only now had something to eat it is all i should want  ill tell you what said he again after a moments pause we will send home by beechnut when he goes with his next load to get us something to eat  well said malleville so we will  beechnut very readily undertook the commission of bringing phonny and malleville something to eat accordingly when his cart was loaded he went away leaving phonny and malleville in their cavern while he was gone the children employed themselves in bringing flat stones and making a fireplace by building walls on each side of their fire  in due time beechnut returned bringing with him a large round box which he said that mrs henry had sent to phonny and malleville it was too heavy for phonny to lift easily and so beechnut drove his cart along until it was nearly opposite the cavern then he took the box out of the cart and carried it into the cavern and laid it down upon mallevilles seat  phonny opened it and he found that it contained a variety of stores there were four potatoes and four apples each rolled up in a separate paper there were also two crackers these crackers were in a tin mug just big enough to hold them one on the top of the other the mug phonny said was for them to drink from and as there was a spring by the side of the cavern they had plenty of water  one cracker is for me said phonny and the other for you malleville i mean to split my cracker in two and toast the halves  at the bottom of the box there was half a pie  illustration the cavern  beechnut stopped to see what the box contained and then he went away to his work again as he went away he told the children that mrs henry said that they need not come home to dinner that day unless they chose to do sobut might make their dinner if they pleased in the cavern from what she had sent them in the box  the children were very much pleased with this plan they remained in the cavern a long time they roasted their potatoes in the fire and their apples in front of it they toasted their crackers and warmed their pie by placing them against a stone between the andirons and they got water whenever they were thirsty in the dipper from the spring  at length about the middle of the afternoon when their interest in the cavern was beginning to decline their thoughts were suddenly turned away from it altogether by the news which beechnut announced to them on his return from the house after his eighth load that wallace had arrived  and has my brother stuyvesant come too asked malleville  i suppose so said beechnut there was a boy with him about as large as phonny but i did not hear what his name was  oh it is he it is he said malleville clapping her hands  phonny and malleville mounted upon the top of the load as soon as beechnut got it ready and rode home they ran into the house while beechnut went to unload his wood just as beechnut was ready to go out of the yard again with his empty cart phonny came out  cousin wallace has really come said phonny  ah said beechnut and what does he have to say  why he says replied phonny that he is going to make a man of me  is he said beechnut well i hope he will take proper time for it i have no great opinion of the plan of making men out of boys before their time  so saying beechnut drove away and phonny went in     chapter ii  boyishness   two or three days after wallace arrived at franconia he and phonny formed a plan to go and take a ride on horseback they invited stuyvesant to go with them but stuyvesant said that beechnut was going to plow that day and had promised to teach him to drive oxen he said that he should like better to learn to drive oxen than to take a ride on horseback  there was another reason which influenced stuyvesant in making this decision and that was that he had observed that there were only two horses in the stable and although he knew that beechnut could easily obtain another from some of the neighbors still he thought that this would make some trouble and he was always very considerate about making trouble this was rather remarkable in stuyvesant for he was a city boy and city boys are apt to be very inconsiderate  so wallace and phonny concluded to go by themselves they mounted their horses and rode together out through the great gate  now said phonny when they were fairly on the way we will have a good time this is just what i like i would rather have a good ride on horseback than any thing else i wish that they would let me go alone sometimes  wont they asked wallace  no not very often said phonny  do you know what the reason is asked wallace  i suppose because they think that i am not old enough replied phonny but i am  i dont think that that is the reason said wallace stuyvesant is not quite so old as you are and yet i shall let him go and ride alone whenever he pleases  what is the reason then asked phonny  because you are not man enough i suppose said wallace you might be more manly without being any older and then people would put more trust in you and you would have a great many more pleasures  phonny was rather surprised to hear his cousin wallace speak thus he had thought that he was manlyvery manly but it was evident that his cousin considered him boyish  i do not know continued wallace but that you are as manly as other boys of your years  except stuyvesant said phonny  yes except stuyvesant said wallace i think that he is rather remarkable i do not think that you are very boyishbut you are growing up quite fast and you are getting to be pretty large it is time for you to begin to evince some degree of the carefulness and considerateness and sense of responsibility that belong to men  there are two kinds of boyishness continued wallace one kind is very harmless  what kind is that asked phonny  why if a boy continues said wallace when he is quite old to take pleasure in amusements which generally please only young children that is boyishness of a harmless kind for example suppose we should see a boy eighteen years old playing marbles a great deal we should say that he was boyish so if you were to have a rattle or any other such little toy for a plaything and should spend a great deal of time in playing with it we should say that it was very boyish or childish still that kind of boyishness does little harm and we should not probably do any thing about it but should leave you to outgrow it in your own time  what kind of boyishness do you mean then that is not harmless asked phonny  i mean that kind of want of consideration by which boys when young are always getting themselves and others into difficulty and trouble for the sake of some present and momentary pleasure they see the pleasure and they grasp at it they do not see the consequences and so they neglect them the result is they get into difficulty and do mischief other people lose confidence in them and so they have to be restricted and watched and subjected to limits and bounds when if they were a little more considerate and manly they might enjoy a much greater liberty and many more pleasures  i dont think that i do so said phonny  no rejoined wallace i dont think that you do that is i dont think that you do so more than other boys of your age but to show you exactly what i mean i will give you some cases perhaps they are true and perhaps they are imaginary it makes no difference which they are  once there was a boy continued wallace who came down early one winter morning and after warming himself a moment by the sittingroom fire he went out in the kitchen it happened to be ironing day and the girl was engaged in ironing at a great table by the kitchen fire we will call the girls name dorothy  the boy seeing dorothy at this work wished to iron something himself so dorothy gave him a flatiron and also something to iron  what was it that she gave him to iron said phonny  a towel said wallace  well said phonny go on  the boy took the flatiron and went to work continued wallace presently however he thought he would go out into the shed and see if the snow had blown in during the night he found that it had and so he stopped to play with the drift a few minutes at last he came back into the kitchen and he found when he came in that dorothy had finished ironing his towel and had put it away he began to complain of her for doing this and then in order to punish her as he said he took two of her flatirons and ran off with them and put them into the snow drift  yes said phonny that was me but then i only did it for fun  was the fun for yourself or for dorothy asked wallace  why for me said phonny  and it made only trouble for dorothy said wallace  yes said phonny i suppose it did  that is the kind of boyishness i mean said wallace getting fun for yourself at other peoples expense and so making them dislike you and feel sorry when they see you coming and glad when you go away  phonny was silent he saw the folly of such a course of proceeding and had nothing to say  there is another case said wallace once i knew a boy and his name wasill call him johnny  what was his other name asked phonny  no matter for that now said wallace he went out into the barn and he wanted something to do and so the boy who lived there gave him a certain corner to take charge of and keep in order  what was that boys name asked phonny  why i will call him hazelnut said wallace  ah exclaimed phonny now i know you are going to tell some story about me and beechnut here phonny threw back his head and laughed aloud he repeated the words johnny and hazelnut and then laughed again until he made the woods ring with his merriment  wallace smiled and went on with his story  hazelnut gave him the charge of a corner of the barn where some harnesses were kept and johnnys duty was to keep them in order there one day hazelnut came home and found that johnny had taken out the long reins from the harness and had fastened them to the branches of two trees in the back yard to make a swing and then he had loaded the swing with so many children as to break it down  yes said phonny that was me too but i did not think that the reins would break  i know it said wallace you did not think that is the nature of the kind of boyishness that i am speaking of the boy does not think men generally before they do any new or unusual thing stop to consider what the results and consequences of it are going to be but boys go on headlong and find out what the consequences are when they come  while wallace and phonny had been conversing thus they had been riding through a wood which extended along a mountain glen just at this time they came to a place where a cart path branched off from the main road toward the right phonny proposed to go into this path to see where it would lead wallace had no objection to this plan and so they turned their horses and went in  the cart path led them by a winding way through the woods for a short distance along a little dell and then it descended into a ravine at the bottom of which there was a foaming torrent tumbling over a very rocky bed the path by this time became quite a road though it was a very wild and stony road it kept near the bank of the brook continually ascending until at last it turned suddenly away from the brook and went up diagonally upon the side of a hill there were openings in the woods on the lower side of the road through which wallace got occasional glimpses of the distant valleys wallace was very much interested in these prospects but phonnys attention was wholly occupied as he went along in looking over all the logs and rocks and hollow trees in search of squirrels  at last at a certain turn of the road the riders came suddenly upon a pair of bars which appeared before themdirectly across the road  well said wallace here we are what shall we do now  it is nothing but a pair of bars said phonny i can jump off and take them down  no said wallace i think we may as well turn about here and go back we have come far enough on this road  just then phonny pointed off under the trees of the forest upon one side and said in a very eager voice  see there  what is it said wallace  a trap said phonny it is a squirrel trap and it is sprung theres a squirrel in it ive no doubt let me get off and see  well said wallace give me the bridle of your horse  so phonny threw the bridle over his horses head and gave it to wallace he then dismountedsliding down the side of the horse safely to the ground  as soon as he found himself safely down he threw his ridingstick upon the grass and ran off toward the trap  the trap was placed upon a small stone by the side of a larger one it was in a very snug and sheltered place almost out of view in fact it probably would not have been observed by any ordinary passerby  phonny ran up to the trap and took hold of it he lifted it up very cautiously he shook it as well as he could and then listened he thought that he could hear or feel some slight motion within he became very much excited  he put the trap down upon the high rock and began opening up the lid a little very gently  illustration the trap  the trap was of the kind called by the boys a boxtrap it is in the form of a box and the back part runs up high to a point the lid of the box has a string fastened to it which string is carried up over the high point and thence down and is fastened to an apparatus connected with the spindle  the spindle is a slender rod of wood which passes through the end of the box into the interior about half of the spindle is within the box and half without there is a small notch in the outer part of the spindle and another in the end of the box a short distance above the spindle there is a small bar of wood with both ends sharpened and made of such a length as just to reach from the notch in the end of the box to the notch in the spindle this bar is the apparatus to which the end of the string is fastened as before described  when the trap is to be set the bar is fitted to the notches in such a manner as to catch in them and then the weight of the lid being sustained by the string the lid is held up so that the squirrel can go in the front of the box is attached to the lid and rises with it so that when the lid is raised a little the squirrel can creep directly in the bait which is generally a part of an ear of corn is fastened to the end of the spindle which is within the trap the squirrel sees the bait and creeps in to get it he begins to nibble upon the corn the ear is tied so firmly to the spindle that he can not get it away in gnawing upon it to get off the corn he finally disengages the end of the spindle from the bar by working the lower end of the bar out of its notch this lets the string up and of course the lid comes down and the squirrel is shut in a captive  when the lid first comes down it makes so loud a noise as to terrify the poor captive very much he runs this way and that around the interior of the box wondering what has happened and why he can not get out as he came in he has no more appetite for the corn but is in great distress at his sudden and unaccountable captivity  after trying in vain on all sides to escape by forcing his way and finding that the box is too strong for him in every part he finally concludes to gnaw out he accordingly selects the part of the box where there is the widest crack and where consequently the brightest light shines through he selects this place partly because he supposes that the box is thinnest there and partly because he likes to work in the lighta  footnote a to prevent the squirrels that are caught from gnawing out the boys sometimes line the inside of their traps with tin  there was a squirrel in the trap which phonny had found it was a large and handsome gray squirrel he had been taken that morning about an hour after the trap sprung upon him he had begun to gnaw out and he had got about half through the boards in the corner when phonny found him when phonny shook the trap the squirrel clung to the bottom of it by his claws so that phonny did not shake him about much  when phonny had put the trap upon the great stone he thought that he would lift up the lid a little way and peep in this is a very dangerous operation for a squirrel will squeeze out through a very small aperture and many a boy has lost a squirrel by the very means that he was taking to decide whether he had got one  phonny was aware of this danger and so he was very careful he raised the lid but very little and looked under with the utmost caution he saw two little round and very brilliant eyes peeping out at him  yes wallace said he yes yes here he is i see his eyes  wallace sat very composedly upon his horse holding phonnys bridle while phonny was uttering these exclamations without appearing to share the enthusiasm which phonny felt at all  he is here wallace said phonny he is truly  i do not doubt it said wallace but what are we to do about it  whywhywhat would you do asked phonny  i suppose that the best thing that we could do said wallace is to ride along  and leave the squirrel said phonny in a tone of surprise  yes said wallace i dont see any thing else that we can do  why he will gnaw out said phonny he will gnaw out in half an hour he has gnawed half through the board already espy ought to have tinned his trap so saying phonny stooped down and peeped into the trap again through the crack under the lid  who is espy asked wallace  espy ransom said phonny he lives down by the mill he is always setting traps for squirrels i suppose that this road goes down to the mill and that he came up here and set his trap but it wont do to leave the squirrel here continued phonny looking at wallace in a very earnest manner it never will do in the world  what shall we do then asked wallace  couldnt we carry him down to espy said phonny  i dont think that we have any right to carry him away it is not our squirrel and it may be that it is not espys  phonny seemed perplexed after a moments pause he added couldnt we go down and tell espy that there is a squirrel in his trap  yes said wallace that we can do  phonny stooped down and peeped into the trap again  the rogue said he the moment that i am gone he will go to gnawing again i suppose and so get out and run away what a little fool he is  do you think he is a fool for trying to gnaw out of that trap asked wallace  why nosaid phonny but i wish he wouldnt do it we will go down quick and tell espy  so phonny came back to the place where wallace had remained in the road holding the horses phonny let down the bars and wallace went through with the horses phonny immediately put the bars up again took the bridle of his own horse from wallaces hands threw it up over the horses head and then by the help of a large log which lay by the side of the road he mounted he did all this in a hurried manner and ended with saying  now cousin wallace lets push on i dont think its more than half a mile to the mill     chapter iii  the plowing   while wallace and phonny were taking their ride as described in the last chapter stuyvesant and beechnut were plowing  beechnut told stuyvesant that he was ready to yoke up as he called it as soon as the horses had gone  well said stuyvesant i will come i have got to go up to my room a minute first  so stuyvesant went up to his room feeling in his pockets as he ascended the stairs to find the keys of his trunk when he reached his room he kneeled down before his trunk and unlocked it  he raised the lid and began to take out the things he took them out very carefully and laid them in order upon a table which was near the trunk there were clothes of various kinds some books and several parcels put up neatly in paper stuyvesant stopped at one of these parcels which seemed to be of an irregular shape and began to feel of what it contained through the paper  what is this said he to himself i wonder what it can be oh i remember now it is my watchcompass  what stuyvesant called his watchcompass was a small pocketcompass made in the form of a watch it was in a very pretty brass case about as large as a ladys watch and it had a little handle at the side to fasten a watchribbon to stuyvesants uncle had given him this compass a great many years before stuyvesant had kept it very carefully in his drawer at home intending when he should go into the country to take it with him supposing that it would be useful to him in the woods his sister had given him a black ribbon to fasten to the handle the ribbon was long enough to go round stuyvesants neck while the compass was in his waistcoat pocket  stuyvesant untied the string which was around the paper that contained his compass and took it off he then wound up this string into a neat sort of coil somewhat in the manner in which fishinglines are put up when for sale in shops he put this coil of twine together with the paper upon the table he looked at the compass a moment to see which was north in his chamber and then putting the compass itself in his pocket he passed the ribbon round his neck and afterward went on taking the things out of his trunk  when he came pretty near to the bottom of his trunk he said to himself  ah here it is  at the same moment he took out a garment which seemed to be a sort of frock it was made of brown linen he laid it aside upon a chair and then began to put the things back into his trunk again he laid them all in very carefully each in its own place when all were in he shut down the lid of the trunk locked it and put the key in his pocket then he took the frock from the chair and opening it put it on  it was made somewhat like a cartmans frock stuyvesant had had it made by the seamstress at his mothers house in new york before he came away he was a very neat and tidy boy about his dress and always felt uncomfortable if his clothes were soiled or torn he concluded therefore that if he had a good strong serviceable frock to put on over his other clothes it would be very convenient for him at franconia  as soon as his frock was on he hastened down stairs and went out to the barn in search of beechnut he found him yoking up the cattle  why stuyvesant said beechnut when he saw him that is a capital frock that you have got how much did it cost  i dont know said stuyvesant mary made it for me  who is mary asked beechnut  she is the seamstress said stuyvesant she lives at our house in new york  do you have a seamstress there all the time said beechnut  yes said stuyvesant  and her name is mary said beechnut  yes said stuyvesant  well i wish she would take it into her head to make me such a frock as that said beechnut  during this conversation beechnut had been busily employed in yoking up the oxen stuyvesant looked on watching the operations carefully in order to see how the work of yoking up was done he wished to see whether the process was such that he could learn to yoke up oxen himself or whether any thing that was required was beyond his strength  can boys yoke up cattle said stuyvesant at length  it takes a pretty stout boy said beechnut  could a boy as stout as i am do it asked stuyvesant  it would be rather hard work for you said beechnut the yoke is pretty heavy  the yoke was indeed quite heavy and it was necessary to lift itone end at a timeover the necks of the oxen stuyvesant observed that the oxen were fastened to the yoke by means of bows shaped like the letter u these bows were passed up under the necks of the oxen the ends of them came up through the yokes and were fastened there by little pegs which beechnut called keys there was a ring in the middle of the yoke on the under side to fasten the chain to by which the cattle were to draw  when the oxen were yoked beechnut drove them to the corner of the yard where there was a drag with a plow upon it beechnut put an axe also upon the drag  what do you want an axe for asked stuyvesant in going to plow  we always take an axe said beechnut when we go away to work we are pretty sure to want it for something or other  beechnut then gave stuyvesant a goad stick and told him that he might drive stuyvesant had observed very attentively what beechnut had done in driving and the gestures which he had made and the calls which he had used in speaking to the oxen and though he had never attempted to drive such a team before he succeeded quite well his success however was partly owing to the sagacity of the oxen who knew very well where they were to go and what they were to do  at length after passing through one or two pairs of bars they came to the field  which is the easiest said stuyvesant to drive the team or hold the plow  that depends said beechnut upon whether your capacity consists most in your strength or your skill  why so asked stuyvesant  because said beechnut it requires more skill to drive than to hold the plow and more strength to hold the plow than to drive i think therefore that you had better drive for as between you and i it is i that have the most strength and you that have the most skill  stuyvesant laughed  why you ought to have the most skill said beechnutcoming from such a great city  beechnut took the plow off from the drag and laid the drag on one side he then attached the cattle to the plow they were standing when they did this in the middle of one side of the field  now said beechnut we are going first straight through the middle of the field do you see that elmtree the other side of the fence  i see a large tree said stuyvesant  it is an elm said beechnut  there is a great bird upon the top of it said stuyvesant  yes said beechnut it is a crow now you must keep the oxen headed directly for that tree go as straight as you can and i shall try to keep the plow straight behind you the thing is to make a straight furrow  when all was ready stuyvesant gave the word to his oxen to move on and they began to draw stuyvesant went on keeping his eye alternately upon the oxen and upon the tree he had some curiosity to look round and see how beechnut was getting along with the furrow but he recollected that his business was to drive and so he gave his whole attention to his driving in order that he might go as straight as possible across the field  the crow flew away when he had got half across the field he had a strong desire to know where she was going to fly to but he did not look round to follow her in her flight he went steadily on attending to his driving  when he was about two thirds across the field he saw a stump at a short distance before him with a small hornets nest upon one side of it his course would lead him he saw very near this nest his first impulse was to stop the oxen and tell beechnut about the hornets nest he did in fact hesitate a moment but he was instantly reassured by hearing beechnut call out to him from behind saying  never mind the hornets nest stuyvesant drive the oxen right on i dont think the hornets will sting them  stuyvesant perceived by this that beechnut thought only of the oxen when he saw a hornets nest and he concluded to follow his example in this respect so he drove steadily on  when they got to the end of the field the oxen stopped beechnut and stuyvesant then looked round to see the furrow it was very respectably straight  you have done very well said he and you will find it easier now for one of the oxen will walk in the furrow and that will guide him  so stuyvesant brought the team around and then went back one of the oxen in returning walking in the furrow which had been made before in this manner they went back to the place from which they had first started  there said beechnut now we have got our work well laid out but before we plow any more we must destroy that hornets nest or else when we come to plow by that stump the hornets will sting the oxen ill go and get some straw you may stay here and watch the oxen while i am gone  in a short time beechnut came back bringing his arms full of hay he walked directly toward that part of the field where the hornets nest was calling stuyvesant to follow him stuyvesant did so when he got near to the stump he put the hay down upon the ground he then advanced cautiously to the stump with a part of the hay in his arms this hay he put down at the foot of the stump directly under the hornets nest extending a portion of it outward so as to form a sort of train he then went back and took up the remaining portion of the hay and held it in his hands  now stuyvesant said beechnut light a match and set fire to the train  beechnut had previously given stuyvesant a small paper containing a number of matches  how shall i light it asked stuyvesant  rub it upon a stone said beechnut find one that has been lying in the sun continued beechnut and then the match will catch quicker because the stone will be warm and dry  so stuyvesant lighted a match by rubbing it upon a smooth stone which was lying upon the ground near by he then cautiously approached the end of the train and set it on fire  illustration the hornets nest  beechnut then came up immediately with the hay that he had in his hands and placed it over and around the hornets nest so as to envelop it entirely he and stuyvesant then retreated together to a safe distance and there stood to watch the result  a very dense white smoke immediately began to come up through the hay presently the flame burst out and in a few minutes the whole mass of the hay was in a bright blaze stuyvesant looked very earnestly to see if he could see any hornets but he could not at last however when the fire was burnt nearly down he saw two they were flying about the stump apparently in great perplexity and distress stuyvesant pitied them but as he did not see what he could do to help them he told them that he thought they had better go and find some more hornets and build another nest somewhere then he and beechnut went back to the plow  stuyvesant had quite a desire to try and hold the plow after he had been driving the team about an hour but he thought it was best not to ask in fact he knew himself that it was best for him to learn one thing at a time so he went on with his driving  when it was about a quarter before twelve beechnut said that it was time to go in so he unhooked the chain from the yoke and leaving the plow the drag the axe and the chain in the field he let the oxen go they immediately ran off into a copse of trees and bushes which bordered the road on one side  why beechnut said stuyvesant the oxen are running away  no said beechnut they are only going down to drink there is a brook down there where they go to drink when they are at work in this field  oxen appear to possess mental qualifications of a certain kind in a very high degree they are especially remarkable for their sagacity in finding good places to drink in the fields and pastures where they feed or are employed at work and for their good memory in recollecting where they are an ox may be kept away from a particular field or pasture quite a long time and yet know exactly where to go to find water to drink when he is admitted to it again  stuyvesant looked at the oxen as they went down the path and then proposed to follow them  let us go and see said he  illustration oxen drinking  so he and beechnut walked along after the oxen they found a narrow but very pretty road or rather path overhung with trees and bushes which led down to the water the road terminated at a broad and shallow place in the stream where the sand was yellow and the water very clear the oxen went out into the water and then put their heads down to drink presently they stopped first one and then the other and stood a moment considering whether they wanted any more finding that they did not they turned round in the water and then came slowly out to the land they walked up the bank and finally emerging from the wood at the place where they had entered it they went toward home  when they reached the house the cattle went straight through the yard toward the barn beechnut and stuyvesant followed them beechnut was going to get them some hay stuyvesant went in with beechnut and stood below on the barn floor while beechnut went up the ladder to pitch the hay down  during all the time that beechnut and stuyvesant had been coming up from the field conversation had been going on between them about various subjects connected with farming stuyvesant asked beechnut if phonny could drive oxen pretty well  pretty well said beechnut  does he like to drive asked stuyvesant  he likes to begin to drive said beechnut  what do you mean by that asked stuyvesant  why when there is any driving to be done replied beechnut he thinks that he shall like it and he wants to take a goad stick and begin but he very soon gets tired of it and goes away you seem to have more perseverance in fact you seem to have a great deal of perseverance which i think is very strange considering that you are a city boy  stuyvesant laughed  city boys continued beechnut i have always heard said are good for nothing at all  but you said a little while ago replied stuyvesant that city boys had a great deal of skill  yes said beechnut they are bright enough but they have generally no steadiness or perseverance they go from one thing to another following the whim of the moment the reason of that is that living in cities they are brought up without having any thing to do  they can go of errands said stuyvesant  yes said beechnut they can go of errands but there are not many errands to be done so they are brought up in idleness country boys on the other hand generally have a great deal to do they have to go for the cows and catch the horses and drive oxen and a thousand other things and so they are brought up in industry  is phonny brought up in industry asked stuyvesant  hardly said beechnut in fact he is scarcely old enough yet to do much work  he is as old as i am said stuyvesant  true said beechnut but he does not seem to have as much discretion do you see that long shed out there projecting from the barn  this was said just at the time when beechnut and stuyvesant were passing through the gate which led into the yard and the barns and sheds were just coming into view  the one with that square hole by the side of the door asked stuyvesant  yes said beechnut that was phonnys hen house he bought some hens and was going to be a great poulterer he was going to have i dont know how many eggs and chickensbut finally he got tired of his brood and neglected them and at last wanted to sell them to me i bought them day before yesterday  how many hens are there asked stuyvesant  about a dozen said beechnut i gave him a dollar and a half for the whole stock i looked into his henhouse when i bought him out and found it all in sad condition i have not had time to put it in order yet  i will put it in order said stuyvesant  will you said beechnut  yes said stuyvesant and i should like to buy the hens of you if i were only going to stay here long enough  i dont think it is worth while for you to buy them said beechnut but i should like to have you take charge of them i would pay you by giving you a share of the eggs  what could i do with the eggs asked stuyvesant  why you could sell them or give them away just as you pleased you might give them to mrs henry or sell them to her or sell them to me if you will take the whole care of them while you are here i will give you one third of the eggs after all expenses are paid  what do you mean by that asked stuyvesant  why if we have to buy any grain for instance to give the hens we must sell eggs enough first to pay for the grain and after that you shall have one third of the eggs that are left  stuyvesant was much pleased with this proposal and was just about to say that he accepted it when his attention was suddenly turned away from the subject by hearing a loud call from phonny who just then came running round a corner with a boxtrap under his arm shouting out  stuyvesant stuyvesant look here ive got a gray squirrela beautiful large gray squirrel     chapter iv  negotiations   it is necessary in this chapter to return to phonny and wallace in order to explain how phonny succeeded in getting his squirrel  he was quite in haste as he went on after leaving the squirrel in order to get down to the mill where espy lived before the squirrel should have gnawed out the road he was quite confident led to the mill  i should like to buy the squirrel if espy will sell him said phonny  do you think that your mother would be willing asked wallace  why yes said phonny certainly what objection could she have  none only the trouble that it would occasion her replied wallace  oh it would not make her any trouble said phonny i should take care of it myself  it would not make her much trouble i know said wallace if you were only considerate and careful as it is i think it may make her a great deal  no said phonny i dont think that it will make her any trouble at all  where shall you keep your squirrel asked wallace  in a cage in the back room said phonny promptly  have you got a cage asked wallace  no said phonny but i can make one  i think that in making a cage replied wallace you would have to give other people a great deal of trouble you would be inquiring all about the house for tools and boards and wirethat is unless you keep your tools and materials for such kind of work in better order than boys usually do  phonny was silent his thoughts reverted to a certain room in one of the outbuildings which he called his shop and used for that purpose and which was as he well knew at this time in a state of great confusion  then continued wallace you will leave the doors open going and coming to see your squirrel and to feed him  no said phonny i am very sure that i shall not leave the doors open  and then continued wallace after a time you will get a little tired of your squirrel and will forget to feed him and so your mother or somebody in the house must have the care of reminding you of it  oh no said phonny i should not forget to feed him i am sure  did not you forget to feed your hens asked wallace  whyyes said phonny hesitatingly but that is a different thing  then besides said wallace you will have to go and beg some money of your mother to buy the squirrel with for i suppose you have not saved any of your own from your allowance it is very seldom that boys of your age have selfcontrol enough to lay up any money  as wallace said these words phonny who had been riding along with the bridle and his little riding stick both in his right hand now shifted them into his left and then putting his right hand into his left vest pocket he drew out a little wallet he then extended his hand with the wallet in it to wallace saying  look in there  wallace took the wallet opened it as he rode along and found that there was a quarter of a dollar in one of the pockets  is that your money said wallace  yes said phonny  then you are not near as much of a boy as i thought you were to be able to save money so as to have a stock on hand for any unexpected emergency is one of the greatest proofs of manliness i had no idea that you were so much of a man  phonny laughed at first wallace supposed that this laugh only expressed the pleasure which phonny felt at having deserved these praises but as he gave back the wallet into phonnys hands he perceived a very mysterious expression upon his countenance  thats the money said phonny that my mother just gave me for my next fortnights allowance  then you have had no opportunity to spend it at all  no said phonny  phonny thought that he was sinking himself in his cousins estimation by this avowal but he was in fact raising himself very much by evincing so much honesty  he is not willing to receive commendation that he knows he does not deserve thought wallace to himself that is a good sign that is a great deal better trait of character than to be able to lay up money  wallace thought this to himself as he rode along he did not however express the thought but went on a minute or two in silence at length he said  so then you have got money enough to buy the squirrel  yes said phonny if a quarter is enough  it is enough said wallace i have no doubt so that one difficulty is disposed of as to the second difficulty he continued that is troubling the family about making the cage we can dispose of that very easily too for i can help you about that myself what shall we do about the third leaving the doors open and making a noise when you go back and forth to feed him  oh i will promise not to do that said phonny  promise repeated wallace in a tone of incredulity  yes said phonny ill promise positively  is it safe to rely on boys promises about here said wallace they would not be considered very good security in wall street in new york  i dont know said phonny i always keep my promises  are you willing to agree that if you make any noise or disturbance in the family with your squirrel that he is to be forfeited  forfeited said phonny how do you mean  why given up to me to dispose of as i please said wallace  and what should you do with him asked phonny  i dont know said wallace i should dispose of him in some way so that he should not be the means of any more trouble perhaps i should give him away perhaps i should open the cage and let him run  then i think you ought to pay me what i gave for him said phonny  no said wallace because i dont take him for any advantage to myself but only to prevent your allowing him to make trouble if you make noise and disturbance with him it is your fault and you lose the squirrel as the penalty for it if you do your duty and make no trouble with him then he would not be forfeited  well said phonny i agree to that but perhaps you will say that i make a disturbance with him when i dont  we will have an umpire then said wallace  what is an umpire asked phonny  somebody to decide when there is a dispute replied wallace who shall be the umpire  beechnut said phonny  agreed said wallace  and now there is one point more he continued and that is perhaps you will neglect to feed him and then we shall be uncomfortable for fear that the squirrel is suffering  no said phonny shaking his head i shall certainly feed him every day and sometimes twice a day  are you willing to agree to forfeit him if you fail to feed him  whyi dont know said phonny but i certainly shall feed him i know i shall  then there will be no harm in agreeing to forfeit him if you fail rejoined wallace for if you certainly do feed him then your agreement to forfeit him will be a dead letter  but i might accidentally omit to feed him some one day said phonny i might be sick or i might be gone away and i might ask stuyvesant to feed him and he forget it and then i should lose my squirrel entirely  no said wallace you are not to forfeit him except for neglect it must be a real and inexcusable neglect on your part beechnut being judge  well said phonny i agree to it  and i will give you three warnings said wallace both for making trouble and disturbance with your squirrel and for neglecting to feed him after the third warning he is forfeited and i am to do what i please with him  well said phonny i agree to it  a short time after this conversation the road in which wallace and phonny were riding emerged from the wood and there was opened before them the prospect of a wide and beautiful valley a short distance before them down the valley there was a stream with a mill by the side of the mill under some large spreading elms was a red house which phonny said was the one where espy lived  they rode on rapidly intending to go to the house and inquire for espy just before reaching the place however phonnys attention was arrested by his seeing some boys fishing on the bank of the stream just below the mill it was at a place where the road lay along the bank of the stream at a little distance from it the stream was very broad at this place and the water quite deep and clear the ground was smooth and green between the road and the water and there were large trees on the bank overshadowing the shore so that it was a very pleasant placeb  footnote b see frontispiece  there were two boys standing upon the bank in one place fishing two other boys were near the water at a little distance trying to make a dog jump in by throwing in sticks and stones  just as wallace and phonny came along one of the boys who was fishing called out in a loud and authoritative tone to one of those who were trying to make the dog jump in saying  heyee there oliver dont throw sticks into the water you scare away all the fish  ned said phonny calling out to the boy who was fishing  the boy looked round without however moving his fishingpole  is espy down there anywhere said phonny  here the boy turned his head again toward the water without directly answering phonny though he called out at the same time in an audible voice  espy  in answer apparently to his call a boy came suddenly out of a little thicket which was near the water just below where ned was fishing and asked ned what he wanted  theres a fellow out here in the road said ned calling for you  hearing this the boy came out of the thicket entirely and scrambled up the bank he stood at the top of the bank looking toward wallace and phonny but did not advance his hand was extended toward a branch of the tree which he had taken hold of to help him in climbing up the bank he continued to keep hold of this tree showing by his attitude that he did not mean to come any farther  he was in fact a little awed at the sight of wallace who was a stranger to him he did not know whether he was wanted for any good purpose or was going to be called to account for some of his misdeeds  come here a minute said phonny  espy did not move  is that your trap up in the woods asked phonny  yes said espy  there is a squirrel in it rejoined phonny and i want to buy him  hearing this the boys who had been playing with the dog began to move up toward wallace and phonny espy himself taking his hand down from the tree came forward a few steps wallace and phonny too advanced a little with their horses toward the stream and thus the whole party came nearer together  there is a squirrel in your trap repeated phonny if he has not gnawed outand i want to buy him what will you sell him for  what kind of a squirrel is it asked espy  i dont know said phonny i couldnt see any thing but his eyes  if its a gray squirrel said espy he is worth a quarter if its a red squirrel you may have him for four pence  or for nothing at all continued espy after a moments pause just as you please  wallace laughed  what will you sell him for just as he is asked wallace and we take the risk of his being red or gray  dont you know which it is asked espy  no said wallace i do not i did not go near the cage and phonny did not open it he says he could only see his eyes  and his nose said phonny i saw his nosebut i dont know at all what kind of a squirrel it is  you may have him for eighteen cents said espy  but perhaps he has gnawed out said phonny he was gnawing out as fast as he could when we saw him  why if he has gnawed out said espy you will not have anything to pay of course because then you wont get him  or continued espy you may have him for ten cents and you take the risk of his gnawing out you give me ten cents now and you may have him if he is there red or gray if he is not there i keep the ten cents and you get nothing  well said phonny would you wallace  i dont know said wallace you must decide there is considerable risk i cant judge  i have not got any ten cents said phonnyonly a quarter of a dollar  oh i can pay said wallace and then you can pay me some other time  well said phonny i believe i will take him  you must lend me the trap said phonny again addressing espyto carry the squirrel home in and i will bring it back here some day  well said espy  so wallace took a ten cent piece from his pocket and gave it to espy and then he and phonny rode away  now said phonny we must go ahead  they rode on rapidly for some time at length on ascending a hill they were obliged to slacken their pace a little  if it should prove to be a gray squirrel said phonny what a capital bargain i shall have made a squirrel worth a quarter of a dollar for ten cents  i dont see why a gray squirrel is so much more valuable than a red one said wallace is gray considered prettier than red  oh it is not his color said phonny it is the shape and size the gray squirrels are a great deal larger and then they have a beautiful bushy tail that lays all the time over their back and curls up at the end like a plume the red squirrels are very small  besides continued phonny they are not red exactly they are a kind of reddish brown so that they are not very pretty even in color i am afraid that my squirrel will be a red one  i am afraid so too said wallace  the red squirrels are altogether the most common said phonny  there are the bars said wallace now we shall soon see  they had arrived in fact at the bars phonny jumped off his horse and gave wallace the bridle and then went to take down the bars as soon as he had got them down he left wallace to go through with the horses at his leisure and he himself ran off toward the rock where he had left the trap to see what sort of a squirrel he had  wallace went through the bars in a deliberate manner as it was in fact necessary to do in conducting two horses and then dismounted intending to put the bars up he had just got off his horse when he saw phonny coming from the direction of the place where the trap had been left with a countenance expressive of great surprise and concern  wallace exclaimed phonny the squirrel has gone trap and all  has it said wallace  yes said phonny i left it on that rock and it is gone  so saying phonny ran to the place and put his foot upon the rock looking up to wallace and added  there is the very identical spot where i put it and now it is gone  wallace seemed at a loss what to think  somebody must have taken him away said he  hark said phonny  wallace and phonny listened they heard the voices of some boys in the woods  there they are now said phonny  mount the horse said wallace and we will go and see  phonny mounted his horse as expeditiously as possible and he and wallace rode off through the woods in the direction of the voices they followed a path which led down a sort of glen and after riding a short distance they saw the boys before them standing in a little open space among the trees the boys had stopped to see who was coming  there were three boys one large and two small the large boy had the trap under his arm  halloa said phonny calling out aloud to the boys stop carrying off that trap  the boys did not answer  i have bought that squirrel said phonny you must give him to me  no said the great boy it belongs to espy and i am going to keep it for him  hush said wallace in a low tone to phonny i will speak to him  then calling out aloud again he said we have just been down to espys and have bought the squirrel and have now come to take him home  the boy did not move from the place where he stood and he showed very plainly by his countenance and his manner that he did not mean to give the squirrel up presently they heard him mutter to the small boys  i dont believe they have bought him and they shant have him  let us go down and take the squirrel away from them said phonny in a low tone to wallace i dont believe they will give him up unless we do  we can not do that said wallace we might take the trap away perhaps but they would first open the trap and let the squirrel go  what shall we do then asked phonny  wallace did not answer this question directly but called out again to the boy who held the trap saying  we found the squirrel here in the woods and then went down to tell espy and we bought the squirrel of him but we cant carry him home very well on horseback at least till we get out of the woods because the road is so steep and rough now if you will carry him down the road for us till we get out of the woods i will give you six cents  well said the boy i will  he immediately began to come toward wallace and phonny so as to go back with them into the road which they were to take wallace and phonny led the way and he followed as soon as he came within convenient distance for talking phonny asked him what sort of a squirrel it was  a gray squirrel said he the prettiest gray squirrel that ever i saw  phonny was very much elated at hearing this intelligence and wanted to get off his horse at once and take a peep at the squirrel but wallace advised him to do no such thing in due time the whole party got out of the woods wallace gave the boy his six cents and the boy handed the trap up to phonny phonny held it upon the pommel of the saddle directly before him he found that the squirrel had gnawed through the board so as to get his nose out but he could not gnaw any more now that the box was all the time in motion so he gave it up in despair and remained crouched down in a corner of the trap during the remainder of the ride wondering all the time what the people outside were doing with him  you managed that boy finely said phonny he is one of the worst boys in town  it is generally best said wallace in dealing with people to contrive some way to make it for their interest to do what you want rather than to quarrel with them about it  for the rest of the way phonny rode on without meeting with any difficulty and arrived at home with his squirrel all safe just at the time when beechnut and stuyvesant were talking about the poultry     chapter v  plans for the squirrel   as soon as phonny had told stuyvesant about his squirrel and had lifted up the lid of the trap a little so as to allow him to peep in and see he said that he was going in to show the squirrel to the people in the house and especially to malleville he accordingly hurried away with the box under his arm stuyvesant went back toward the barn  phonny hastened along to the house from the yard he went into a shed through a great door he walked along the platform in the shed and at the end of the platform he went up three steps to a door leading into the back kitchen he passed through this back kitchen into the front kitchen hurrying forward as he went and leaving all the doors open  dorothy was at work at a table ironing  dorothy said phonny ive got a squirrela beautiful squirrel if i had time i would stop and show him to you  i wish you had time to shut the doors said dorothy  in a minute said phonny i am coming back in a minute and then i will  so saying phonny went into a sort of hall or entry which passed through the house and which had doors in it leading to the principal rooms there was a staircase here phonny supposed that malleville was up in his mothers chamber so he stood at the foot of the stairs and began to call her with a loud voice  malleville said he malleville where are you come and see my squirrel  presently a door opened above and phonny heard some one stepping out  malleville said phonny is that you  no said a voice above it is wallace i have come to give you your first warning  why i only wanted to show my squirrel to malleville said phonny  you are making a great disturbance said wallace and besides though i dont know any thing about it i presume that you came in a noisy manner through the kitchen and left all the doors open there  well said phonny i will be still  so phonny turned round and went away on tiptoe when he got into the kitchen he first shut the doors and then carried the trap to dorothy and let her peep through the hole which the squirrel had gnawed and see the squirrel inside  do you see him asked phonny  i see the tip of his tail said dorothy curling over the whole squirrel is there somewhere ive no doubt  phonny then went out again to find stuyvesant he was careful to walk softly and to shut all the doors after him  he found stuyvesant and beechnut in the barn beechnut was raking up the loose hay which had been pitched down upon the barn floor and stuyvesant was standing beside him  beechnut said phonny just look at my squirrel you can peep through this little hole where he was trying to gnaw out  phonny held the trap up and beechnut peeped through the hole  yes said he i see the top of his head his name is frink  frink repeated phonny how do you know  i think that must be his name said beechnut if you dont believe it try and see if you can make him answer to any other name if you can ill give it up  nonsense beechnut said phonny that is only some of your fun but frink will be a very good name for him nevertheless only i was going to call him bunny  i dont think his name is bunny said beechnut i knew bunny he was a squirrel that belonged to rodolphus he got away and ran off into the woods but i dont think that this is the same one  ill call him frink said phonny but what would you do with him if you were in my place  me said beechnut  yes said phonny  well i think said beechnut stopping his work a moment and leaning on his rake and drawing a long breath as if what he was about to say was the result of very anxious deliberation i think that on the whole if that squirrel were mine i should put two large baskets up in the barnchamber and send him into the woods this fall to get beechnuts and hazelnuts and fill the baskets one basket for beechnuts and one for hazelnuts and i would give him a month to fill them  illustration beechnuts advice  nonsense beechnut said phonny you are only making fun if i were to let him go off into the woods he never would come back again  why do you suppose said beechnut that he would rather be running about in the woods than to live in that trap  yes said phonny  then said beechnut you must make him a beautiful cage and have it so convenient and comfortable for him that he shall like it better than he does the woods that would not be difficult one would suppose because he has nothing but holes in the ground and old hollow logs in the woods  i know that said phonny but then i dont think he would like any house that i could make him so well as he does the old logs  then i dont know what you will do said beechnut to make him contented  so saying beechnut went away leaving phonny and stuyvesant together they talked a few minutes about the squirrel and then began to walk along toward the house  as they walked along they heard the bell ring for dinner  there said phonny there is the dinnerbell what shall we do now where shall i put my squirrel while we are in at dinner  havent you got some sort of cage to put him in said stuyvesant  no said phonny i was going to make one after dinner in my shop i have got a shop did you know it  yes said stuyvesant beechnut told me  only my tools are rather dull added phonny but i think i can make a cage with them  you might put the trap in the shop on the bench said stuyvesant till after dinner and then make your cage  well said phonny so i will  so the two boys went into the shop the room was indeed in great confusion the floor was covered with chips and shavings the tools were lying in disorder on the bench there was a sawhorse in the middle of the room tumbled over upon one side because one of the legs was out the handle was out of the hatchet and one of the claws of the hammer was broken  while stuyvesant was surveying this scene of disorder phonny advanced to the bench and pushing away the tools from one corner of it he put the trap down  there said he he will be safe there till after dinner  only said stuyvesant he may finish gnawing out  i will stop him up said phonny  so saying he took the foreplane which is a tool formed of a steel cutter set in a pretty long and heavy block of wood and placed it directly before the hole in the trap there said he now if he does gnaw the hole big enough he cant get out for he cant push the plane away  perhaps he will be hungry said stuyvesant  no said phonny for there was half an ear of corn tied to the spindle for bait and he has not eaten but a very little of it yet i can see by peeping in  then perhaps he will be thirsty said stuyvesant  i will give him something to drink said phonny  yes said beechnut  the boys turned and saw beechnut standing at the door of the shop looking at them he continued       his name is frink      and so i think      id give him a little water to drink  so saying beechnut went away phonny took up an old tin cover which lay upon a shelf behind the bench and which had once belonged to a tin box the box was lost but phonny had kept the cover to put nails in he now poured the nails out upon the bench and went out to the pump to fill the cover with water  in a minute or two he came back walking carefully so as not to spill the water he raised the lid of the trap a little very cautiously and then pushed the cover in underneath it in such a manner that about half of it was inside the trap  there thats what i call complete now he can have a drink when he pleases and we will go in to dinner                                       at the dinner table phonny and stuyvesant sat upon one side of the table and malleville sat on the other side opposite to them mrs henry sat at the head and wallace opposite to her at the foot of the table the dinner consisted that day of roast chickens and after it an apple pudding  wallace carved the chickens and when all had been helped phonny began to talk about the squirrel  i suppose you consider it as boyishness in me cousin wallace to like to have a squirrel said he  it is a very harmless kind of boyishness at any rate replied wallace  then you have no objection to it said phonny  none at all said wallace in one sense it is boyishness for it is boys and not men that take pleasure in possessing useless animals  useless said phonny do you call a gray squirrel useless  he is not useful in the sense in which the animals of a farmyard are useful said wallace he gives pleasure perhaps but cows sheep and hens are a source of profit boys dont care much about profit but like any kind of animals if they are pretty or cunning in their motions and actions  i like gray squirrels said phonny very much indeed if it is boyishness  it is a very harmless kind of boyishness at all events replied wallace it is not like some other kinds of boyishness such as i told you about the other day  well cousin wallace said phonny what would you do if you were in my case for a cage  i would take some kind of box without any top to it replied wallace and lay it down upon its side and then make a front to it of wires  yes said phonny that will be an excellent plan but how can i make the front of wires  i will come and show you said wallace when you get the box all ready you must look about and find a box and carry it into the shop is your shop in order  no said phonny not exactly but i can put it in order in a few minutes  very well said wallace put your shop all in order and get the box and then come and call me  well said phonny i will     chapter vi  difficulty   after dinner stuyvesant told phonny that he should be glad to help him about his cage were it not that he was engaged to go with beechnut that afternoon to plow phonny was very sorry to hear this in fact he had a great mind to go himself and help plow and so put off making his cage until the next day it is very probable that he would have decided upon this plan but while he was hesitating about it beechnut came to tell stuyvesant that he should not be able to finish the plowing that day for he was obliged to go away then stuyvesant said that he would help phonny so they went together into the shop  they found the squirrel safe phonny examined the water very attentively to see whether frink had been drinking any of it he was very confident that the water had diminished quite sensibly stuyvesant could not tell whether it had diminished or not  and now said phonny the first thing is to put the shop in order  so saying he took the plane away from before the trap and looked at the hole to see whether frink had gnawed it any bigger he had not phonny then carried the trap to the back side of the shop and put it upon a great choppingblock which stood there he did this for the purpose of having the bench clear so as to put the tools in order upon it  i am glad that you are going to put this shop in order said stuyvesantthat is if you will let me use it afterward  yes said phonny i will let you use it but what should you want to make in it  why beechnut has given me charge of the henhouse said stuyvesant and i am to have one third of the eggs  here phonny stopped suddenly in his work and looked up to stuyvesant as if surprised  what my henhouse said he  the one that you used to have said stuyvesant he said that you sold it to him  so i did said phonny thoughtfully as he said this he laid down his saw which he had just taken to hang upon a nail where it belonged and ran off out of the shop  he was in pursuit of beechnut he found him harnessing a horse into a wagon  beechnut said he have you given stuyvesant the charge of my henhouse  i have offered it to him said beechnut but he has not told me yet whether he accepted the offer or not  you are going to let him have half the eggs if he takes care of the house and the hens inquired phonny  one third of them said beechnut  i did not know that you would do that said phonny if i had known that you would be willing to let it out in that way i should have wanted it myself  i am not certain that it would be safe to let it to you said beechnut  why not asked phonny  i am not sure that you would be persevering and faithful in taking care of the hens  why should not i as well as stuyvesant asked phonny stuyvesant is not so old as i am  he may have more steadiness and perseverance for all that said beechnut  i think you might let me have it as well as him said phonny  very well said beechnut either of you it shall go to the one who has the first claim  you say he did not accept your offer of it to him  no said beechnut i believe he did not  then i agree to accept it now said phonny and that gives me the first claim  beechnut did not answer to this proposal but went on harnessing the horse when the horse was all ready he gathered up the reins and stood a moment just before getting into the wagon in a thoughtful attitude  well now phonny said he here is a great law question to be settled whether you or stuyvesant has the best right to the contract go and ask stuyvesant to come to the shopdoor  so beechnut got into the wagon and drove out of the shed and along the yard until he came to the shopdoor and there he stopped phonny and stuyvesant were standing in front of the door  stuyvesant said beechnut here is a perplexing case phonny wants to have the care of the henhouse on the same terms i offered it to you you did not tell me whether you would take it or not  no said stuyvesant i was going to tell you that i would take it but if phonny wants it i am willing to give it up to him  and you phonny said beechnut are willing i suppose if stuyvesant wants it to give it up to him  whyyes said phonny in saying this however phonny seemed to speak quite reluctantly and doubtfully  thats right said beechnut each of you is willing to give up to the other but now before we can tell on which side the giving up is to be we must first decide on which side the right is so that you see we have got the quarrel into a very pretty shape now the question is which of you can have the pleasure and privilege of giving up to the other instead of which shall be compelled to give up against his will so you see it is now a very pleasant sort of a quarrel  no said phonny it is not any such thing a quarrel is not pleasant ever  oh yes said beechnut one of the greatest pleasures of life is to quarrel we can not possibly get along without quarrels the only thing that we can do is to get them in as good shape as possible  have you got a pencil and paper in your shop continued beechnut  yes said phonny  bring them out to me  phonny brought out a pencil and a small piece of paper and held them up to beechnut in the wagon  now boys said beechnut are you willing to submit this case to mr wallace for his decision  yes said phonny  i am too said stuyvesant  then ill write a statement of it said beechnut  beechnut accordingly placed the paper upon the seat of the wagon beside him and began to write in a few minutes he held up the paper and read as follows       a has a certain contract which he is willing to offer to      either b or c whichever has the prior right to it he      first offered it to b but before b accepted the offer c      made application for it c immediately accepted the offer      before a decided upon bs application now the question is      whose claim is best in respect simply of prioritythe one      to whom it was first offered or the one who first      signified his willingness to accept of it  there said beechnut there is a simple statement of the case  i dont understand it very well said phonny  dont you said beechnut then ill read it again  so beechnut began again  a has a certain contract  here beechnut paused and looked up at the boys  a means beechnut said stuyvesant  then why dont you say beechnut said phonny  and the contract continued stuyvesant is the agreement about the hens  which he is willing to offer continued beechnut to either b or c  that is either to you or me said stuyvesant  yes said phonny i understand so far but what is that about priority  priority said beechnut means precedence in respect to time  that is harder to understand than priority said phonny  the question is continued beechnut which must be considered as first in order of time the one who had the offer first or the one who accepted first  the one who accepted first said phonny  you are not to decide the question said beechnut i was only explaining to you what the question is you must carry the paper to mr wallace and get his opinion  but beechnut said phonny why dont you tell him all about it just as it was instead of making up such a story about a b and c and priority  why when we refer a case to an umpire for decision said beechnut it is always best when we can to state the principle of the question in general terms so that he can decide it in the abstract without knowing who the real parties are and how they are to be affected by his decision heres mr wallace now who would not like very well to decide in favor of his brother and against you even if he thought that his brother was in the right but by not letting him know any thing but the general principle he can decide just as he thinks without fear that you would think him partial  well said phonny i will carry him the paper  you must only give him the paper said beechnut and not tell him any thing about the case yourself  no said phonny i will not  for if you do continued beechnut he will know who the parties are and then he will not like to decide the question  well said phonny i will not tell him  let stuyvesant go with you said beechnut  well said phonny  phonny accordingly took the paper and went into the house with stuyvesant he led the way up into his cousin wallaces room he found wallace seated at his table in his alcove where he usually studied the curtains were both up which was the signal that phonny might go and speak to him  phonny and stuyvesant accordingly walked up to the table and wallace asked them if they wished to speak to him  illustration the appeal  phonny handed him the paper  there said he is a case for you to decide  wallace took the paper and read it he said nothing but seemed for a moment to be thinking on the subject and then he took his pen and wrote several lines under the question phonny supposed that he was writing his answer  after his writing was finished wallace folded up the paper and told phonny that he must not read it until he had given it to beechnut  how did you know that it was from beechnut said phonny  i knew by the handwriting said wallace besides i knew that there was nobody else here who would have referred such a question to me in such a scientific way  so phonny took the paper and carried it down to beechnut  beechnut opened it and read aloud as follows       my judgment is that it would depend upon whether b had a      reasonable time to consider and decide upon the offer      before c came forward in all cases of making an offer it      is implied that reasonable time is allowed to consider it  the question is then boys said beechnut whether stuyvesant had had a reasonable time to consider my offer before phonny came forward what do you think about that phonny  why yes said phonny he had an hour  stuyvesant said nothing  i will think about that while i am riding said beechnut and tell you what i conclude upon it when i return perhaps we shall have to refer that question to mr wallace too  so beechnut drove away and the boys went back into the shop here they resumed their work of putting the tools in order and while doing so they continued their conversation about the question of priority  i think said phonny that you had abundance of time to consider whether you would accept the offer  we might leave that question to wallace too said stuyvesant  yes said phonny lets go now and ask him  well said stuyvesant i am willing  only said phonny we must not tell him what the question is about  no said stuyvesant  so the boys went together up to wallaces room they found him in his alcove as before they advanced to the table and wallace looked up to them to hear what they had to say  b had an hour to consider of his offer said phonny dont you think that that was enough  phonny was very indiscreet indeed in asking the question in that form for it showed at once that whatever might be the subject of the discussion he was not himself the person represented by b it was now no longer possible for wallace to look at the question purely in its abstract character  now i know said wallace which is b and of course you may as well tell me all about it  phonny looked at stuyvesant with an expression of surprise and concern upon his countenance  no matter said stuyvesant let us tell him the whole story  phonny accordingly explained to wallace that the contract related to the care of the henhouse and the hensthat it was first offered to stuyvesant that stuyvesant did not accept it for an hour or two and that in the course of that time he phonny had himself applied for it he concluded by asking wallace if he did not think that an hour was a reasonable time  the question said wallace how much it is necessary to allow for a reasonable time depends upon the nature of the subject that the offer relates to if two persons were writing at a table and one of them were to offer the other six wafers in exchange for a steel pen five minutes or even one minute might be a reasonable time to allow him for decision on the other hand in buying a house two or three days would not be more than would be reasonable now i think in such a case as this any person who should receive such an offer as beechnut made ought to have time enough to consider the whole subject fairly he would wish to see the henhouse to examine its condition to consider how long it would take him to put it in order and how much trouble the care of the hens would make him afterward he would also want to know how many eggs he was likely to receive and to consider whether these would be return enough for all his trouble now it does not seem to me that one hour coming too just when stuyvesant was called away to dinner could be considered a reasonable time he ought to have a fair opportunity when the offer is once made to him to consider it and decide understandingly whether he would accept it or not  well said phonny with a sigh i suppose i must give it up  so he and stuyvesant walked back to the shop together     chapter vii  the work shop   when the boys entered the shop door the first thing for phonny to do was to look and see if his trap was safe it was safe it remained standing upon the horseblock where he had placed it  and now said phonny the question is where i am to find a box for a cage i must go and look about  and i must go and look at my henhouse said stuyvesant  phonny proposed that stuyvesant should go with him to find a box and then help him make a cage and after that he would go he said and help stuyvesant about the repairs of the henhouse  i must go and look at the henhouse first said stuyvesant i can do that while you are finding the box and then i will help you  well said phonny buton the whole i will go with you to look at it and then you can go with me to find the box  so the boys walked along toward the henhouse together  when they came to the place they went in and stuyvesant proceeded to examine the premises very thoroughly there were two doors of admission one was a large one for men and boys to go in at the other was a very small one a square hole in fact rather than a door and was intended for the hens  this small opening had once been fitted with a sort of lid which was attached by leather hinges on its upper edge to a wooden bar or cleat nailed to the side of the house just over the square hole this lid formed of course a sort of door opening outward and upward when up it could be fastened in that position by means of a wooden button the button and the bar of wood remained in its place but the door was gone  where is the door asked stuyvesant after he had examined all this very carefully  why i took it off said phonny to make a little stool of i wanted a square board just about that size  and did you make a stool asked stuyvesant  no said phonny i found that i could not bore the holes for the legs i tried to bore a hole but i split the board  then i must find another piece of board somewhere said stuyvesant  stuyvesant next turned his attention to the great door he swung it to and fro to see if the hinges were in order they were next he shut it but he found there was nothing to keep it shut  there used to be a button said phonny  where is the button now asked stuyvesant  i dont know said he let me seeit must be about here somewhere  so saying phonny began to look around upon the ground there was some litter upon the ground formed of sticks straws c and phonny began to poke this litter about with his foot  i saw it lying down here somewhere once said he but i cant find it now  why didnt you pick it up and put it away in some safe place said stuyvesant or get it put on  why i dont know said phonny you see we dont want to shut up the hens much in the summer  no replied stuyvesant but it is a great deal better to have the doors all in order  why is it better asked phonny  it is more satisfactory said stuyvesant  satisfactory repeated phonny hoh  stuyvesant went into the henhouse phonny followed him in  it was a small room with a loft upon one side of it the floor was covered with sticks straw and litter in one corner was a barrel three quarters filled with hay there were two or three bars overhead for the hens to roost upon stuyvesant looked around upon all these objects for a few minutes in silence and then pointing up to the loft he asked  what is up there  that is the loft replied phonny there is nothing up there  how do you get up to see asked stuyvesant  i cant get up except when beechnut is here to boost me said phonny  i mean to make a ladder said stuyvesant  hoh said phonny you cant make a ladder  i will try at any rate said stuyvesant then after a short pause and a little more looking around he added  well i am ready now to go and help you find your box i see what i have got to do here  what is it asked phonny  i have got a small door to make and a button for the large door and a ladder to get up to the loft then i have got to clear the henhouse all out and put it in order what is in this barrel  that is where the hens lay sometimes said phonny when they dont lay in the barn  so saying phonny walked into the corner where the barrel stood and there he found three eggs in the nest  three eggs said he i think dorothy has not been out here today that is the beginning of your profits you can take two of them we have to leave one for the nestegg  phonny proposed that stuyvesant should carry the eggs in and give them to dorothy but he said he would not do it then he would leave them where they were for the present and go and look for the box stuyvesant was intending to look at the same time for the materials necessary for his door his ladder and his button  phonny accordingly led the way and stuyvesant followed into various apartments in the barns and sheds where lumber was stored or where it might be expected to be found there were several boxes in these places but some were too large and others too small and one which seemed about right in respect to size was made of rough boards and so phonny thought that it would not do  at last he found some boxes under a cornbarn one of which he thought would do very well it was about two feet long when laid down upon its side and one foot wide and high the open part was to be closed by a wire front which was yet to be made  now said phonny help me to get the box to the shop and then wallace is coming down to help me make it into a cage  so phonny and stuyvesant working together got the box into the shop the bench had been cleared off so that there was a good space there to put the box upon phonny and stuyvesant placed it there and then phonny went to the trap to see if his squirrel was safe  now frink said he we are going to make you a beautiful cage wait a little longer and then we will let you out of that dark trap  phonny said this as he passed across the floor toward the horseblock as soon however as he came near to the trap he suddenly called out to stuyvesant  why stuyvesant see how big this hole is  he referred to the hole which the squirrel had begun to gnaw somehow or other the opening had grown very large phonny stooped down with his hands upon his knees and peeped into the trap  the squirrel was gone  hes gone said phonny hes gone so saying he lifted up the lid gradually and then holding out the empty trap to stuyvesant he exclaimed again in a tone of despairhes gone  he gnawed out said stuyvesant  yes said phonny  there were two windows in phonnys shop one was over the work bench and was an ordinary window formed with sashes the other was merely a large square hole with a sort of lid or shutter opening upward and outward like the small door of the henhouse phonny used to call this his shutter window it was the place where he was accustomed to throw out his shavings  of course there was no glass in this window and nothing to keep out the wind and rain when it was open in stormy weather therefore it was always kept shut the shavings which phonny threw out here formed a little pile outside and after accumulating for some time phonny used to carry them away and burn them  as phonny stood showing the empty cage to stuyvesant his back was turned toward this window but stuyvesant was facing it happening at that instant to glance upward behold there was the squirrel perched at his ease upon a beam which passed along just over the window  stuyvesant did not say a word but pointed to the place phonny looked up and saw the squirrel  illustration frink on the beam  oooooo said phonny  shut the window he exclaimed let us shut the window quick he added impatiently and then creeping softly up to the place he took hold of the prop which held the shutter up and gently drawing it in he let the shutter down into its place  shut the other window said phonny climb up on the bench stivy and shut the other window as quick as you can  stuyvesant clambered up upon the bench and shut down the sash of the window  now for the door said phonny and he ran to the door and shut it looking round as he went toward the squirrel as soon as he got the door shut he seemed relieved  there said he we have got him safe the only thing now is to catch him  here followed quite a long consultation between the two boys in respect to the course which it was now best to pursue phonnys first plan was to put the trap upon the table and then for him and stuyvesant to drive the squirrel into it stuyvesant however thought that that would be a very difficult operation  if the squirrel were a horse said he and the trap a barn we might possibly get him in but as it is i dont believe the thing can be done  phonny next proposed to chase the squirrel round the shop until they caught him stuyvesant objected to this too  we should frighten him said he and make him very wild and besides we might hurt him dreadfully in catching and holding him very likely we should pull his tail off  after considerable consultation the boys concluded to let the squirrel remain for a time at liberty in the shop taking care to keep the door and windows shut they thought that by this means he would become accustomed to see them working about and would grow tame perhaps so tame that byandby phonny might catch him in his hand  and then besides said phonny we can set the trap for him here tonight when we go away and perhaps he will go into it and get caught so before morning  then we mustnt feed him any this afternoon said stuyvesant he wont go into the trap tonight unless he is hungry  well said phonny we wont feed him i will leave him to himself and let him do what he pleases and ill go to work and make my cage  phonnys plan for his cage was this stuyvesant helped him form it he was to take some wire a coil of which he found hanging up in the shed and cut it into lengths suitable for the bars of his cage then he was going to bore a row of holes in the top of his box near the front edge with a small gimlet these holes were to be about half an inch apart and to be in a line about half an inch from the front edge of the top of the box the wires were to be passed down through these holes and then in the bottom of the box at the points where the ends of those wires would come respectively he was to bore other holes partly through the board to serve as sockets to receive the lower ends of the wires  this plan being all agreed upon phonny climbed up upon the bench with his gimlet in his hand and taking his seat upon the box was beginning to bore the holes  stop said stuyvesant you ought to draw a line and mark off the places first  oh no said phonny i can guess near enough  well said stuyvesant though i dont think that guessing is a good way  phonny thought that it would take a great while to draw a line and measure off the distances and so he went on with his boring looking up however continually from his work to watch the squirrel  and now said stuyvesant i will begin my work  stuyvesant accordingly went out taking great care as he opened and shut the door not to let the squirrel escape presently he returned bringing his materials there was a short board for the small door two long strips for the sides of the ladder and another long strip which was to be sawed up into lengths for the crossbars  stuyvesant began first with his door he went out to the henhouse carrying with him an instrument called a square on which feet and inches were marked with this he measured the hole which his door was to cover and then making proper allowance for the extension of the door laterally beyond the hole he determined on the length to which he would saw off his board he determined on the breadth in the same way  he then went to the shop and sawed off the board to the proper length and then with the hatchet and plane he trimmed it to the proper breadth next he made two hinges of leather and nailed them on in their places upon the upper side of the board he then carried his work out to the henhouse and nailed the ends of the hinges to the crossbar provided for them when this was all done he turned the lid up and fastened it into its place  then standing up he surveyed his work with a look of satisfaction and said  there  he returned to the shop again when he came to the door he opened it a very little way and paused calling out to phonny to know if the squirrel was anywhere near  no said phonny come in  so he went in the squirrel had run along the beams to the back part of the shop and was nibbling about there among some blocks of wood  i have a great mind to feed him said phonny he is hungry  well said stuyvesant  so phonny took the ear of corn out of the trap and breaking it into two or three pieces he carried the parts into the back part of the shop and put them at different places on the beams then he crept back to his work again  stuyvesant went to work making his button he selected a proper piece of wood sawed it off of the proper length and then shaped it into the form of a button by means of a chisel working in doing this at the bench as soon as this operation was completed he took a large gimlet and bored a hole through the center of the button he measured very carefully to find the exact center of the button before he began to bore  when the button was finished stuyvesant looked in phonnys nailbox to find a large screw and when he had found one he took the screwdriver and went out to the henhouse and screwed the button on when the screw was driven home to its place stuyvesant shut the door and buttoned it then standing before it with his screwdriver in his hand he surveyed his work with another look of satisfaction and said  there there are two good jobs done  he then opened and shut his two doors both the large and the small one to see once more whether they worked well they did work perfectly well so he turned away and went back toward the shop again saying  now for the ladder  he went back to the shop and entered cautiously as before he found that phonny had bored quite a number of holes and was now engaged in cutting his wire into lengths he used for this purpose a pair of cuttingplyers as they are called an instrument formed much like a pair of nippers the instrument was made expressly for cutting off wire  stuyvesant came to the place where phonny was at work and stood near him a few minutes looking on he perceived that the holes were not in a straight line nor were they equidistant from each other he however said nothing about it but soon went to his own work again  he took the piece of wood which he had selected to make his crossbars of and began to consider how many crossbars he could make from it  what is that piece of wood for asked phonny  it is for the crossbars of my ladder said stuyvesant  the crossbars of a ladder ought to be round said phonny they always make them round in fact they call them rounds  yes said stuyvesant i know they do but i cant make rounds very well and besides if i could i could not make the holes in the sidepieces to put them into so i am going to make them square and nail them right on  hoh said phonny that is no way to make a ladder you can bore the holes easily enough here ill show you how ive got an auger  so saying phonny jumped down from the bench and went and climbed up upon the choppingblock to get down an auger phonny had two augers and they both hung over the block he took down one and began very eagerly to bore a hole into the side of the choppingblock he bored in a little way and then in attempting to draw the auger out to clear the hole of chips the handle came off leaving the auger itself fast in the hole  ah this auger is broken said phonny i forgot that i could bore a hole if the auger was not broken  never mind said stuyvesant i dont think i could make a ladder very well in that way and dont like to undertake any thing that i cant accomplish so i will make it my way  stuyvesant went out to the henhouse and measured the height of the loft he found it to be seven feet he concluded to have his ladder eight feet long and to have six crossbars one foot apart the upper and lower crossbars to be one foot from the ends of the ladder the crossbars themselves being about two inches wide each the breadth of the whole six would be just one foot this stuyvesant calculated would make just the eight feet  stuyvesant then went back to the shop he found that the pieces which he had chosen for the sides of the ladder were just about eight feet long  phonny came to him while he was measuring to see what he was going to do  how wide are you going to have your ladder said he  i dont know said stuyvesant i am going to have it as wide as i can  so saying stuyvesant took down the piece which he had intended for the crossbars  i am going to divide this into six equal parts said he because i must have six bars  so stuyvesant began to measure the piece of wood he found was eight feet longthe same as the side pieces of the ladder  and now how are you going to divide it said phonny  why eight feet said stuyvesant make ninetysix inches i must divide that by six  so he took a pencil from his pocket and wrote down the figures 96 upon a board he divided the number by 6  it will go 16 times said he i can have 16 inches for each cross bar  stuyvesant then measured off sixteen inches and made a mark then he measured off sixteen inches more and made another mark in the same manner he proceeded until he had divided the whole piece into portions of sixteen inches each he then took a saw and sawed the piece off at every place where he had marked  there said he there are my crossbars  what good crossbars said phonny that was an excellent way to make them     chapter viii  a discovery   while the boys were at work in this manner stuyvesant making his ladder and phonny his cage they suddenly heard some one opening the door wallace came in phonny called out to him to shut the door as quick as possible wallace did so while phonny in explanation of the urgency of his injunction in respect to the door pointed up to the squirrel which was then creeping along apparently quite at his ease upon one of the beams in the back part of the shop  why bunny said wallace  his name is not bunny said phonny his name is frink  frink repeated wallace who invented that name  i dont know replied phonny only beechnut said that his name was frink see the cage i am making for him  wallace came up and looked at the cage he stood a moment surveying it in silence then he turned toward stuyvesant  and what is stuyvesant doing said he  he is making a ladder  what is it for stuyvesant said wallace  why it is to go upon the loft in the henhouse said phonny though i dont see what good it will do to go up there  so it is settled that you are going to have the henhouse said wallace looking toward stuyvesant  yes said stuyvesant  here there was another long pause wallace was looking at the ladder he observed how carefully stuyvesant was making it he saw that the crossbars were all exactly of a length and he knew that they must have been pretty accurately measured while wallace was looking on stuyvesant was measuring off the distances upon the side pieces of the ladder so as to have the steps of equal length wallace observed that he did this all very carefully  wallace then looked back to phonnys work he saw that phonny was guessing his way along the holes were not equidistant from each other and then they were not at the same distance from the edge of the board as he had advanced along the line he had drawn gradually nearer and nearer to the edge and what was a still greater difficulty the holes in the lower board which was to form the bottom of the cage since their places too had been guessed at did not correspond with those above so that the wires when they came to be put in inclined some this way and some that in some places the wires came very near together and in others the spaces between them were so wide that wallace thought that the squirrel if by any chance he should ever get put into the cage would be very likely to squeeze his way out  then besides phonny had not measured his wires in respect to length but had cut them off of various lengths taking care however not to have any of them too short the result was that the ends of the wires projected to various distances above the board presenting a ragged and unworkmanlike appearance  wallace was silent while he was looking at these things he was thinking of the difference between the two boys the train of thought which was passing through his mind was somewhat as follows  stuyvesant is younger than phonny and he was brought up in a city and yet he seems a great deal more of a man which is very strange in the first place he takes a great deal more interest in the hens which are useful and productive animals than he does in the squirrel which is a mere plaything then he plans his work carefully considers how much he can probably accomplish himself and undertakes no more he plans he calculates he measures and then proceeds steadily and perseveringly till he finishes  in the midst of these reflections wallace was called away by phonny as follows  cousin wallace i wish you would finish my cage for me i am tired of boring all these holes and besides i cant bore them straight  wallace looked at the work a moment in uncertainty he did not like to throw away his own time in finishing an undertaking so clumsily begun and on the other hand he did not like very well to refuse to help phonny out of his difficulties he finally concluded to undertake the work so he took the cage down from the bench and put it upon the floor he borrowed the iron square and the compasses from stuyvesant he ruled a line along the top of the box at the right distance from the edge and marked off places for the holes half an inch apart along this line pricking in at the places for the holes deep with one of the points of the compass when this had all been done he went on boring the holes  stuyvesant was now ready to nail the crossbars to the side pieces of the ladder he asked phonny where he kept his nails phonny showed him a box where there was a great quantity of nails of all sizes some crooked and some straight some whole and some broken and all mixed up in confusion with a mass of old iron such as rings parts of hinges old locks and fragments of keys stuyvesant selected from this mass a nail of the size that he thought was proper and then went to his ladder to apply it to see whether it would do  it is too large said phonny  no said stuyvesant it is just right i want the nail to go through and come out on the other side so that i can clinch it  you cant clinch such nails as these said phonny they are cut nails and they will break off if you try to clinch them  but i shall soften them first said stuyvesant  soften them said phonny how can you do that  by putting them in the fire said stuyvesant  he cant soften them can he wallace said phonny  yes said wallace he can soften them so that they will clinch  this was true what are called cutnails are made by machinery they are cut from flatbars or plates of iron almost redhot by a massive and ponderous engine carried by water at the same instant that the nail is cut off from the end of the plate by the cutting part of the engine the end of it is flattened into a head by another part which comes up suddenly and compresses the iron at that end with prodigious force the nail is then dropped and it falls down all hot into a box made to receive it below  the prodigious pressure to which the hot iron is subjected in the process of making cutnails seems as it were to press the particles of iron closer together and make the metal more compact and hard the consequence is that such nails are very stiff and if bent much they break off this is no disadvantage provided that the wood to be nailed is such that the nail is to be driven straight into the substance of it to its whole length in fact this hardness and stiffness is an advantage for in consequence of these properties the nail is less likely to bend under the hammer  when however the nailing to be done is of such a kind that it becomes necessary that the nail should pass through the wood so as to come out upon the other side to be clinched there the stiffness of the iron in a cutnail constitutes a serious difficulty for the end of the nail where it comes through instead of bending over and sinking into the wood as it ought to do at first refuses to bend at all and then when the workman attempts to force it to bond by dint of heavier blows with the hammer it breaks off entirely  to remedy this difficulty it is found best to heat nails intended for clinching before driving them by heating the iron red hot the metal seems to expand to its original condition of ductile iron and it loses the extreme hardness and stiffness which was given to it by the force and compression of the nailmaking machine  stuyvesant had seen a carpenter in new york heating some nails on one occasion and he had asked him the reason he therefore understood the whole process and his plan was now after selecting his nails to go and heat them redhot in the kitchenfire  he made a little calculation first in respect to the number of nails that he should want there were six crossbars these bars were to be nailed at both ends this would make twelve nailings stuyvesant concluded that he would have four nails at each nailing and multiplying twelve by four he found that fortyeight was the number of the nails that he should require to be sure to have enough he counted out fiftytwo some might break and perhaps some would be lost in the fire  phonny felt a considerable degree of interest in stuyvesants plan of softening the nails and so he left wallace to go on boring the holes while he went with stuyvesant into the house  you never can get so many nails out of the fire in the world said phonny they will be lost in the ashes  i shall put them on the shovel said stuyvesant  when they got into the kitchen stuyvesant went to dorothy who was still ironing at a table near the window and asked her if he might use her shovel and her fire to heat some nails  certainly said dorothy i will go and move the flatirons out of the way for you  stuyvesant was always very particular whenever he went into the kitchen to treat dorothy with great respect he regarded the kitchen as dorothys peculiar and proper dominion and would have considered it very rude and wrong to have been noisy in it or to take possession of and use without her leave the things which were under her charge there dorothy observed this and was very much pleased with it and as might naturally be expected she was always glad to have stuyvesant come into the kitchen and do any thing that he pleased there  there was a large forestick lying across the andirons with a burning bed of coals below directly in front of these coals was a row of flatirons stuyvesant put his nails upon a longhandled shovel and dorothy moved away one of the flatirons so that he could put the shovel with the nails upon it in among the burning coals  now said he it will take some time for them to get hot and i will go and clear out the floor of the henhouse in the meanwhile  well said phonny i will help you  only said stuyvesant turning to dorothy will you look at the nails when you take up your irons and if you see that they get redhot take the shovel out from the coals and set it down somewhere on the hearth to cool  yes said dorothy but what are you going to heat the nails for  to take the stiffness out of them said stuyvesant  to take the stiffness out replied dorothy what do you wish to do that for  so that i can clinch them replied stuyvesant and i should like to have you take them off the fire as soon as you see that they are redhot  illustration dorothys fire  yes said dorothy i will  so phonny and stuyvesant went away while dorothy resumed her ironing  they got a wheelbarrow and a rake and went out to the henhouse they raked the floor all over drawing out the old straw sticks c to the door they then with a fork pitched this rubbish into the wheelbarrow and wheeled it out and made a heap of it in a clear place at some distance from the buildings intending to set it on fire there were four wheelbarrow loads of it in all  they then went into the barn and brought out a quantity of hay and sprinkled it all over the floor of the henhouse which made the apartment look extremely neat and comfortable they then brought out another forkfull of hay and pitched it up upon the loft  there said stuyvesant now when we have got our ladder done we will climb up and spread it about  hark said phonny  what is that said stuyvesant  it sounded like a hen clucking i wonder if it is possible that there is a hen up there  we will see said stuyvesant when we get our ladder done  yes said phonny we must go and finish our ladder and the nailsit is time to go and get the nails or they will be all burnt up  the boys accordingly went back to the kitchen they found that dorothy had taken the nails away from the fire and they were now almost cool stuyvesant slid them off from the shovel upon a small board which he had brought in for that purpose and then they went back to the shop  they found that wallace had gone he had finished boring the holes and now all that phonny had to do was to cut off the wires and put them in he had however now become so much interested in the operation of making the ladder that he concluded to put off finishing the cage until the ladder was done besides he was in a hurry to see whether there really was a hen up there on the loft  so he helped stuyvesant nail his ladder stuyvesant got a small gimlet to bore holes for the nails phonny thought that this was not necessary he said they could drive the nails without boring stuyvesant said that there were three objections to this first they might not go straight secondly they might split the wood and thirdly they would cause the wood to break out as he called it where they came through on the other side  as soon as he had bored one hole he put a nail into it and drove it almost through but not quite through as he said it might prove that he should wish to alter it he then went to the other end of the same crossbar bored a hole there and put a nail in driving it as far as he had driven the first one this was the topmost crossbar of the ladder and it was held securely in its place by the two nails stuyvesant then took the bottom crossbar and secured that in the same way then he put on the other bars one at a time until his ladder was complete in form only the crossbars were not yet fully nailed he and phonny looked at it carefully to see if all was right and stuyvesant taking it up from the floor placed it against the wall of the shop  let me climb up on it said phonny  not now said stuyvesantwait till it is finished  stuyvesant then proceeded to drive the nails home and clinch them the clinching was done by putting an axe under the part of the ladder where a nail was coming through and then driving the point of the nail when it reached the axe was deflected and turned and bending round entered the wood again on the back side and so clinched the nail firmly thus the other holes were bored and the other nails put in and at length the ladder was completed  just as the boys were ready to carry it out the door opened and beechnut came in  beechnut looked round at all that the boys had been doing with great interest he examined the ladder particularly and said that it was made in a very workmanlike manner phonny showed beechnut his cage too though he said that he had pretty much concluded not to finish it that afternoon  i dont see why you need finish it at all said beechnut you have got a very good cage already for your squirrel  what cage asked phonny  this shop it is a great deal better cage for him than that boxi think and i have no doubt that he thinks so too  he would gnaw out of this shop said phonny  not any more easily than he would gnaw out of the box said beechnut  phonny turned to his box and looked at the smooth surface of the pine which formed the interior he perceived that frink could gnaw through anywhere easily in an hour  i did not think of that said phonny i must line it with tin  he began to picture to his mind the process of putting his arm into the box and nailing tin there where there was no room to work a hammer and sighed  well said he ill let him have the whole shop tonight and now we will go out and try the ladder  the whole party accordingly went to the henhouse beechnut examined the small door that stuyvesant had made and the button of the large door while stuyvesant was planting the ladder phonny was eager to go up first stuyvesant followed him  phonny mounted upon the floor of the loft and immediately afterward began to exclaim  oooostivyhere is old gipsy on a nest and i verily believe that she is setting i could not think what had become of old gipsy  just at this time beechnuts head appeared coming up the ladder he called upon the boys to come back away from the hen while he went up to see she was upon a nest there squatted down very low and with her wings spread wide as if trying to cover a great nest full of eggs  yes said beechnut she is setting i have no doubt and as she has been missing a long time i presume the chickens are about coming out  hark said beechnut  the boys listened and they heard a faint peeping sound under the hen  beechnut looked toward the boys and smiled  phonny was in an ecstacy of delight stuyvesant was much more quiet but he seemed equally pleased beechnut said that he thought that they had better go away and leave the hen to herself and that probably she would come off the nest with her brood that evening or the next morning  but stop said beechnut as he was going down the ladder it is important to ascertain whether they are eggs or chickens under the hen for if they are eggs they are one third your property and if they are chickens they are all mine  however he resumed after a moments pause i think we will call them eggs today i presume they were all eggs when we made the bargain tomorrow we will get them all down and you phonny may make a pretty little coop for them in some sunny corner in the yard  phonny had by this time become so much interested in the poultry that he proposed to stuyvesant to let him have half the care of them and offered to give stuyvesant half of his squirrel in return stuyvesant said that he did not care about the squirrel but that he would give him a share of the henhouse contract for half the shop  phonny gladly agreed to this and so the boys determined that the first thing for the next day should be to put the shop and the tools all in complete order and the next to make the prettiest hencoop they could contrive in a corner of the yard this they did and beechnut got the hen and the chickens down and put them into it the brood was very large there being twelve chickens in it and they were all very pretty chickens indeed     chapter ix  the accident   about a week after the occurrences related in the last chapter mrs henry was sitting one morning at her window at work it was a large and beautiful window opening out upon a piazza  the window came down nearly to the floor so that when it was open one could walk directly out there was a sort of step however which it was necessary to go over  mrs henry had a little table at the window and she was busy at her work there was a basket on the floor by her side malleville was sitting upon the step she had quite a number of green leaves in her lap which she had gathered in the yard she said that she was going to put them into a book and press them  just then she heard phonnys voice around a corner calling to her  malleville malleville said the voice calling loudly  malleville hastily gathered up her leaves and called out what phonny im coming  before she got ready to go however phonny appeared upon the piazza  malleville said he come and see our chickens  well said malleville i will come  and mother i wish you would come out and see them too said phonny  i have seen them once said his mother only two or three days ago  but mother they are a great deal larger now replied phonny i wish you could come and see them you dont know how large they have grown  very well said mrs henry i will come  so she laid aside her work and stepping out into the piazza she followed phonny and malleville around the corner of the house phonny walked fast with long strides malleville skipped along by his side while mrs henry came on after them at her leisure  they all gathered round the coop which had been made in a sunny corner of the yard it was a very pretty coop indeed it was formed by a box turned bottom upward to form a shelter for the hen when she chose to retire to it and a little yard with a paling around it made by bars to prevent the chickens from straying away phonny said that there was a good comfortable nest in under the box and he was going to lift up the box and let mrs henry see the nest but stuyvesant recommended to him not to do so as it would frighten the hen  there was an opening in the side of the box which served as a door for the hen to go in and out at at the time of mrs henrys visit the hen was out in the yard walking about she appeared to be a little anxious at seeing so unusual a company of visitors at her lodgings and at first thought it probable that they might have come to take some of her chickens away but when she found that they stood quietly by and did not disturb her she became quiet again and began to scratch upon the ground to find something for the chickens to eat  seeing this phonny ran off to bring some food for them and presently returned with a saucer full of what he called pudding it consisted of meal and water stirred up together he threw out some of this upon the ground within the yard and the hen calling the chickens to the place scattered the pudding about with her bill for the chickens to eat  the boys then wished to have mrs henry go to the shop she accordingly went with them they opened the shopdoor very carefully to keep frink from getting out when they were all safely in and the door was shut they began to look about the room to find the squirrel there he is said phonny pointing to the beam over the shutterwindow  so saying he went to the place and putting up his hand took the squirrel and brought him to his mother  why how tame he is said mrs henry  yes said phonny stuyvesant and i tamed him he runs all about the shop and we have got a house for him to sleep in come and see his house  so saying phonny led his mother and malleville to the back side of the shop where upon a shelf there stood a small box with a hole in the side of it much like the one which had been made for the hen only not so large  he goes in there to sleep said phonny we always feed him in there too so as to make him like the place  as phonny said this he put the squirrel down upon the beam before the door of his house  now you will see him go in said he  frink crept into his hole and then turning round within the box he put his head out a little way and after looking at mrs henry a moment with one eye he winked in a very cunning manner  there was a small paper tacked up with little nails on the side of the squirrels house near the door  what is this said mrs henry  oh thats his poetry said phonny you must read it  so mrs henry standing up near read aloud as follows             my name is frink            and unless you think      to give me plenty to eat and drink            youll find me running away                  some day            i shall tip you a wink            then slyly slink      out through some secret cranny or chink            and hie for the woods away                  away  mrs henry laughed heartily at this production she asked who wrote it  why we found it here one morning said phonny stuyvesant says that he thinks beechnut wrote it  but beechnut added malleville says that he believes that frink wrote it himself  oh no said stuyvesant he did not say exactly that  what did he say asked mrs henry  why he said replied stuyvesant that as there was a pen and ink in the shop and hammer and nails and as the paper was found nailed up early one morning when nobody had slept in the shop the night before but frink if it did not turn out that frink himself wrote the lines he should never believe in any squirrels writing poetry as long as he lived  mrs henry laughed at this and she then began to look about the shop to see the tools and the arrangements which had been made by the boys for their work  she found the premises in excellent order the floor was neat the tools were all in their proper places and every thing seemed well arranged  i suppose the tools are dull however said mrs henry as boys tools generally are  no said phonny they are all sharp we have sharpened them every one  how did you do it asked mrs henry  why we turned the grindstone for beechnut while he ground his axes and then he held our tools for us to sharpen them we could not hold them ourselves very well  we are going to keep them sharp continued phonnyas sharp as razors wont we stivy  we are going to try it said stuyvesant  phonny took up the plane to show his mother how sharp it was  yes said she i like that tool too very muchit is so safe  the plane is a very safe tool indeed for the cutting part which consists of a plate of iron faced with steel for an edge is almost embedded in the wood it is made in fact on purpose to take off a thin shaving only from a board and it would be impossible to make a deep cut into any thing with it  phonny then showed his mother his chisels he had four chisels of different sizes they were very sharp  it seems to me that a chisel is not so safe a tool as a plane said mrs henry  why not mother asked phonny  why you might be holding a piece of wood with your fingers and then in trying to cut it with the chisel the chisel might slip and cut your fingers  oh no mother said phonny there is no danger  boys always say there is no danger  phonny next showed his gimlets and his augers and his bits and bitstocks a bit is a kind of borer which is turned round and round by means of a machine called a bitstock  phonny took the bitstock and a bit and was going to bore a hole in the side of the bench by way of showing his mother how the tool was used  stop said stuyvesant i would not bore into the work bench i will get a piece of board  so he pulled out a small piece of board from under the work bench and phonny bored into that  mrs henry next came to the chopping block the hatchet was lying upon the block  i am rather sorry to see that you have got a hatchet said mrs henry  why mother asked phonny  because i think it is a dangerous tool i think it is a very dangerous tool indeed  oh no mother said phonny there is no danger  you might be holding a piece of wood in your hand said mrs henry and then in trying to chop it with your hatchet hit your hand instead of the wood there is great danger when you strike a blow with a sharp instrument  oh no mother said phonny there is not any danger i have had my hatchet a long time and i never have cut myself but once  that shows that there is some danger said his mother besides i knew a boy who was cutting with a hatchet and it came down through the board that he was cutting and struck the boy himself in the knee and wounded him very badly  but i shall be very careful said phonny i know i shall not cut myself with it  i wish said his mother that you would let me have the hatchet to carry in the house and keep it till you grow older  oh no mother said phonny we could not get along at all without the hatchet unless we had an axe and that would be more dangerous still but we will be very careful with it  mrs henry did not appear satisfied with these promises but she did not urge phonny any longer to give the hatchet to her she walked along seeming however not at all at her ease phonny showed her his stock of boards and blocks among which last was one which he said was to be made into a boat after looking around at all these things mrs henry and malleville went away phonny and stuyvesant remained in the shop  i would let her have the hatchet said stuyvesant  i dont think there is any danger said phonny  nor i said stuyvesant  then why would not you keep the hatchet here asked phonny  because aunt henry does not feel easy about it said stuyvesant it is not right for us to make her feel uncomfortable  but then what shall we do when we want to sharpen stakes asked phonny  i dont know said stuyvesantthinking perhaps we might burn them sharp in the kitchen fire  hoh said phonny that would not do at all  it would be better than to make aunt henry feel anxious said stuyvesant  but i dont think she feels anxious said phonny she will forget all about it pretty soon however if you think it is best i will carry my hatchet in and give it to her we can get along very well with the draw shave  well said stuyvesant i do think it is best and now i am going to finish mending the wheelbarrow  well said phonny and i will go and carry the hatchet in to my mother  phonny accordingly took the hatchet and went sauntering slowly along out of the shop  in a few minutes stuyvesant heard an outcry in the yard it sounded like a cry of pain and terror from phonny stuyvesant threw down his work and ran out to see what was the matter  he found phonny by the woodpile where he had stopped a moment to chop a stick with his hatchet and had cut himself he was down upon the ground clasping his foot with his hands and crying out as if in great pain  oh stuyvesant said he i have cut my foot oh i have cut my foot most dreadfully  let me see said stuyvesant and he came to the place phonny raised his hands a little from his foot so as to let stuyvesant see but continued crying with pain and terror  oh dear me said he what shall i dooh dear me  stuyvesant looked all that he could see however was a gaping wound in phonnys boot just over the ankle and something bloody beneath  i dont think it is cut much said stuyvesant let us go right into the house  phonny rose and leaning upon stuyvesants shoulder he began to hobble along toward the house uttering continued cries and lamentations by the way  i would not cry said stuyvesant i would bear it like a hero  in obedience to this counsel phonny abated somewhat the noise that he was making though he still continued his exclamations and moanings dorothy came to the door to find out what was the matter  dorothy was not much alarmed in fact the more noise a child made when hurt the less concerned dorothy always was about it she knew that when people were dangerously wounded they were generally still  whats the matter said dorothy  he has cut his foot said stuyvesant  let me see said she so she looked down at phonnys ankle  i guess he has cut his boot more than his foot said she lets pull off his boot  oh dear me said phonny oh go and call my mother oh dear me  dorothy began to pull off phonnys boot while stuyvesant went to call phonnys mother mrs henry was very much alarmed when she heard that phonny had cut himself she hurried out to him and seemed to be in great distress and anxiety she kneeled down before him while dorothy held him in her lap and examined the foot the cut was a pretty bad one just above the ankle  it is a very bad place for a cut said she bring me some water  ill get some said stuyvesant  so stuyvesant went and got a bowl from a shelf in the kitchen and poured some water into it and brought it to mrs henry mrs henry bathed the wound with the water and then closing it up as completely as possible and putting a piece of stickingplaster across to keep the parts in place she bound the ankle up with a bandage  by this time phonny had become quiet his mother when she had finished bandaging the ankle brought another stocking and put it on to keep the bandage in its place  there said she that will do now the first thing is to get him into the other room  so dorothy carried phonny in and laid him down upon the sofa in the great sittingroom  that evening when beechnut went to the village to get the letters at the postoffice he stopped at the doctors on his way to ask the doctor to call that evening or in the morning at mrs henrys the doctor came that evening  ah phonny said he when he came into the room and saw phonny lying upon the sofa and what is the matter with you  i have cut my foot said phonny  cut your foot rejoined the doctor could not you find any thing else to cut than your foot  phonny laughed  i hope you have cut it in the right place continued the doctor in cutting your foot every thing depends upon cutting it in the right place  while the doctor was saying this mrs henry had drawn off phonnys stocking and was beginning to unpin the bandage  stop a moment madam said the doctor that bandage is put on very nicely it seems hardly worth while to disturb it you can show me now precisely where the wound was  mrs henry then pointed to the place upon the bandage underneath which the cut lay and she showed also the direction and length of the cut  exactly said the doctor you could not have cut your ankle phonny in a better place a half an inch more one side or the other might have made you a cripple for life you hit the right place exactly it is a great thing for a boy who has a hatchet for a plaything to know how to cut himself in the right place  illustration the doctors visit  the doctor then said that he would not disturb the bandage as he had no doubt that the wound would do very well under the treatment which mrs henry herself had administered he said that in a few days he thought it would be nearly well  it might be prudent however he added not to walk upon that foot in the mean time there might be some small possibility in that case of getting the wound irritated so as to bring on an inflammation and that might lead to serious consequences  the doctor then bade phonny goodbye telling him that he hoped he would be as patient and goodnatured in bearing his confinement as he had been dextrous in the mode of inflicting the wound and so he went away     chapter x  good advice   phonny was confined nearly a week with his wound they moved the sofa on which he was lying up into a corner of the room near mrs henrys window and there stuyvesant and malleville brought various things to him to amuse him  he was very patient and goodnatured during his confinement to this sofa wallace came to see him soon after he was hurt and gave him some good advice in this respect  now said wallace you have an opportunity to cultivate and show one mark of manliness which we like to see in boys  i should think you would like to see all marks of manliness in boys said phonny  oh no said wallace some traits of manly character we like and some we dont like  what dont we like asked phonny  whythere are many said wallace hesitating and considering we dont desire to see in boys the sedateness and gravity of demeanor that we like to see in men we like to see them playful and joyous while they are boys  i thought it was better to be sober said phonny  no said wallace not for boys boys ought to be sober at proper times but in their plays and in their ordinary occupations it is better for them to be frolicsome and lighthearted their time for care and thoughtful concern has not come the only way by which they can form good healthy constitutions is to run about a great deal and have a great deal of frolicking and fun only they must be careful not to let their fun and frolicking give other people trouble but we like to see them full of life and joy and activity for we know that that is best for them if a boy of twelve were to be as sage and demure as a man always sitting still and reading and studying we should be afraid either that he was already sick or that he would make himself sick  then i think that you ought to be concerned about stuyvesant said phonny for he is as sage and demure as any man i ever saw  wallace laughed at this  there is a boy that lives down in the village that is always making some fun said phonny one evening he dressed himself up like a poor beggar boy and came to the door of his fathers house and knocked and when his father came to the door he told a piteous story about being poor and hungry and his mother being sick and he begged his father to give him something to eat and a little money to buy some tea for his mother his father thought he was a real beggar boy and gave him some money then afterward he came in and told his father all about it and had a good laugh  then another day he got a bonnet and shawl of his sister fanny and put them upon a pillow so as to make the figure of a girl with them and then he carried the pillow up to the top of the shed and set it up by the side of the house it looked exactly as if fanny was up there then he went into the house and called his mother to come out and when she got out where she could see he pointed up and asked her whether fanny ought to be up there on the shed  illustration the effigy  wallace laughed to hear this story  then in a minute continued phonny the boy pointed off in another direction and there his mother saw fanny playing safely upon the grass  and what did his mother say asked wallace  she was frightened at first replied phonny when she saw what she supposed was fanny up in such a dangerous place but when she saw how it really was she laughed and went into the house  do you think he did right wallace asked stuyvesant  what do you think phonny asked wallace  why i dont know said phonny  do you think on the whole that his mother was most pleased or most pained by it asked wallace  most pleased said phonny she was not much frightened and that only for a moment and she laughed about it a great deal  were you there at the time asked wallace  yes said phonny  what was the boys name said wallace  arthur said phonny  another day continued phonny arthur was taking a walk with fanny and he persuaded her to go across a plank over a brook and when she was over he pulled the plank away so that she could not get back again he danced about on the bank on the other side and called fanny a savage living in the woods  and what did fanny do asked wallace  why she was very much frightened and began to cry  and then what did arthur do asked wallace  why after a time he put up the plank again and let her come home he told her that she was a foolish girl to cry for he only did it for fun  and do you think he did right or wrong said wallace  why wrong i suppose said phonny  yes said wallace decidedly wrong i think for in that case there is no doubt that his fun gave his sister a great deal of pain it is very right for boys to love frolicking and fun but they should be very careful not to let their fun give other people trouble or pain  but now phonny continued wallace you are to be shut up for perhaps a week and here is an opportunity for you to show some marks of manliness which we always like to see in boys  how can i asked phonny  why in the first place said wallace by a proper consideration of the case so as to understand exactly how it is sometimes a boy situated as you are without looking at all the facts in the case thinks only of his being disabled and helpless and so he expects every body to wait upon him and try to amuse him as if that were his right he gives his mother a great deal of trouble by first wanting this and then that and by uttering a great many expressions of discontent impatience and illhumor thus his accident is not only the means of producing inconvenience to himself but it makes the whole family uncomfortable this is boyishness of a very bad kind  to avoid this you must consider what the true state of the case is whose fault is it that you are laid up here in this way  why it is mine i suppose said phonny though if stuyvesant had not advised me to bring the hatchet in i suppose that i should not have cut myself  it was not by bringing the hatchet in that you cut yourself said wallace but by stopping to cut with it on the way contrary to your mothers wishes  yes said phonny i suppose that was it  so that it was your fault now when any person commits a fault continued wallace he ought to confine the evil consequences of it to himself as much as he can have the evil consequences of your fault extended yet to any other people do you think  why yes said phonny my mother has had some trouble  has she yet had any trouble that you might have spared her asked wallace  whyi dont know said phonny unless i could have bandaged my foot up myself  if you could have bandaged it up yourself said wallace you ought to have done so though i suppose you could not but now it is your duty to save her as much as possible from all other trouble you ought to find amusement for yourself as much as you can instead of calling upon her to amuse you and you ought to be patient and gentle and quiet and goodhumored  besides continued wallace i think you ought to contrive something to do to repay her for the trouble that she has already had with this cut she was not to blame for it at all and did not deserve to suffer any trouble or pain  i dont know what i can do said phonny to repay her  it is hard to find any thing for a boy to do to repay his mother for what she does for him but if you even wish to find something and try to find something it will make you always submissive and gentle toward her and that will give her pleasure  perhaps i might read to her sometimes when she is sewing said phonny  yes said wallace that would be a good plan  when this conversation first commenced malleville was standing near to wallace and she listened to it for a little time but she found that she did not understand a great deal of it and she did not think that what she did understand was very interesting so she went away  she went to the piazza and began to gather up the green leaves which she had been playing with when phonny had called her to go out to see the chickens she put these leaves in her apron with the design of carrying them to phonny thinking that perhaps it would amuse him to see them  she brought them accordingly to the sofa and now stood there holding her apron by the corners and waiting for wallace to finish what he was saying  what have you got in your apron said wallace  some leaves said malleville i am going to show them to phonny  so she opened her apron and showed phonny  they are nothing but leaves said phonny are they common leaves  no said malleville they are not common leaves they are very pretty leaves  stuyvesant came to look at the leaves he took up one or two of them  that is a maple leaf said he and that is an oak  there was a small oaktree in the corner of the yard  i am going to press them in a book said malleville  wallace looked at the leaves a minute and then he went away  stuyvesant seemed more interested in looking at the leaves than phonny had been he proposed that while phonny was sick they should employ themselves in making a collection of the leaves of foresttrees  we can make a scrapbook said he and paste them in and then underneath we can write all about the trees that the leaves belong to  how can we find out about the trees asked phonny  beechnut will tell us said stuyvesant  so he will replied phonny and that will be an excellent plan  this project was afterward put into execution stuyvesant made a scrapbook he made it of a kind of smooth and pretty white wrappingpaper he put what are called false leaves between all the true leaves as is usually done in large scrapbooks stuyvesants scrapbook had twenty leaves he said that he did not think that they could find more than twenty kinds of trees they pressed the leaves in a book until they were dry and then pasted them into the scrapbook one on the upper half of each page then they wrote on a small piece of white paper all that they could learn about each tree and put these inscriptions under the leaves to which they respectively referred  the children worked upon the collection of leaves a little while every day they divided the duty giving each one a share stuyvesant pressed the leaves and gummed them to their places in the book phonny who was a pretty good composer composed the descriptions and afterward stuyvesant would copy them upon the pieces of paper which were to be pasted into the book stuyvesant used to go out to the barn or the yard to get all the information which beechnut could give him in respect to the particular tree which happened for the time being to be the subject of inquiry he would then come in and tell phonny what beechnut had told him phonny would then write the substance of this information down upon a slate and after reading it over and carefully correcting it stuyvesant would copy it neatly upon the paper  one day during the time that phonny was confined to his sofa stuyvesant and malleville had been playing with him for some time at last stuyvesant and malleville concluded to go out into the yard a little while and they left phonny with a book to read  i am sorry to leave you alone said stuyvesant  oh no matter said phonny i can read but there is one thing i should like  what is that said stuyvesant  i should like to see frink i suppose it would not do to bring him in here would it mother  mrs henry was sitting at her window at this time sewing  why i dont know said mrs henry how can you bring him in she asked  oh i can put his house upon a board said stuyvesant and put him into it and then bring house and all  well said mrs henry i have no objection only get a smooth and clean board  so stuyvesant went out to the shop to get the squirrel he found him perched upon the handle of the handsaw which was hanging against the wall  come frink come with me said stuyvesant so he extended his hand and took frink down  ah said he i have not got your house ready yet so you will please to go down into my pocket until i am ready  so saying stuyvesant slipped the squirrel into his jacketpocket leaving his head and the tip of his tail out the squirrel being accustomed to such operations remained perfectly still stuyvesant then found a board a little larger than the bottom of the squirrels house and putting this board upon the bench he placed the house upon it he then took frink out of his pocket and slipped him into the door he next put a block before the door to keep the squirrel from coming out and then taking up the board by the two ends he carried it out of the shop  he walked along the yard with it until he came to the piazza and then went in at mrs henrys window which was open as soon as he had gone in mrs henry shut her window and malleville shut the doors stuyvesant then put the house down upon a chair and took the block away from the door to let the squirrel come out  frink seemed at first greatly astonished to find himself in a parlor the first thing that he did was to run up to the top of a tall clock which stood in the corner and perching himself upon a knob there he began to gaze around the room  illustration frink in the parlor  phonny was very much amused at this stuyvesant and malleville were very much amused too they postponed their plan of going out to play for some time in order that they might see frink run about the parlor at length however they went away and phonny commenced reading his story after a time frink crept slyly along and perched himself on the back of the sofa close to the book out of which phonny was reading     chapter xi  the journey   one evening about a week after the occurrences related in the last chapter when phonnys foot had got entirely well mrs henry went to the door which led to the back yard with a letter in her hand she was looking for stuyvesant  presently she saw him and phonny coming through the garden gate with tools in their hands they had been down to build a bridge across a small brook in a field beyond the garden  stuyvesant said mrs henry i have just received a letter from your father  stuyvesants eye brightened as mrs henry said this and he pressed eagerly forward to learn what the letter contained  it is about you said mrs henry and it is a very important letter indeed  what is it said phonny eagerly read it to us mother  so mrs henry opened the letter and read it as followsthe boys standing before her all the time with their tools in their hands                      new york june 20       my dear sister       my business has taken such a turn that i am obliged to go      to europe to be gone five or six weeks and i am thinking      seriously of taking stuyvesant with me he is so thoughtful      and considerate a boy that i think he will give me very      little trouble and he will be a great deal of company for      me on the way besides i think he will be amused and      entertained himself with what he will see in traveling      through england and in london and paris and i do not think      that he will care much for whatever hardships we may have to      endure on the voyage so i have concluded to take him if he      would like to go i intend to sail in the steamer of the      first so that it will be necessary for him to come home      immediately i would rather have him come home alone if      he feels good courage for such an undertakingas i think      he could take care of himself very well and the experience      which he would acquire by such a journey would be of great      service to him if he seems inclined to come alone please      send him on as soon as may be furnish him with plenty of      money and give him all necessary directions if on the      other hand he appears to be a little afraid send some one      with him perhaps beechnut could come  here mrs henry raised her eyes from the letter as if she had read all that related to the subject and phonny immediately exclaimed  send me mother send me ill go and take care of him let me go stivy that will be the best plan as he said this phonny using his hoe for a vaulting pole began to leap about the yard with delight at the idea  stuyvesant remained where he was with a pleased though thoughtful expression of countenance but saying nothing  ill give you two hours to think of it said mrs henry addressing stuyvesant you must set off either alone or with beechnut tomorrow morning  well said stuyvesant i will think of it and come to tell you and now phonny let us go and put away the tools  in the course of the two hours which stuyvesant was allowed for considering the question he made a great many inquiries of beechnut in respect to the journey asking not only in relation to the course which he should pursue at the different points in the journey if every thing went prosperously and well but also in regard to what he should do in the various contingencies which might occur on the way  do you advise me to try it said stuyvesant  yes said beechnut by all means and that is very disinterested advice for there is nothing that i should like better than to go with you  mrs henry herself afterward asked beechnut if he thought it would be safe for stuyvesant to go alone  just as safe said beechnut as it would be for him to go under my charge there is always danger of accidents in traveling he added but there is no more danger for stuyvesant alone than if he were in company  but will he know what to do always said mrs henry in order to get along  i think he will said beechnut i shall explain it all to him beforehand  but there may be some accident said mrs henry the train may run off the track or there may be a collision  that is true replied beechnut but those things will be as likely to happen if i were with him as if he were alone it seems to me that when a boy gets as old as stuyvesant the only advantage of having some one with him when he is traveling is to keep him from doing careless or foolish thingsand stuyvesant can take care of himself in that respect  it was finally decided that stuyvesant should go alone  about eight oclock mrs henry went up into stuyvesants room to pack his trunk but she found it packed already stuyvesant had put every thing in and had arranged the various articles in a very systematic and orderly manner the trunk was all ready to be locked and strapped but it was left open in order that mrs henry might see that all was right  besides his trunk stuyvesant had a small carpetbag which contained such things as he expected to have occasion to use on the way in this carpetbag was a nightdress rolled up snugly and also a change of clean linen besides these things there were two books which stuyvesant had borrowed of phonny to read in the cars in case there should chance to be any detention by the way stuyvesant had a small morocco portfolio too which shut with a clasp and contained note and letter paper and wafers and postage stamps this portfolio he always carried with him on his journeys so that he could at any time have writing materials at hand in case he wished to write a letter he carried the portfolio in his carpetbag there was a small square moroccocovered inkstand also in the carpetbag it shut with a spring and a catch and kept the ink very securely  mrs henry calculated that it would cost stuyvesant about ten dollars to go from franconia to new york so she put ten dollars in small bills in stuyvesants wallet and also a ten dollar bill besides in the inner compartment of his wallet to be used in case of emergency when all these arrangements were made she told stuyvesant that he might go and find beechnut and get his directions  stuyvesant accordingly went in pursuit of beechnut he found him sitting on a bench under a trellis covered with woodbine at the kitchen door enjoying the cool of the evening malleville was with him and he was telling her a story stuyvesant and phonny came and sat down upon the bench near to beechnut  so then it is decided that you are to go alone said beechnut  yes said stuyvesant and i have come to you to get my directions  well said beechnut i am glad you are going you will have a very pleasant journey i have no doubtthat is if you have accidents enough  accidents said stuyvesant so you wish me to meet with accidents  yes said beechnut i dont desire that you should meet with any very serious or dangerous accidents but the more common accidents that you meet with the more you will have to amuse and entertain you if it were only winter now there would be a prospect that you might be blocked up in a snow storm  hoh said phonny that would be a dreadful thing  no replied beechnut not dreadful at all for people who are on business and who are in haste to get to the end of their journey it is bad to meet with accidents and delays but for boys and for people who are traveling for pleasure the more adventures they meet with the better  accidents are not adventures said phonny  they lead to adventures replied beechnut  but now for my directions said stuyvesant  well as for your directions replied beechnut i can either go over the whole ground with you and tell you what to do in each particular caseor i can give you one universal rule which will guide you in traveling in all cases wherever you go which would you prefer  i should prefer the rule said stuyvesant if that will be enough to guide me  yes said beechnut it is enough to guide you not only from here to new york but all over the civilized world  what is the rule asked stuyvesant  i shall write it down for you replied beechnut and you can read it in the stage tomorrow morning or in the cars  well said stuyvesantif you are sure that it will be enough for me  yes replied beechnut i am sure it will be enough it is the rule that i always travel by and i find it will carry me safely anywhere it is an excellent rule for ladies who are traveling alone if they would only trust themselves to it it would be all the guidance that they would need  well said stuyvesant i will decide to take the rule  shortly after this beechnut and the children all went into the house and stuyvesant and phonny went to bed stuyvesant was so much excited however at the thoughts of his journey that it was a long time before he could get to sleep  he woke at the earliest dawn he rose and dressed himself and took his breakfast at six oclock at seven the stage came for him beechnut carried his trunk out to the stage and the driver strapped it on in its place behind mrs henry and malleville stood at the door to see stuyvesant went first to the kitchen to bid dorothy goodby and then came out through the front door and bade mrs henry and malleville goodby  illustration the departure  by this time the driver of the stage had finished strapping on the trunk and had opened the door and was waiting for stuyvesant to get in beechnut handed stuyvesant a small note he said that the traveling rule was inside of it but that stuyvesant must not open the note until he got into the car on the railroad so stuyvesant took the note and put it in his pocket and then shaking hands with beechnut and phonny and putting his carpetbag in before him he climbed up the steps and got into the stage the driver shut the door mounted upon the box and drove away  stuyvesant had about twentyfive miles to go in the stage he was then to take the cars upon a railroad and go about a hundred and fifty miles to boston from boston he was to go to new york either by the railroad all the way or by one of the sound boats just as he pleased  stuyvesant had a great curiosity to know what the rule was which beechnut had written for him as a universal direction for traveling he had however been forbidden to open the note until he should reach the cars so he waited patiently wondering what the rule could be  one reason in fact why beechnut had directed stuyvesant not to open his note until he should reach the cars was to give him something to occupy his attention and amuse his thoughts on first going away from home the feeling of loneliness and homesickness to be apprehended in traveling under such circumstances is always much greater when first setting out on the journey than afterward and beechnut being aware of this thought it desirable to give stuyvesant something to think of when he first drove away from the door  when stuyvesant first got into the stage he took a place on the middle of the front seat which was not a very good place for he could not see pretty soon however he had an opportunity to change to a place on the middle seat near the window here he enjoyed the ride very much he could look out and see the farms and the farmhouses and the people passing as the stage drove along and at intervals he amused himself with listening to the conversation of the people in the stage  it was about ten oclock when the stage arrived at the railroad station as they drew near to the place stuyvesant began to consider what he should have to do in respect to getting his trunk transferred from the stage to the train of cars he knew very well that he could ask the driver what to do but he felt an ambition to find out himself and he accordingly concluded to wait until after he had got out of the stage and had had an opportunity to make his own observations before troubling the driver with his questions as for his ticket he was aware that he must buy that at the ticketoffice and he supposed that he could find the ticketoffice very readily  when the stage stopped stuyvesant and all the other passengers got out the stage was standing near a platform which extended along the side of one of the buildings of the station as soon as the passengers had got out the driver began to take off the trunks from the rack behind the stage and to put them on the platform  there was a gentleman among the passengers who had said in the course of conversation in the stage that he belonged in boston and was going there it occurred to stuyvesant that it would be a good plan to watch this man and see what he would do in respect to his trunk and then do the same in respect to his own so he stood on the platform while the driver was taking down the trunks and said nothing  the driver put the trunks and baggage down in heaps of confusion all about the platform and though the passengers were all standing around none of them paid much attention to what he was doing this led stuyvesant to think that there was no urgent necessity for haste or anxiety about the business but that in some way or other it would all come right in the end so he stood quietly by and said nothing  the result was just as he had anticipated for after he had been standing there a short time a man with a band about his hat on which were inscribed the words baggagemaster came out from a door in the stationhouse and advancing toward the baggage with a businesslike air he said  now then gentlemen tell me where all this baggage is going to  as the baggagemaster said this the people standing by began to point out their several trunks and to say where they were to go as fast as the baggagemaster was informed of the destination of the trunks and carpetbags he would fasten a check upon each one by means of a small strap and give the mate of the check to the owner of the baggage stuyvesant stood quietly by watching this operation until it came to the turn of the gentleman who he had observed was going to boston  that trunk is to go to boston said the gentleman pointing to his trunk  so the baggagemaster checked the trunk and gave the duplicate check to the gentleman  and that trunk is to go to boston too said stuyvesant pointing to his own trunk  so the baggagemaster put a check upon stuyvesants trunk and gave stuyvesant the duplicate of it  stuyvesant observed that as soon as the baggage was checked the owners of it appeared to go away at once and to give themselves no farther concern about it and he inferred that it would be safe for him to do so too so he went into the station to find the ticketoffice in order to buy his ticket he saw in a corner of the room a sort of window with a counter before it and a sign with the words ticket office above stuyvesant went to this window the boston gentleman was there buying his ticket  one for boston said the gentleman as he said this he laid down a bankbill upon the counter just within the window the ticket seller gave him two tickets and some change  he said one and he has got two said stuyvesant to himself i wonder what that means  stuyvesant then took the boston gentlemans place at the window and laid down a bank bill upon the counter saying  half a one for boston  the ticketseller looked at stuyvesant a moment over his spectacles with a very inquiring expression of countenance and then said  how old are you my boy  i am between nine and ten said stuyvesant  and are you going to boston all alone asked the man  yes sir said stuyvesant  so the man gave stuyvesant two tickets and his change and stuyvesant put them tickets money and all carefully in his wallet and turned away he observed that each of his tickets had one of the corners cut off this was to show that they were for a boy who had only paid halfprice  as stuyvesant turned to go away he met the driver of the stage coming toward him  ah stuyvesant said he i was looking for you have you got your tickets  yes said stuyvesant  and is your trunk checked asked the driver  yes said stuyvesant  very well then its all right i was going to show you i did not suppose that you knew how to take care of yourself so well  there were no cars at the station at this time it was a way station and the train was to pass there and stop a few minutes to take up passengers but it had not yet arrived stuyvesant went round to see what had been done with his trunk it had been removed from the place where he had left it but after a time he found it with others on another platform near the railroad track he supposed that that was the place where the train was to come in  he was right in this supposition for in a few minutes the sound of the whistle was heard in the distance and soon afterward the train came thundering in it slackened its speed as it advanced and finally stopped opposite to the platform on which stuyvesant was standing the baggagemaster put the trunks into the baggage car and the passengers got into the passenger cars and in a very few minutes the bell rang and the train began to move on again stuyvesant got an excellent seat near a window  now said he for beechnuts rule  so stuyvesant opened his note and read as follows       universal rule for inexperienced travelers       keep a quiet mind and do as other people      do                             beechnut  thats just what i have been doing all the time said stuyvesant to himself as soon as he had read the paper i found out beechnuts rule myself before he told me  this was true for stuyvesants instinctive good sense and sagacity had taught him that when traveling with a multitude of other people who were almost all perfectly familiar with the usages of the road a stranger would always find sufficient means of guidance in his observation of those about him it gave stuyvesant pleasure to think that he had found out the way to travel himself and he was very glad to have the wisdom of the method which he had adopted confirmed by beechnuts testimony  during the whole of the journey to boston stuyvesant guided himself by observation of those about him when the conductor came for the tickets stuyvesant looked to see what the others did and then did the same himself at one time the cars stopped and all the passengers rose from their seats and seemed to be going out stuyvesant accordingly rose and went with them there was a man on the platform who called out as the people stepped down from the cars passengers for boston will take the forward cars on the right stuyvesant followed the crowd and entered with them into the cars of another train in fact the travelers had arrived at what is called a junction that is to a place where they come upon a railroad belonging to another company and here of course they took another train the fact that there were two railroads and two companies was the reason why each passenger had two tickets  stuyvesant wondered whether the baggage men would remember to transfer his trunk to the new train without his attending to it but as he observed that the other passengers did nothing about their trunks but went at once into the new cars he concluded that he had nothing to do but follow their example  when he arrived at boston it was very late this was owing to a detention which took place on the road through a somewhat singular cause it seems that there was in one part of the road a very narrow cut through a rocky hill and the company were attempting to widen it in order to make a double track they had accordingly been blasting the rocks on one side of the cut and having fired a very heavy charge just before the train that stuyvesant was in came along an immense mass of rocks had fallen down into the cut and covered the track so that the train could not get by the workman had accordingly sent a man along with a red flag to stop the train when it should come and in the mean time they went to work with an enormous crane which was set up on the rocks above to hoist the stones off from the track and swing them out of the way a great many of the passengers got out and went forward when the train stopped in order to see this operation and stuyvesant felt himself authorized by beechnuts rule to go with them it took more than half an hour to raise and remove the rocks so as to clear the track and stuyvesant had a very pleasant time in watching the operation and in listening to the remarks of the men who were standing around  on account of this delay and of some subsequent delays which were caused by this one it was quite late when the train arrived in boston when the cars at length reached the boston station and the passengers began to get out a great scene of noise and confusion ensued  now said stuyvesant to himself i must obey the first part of beechnuts direction and keep a quiet mind  he accordingly rose from his seat and taking his carpetbag in his hand he went out with the rest of the passengers there was a great crowd of hackmen on the platform all clamorously shouting together to the passengers offering their carriages and calling out the names of the several hotels stuyvesant observed that those before him who wished for a hack would quietly speak to one of these men give him their baggage tickets and then ask him to show them his carriage stuyvesant accordingly did the same he spoke to a man who was standing there with a whip in his hand and asking every body if they wanted a carriage  i want a carriage said stuyvesant i want to go to the marlboro hotel  yes said the man eagerly ill take you right there walk this way and ill show you the carriage  so stuyvesant followed the man and got into his carriage at the same time he gave him his check and said thats for my trunk the man took the check and went away in about ten minutes he returned with the trunk and after fastening it upon the carriage behind he got upon the box and drove away  stuyvesant had a very fine time at the marlboro hotel he had a good bedroom to sleep in that night and an excellent breakfast the next morning he took a little walk in washingtonstreet after breakfast and then wrote a short letter to phonny to tell him how well he had got along on his journey he wrote this letter in his room having all the necessary materials in his portfolio when his letter was finished he brought it to the office of the hotel and asked the clerk how he could get that letter to the postoffice  put it right in there said the clerk  so saying the clerk pointed to a letterbox on the counter with an opening at the top and stuyvesant dropped the letter in he then told the clerk that he wished to go to new york that day by the afternoon train the clerk said that it was very well and that he would have a carriage ready at the proper time to take him to the station stuyvesant had no idea where the station was or what the arrangements would be there about checks and tickets but he had no doubt that he should find plenty of people there who were going to new york that day and that he could very easily find out by observing them what he would have to do  and so it proved he had no difficulty whatever in fact all that he had to do was to throw himself as it were into the current and be floated along to new york without any care or concern he arrived very safely there at last and his father was quite proud of him when he found that he had come all the way home alone                           the end
