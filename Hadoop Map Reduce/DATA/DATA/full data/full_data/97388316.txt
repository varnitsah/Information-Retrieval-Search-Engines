97388316	sailors knots  by ww jacobs   1909    prize money   the old man stood by the window gazing at the frozen fields beyond  the sign of the cauliflower was stiff with snow and the breath of a pair of waiting horses in a wagon beneath ascended in clouds of steam  illustration the sign of the cauliflower was stiff with snow  amusements he said slowly as he came back with a shiver and resuming his seat by the taproom fire looked at the wayfarer who had been idly questioning him  claybury men dont have much time for amusements the last one i can call to mind was bill chambers being nailed up in a pigsty he was cleaning out but there was such a fuss made over that by billthat it sort o disheartened people  he got up again restlessly and walking round the table gazed long and hard into three or four mugs  sometimes a little gets left in them he explained meeting the strangers inquiring glance  the latter started and knocking on the table with the handle of his knife explained that he had been informed by a man outside that his companion was the bitterest teetotaller in claybury  thats one o bob prettys larks said the old man flushing  i see you talking to im and i thought as ow he warnt up to no good biggest rascal in claybury he is  ive said so afore and ill say so agin  he bowed to the donor and buried his old face in the mug  a poacher he said taking breath  a thief  he continued after another draught  i wonder whether smith spilt any of this acarrying of it in  he put down the empty mug and made a careful examination of the floor until a musical rapping on the table brought the landlord into the room again  my best respects he said gratefully as he placed the mug on the settle by his side and slowly filled a long clay pipe  next time you see bob pretty ask im wot happened to the prize hamper  hes done a good many things has bob but itll be a long time afore claybury menll look over that  it was henery walkers idea  henery ad been away to see an uncle of

each pay twopence a week till christmas he ses and we buy a hamper with a goose or a turkey in it and bottles o rum and whiskey and gin as far as the moneyll go and then we all draw lots for it and the one that wins has it  it took a lot of explaining to some of em but smith the landlord helped henery and in less than four days twentythree men had paid their tuppences to henery who ad been made the seckitary and told him to hand them over to smith in case he lost his memory  bob pretty joined one arternoon on the quiet and more than one of em talked of aving their money back but arter smith ad explained as ow he would see fair play they thought better of it  hell ave the same chance as all of you he ses  no more and no less  id feel more easy in my mind though ife wasnt in it ses bill chambers staring at bob  i never knew im to lose anything yet  you dont know everything bill ses bob shaking his ead  you dont know me else you wouldnt talk like that  ive never been caught doing

the week afore christmas smith the landlord said as ow he ad got enough money and three days arter we all came up ere to see the prize drawn  it was one o the biggest hampers smith could get and there was a fine large turkey in it a large goose three pounds o pork sausages a bottle o whiskey a bottle o rum a bottle o brandy a bottle o gin and two bottles o wine  the hamper was all decorated with holly and a little flag was stuck in the top  ony men as belonged was allowed to feel the turkey and the goose and arter a time smith said as ow praps theyd better leave off and e put all the things back in the hamper and fastened up the lid  how are we going to draw the lottery ses john biggs the blacksmith  therell be twentythree bits o paper ses smith and theyll be numbered from one to twentythree  then theyll be twisted up all the same shape and put in this ere paper bag which i shall old as each man draws  the chap that draws the paper with the figger on it wins  he tore up twentythree bits o paper all about the same size and then with a blacklead pencil e put the numbers on while everybody leaned over im to see fair play  then he twisted every bit o paper up and held them in his and  is that satisfactory he ses  couldnt be fairer ses bill chambers  mind ses smith putting them into a tall paper bag that had ad sugar in it and shaking them up number i wins the prize  whos going to draw fust  all of em hung back and looked at each other they all seemed to think theyd ave a better chance when there wasnt so many numbers left in the bag  come on ses smith the landlord  somebody must be fust  go on george kettle ses bob pretty  youre sure to win  i ad a dream you did  go on yourself ses george  i never ave no luck ses bob but if henery walker will draw fust ill draw second  somebody must begin  o course they must ses henery and if youre so anxious why dont you ave fust try  bob pretty tried to laugh it off but they wouldnt ave it and at last he takes out a pocketandkerchief and offers it to smith the landlord  all right ill go fust if youll blindfold me he ses  there aint no need for that bob ses mr smith  you cant see in the bag and even if you could it wouldnt help you  never mind you blindfold me ses bob itll set a good example to the others  smith did it at last and when bob pretty put his and in the bag and pulled out a paper you might ha heard a pin drop  open it and see what number it is mr smith ses bob pretty  twenty three i expect i never ave no luck  smith rolled out the paper and then e turned pale and is eyes seemed to stick right out of his ead  hes won it  he ses in a choky voice  its number i  bob pretty as won the prize  illustration hes won it  he ses in a choky voice its number i  you never eard such a noise in this ere publicouse afore or since everybody shouting their ardest and bill chambers stamping up and down the room as if hed gone right out of his mind  silence ses mr smith at last  silence  how dare you make that noise in my ouse giving it a bad name  bob pretty as won it fair and square  nothing could ha been fairer  you ought to be ashamed o yourselves  bob pretty wouldnt believe it at fust  he said that smith was making game of im and when smith held the paper under is nose he kept the handkerchief on his eyes and wouldnt look at it  ive seen you afore today he says nodding his ead  i like a joke as well as anybody but it aint fair to try and make fun of a pore ardworking man like that  i never see a man so astonished in my life as bob pretty was when e found out it was really true  he seemed fair mazedlike and stood there scratching his ead as if he didnt know where e was  he come round at last arter a pint o beer that smith ad stood im and then he made a little speech thanking smith for the fair way he ad acted and took up the hamper  strewth it is heavy he ses getting it up on his back  well so long mates  aint youaint you going to stand us a drink out o one o them bottles ses peter gubbins as bob got to the door  bob pretty went out as if he didnt ear then he stopped suddenlike and turned round and put his ead in at the door agin and stood looking at em  no mates he ses at last and i wonder at you for asking arter what youve all said about me  im a pore man but ive got my feelings  i drawed fust becos nobody else would and all the thanks i get for it is to be called a thief  he went off down the road and by and by bill chambers wot ad been sitting staring straight in front of im got up and went to the door and stood looking arter im like a man in a dream  none of em seemed to be able to believe that the lottery could be all over so soon and bob pretty going off with it and when they did make up their minds to it it was one o the most miserable sights you ever see  the idea that they ad been paying a pint a week for bob pretty for months nearly sent some of em out of their minds  it cant be elped ses mr smith  he ad the pluck to draw fust and he won anybody else might ha done it  he gave you the offer george kettle and you too henery walker  henery walker was too lowspirited to answer im and arter smith ad said hush  to george kettle three times he up and put im outside for the sake of the ouse  when e came back it was all quiet and everybody was staring their ardest at little dicky weed the tailor who was sitting with his head in his ands thinking and every now and then taking them away and looking up at the ceiling or else leaning forward with a start and looking as if e saw something crawling on the wall  wots the matter with you  ses mr smith  dicky weed didnt answer im  he shut his eyes tight and then e jumps up all of a sudden  ive got it he says  wheres that bag  wot bag ses mr smith staring at im  the bag with the papers in ses dicky  where bob pretty ought to be ses bill chambers  on the fire  wot screams dicky weed  now youve been and spoilt everything  speak english ses bill  i will ses dicky trembling all over with temper  who asked you to put it on the fire  who asked you to put yourself forward  i see it all now and its too late  wots too late  ses sam tones  when bob pretty put his and in that bag ses dicky weed holding up is finger and looking at them hed got a bit o paper already in ita bit o paper with the figger i on it  thats ow he done it  while we was all watching mr smith he was getting is own bit o paper ready  he ad to say it three times afore they understood im and then they went down on their knees and burnt their fingers picking up bits o paper that ad fallen in the fireplace  they found six pieces in all but not one with the number they was looking for on it and then they all got up and said wot ought to be done to bob pretty  you cant do anything ses smith the landlord  you cant prove it after all its only dickys idea  arfadozen of em all began speaking at once but bill chambers gave em the wink and pretended to agree with im  were going to have that hamper back he ses as soon as mr smith ad gone back to the bar but it wont do to let im know  he dont like to think that bob pretty was one too many for im  lets all go to bob prettys and take it ses peter gubbins wot ad been in the militia  dicky weed shook his ead  hed ave the lor on us for robbery he ses theres nothing hed like better  they talked it over till closingtime but nobody seemed to know wot to do and they stood outside in the bitter cold for over arf an hour still trying to make up their minds ow to get that hamper back  fust one went off ome and then another and at last when there was ony three or four of em left henery walker wot prided himself on is artfulness ad an idea  one of us must get bob pretty up ere tomorrow night and stand im a pint or praps two pints he ses  while hes here two other chaps must ave a row close by his ouse and pretend to fight  mrs pretty and the young uns are sure to run out to look at it and while they are out another chap can go in quietlike and get the hamper  it seemed a wunnerful good idea and bill chambers said so and e flattered henery walker up until henery didnt know where to look as the saying is  and wots to be done with the hamper when weve got it  ses sam jones  have it drawed for agin ses henery  itll ave to be done on the quiet o course  sam jones stood thinking for a bit  burn the hamper and draw lots for everything separate e ses very slow  if bob pretty ses its is turkey and goose and spirits tell im to prove it  we shant know nothing about it  henery walker said it was a good plan and arter talking it over they walked ome all very pleased with theirselves  they talked it over next day with the other chaps and henery walker said arterwards that praps it was talked over a bit too much  it took em some time to make up their minds about it but at last it was settled that peter gubbins was to stand bob pretty the beer ted brown who was well known for his ot temper and joe smith was to ave the quarrel and henery walker was to slip in and steal the hamper and ide the things up at his place  bob pretty fell into the trap at once  he was standing at is gate in the dark next day smoking a pipe when peter gubbins passed and peter arter stopping and asking im for a light spoke about is luck in getting the hamper and told im he didnt bear no malice for it  you ad the pluck to draw fust he ses and you won  bob pretty said he was a briton and arter a little more talk peter asked im to go and ave a pint with im to show that there was no illfeeling they came into this ere cauliflower publicouse like brothers and in less than ten minutes everybody was making as much fuss o bob pretty as if ed been the best man in claybury  arter all a man cant elp winning a prize ses bill chambers looking round  i couldnt ses bob  he sat down and elped hisself out o sam joness baccybox and one or two got up on the quiet and went outside to listen to wot was going on down the road  everybody was wondering wot was happening and when bob pretty got up and said e must be going bill chambers caught old of him by the coat and asked im to have arf a pint with im  bob had the arfpint and arter that another one with sam jones and then e said e really must be going as his wife was expecting im  he pushed bill chamberss at over his eyesa thing bill cant abearand arter filling is pipe agin from sam joness box he got
