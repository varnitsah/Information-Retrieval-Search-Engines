47514360	the queens cup  by  g a henty        chapter 1  a large party were assembled in the drawing room of greendale sir john greendales picturesque old mansion house it was early in september the men had returned from shooting and the guests were gathered in the drawing room in the pleasant half hour of dusk when the lamps have not yet been lighted though it is already too dark to read the conversation was general and from the latest news from india had drifted into the subject of the italian belief in the mal occhio  do you believe in it captain mallett asked bertha sir johns only child a girl of sixteen who was nestled in an easy chair next to that in which the man she addressed was sitting  i dont know bertha  he had known her from childhood and she had not yet reached an age when the formal miss greendale was incumbent upon her acquaintances  i do not believe in the italian superstition to anything like the extent they carry it i dont think i should believe it at all if it were not that one man has always been unlucky to me  how unlucky captain mallett  well i dont know that unlucky is the proper word but he has always stood between me and success at least he always did for it is some years since our paths have crossed  tell me about it  well i have no objection but there is not a great deal to tell  i was at school withi wont mention his name we were about the same age he was a bully i interfered with him we had a fight and i scored my first and only success over him it was a very tough fightby far the toughest i ever had i was stronger than he but he was the more active i fancied that it would not be very difficult to thrash him but found that i had made a great mistake it was a long fight and it was only because i was in better condition that i won at last  well you know when boys fight at school in most cases they become better friends afterwards but it was not so here he refused to shake hands with me and muttered something about its being his turn next time till then he had not been considered a firstrate hand at anything he was one of those fellows who saunter through school get up just enough lessons to rub along comfortably never take any prominent part in games but have a little set of their own and hold themselves aloof from school in general  once or twice when we had played cricket he had done so excellently that it was a grievance that he would not play regularly and there was a sort of general idea that if he chose he could do most things well after that fight he changed altogether he took to cricket in downright earnest and was soon acknowledged to be the best bat and best bowler in the school before that it had been regarded as certain that when the captain left i should be elected but when the time came he got a majority of votes i should not have minded that for i recognised that he was a better player than i but i fancied that he had not done it fairly for many fellows whom i regarded as certain to support me turned round at the last moment  we were in the same form at school he had been always near the bottom i stood fairly up in it and was generally second or third he took to reading and in six weeks after the fight won his way to the top of the class and remained there and not only so but he soon showed himself so far superior to the rest of us that he got his remove to the form above  then there was a competition in latin verses open to both forms latin verse was the one thing in which i was strong there is a sort of knack you know in stringing them together a fellow may be a duffer generally and yet turn out latin verse better than fellows who are vastly superior to him on other points it was regarded as certain that i should gain that no one had intended to go in against me but at the last moment he put his name down and to the astonishment of everyone won in a canter  we left about the same time and went up to oxford together but to different colleges i rowed in my college eight he in his we were above them on the river but they made a bump every night until they got behind us and then bumped us he was stroke of his boat and everyone said that success was due to his rowing and i believe it was i did not so much mind that for my line was chiefly sculling i had won in my own college and entered for henley where it was generally thought that i had a fair chance of winning the diamonds however i heard a fortnight before the entries closed that he was out on the river every morning sculling i knew what it was going to be and was not surprised when his name appeared next to mine in the entries  we were drawn together and he romped in six lengths ahead of me though curiously enough he was badly beaten in the final heat he stroked the university afterwards though i was tried i did not even get a seat in the eight contrary to general expectation but i know that it was his influence that kept me out of it  we had only one more tussle and again i was worsted i went in for the newdigatethat is the english poetry prize you know i had always been fond of stringing verses together and the friends to whom i showed my poem before sending it in all thought that i had a very good chance i felt hopeful myself for i had not heard that he was thinking of competing and indeed did not remember that he had ever written a line of verse when at school however when the winner was declared there was his name again  i believe that it was the disgust i felt at his superiority to me in everything that led me to ask my father to get me a commission at once for it seemed to me that i should never succeed in anything if he were my rival since then our lives have been altogether apart although i have met him occasionally of course we speak for there has never been any quarrel between us since that fight but i know that he has never forgiven me and i have a sort of uneasy conviction that some day or other we shall come into contact again  i am sure that if we meet again he will do me a bad turn if possible i regard him as being in some sort of way my evil genius i own that it is foolish and absurd but i cannot get over the feeling  oh it is absurd captain mallett the girl said he may have beaten you in little things but you won the victoria cross in the crimea and everyone knows that you are one of the best shots in the country and that before you went away you were always in the first flight with the hounds  ah you are an enthusiast bertha i dont say that i cannot hold my own with most men at a good many things where not brains but brute strength and a quick eye are the only requisites but i am quite convinced that if that fellow had been in the redan that day he would have got the victoria cross and i should not there is no doubt about his pluck and if it had only been to put me in the shade he would have performed some brilliant action or other that would have got it for him he is a better rider than i am at any rate a more reckless one and he is a better shot too he is incomparably more clever  i cannot believe it captain mallett  it is quite true bertha and to add to it all he is a remarkably handsome fellow a firstrate talker and when he pleases can make himself wonderfully popular  he must be a perfect crichton captain mallett  the worst of it is bertha although i am ashamed of myself for thinking so i have never been able to divest myself of the idea that he did not play fair there were two or three queer things that happened at school in which he was always suspected of having had a hand though it was never proved i was always convinced that he used cribs and partly owed his place to them i was jealous enough to believe that the latin verses he sent in were written for him by rigby who was one of the monitors and a great dab at verses rigby was a great chum of his for he was a mean fellow and my rival was always well supplied with money and to do him justice liberal with it  then just before we left school he carried off the prize in swimming he was a good swimmer but i was a better i thought myself for once certain to beat him but an hour before the race i got frightful cramps a thing that i never had before or since and i could hardly make a fight at all i thought at the time and i have thought since that i must have taken something at breakfast that disagreed with me horribly and that he somehow put it in my tea  then again in that matter of the sculls at henley i never felt my boat row so heavily as it did then when it was taken out of the water it was found that a piece of curved iron hoop was fixed to the bottom by a nail that had been pushed through the thin skin it certainly was not there when it was on the rack but it was there when i rowed back to the boathouse and it could only have got there by being put on as the boat was being lowered into the water there were three or four men helping to lower her downtwo of them friends of mine two of them fellows employed at the boathouse while it lay in the water before i got in and took my place anyone stooping over it might unobserved have passed his hand under it and have pushed the nail through  i never said anything about it i had been beaten there was no use making a row and a scandal over it especially as i had not a shadow of proof against anyone but i was certain that he was not so fast as i was for during practice my time had been as nearly as possible the same as that of the man who beat him with the greatest ease and i am convinced that for once i should have got the better of him had it not been for foul play  that was shameful captain mallett bertha said indignantly i wonder you did not take some steps to expose him  i had nothing to go upon bertha it was a case of suspicion only and you have no idea what a horrible row there would have been if i had said anything about it committees would have sat upon it and the thing would have got into the papers fellows would have taken sides and i should have been blackguarded by one party for hinting that a wellknown university man had been guilty of foul practices  altogether it would have been a horrible nuisance it was much better to keep quiet and say nothing about it  i am sure i could not have done that captain  no but then you see women are much more impetuous than men i am certain that after you had once set the ball rolling you would have been sorry that you had not bided your time and waited for another contest in which you might have turned the tables fairly and squarely  he must be hateful the girl said  he is not considered hateful i can assure you he conceived a grudge against me and has taken immense pains to pay me out and i only trust that our paths will never cross again if so i have no doubt that i shall again get the worst of it at any rate you see i was not without justification when i said that though i did not believe in the mal occhio i had reason for having some little superstition about it  i prophesy captain mallett that if ever you meet him in the future you will turn the tables on him such a man as that can never win in the long run  well i hope that your prophecy will come true at any rate i shall try and i hope that your good wishes will counterbalance his power and that you will be a sort of mascotte  how tiresome the girl broke off as there was a movement among the ladies it is time for us to go up to dress for dinner and though i shant take half the time that some of them will do i suppose i must go  captain mallett had six months previously succeeded at the death of his father to an estate five miles from that of sir john greendale his elder brother had been killed in the hunting field a few months before and frank mallett who was fond of his profession and had never looked for anything beyond it save a younger sons portion had thus come in for a very fine estate  two months after his fathers death he most reluctantly sent in his papers considering it his duty to settle down on the estate but ten days later came the news of the outbreak of the sepoys of barrackpoor and he at once telegraphed to the war office asking to be allowed to cancel his application for leave to sell out  so far the cloud was a very small one but rumours of trouble had been current for some little time and the affair at least gave him an excuse for delaying his retirement  very rapidly the little cloud spread until it overshadowed india from calcutta to the afghan frontier his regiment stood some distance down on the rota for indian service but as the news grew worse regiment after regiment was hurried off and it now stood very near the head of the list all leave had not yet been stopped but officers away were ordered to leave addresses so that they could be summoned to join at an hours notice  when he had left home that morning for a days shooting with sir john he had ordered a horse to be kept saddled so that if a telegram came it could be brought to him without a moments delay he was burning to be off there had at first been keen disappointment in the regiment that they were not likely to take part in the fierce struggle but the feeling had changed into one of eager expectation when as the contest widened and it was evident that it would be necessary to make the greatest efforts to save india the prospect of their employment in the work grew  for the last fortnight expectation had been at its height orders had been received for the regiment to hold itself in readiness for embarkation men had been called back from furlough the heavy baggage had been packed and all was ready for a start at twentyfour hours notice many of the officers obtained a few days leave to say goodbye to their friends or settle business matters and frank mallett was among them  so i suppose you may go at any moment mallett said the host at the dinner table that evening  yes sir john my shooting today has been execrable for i have known that at any moment my fellow might ride up with the order for me to return at once and we are all in such a fever of impatience that i am surprised i brought down a bird at all  you can hardly hope to be in time either for the siege of delhi or for the relief of lucknow mallett  one would think not but there is no saying you see our news is a month old havelock had been obliged to fall back on cawnpore and a perfect army of rebels were in delhi of course the reinforcements will soon be arriving and i dont think it likely that we shall get up there in time to share in those affairs but even if we are late both for lucknow and delhi there will be plenty for us to do what with the sepoy army and with the native chiefs that have joined them and the fighting men of oude and one thing and another there cannot be less than 200000 men in arms against us and even if we do take delhi and relieve lucknow that is only the beginning of the work the scoundrels are fighting with halters round their necks and i have no fear of our missing our share of the work of winning back india and punishing these bloodthirsty scoundrels  it is a terrible time sir john said and old as i am i should like to be out there to lend a hand in avenging this awful business at cawnpore and the coldblooded massacres at other places  i think that there will be no lack of volunteers sir john if government were to call for them i believe that 100000 men could be raised in a week  ay in twentyfour hours there is scarce a man in england but would give five years of his life to take a share in the punishment of the faithless monsters there was no lack of national feeling in the crimean war but it was as nothing to that which has been excited by these massacres had it been a simple mutiny among the troops we should all be well content to leave the matter in the hands of our soldiers but it is a personal matter to everyone rich and poor are alike moved by a burning desire to take part in the work of vengeance i should doubt if the country has ever been so stirred from its earliest history  yes i fancy we are all envying you mallett one of the other gentlemen said partridge shooting is tame work in comparison with that which is going on in india it was lucky for you that that first mutiny took place when it did for had it been a week later you would probably have been gazetted out before the news came  yes that was a piece of luck certainly ashurst i dont know how i should be feeling if i had been out of it and the regiment on the point of starting for india  i suppose you are likely to embark from plymouth said sir john  i should think so but there is no saying i hardly fancy that we should go through france as some of the regiments have done there would be no very great gain of time especially if we start as far west as plymouth besides i have not heard of any transports being sent round to marseilles lately of course in any case we shall have to land at alexandria and cross the desert to suez i should fancy now that the advantages of that route have been shown that troops in future will always be taken that way you see it is only five weeks to india instead of five months the situation is bad enough as it is but it would have been infinitely worse if no reinforcements could have got out from england in less than five months  is there anything that i can do for you while you are away mallett sir john greendale asked as they lingered for a moment after the other gentlemen had gone off to join the ladies  nothing that i know of thank you norton will see that everything goes on as usual my father never interfered with him in the general management of the estate and had the greatest confidence in him i have known him since i was a child and have always liked him so i can go away assured that things will go on as usual if i go down the estate goes as you know to a distant cousin whom i have never seen  as to other matters i have but little to arrange i have made a will so that i shall have nothing to trouble me on that score tranton came over with it this morning from stroud and i signed it  that is right lad we all hope most sincerely that there will be no occasion for its provisions to be carried out but it is always best that a man should get these things off his mind are you going to say goodbye to us tonight  i shall do it as a precautionary measure sir john but i expect that when i get the summons i shall have time to drive over here my horse will do the distance in five and twenty minutes and unless a telegram comes within an hour of the night mail passing through stroud i shall be able to manage it i saw everything packed up before i left and my man will see that everything except the portmanteau with the things i shall want on the voyage goes on with the regimental baggage  a quarter of an hour later captain mallett mounted his dog cart and drove home the next morning he received a letter from the adjutant saying that he expected the order some time during the next day  we are to embark at plymouth and i had a telegram this morning saying that the transport had arrived and had taken her coal on board of course they will get the news at the war office today and will probably wire at once i think we shall most likely leave here by a train early the next morning i shall of course telegraph as soon as the order comes but as i know that you have everything ready you will be in plenty of time if you come on by the night mail  at eleven oclock a mounted messenger from stroud brought on the telegram  we entrain at six tomorrow morning join immediately  this was but a formal notification and he resolved to go on by the night mail he spent the day in driving round the estate and saying goodbye to his tenants he lunched at the house of one of the leading farmers where as a boy he had been always made heartily welcome before mounting his dog cart he stood for a few minutes chatting with martha his hosts pretty daughter  you are not looking yourself martha he said you must pick up your roses again before i come back i shall leave the army then and give a big dinner to my tenants with a dance afterwards and i shall open the ball with you and expect you to look your best  who is this he asked as a young fellow came round the corner of the house and on seeing them turned abruptly and walked off  it is george lechmere is it not  a flash of colour came into the girls face  ah i see he laughed he thought i was flirting with you and has gone off jealous well you will have no difficulty in making your peace with him tomorrow  goodbye child i must be going i have a long round to make  he jumped into the dog cart and drove away while the girl went quietly back into the house  her father looked up at the clock  two oclock he said i must be going i expected george lechmere over here he was coming to talk with me about his fathers twelveacre meadow i want it badly this winter for i have had more land under the plough than usual this year i must either get some pasture or sell off some of my stock  george lechmere came father martha said with an angry toss of her head but when he saw me talking to captain mallett he turned and went off just as if i was not to open my lips to any man but himself  the farmer would have spoken but his wife shook her head at him george lechmere had been at one time engaged to martha but his jealousy had caused so many quarrels that the engagement had been broken off he still came often to the house however and her parents hoped that it would be renewed for the young fellows character stood high he was his fathers right hand and would naturally succeed him to the farm his parents too had heartily approved of the match so far however the prospect of the young people coming together was not encouraging martha was somewhat given to flirtation george was as jealous as ever and was unable to conceal his feelings which as he had now no right to criticise her conduct so angered the girl that she not unfrequently gave encouragement to others solely to show her indifference to his opinions  george lechmere had indeed gone away with anger in his heart he knew that captain mallett was on the point of leaving with his regiment for india and yet to see him chatting familiarly with martha excited in him a passionate feeling of grievance against her  it matters nought who it is he muttered to himself she is ever ready to carry on with anyone while she can hardly give me a civil word when i call i know that if we were to marry it would be just the same thing and that i am a fool to stop here and let it vex me it would be better for me to get right out of it john is old enough to take my place on the farm some of these days i will take the queens shilling if i were once away i should not be always thinking of her i know i am a fool to let a girl trouble me so but i cant help it if i stay here i know that i shall do mischief either to her or to someone else i felt like doing it last month when she was over at that business at squire carthewshe is just such another one as captain mallett only he is a bad landlord while ours is a good one what made him think of asking all his own tenantry and a good many of us round and getting up a cricket match and a dance on the grass is more than i can say he never did such a thing before in all the ten years since he became master there they all noticed how he carried on with martha and how she seemed to like it it was the talk of everyone there if i had not gone away i should have made a fool of myself though i have no right to interfere with her and her father and mother were there and seemed in no way put out  i will go away and have a look at that lot of young cattle i bought the other day i dont know that i ever saw a more likely lot  it was dark when george returned on his way home he took a path that passed near the house whence he had turned away so angrily a few hours before it was not the nearest way but somehow he always took it even at hours when there was no chance of his getting the most distant sight of martha  presently he stopped suddenly for from behind the wall that bounded the kitchen garden of the farm he heard voices a man was speaking  you must make your choice at once darling for as i have told you i am off tomorrow we will be married as soon as we get there and you know you cannot stop here  i know i cant marthas voice replied but how can i leave  they will forgive you when you come back a lady he said it will be a year at least before i return and  george could restrain himself no longer a furious exclamation broke from his lips and he made a desperate attempt to climb the wall which was however too high when after two or three unsuccessful attempts he paused for a moment all was silent in the garden  i will tackle her tomorrow he said grimly and him too but i dare not go in now bennett has always been a good friend to me and so has his wife and it would half kill them were they to know what i have heard but as for her and that villain  georges mouth closed in grim determination and he strolled on home through the darkness whatever his resolutions may have been he found no opportunity of carrying them out for the next morning he heard that martha bennett had disappeared how or why no one knew she had been missing since tea time on the previous afternoon she had taken nothing with her and the farmer and his two sons were searching all the neighbourhood for some sign of her  the police of stroud came over in the afternoon and took up the investigation the general opinion was that she must have been murdered and every pond was dragged every ditch examined for a distance round the farm in the meantime george lechmere held his tongue  it is better he said to himself that her parents and friends should think her dead than know the truth  he seldom spoke to anyone but went doggedly about his work his father and mother knowing how passionately he had been attached to martha were not surprised at his strange demeanour though they wondered that he took no part in the search for her  they had their trouble too for although they never breathed a word of their thoughts even to each other there was deep down in their hearts a fear that george knew something of the girls disappearance his intense jealousy had been a source of grief and trouble to them previous to his engagement to martha he had been everything they could have wished him he had been the best of sons the steadiest of workers and a general favourite from his willingness to oblige his cheerfulness and good temper  his jealousy as a child had been a source of trouble any gift any little treat for his younger brothers in which he had not fully shared had been the occasion for a violent outburst of temper never exhibited by him at any other time and this feeling had again shown itself as soon as he had singled out martha as the object of his attentions  they had remarked a strangeness in his manner when he had returned home that night and remembering the past each entertained a secret dread that there had been some more violent quarrel than usual between him and martha and that in his mad passion he had killed her  it was then with a feeling almost of relief that a month after her disappearance he briefly announced his intention of leaving the farm and enlisting in the army his mother looked in dumb misery at her husband who only said gravely  well lad you are old enough to make your own choice things have changed for you of late and maybe it is as well that you should make a change too you have been a good son and i shall miss you sorely but john is taking after you and presently he will make up for your loss  i am sorry to go father but i feel that i cannot stay here  if you feel that it is best that you should go george i shall say no word to hinder you and then his wife was sure that the fear she felt was shared by her husband  the next morning george came down in his sunday clothes carrying a bundle few words were spoken at breakfast when it was over he got up and said  well goodbye father and mother and you boys i never thought to leave you like this but things have gone against me and i feel i shall be best away  john i look to you to fill my place  goodbye all and with a silent shake of the hand he took up his bundle and stick and went out leaving his brothers who had not been told of his intentions speechless with astonishment    chapter 2  frank mallet after he had visited all his tenants drove to sir john greendales  we have got the route he said as he entered and i leave this evening i had a note from the adjutant this morning saying that will be soon enough so you see i have time to come over and say goodbye comfortably  i do not think goodbyes are ever comfortable lady greendale said one may get through some more comfortably than others but that is all that can be said for the best of them  i call them hateful bertha put in downright hateful captain mallettespecially when anyone is going away to fight  they are not pleasant i admit frank mallett agreed and i ought to have said as comfortably as may be i think perhaps those who go feel it less than those who stay they are excited about their going they have lots to think about and to do and the idea that they may not come back again scarcely occurs to them at the time although they would admit its possibility or even its probability if questioned  however i fancy the worst of the fighting will be over by the time we get there it seems almost certain that it will be so if delhi is captured and lucknow relieved the sepoys thought that they had the game entirely in their hands and that they would sweep us right out of india almost without resistance they have failed and when they see that every day their chances of success diminish their resistance will grow fainter  i expect that we shall have many long marches a great many skirmishes and perhaps two or three hard fights but i have not a shadow of fear of a single reverse we are going out at the best time of year and with cool weather and hard exercise there will be little danger of fevers therefore the chances are very strongly in favour of my returning safe and sound it may take a couple of years to stamp it all out but at the end of that time i hope to return here for good  i shall find you a good deal more altered miss greendale than you will find me you will have become a dignified young lady i shall be only a little older and a little browner you see i have never been stationed in india since i joined for the regiment had only just come home and i am looking forward with pleasurable anticipation to seeing it ordinary life there in a hot cantonment must be pretty dull though from what i hear people enjoy it much more than you would think possible but at a time like the present it will be full of interest and excitement  you will write to us sometimes i hope sir john said when mallett rose to leave  i wont promise to write often sir john i expect that we shall be generally on the move perhaps without tents of any kind and to write on ones knee seated round a bivouac fire with a dozen fellows all laughing and talking round would be a hopeless task but if at any time we are halted at a place where writing is possible i will certainly do so i have but few friends in englandat any rate only men who never think of expecting a letter and as you are among my very oldest and dearest friends it will be a pleasure for me to let you know how i am getting on and to be sure that you will feel an interest in my doings  there was a warm goodbye and all went to the door for a few last words franks portmanteau was already in the dog cart for he had arranged to drive straight from greendale to chippenham where he would dine at an hotel and then go on by the mail to exeter  it was three oclock when he drove into the barracks there early as the hour was the troops were already up and busy wagons were being loaded the long lines of windows were all lighted up and in every room men could be seen moving about he drove across the barrack yard to his own quarters left his portmanteau there and then walked to the mess room as he had expected he found several officers there  ah mallett there you are you are the last in the others all turned up by the evening train but we thought that as you were comparatively near you would come on by the mail  i thought i should find some of you fellows keeping it up  well there was nothing else to do there wont be much chance of going to sleep we all dined in the town for of course the mess plate and kit have been packed up we are not taking much with us now just enough to make shift with the rest will be sent round to calcutta to be stored there till we settle down the men had a dinner given to them by the town and as they all got leave out till twelve oclock and the loading of the wagons began at two there has been a row going on all night most of us played pool till an hour ago then we gradually dropped off for an hours snooze  there will be a chance of getting breakfast i hope  yes there is to be a rough and tumble breakfast at a quarter to five we fall in at a quarter past we got through the inspection of kits yesterday the mess sergeant and a party will pack up the breakfast things and the pots and pans will come on by the next train there is one at eight it will be in plenty of time as i dont suppose the transport will be off until the afternoon perhaps not till night there are always delays at the last moment  however it will be something to be on board ship that is the first step towards getting at those black scoundrels we are all afraid that we shall be late for delhi still there is plenty of other work to be done  any ladies with us  no there was a general agreement among the married officers that they had best be left behind so for once the regiment goes without women  there is a levity about your tone that i do not approve of armstrong frank mallett said reprovingly there were no women when we went out to the crimea at the time when you were a good little boy doing latin exercises  well altogether it is a good thing mallett and we shall be much more comfortable without them  speak for yourself armstrong lads of your age who can talk nothing but barrack slang and are eminently uncomfortable when they have to chat for five minutes to a lady are naturally glad when they are free from the restraint of having to talk like reasonable beings but it is not so with older and wiser men how about marshall  he has been away on leave for the last ten days he has not come back here there have been two fellows inquiring after him diligently for the last week there was no mistaking their errand even if we did not know how he stood i expect he is on board the transport i fancy the colonel gave him a hint to join there no doubt the jews will be on the lookout for him at plymouth as well as here but he will manage to smuggle himself on board somehow even if he has to wrap up as an old woman  he deserves all the trouble that has fallen upon him frank mallett said angrily i have no patience with a young fool who bets on race horses when he knows very well that if they lose there is nothing for him to do but to go to the jews for money however he has had a sharp lesson and as it is likely enough that the regiment wont be back in england for years he will have a chance of getting straight again this affair has been a godsend for him for had he remained in england there would have been nothing for him to do but to sell out  so they chatted until the mess waiters laid the table for breakfast when the other officers came pouring in the meal was eaten hastily for the assembly was sounding in the barrack yard as soon as breakfast was finished the officers went out and took their places with their companies  there was a brief inspection then the drums and fifes set up the girl i left behind me and the regiment marched off to the station the streets being already full of people who had got up to see the last of them and to wish them godspeed in the work of death they were going to perform  the baggage was already in the train that was waiting for them in the station and in a few minutes it steamed away the soldiers hanging far out of every window to wave a last goodbye to the weeping women who thronged the platform two hours later they reached plymouth marched through the town to the dockyard and went straight on board the transport  there was the usual confusion until the cabins had been allotted portmanteaus stowed away and the general baggage lowered into the hold a tedious wait of three or four hours followed no one exactly knew why and then the paddle wheels began to revolve the men burst into a loud cheer and a few minutes later they passed drakes island and headed down the sound  they had as expected found young marshall on board he kept below until they started although told that there was little chance of the bailiffs being permitted to enter the dockyard as he had the grace to feel thoroughly ashamed of his position little was said to him but the manner of the senior officers was sufficient to make him feel their strong disapproval of the position in which he had placed himself by his folly  i have taken a solemn oath never to bet again he said that evening to captain mallett who was a general favourite with the younger officers and i mean to keep it  how much do you owe young un  four hundred and fifty what with allowances and so on i ought to be able to pay it off in three or four years  yes and if you keep your word marshall some of us may be inclined to help you i will for one i would have done so before but to give money to a fool is worse than throwing it into the sea as soon as you show us by deeds not words that you really mean to keep straight you will find that you are not without friends  thank you awfully mallett but i dont want to be helped i will clear it off myself if i live  you will find it hard work to do that marshall even in india of course the pay and allowances make it easy for even a subaltern to live on his income there but when it comes to laying by much that is a difficult matter however so long as the actual campaign lasts the necessary expenses will be very small we shall live principally on our rations and you can put by a good bit there may be a certain amount of prize money for although there is nothing to be got from the mutineers themselves some of the native princes who have joined them will no doubt have to pay heavily for their share in the business  well you wont give me up will you mallett  certainly not i was as hard as anyone on you before for i have no patience with such insane folly but if you keep straight no one will be more inclined to make things easy for you  the voyage to alexandria was unmarked by any incident drill went on regularly and life differed to no great extent from that in barracks all were glad when the halfway stage of the journey was reached but still more so when they embarked in another transport at suez  here they learned according to news that had arrived on the previous day that at the end of august delhi was still holding out and that although reinforcements had reached the british vastly greater numbers of men had entered the city and that constant sorties were made against the british position on the ridge  excitement therefore was at its highest when on the 20th of october a pilot came on board at the mouth of the hooghly and they learned that the assault had been made on the 14th of september and that after desperate fighting extending over a week the city had been captured the puppet emperor made prisoner and the rebels driven with tremendous loss across the bridge of boats over the jumma  the satisfaction with which the news was received in spite of the disappointment that they had arrived too late to share in the victory was damped by the news of the heavy losses sustained in the assault and especially that of that most gallant soldier general nicholson  nor were their hopes that they might take part in the relief of lucknow realised for they learned that on the 25th of september the place had been relieved by havelock and outram here however there was still a prospect that they might take a share in the serious fighting as the losses of the relieving column had been so heavy and the force of mutineers so large that it had been found impracticable to carry off the garrison as intended and the relieving forces were now themselves besieged there was however no fear felt for their safety if the scanty original garrison had defied all the efforts of the mutineers no one doubted that now that their force was trebled they would succeed in defending themselves until an army sufficiently strong to bring them off could be assembled  not a day was lost at calcutta general sir colin campbell who was now in supreme command was collecting a force at cawnpore there he had already been joined by a column which had been despatched from delhi as soon as the capital fell and by a strong naval brigade with heavy guns from the ships of war  all arrangements had been made for pushing up reinforcements as fast as they arrived and the troops were marched from the side of the ship to a spot where a flotilla of boats was in readiness the men only took what they could carry all other baggage was to be sent after them by water and to lie until further instructions at allahabad as soon therefore as the troops had been packed away in the boats they were taken in tow by two steamers and at once taken up the river officers and men were alike in the highest spirits at finding themselves in so short a time after their arrival already on the way to the front and their excitement was added to by the fact that it was still doubtful whether they would arrive in time to join the column cramped as the men were in the crowded boats there was no murmuring as day after day and night after night they continued their course up the river  at patna they learned that the commander in chief was still at cawnpore and the same welcome news was obtained at allahabad but at the latter place they learned that the news of his having gone forward was hourly expected  they reached cawnpore on the morning of the 11th and learned that the column had left on the 9th but was halting at buntara not a moment was lost each man received six days provisions from the commissariat stores and two hours after landing the regiment was on the march and arrived late at night at buntara being received with hearty cheers by the troops assembled there  they learned that they were to go forward on the following morning weary but in high spirits at finding that they had arrived in time the regiment lighted its fires and bivouacked  this has been a close shave indeed mallett one of the other captains said as a party of them sat round a fire we won by a short head  short indeed ackers it has been a race all the way from england and it is marvellous indeed that we should arrive just in time to take part in the relief of lucknow a day later and we should have missed it  we should not have done that mallett for the men would have marched all night and if necessary all day tomorrow to catch up still it is a wonderful fluke that after all we should be in time  there is no doubt that it will be a tough business one of the majors said havelock found it so and i expect that the lesson he taught them hasnt been lost and that we shall have to meet greater difficulties than even he had  yes but look at our force sixteen guns of horse artillery a heavy field battery and the naval brigade with eight guns the 9th lancers the punjaub cavalry and hodsons horse four british regiments of infantry and two of punjaubies besides a column 1500 strong which is expected to join us tomorrow or next day  i hope in any case major that we shant follow the line havelock took through the narrow streets for there we cannot use our strength but will manage to approach the residency from some other direction we know that it stands near the river and at the very edge of the town so there ought to be some other way of getting at it i consider that we are a match for any number of these scoundrels if we do but get a fair ground for fighting which we certainly should not do in the streets of the town  i dont care how it is so that we do get at them another officer said we have heard such frightful details of their atrocities as we came up that one is burning to get at close quarters with them i suppose we shall go to the alumbagh first and relieve the force that has so long been shut up there i only hope that we shant be chosen to take their place  there was a general exclamation of disgust at the suggestion  well someone must stay you know he went on in deprecation of the epithets hurled at him and why not our regiment as well as any other  because i cannot believe that after luck has favoured us so long she will play us such a trick now frank mallett said besides the other regiments have done something in the way of fighting already while we have not fired a shot and i think that sir colin would be more likely to choose the 75th or in fact any of the other regiments than us still if the worst comes to the worst we must not grumble other regiments have had weary times of waiting and it may be our turn now your suggestion has come as a damper to our spirits and as i dont mind acknowledging that i am dog tired with the march after not having used my legs for the last seven or eight weeks i shall try to forget it by going off to sleep  making a pillow of his cloak he lay down on the spot where he was sitting his example being speedily followed by the rest of the officers  the next morning the troops were on the march early but they were not to reach the alumbagh without opposition for on passing a little fort to the right they were suddenly attacked by a small body of rebels posted round it  but little time was lost hodsons horse who were nearest to them at once made a brilliant charge scattering them in all directions a short pause was made while the fort was dismantled and then the column proceeded without further interruption to the alumbagh  there was some disappointment at its appearance instead of finding as they had expected a palace there was nothing but a large garden enclosed by a lofty wall and having a small mosque at one end it had evidently been a place of retirement when the kings of oude desired to get away from the bustle and ceremony of the great town  the commander in chief was thoroughly acquainted with the situation in the city by information that he had received from a civilian named kavanagh who had at immense risk made his way out from the residency and was able to furnish plans of all the principal buildings and the route which in the opinion of brigadier general inglis was the most favourable for the attack  in the evening the reinforcements arrived bringing up the total force to 5000 when the orders were issued the officers of the th found to their intense satisfaction that as captain mallett had thought likely the 75th was selected to remain in charge of the baggage at the alumbagh  the force moved off early on the morning of the 14th but after marching a short distance along the direct road followed by havelock struck off to the right and keeping well away from the city came down upon the summer palace of the kings of oude called the dilkoosha it stood on an eminence commanding a view of the whole of the eastern suburbs of the town and was surrounded by a large park  as soon as the head of the column approached this a heavy musketry fire broke out and it was at once evident that their movements had been watched and the object of their march divined the head of the column was halted for a few minutes until reinforcements came up then they formed into line the artillery opened on their flanks and with a cheer the troops advanced to the attack  the beggars cannot shoot a bit frank mallett said to his subaltern armstrong i expect they are sepoys for the oude tribesmen are said to be good marksmen  keeping up a rolling fire at the loopholes in the walls the infantry pressed forward the fire of the enemy slackened as they approached and they soon forced their way in some helping their comrades over the wall others breaking down a gate and so pouring in a halt was made until the greater portion of the troops came up and then the advance was continued  the defenders of the wall had been considerably reinforced by troops stationed round the palace itself but they were unable to withstand the british advance and soon began to retreat towards the city stopping occasionally where a wall or building offered facilities for defence but never waiting long enough for the british to get at them in two hours all had been driven down the hill to the martiniere college here again they made a stand but were speedily driven out and chased through the garden and park of the college and thence across the canal into the streets of the town here the pursuit ceased the th being told off to hold the martiniere as an advanced position sir colin established his headquarters at the dilkoosha the rest of the troops bivouacking around it or on the slope of the hill between it and the college  after seeing that the men were comfortable and getting some food most of the officers gathered on the flat roof of the college whence a fine view was obtainable over the town the residency had been already pointed out to them and the british flag could be seen floating above it several very large buildings surrounded for the most part with walled gardens rose above the low roofs of the native houses in the intervening space  the way is pretty open a good deal of the ground seems to be occupied with gardens and most of the houses are so small that they could not hold many men  i agree with you mallett it is evident that we shall be passing through an open suburb rather than the town itself those big buildings if held in force will give us a good deal of trouble they are regular fortresses  i dont think that any of them are built of stone they all seem to be whitewashed  that is so the major agreed as he examined them through his field glass i suppose stone is scarce in this neighbourhood but it is probable that the walls are of brickwork and very thick they will have to be regularly breached before we can carry them  it makes one sad to think that that flag which has waved over the residency for the last five months defying all the efforts of enormously superior numbers is to come down and that these scoundrels will be able to exult in the possession of the place that has defied all their efforts to take it still one feels that sir cohns decision is a necessary one it would never do to have six or seven thousand men shut up there when there is urgent work to be done in a score of other places besides it would need a vast magazine of provisions to maintain them our force even when joined by the garrison would be wholly inadequate for so tremendous a task as reducing to submission a city containing at least halfamillion inhabitants together with thirty or forty thousand mutineers and a host of oudes best men with the advantage of the possession of a score or two of buildings all of which are positive fortresses  no there is nothing for it but to fall back again till we have a force sufficient to capture the whole city and utterly defeat its defenders with us away this place will become the focus of the mutiny half the fugitives from delhi will find their way here and at least we shall be able to crush them at one blow instead of having to scour the country for them for months the more of them gather here the better and then when we do capture the place there will be an end of the mutiny though of course there will still be the work of hunting down scattered bands  we may look forward to very much harder work tomorrow than we have had today captain johnson said with these glasses i can make out that the place is crowded with men of course today we took them somewhat by surprise as they would naturally expect us to follow havelocks line but now that they know what our real intentions are they will be able to mass their whole force to oppose us  so much the better frank mallett said there is no mistaking the feeling of the troops they are burning to avenge cawnpore and little mercy will be shown the rebels who fall into their hands  i should advise any of you gentlemen who want to write home the colonel said gravely to do so this evening there is no doubt that we shall take those places but i think that there is also no doubt that our death roll will be heavy you must not judge by their fighting today of the stand that they are likely to make tomorrow they know well enough that they will get no quarter after what has taken place and will fight desperately to the end  most of the officers took his advice captain mallett sat down on the parapet took out a notebook and wrote in pencil  dear sir john  although it is but four days since i posted you a long letter from cawnpore that i had written on our way up the river i think it as well to write a few lines in pencil you will not get them unless i go down tomorrow as i shall of course tear them up if i get through all right i am writing now within sight of the residency we had a bit of a fight today but the rebels did not make any serious stand tomorrow it will be different for we shall have to fight our way through the town and there is no doubt that the resistance will be very obstinate i have nothing to add to what i wrote to you last what i should like you to know is that i thought of you all this evening and that i send you and lady greendale and bertha my best wishes for your long life and happiness  yours most sincerely  frank mallett  he tore the page from his notebook put it in an envelope and directed it then placed it in an inner pocket of his uniform  so you are not writing marshall he said as he went across to the young ensign who was sitting on the angle of the parapet  i have no one particular to write to captain mallett and the only persons who will feel any severe sorrow if i fall tomorrow are my creditors  we should all be sorry marshall very sorry ever since we sailed from plymouth your conduct has shown that you have determined to retrieve your previous folly the colonel himself spoke to me about it the other day and remarked that he had every hope that you would turn out a steady and useful officer we have all noticed that beyond the regular allowance of wine you have drunk nothing and that you did not touch a card throughout the voyage  i have not spent a penny since i went on board at plymouth the lad said i got the paymaster to give me an order on london for the amount of pay due to me the day we got to cawnpore and posted it to morrison so he has got some fifteen pounds out of the fire of course it is not much but at any rate it will show him i mean to pay up honestly  well done lad you are quite right to give up cards and to cut yourself off liquors beyond the queens allowance but dont stint yourself in necessaries for instance fruit is necessary here and of course when we once get into settled quarters you must keep a horse of some sort as everyone else will do so how much did you really have from morrison in cash  three hundred for which i gave him bills for four fifty and a lien on my commission  all right lad i will write to my solicitor in london and get him to see morrison and ask him to meet you fairly in the matter he will know that it will be years before you are likely to be in england again and that if you are killed he will lose altogether so under these circumstances i have no doubt that he will be glad enough to make a considerable abatement perhaps to content himself with the sum that you really had from him  i am afraid that my letter with the enclosure assuring him that i will in time pay the amount due will harden his heart marshall laughed i am much obliged all the same but i dont think that it will be of any use  however on leaving him mallett went downstairs borrowed some ink from the quartermaster and wrote to his solicitor enclosing a cheque for 300 pounds with instructions to see the money lender  you will find that he will be glad enough to hand over young marshalls bills for four fifty for that amount he said he has already had fifteen pounds which is a fair interest for the three hundred for the time the lad has had it he will know well enough that if marshall dies he will lose every penny and that at any rate he will have to wait many years before he can get it i have no doubt that he would jump at an offer of a couple of hundred but it is just as well that the young fellow should feel the obligation for some time and as the man did lend him the money it would be unfair that he should be an absolute loser    chapter 3  the next morning three days rations were served out to the troops and the advance begun the movement being directed against the secunderbagh a large garden surrounded by a very high and strong wall loopholed for musketry to reach it a village fortified and strongly held had first to be carried the attack was led by brigadier hopes brigade of which the regiment formed part as they approached the village so heavy a musketry fire was opened upon them that the order to advance was changed and the leading regiment moved forward in skirmishing order the horse artillery and heavy field guns were brought up and poured a tremendous fire into the village driving the defenders from their post on the walls  as soon as this was accomplished the infantry rushed forward and stormed the village the enemy opposing a stout resistance occupying the houses and fighting to the last the main body of them however fled to the secunderbagh the 4th sikhs had been ordered to lead the attack while the british infantry of the brigade were to cover the operation the men were however too excited and too eager to get at the enemy to remain inactive and on leaving the village dashed forward side by side with the sikhs and attacked the wall there was a small breach in this and many of the men rushed through it before the enemy taken by surprise could offer a serious resistance the entrance was however so narrow that very few men could pass in and while a furious fight was raging inside the rest of the troops tried in vain to find some means of entering  there were two barred windows one on each side of the gate and some of the troopers creeping under these raised their shakos on their bayonets the defenders fired a heavy volley into them and the soldiers leaping to their feet sprang at the bars and pulled them down by main force before the defenders had time to reload then they leaped down inside others followed them the gates were opened and the main body of troops poured in  the garden was held by 2000 mutineers with shouts of remember cawnpore the troops flung themselves upon them and although the mutineers fought desperately and the struggle was continued for a considerable time every man was at last shot or bayoneted  in the meantime a serious struggle was going on close by nearly facing the secunderbagh stood the large mosque of shah nujeeff it had a domed roof with a loopholed parapet and four minarets which were filled with riflemen it stood in a large garden surrounded by a high wall also loopholed the entrance being blocked up with solid masonry the fire from this building had seriously galled hopes division while engaged in forcing its way into the secunderbagh and captain peel with the naval brigade brought up the heavy guns against it he took up his position within a few yards of the wall and opened a heavy fire assisted by that of a mortar battery and a field battery of bengal artillery the highlanders covering the sailors and artillerymen as they worked their guns by a tremendous fire upon the enemys loopholes so massive were the walls that it was several hours before even the sixtyeight pounders of the naval brigade succeeded in effecting a breach  as soon as this was done the impatient infantry were ordered to the assault and rushing in overpowered all resistance and slew all within the enclosure save a few who effected their escape by leaping from the wall at the rear  it was now late in the afternoon and operations ceased for the day the buildings on which the enemy had chiefly relied for their defence had been captured and the difficulties still to be encountered were comparatively small the next day an attack was made upon a strong building known as the mess house this was first breached by the artillery and then carried by assault by the 53rd and 90th regiments and a detachment of sikhs the latter single handed storming another building called the observatory in the rear of the mess house  at the same time the garrison of the residency had in accordance with the plan brought out by kavanagh begun operations on their side the capture of the secunderbagh and mosque had been signalled to them and while the attack on the mess house was being carried out they had blown down the outer wall of their defences shelled the ground beyond and then advanced carrying two large buildings facing them at the point of the bayonet  all day the fighting continued the british gaining ground on either side the next day the houses still intervening between them were captured and in the afternoon the defenders of the residency and the relieving force joined hands the total loss of the latter was 122 officers and men killed and 345 wounded  frank malletts letter to sir john greendale was not sent off he received a bullet through the left arm as the troops advanced against the secunderbagh but using his sash as a sling led on his company against the defenders crowded in the garden and took part in the desperate fighting three of his brother officers were killed during the three days fighting and five others wounded  well marshall he said on the evening of the day when the way was open to the residency you have not cheated your creditor i see  no captain mallett i thought of him when those fellows in the mosque were keeping such a heavy fire upon us as we were waiting to get into the secunderbagh it seemed to me that his chance of ever getting his money was not worth much how the bullets did whizz about i felt sure that we should be all mown down before we could get under the shelter of the wall  i dont think i shall ever feel afraid in battle again one gets to see that musketry fire is not so very dangerous after all if it were very few of us would have got through the three days fighting alive whereas the casualties only amount to onetenth of the force engaged i am very sorry you are wounded  oh my wound is a mere trifle i scarcely felt it until the sergeant next to me said you are wounded in the arm captain mallett the doctor says that it narrowly missed the bone but in this case a miss is as good as a mile i am very sorry about hatchard and rivers and miles they were all good fellows and when this excitement is over we shall miss them sadly it will give you your step  yes i wont say that it is lucky for one cannot forget how it has been gained still it is a good lift for me for there are two or three down for purchase below me and otherwise i should have had to wait a long time it puts you one higher on the list captain mallett  i am going to clear out altogether as soon as the fighting is all over so whether i am fourth or fifth on the list makes no difference whatever to me  still it is a great satisfaction to have been through this and to have taken ones share in the work of revenge it was a horrible business in the secunderbagh though one did not think of it at the time the villains richly deserved what they got but i own that i should not care to go into the place again they must have suffered tremendously altogether the colonel said this afternoon that he found their loss had been put down as at least six or seven thousand  the regiment took its full share in the work that followed the relief of lucknow portions being attached to each of the flying columns which scoured oude defeated kunwer singh and drove the rebels before them wherever they encountered them  in the beginning of february the vacancies in the ranks were filled up by a draft from england the work had been fatiguing in the extreme but the men were as a rule in splendid health the constant excitement preventing their suffering from the effect of heat or attacks of fever  two companies which had been away from the headquarters of the regiment for six weeks found on their return a number of letters awaiting them the first they had received since leaving england captain mallett who commanded this detachment found one from sir john greendale written after the receipt of his letter from cawnpore  my dear mallett  we were all delighted to get your letter long before we received it we had the news of the desperate fighting at lucknow which was of course telegraphed down to the coast and got here before your letter you may imagine that we looked anxiously through the list of killed and wounded and were glad indeed that your name in the latter had the word slightly after it  things are going on here much as usual there was a terrible sensation on the very morning after you left at the disappearance of martha bennett the daughter of one of your tenants she left the house just at dusk the evening before and has not been heard of since as she took nothing with her it is improbable in the extreme that she can have fled and there can be little doubt that the poor girl was murdered possibly by some passing tramps however though the strictest search was made throughout the neighbourhood her body has never been discovered  we lost another neighbour just about the time you leftpercy carthew he went for a years big game shooting in north america we dont miss him much as he lived in london and was not often down at his place i dont remember his being there since you came back from the crimea anyhow i do not think that i ever saw you and him together either in a hunting field or at a dinner party which of course you would have been had you both been down here at the same time if i remember right you were at the same school  and then followed some gossip about mutual friends and the letter concluded  the general excitement is calming down a little now that delhi is taken and the garrison of lucknow brought off of course there will be a great deal more fighting before the whole thing is over but there is no longer any fear for the safety of india the sikhs have come out splendidly who would have thought it after the tremendous thrashing we gave them a few years back  take care of yourself lad you have the victoria cross and can do very well without a bar so give someone else the chance my wife and bertha send their love  two or three of his other letters were from friends in regiments at home bewailing their hard fortune at being out of the fighting the last he opened bore the latest postmark it was from his solicitor and enclosed marshalls cancelled bill  of course as you requested me to give 300 pounds for the enclosed i did so but by the way in which morrison jumped at the offer i believe that he would have been glad to have taken half that sum  mallett had gone into his tent to open his letters in quiet he presently went to the entrance and catching sight of marshall called him up  i have managed that affair for you marshall he said and have arranged it in a way that i am sure will be satisfactory to us both you must look upon me now as your creditor instead of morrison and you wont find me a hard one here is your cancelled bill for four hundred and fifty i got it for three hundred so that a third of your debt is wiped off at once as to the rest you can pay me as you intended to pay him but i dont want you to stint yourself unnecessarily pay me ten or fifteen pounds at a time at your convenience and dont let us say anything more about it  but i may be killed marshall said in a voice struggling with emotion  if you are lad there is an end of the business as you know i am very well off and the loss would not affect me in any way very likely you will light upon some rich booty in one of these affairs with a rebel rajah and will be able to pay it all off at once  i will if i can mallett though i think that it will be much more satisfactory to do it out of my savings except that i shall have the pleasure of knowing that if i were wiped out afterwards you would not be a loser  a few days later frank mallett was sent with his company to rout out a party of rebels reported to be in possession of a large village twenty miles away armstrong was laid up by a slight attack of fever and he asked that marshall should be appointed in his place on this occasion  one wants two subalterns colonel he said for a business like this i may have to detach a party to the back of the village to cut off the rebels retreat and it may be necessary to assault in two places  certainly take marshall if you wish it captain mallett the young fellow has been behaving excellently and has gone far to retrieve his character captain johnson has reported to me that he is exemplary in his duties and has shown much gallantry under fire especially in that affair near neemuch in which he rushed forward and carried off a wounded man who would otherwise have certainly been killed i reported the case to the brigadier who said that at any other time the young fellow would probably have been recommended for a vc but that there were so many cases of individual gallantry that there was no chance of his getting that but marshall was specially mentioned in orders four days ago and this will of course count in his favour  take him with you by all means your ensign only joined with the last draft and you will certainly want someone with you of greater experience than he has  marshall was delighted when he heard that he was to accompany captain mallett in addition to his own company a hundred men of the punjaub infantry and fifty sikh horse were under captain malletts command the native troops being added at the last moment as a report of another body of mutineers marching in the same direction had just come in  frank spent a quarter of an hour in inspecting some maps of the country and had a talk with the native who was to act as guide when the little force was drawn up he marched off in quite another direction from that in which the village lay being in command he was mounted for the first time during the campaign the lieutenant in command of the sikhs presently rode up to him  i beg your pardon captain mallett but i cannot but think that your guide is taking you in the wrong direction i looked at the map before starting and find that dousi lies almost due north we are marching west  you are quite right mr hammond but you see i dont want any of the natives about the camp to guess where we are going none of these oude fellows bears us any goodwill and one of them might hurry off and carry information as to the line we were following  we will march four miles along this road and then strike off by another leading north we must surprise them if we can we dont really know much about their force and even if we did they may be joined by some other body before we get therethere are numerous bands of them all over the country and in the next place if they knew that we were coming they might bolt before we got there  besides some of these villages are very strong and we might suffer a good deal before we could carry it if they had notice of our coming however you were quite right to point out to me that we were not going in what seemed the right direction  the column started at four oclock in the afternoon it had been intended that it should move off at daybreak on the following morning but frank had suggested to the colonel that it would be advantageous to march half the distance that night  of course we could do the twenty miles tomorrow colonel he said but the men would hardly be in the best fighting trim when they got there moreover by starting in the afternoon the natives here would imagine that we were going to pounce upon some fugitives at a village not far away  the permission was readily granted and accordingly after marching until nine oclock in the evening the column halted in a grove of trees to which their guide led them half a mile from the road each man carried four days cooked provisions in his haversack there was therefore no occasion for fires to be lighted and after seeing that sentries were placed round the edge of the grove frank mallett joined the officers who were gathered in the centre  what time shall we march tomorrow the officer in command of the native infantry asked  not until the heat of the day is over we have come about twelve miles and have as much more to do and if we start at the same hour as we did today we shall get there about nine i shall halt half a mile away reconnoitre the place at night and if the ground is open enough to move without making a noise we will post the troops in the positions they are to occupy and attack as soon as day breaks  in that way we shall get the benefit of surprise and at the same time have daylight to prevent their escaping besides if we attacked at night a good many of the villagers and perhaps women might be killed in the confusion  tomorrow morning we will cut down some young saplings and make a dozen scaling ladders we have brought a bag of gunpowder to blow open the gate and if the main body enter there while two parties scale the walls at other points we shall get them in a trap  at about nine oclock the next evening the guide said that they were now within half a mile of the village and they accordingly halted the men were ordered to keep silence and to lie down and sleep as soon as they had eaten their supper while mallett accompanied by the two officers of the native troops and the guide made his way towards the village  it was found to be larger than had been anticipated on three sides cultivated fields extended to the foot of the strong wall that surrounded it while on the fourth there was rough broken ground covered with scrub and brushes  how far does this extend captain mallett asked the guide  about half a mile and then joins a big jungle sahib  this is the side they will try to escape by therefore mr herbert you will lead your men round here with four scaling ladders you will post them along at the foot of the wall and when you hear the explosion of the powder bag or an outburst of musketry firing you will scale the wall and advance to meet me keeping as wide a front as possible so as to prevent fugitives from passing you and getting out here the cavalry will cut off those who make across the open country i would give a good deal to know how many of these fellows are inside four hundred was the number first reported they may of course have already moved away and on the other hand they may have been joined by others they were said to have some guns with them but these will be of little use in the streets of the village and we shall probably capture them before they have time to fire a single round  at three oclock the troops stood to their arms and moved noiselessly off towards the positions assigned to them captain mallett led his own company to within four hundred yards of the wall and then sent marshall forward with two men to fix the powder bag and fuse to the gate when they had done this they were to remain quietly there until warned that the company was about to advance then they were to light the fuse which was cut to burn two minutes to retire round the angle of the wall and join the company as it came up the troops lay down for the ground was level and there was no spot behind which they could conceal themselves and impatiently watched the sky until the first gleam of light appeared another ten minutes elapsed the dawn was spreading fast and a man was sent forward to lieutenant marshall to say that the company was getting in motion  as soon as the messenger was seen to reach the gates mallett gave the word the men sprang to their feet  dont double men we shall be there in time and it is no use getting out of breath and spoiling your shooting  they were within a hundred yards of the gate when they heard a shout from the village and as they pressed on shot after shot rang out from the wall a moment later there was a heavy explosion and as the smoke cleared off the gate was seen to be destroyed  a few seconds later the troops burst through the opening infantry bugles were sounding in the village and there was a loud din of shouting cries of alarm and orders from every house the mutineers rushed musket in hand but were shot down or bayoneted by the troops as the latter approached a large open space in the middle of the village a strong body of sepoys advanced in good order to meet them led by their native officers  steady men steady captain mallett shouted form across the street  quickly the men fell in though several dropped as a volley flashed out from the sepoy line  one volley and then charge mallett shouted some of the guns were already empty but the rest poured in their fire when the word was given as regularly as if on parade  level bayonetscharge and with a loud cheer the soldiers sprang forward the sepoys well commanded though they were wavered and broke but the british were upon them before they could fly and with shouts of cawnpore used their bayonets with deadly effect driving the enemy before them  as they came into the open and the fugitives cleared away on either side they saw a long line of men drawn up a moment later a flash of fire ran along it  shoulder to shoulder men captain mallett shouted give them the bayonet  with a hoarse roar of rage for many of their comrades had fallen the company rushed forward and burst through the line of mutineers as if it had been a sheet of paper then they divided and captain mallett with half the company turned to the right marshall took the other wing to the left  encouraged by the smallness of the number of their assailants the mutineers cheered on by their officers resisted stoutly a scattering fire opened upon the british from the houses round and the shouts of the mutineers rose louder and louder when a heavy volley was suddenly poured into them and the punjaubies rushed out from the street facing that by which the british had entered they bore to the right and fell upon the body with which marshall was engaged  the sepoys taken wholly by surprise at once lost heart cheering loudly the british attacked them with increased ardour while the punjaubies flung themselves into their midst in an instant that flank of the sepoys was scattered in headlong flight hotly pursued by their foes there was no firing for the muskets were all empty but the bayonet did its work and the open space and the streets leading from it were thickly strewn with dead  the sepoys attacked by captain malletts party on the other hand though shaken for a moment stood firm led by two or three native officers who fighting with the greatest bravery exhorted their men to continue their resistance  would you rather be hung than fight they shouted they are but a handful we are five to one against them forward men and exterminate these feringhees before the others can come back to their assistance  the sepoys were now the assailants and with furious shouts pressed round the little body of british troops  steady men steady captain mallett shouted as he drove his sword through the body of one of the rebel leaders who rushed at him keep together back to back we shall have help here in a minute  it was longer than that however before relief came for three or four minutes a desperate struggle went on then marshalls voice was heard shouting  this way men this way  a moment later there was a surging movement in the ranks of the insurgents and with a dozen men marshall burst through them and joined the party these at once fell furiously upon the mutineers and the latter were already giving way when some fifty of the punjaubies led by their officers fell upon them  the effect was decisive the sepoys scattered at once and fled in all directions pursued by the furious soldiers and the punjaubies reaching the walls the fugitives leapt recklessly down forty or fifty of them were cut down by the cavalry but the greater portion reached the broken ground in safety here the cavalry could not follow them for the ground was covered with rocks and boulders concealed by the bushes in the village itself three hundred and fifty lay dead  thanks marshall frank mallett said when the fight in the village was over you arrived just in time for it was going very hard with us altogether it was more than we bargained for for they were certainly over a thousand strong they must have been joined by a very strong party yesterday  i ought not to have gone so far marshall replied but i had no idea that all the punjaubies had come to our side of the fight the men were so eager that i had the greatest difficulty in getting them off the pursuit fortunately i met herbert and learned that all his men were with us then i gathered a dozen of our fellows and rushed off telling him to follow as soon as he could get some of his men together  you can imagine what agony i felt when as i entered the open space i saw a surging mass of sepoys and no sign of any of you and how i cursed my own folly and what delight i felt as on cutting our way through we found that you were still on your feet  yes it was a close shave marshall another two or three minutes and it would have been all over the men fought like lions as you can see by the piledup dead there half of them were down and twenty men cannot hold out long against four or five hundred  we owe our lives to you beyond all question i dont see that you were in the least to blame in the matter for naturally you would suppose that some of the punjaubies would have joined us besides it was of course essential that you should not give the sepoys time to rally but should follow them up hotly  where is anstruther  i dont know i have not seen him since we entered the square  have any of you seen mr anstruther captain mallett asked turning to some soldiers standing near  he is lying over there sir one of the men said he was just in front of me when the pandies fired that volley at us as we came out of the streets and he pitched forward and fell like a stone i think that he was shot through the head sir  they went across to the spot the ensign lay there shot through the brain four or five soldiers lay round him one of them was dead the others more or less seriously wounded  sound the assembly captain mallett said as he turned away sadly to a bugler let us see what our losses are    chapter 4  the bugle sounded and in a short time the infantry fell in they had been engaged in searching the houses for mutineers the punjaubies had lost but five killed and thirteen wounded while of the whites an officer and eighteen men were killed and sixteen wounded nine of the former having fallen in the bayonet struggle with the sepoys nine guns were captured none of which had been fired the attack having been so sudden that the sepoys had only had time to fall in before their assailants were upon them  it is a creditable victory mallett said considering that we had to face more than double the number that we expected our casualties are heavy but they are nothing to those of the mutineers  sergeant take a file of men and go round and count the number of the enemy who have fallen  ah here comes a sowar and we shall hear what the cavalry have been doing outside  the trooper handed him a paper fiftythree of the enemy killed the rest escaped into the jungle on our side two wounded one seriously one slightly  that is as well as we could expect marshall of course most of them got over the wall at the back you see all our plans were disarranged by finding them in such unexpected strength had we been able to thrash them by ourselves the punjaubies would have cut off the retreat in that direction as it was that part of the business is a failure  the sergeant presently returned  there are 340 in the streets sir he reported and i reckon there are another 20 or 30 killed in the houses but i have not searched them yet  that is sufficiently close upwards of 400 is good enough  now mr marshall set the men to work making stretchers to carry the wounded  mr herbert will you tell off a party of your men to dig a large grave outside the village for the killed and a small one apart for mr anstruther poor fellow i am sorry indeed at his loss he would have made a fine officer  sergeant hugging take a party and search the village for provisions we have got bread but lay hands on any fowls or goats that you can find and there may be some sheep  while this party was away another tore down the woodwork of an empty house and fires were soon burning an abundance of fowl and goats having been obtained the cavalry had by this time come in  while the meal was being cooked the british and punjaub dead were carried out to the spot where the grave had been dug the troops had a hearty meal and then marched out from the village they were drawn up round the graves and the bodies were laid reverently in them captain mallett said a few words over them the earth was then shovelled in and levelled and the troops marched to a wood a mile distant where they halted until the heat of the day was over they returned by the direct road to the camp which they reached at midnight  all concerned gained great credit for the heavy blow that had been inflicted on the mutineers and the affair was highly spoken of in the brigadiers report to the commander in chief shortly afterwards malletts name appeared in general orders as promoted to a brevet majority pending a confirmation by the home authorities  two days after the return of the little column the brigade marched and joined the force collected at cawnpore for the final operation against lucknow and on the 3rd of march reached the commander in chief at the dil koosha which had been captured with the same ease as on the occasion of the former advance  they found that while the main body had gathered there 6000 men under sir james outram had crossed the goomtee from the alum bagh and after defeating two serious attacks by the enemy had taken up a position at chinhut on the 9th sir colin campbell captured the martiniere with trifling loss on the 11th general outram pushed his advance as far as the iron bridge and established batteries commanding the passage of the stone bridge also on the 12th the imambarra was breached and stormed and the troops pressed so hotly on the flying enemy that they entered the kaiser bagh the strongest fortified palace in the city and drove the enemy from it  the  th was engaged in this action and major mallett was leading his company to the assault on the imambarra when a shot brought him to the ground when he recovered his senses he found himself in a chamber that had been hastily converted into a hospital with the regimental doctor leaning over him  what has happened he asked  you have been hit mallett and have had a very close shave of it indeed but as it is you will soon be about again  where was i hit i dont feel any pain  you were hit in the neck about half an inch above the collarbone and the ball has gone through the muscles of the neck and beyond the fact that you wont be able to turn your head for some time you will be none the worse for it an inch further to the right or an inch lower or higher and it would have been fatal it was not one of the enemy who did you this service for the ball went up from behind and came out in front it is evidently a random shot from one of our own fellows  i am always more afraid of a shot from behind than i am of one in front when i am leading the company doctor the men get so excited that they blaze away anyhow and in the smoke are just as likely to hit an officer two or three paces ahead of them as an enemy how long have i been insensible  you were brought in here half an hour ago and i dont suppose that you had lain many minutes on the ground before you were picked up  have we taken the imambarra  yes and what is better still our fellows rushed into the kaiser bagh at the heels of the enemy we got the news ten minutes ago  that is good indeed we anticipated desperate fighting before we took that  yes it was an unlucky shot mallett that knocked you out of your share in the loot we have always heard that the place was full of treasure and jewels  if there is no one else who wants your attention doctor i advise you to join the regiment there for an hour or two as for me i care nothing about the loot there are plenty of fellows who will benefit by it more than i should and i give up my share willingly  the doctor shook his head  i am afraid i cannot do that but between ourselves i have let ferguson slip away and he is to divide what he gets with me  have we any wounded  i dont know yet the whole thing was done so suddenly that the loss cannot have been heavy i was in the rear of the brigade when you were brought in and as the case at first looked bad i got some of the stretcher men with me to burst open the door of this house and established a dozen temporary beds here as you see there are only four others tenanted and they are all hopeless cases no doubt the rest have all been carried off to the rear as only the men who helped me would have known of this place  now that you have come round i will send a couple of hospital orderlies in here and be off myself to the hospital in the rear i will look in again this evening  in a short time the doctor returned with an orderly  i cannot find another now he said but one will be enough here is a flask of brandy and he will find you water somewhere there is nothing to be done for any of you at present except to give you drink when you want it  two hours later marshall came in  thank god you are not dangerously hurt mallett he said i only heard that you were down threequarters of an hour ago when i ran against armstrong in the kaiser bagh he told me that he had seen you fall at the beginning of the fight and i got leave from the colonel to look for you at the hospital no one seemed to know anything about you but i luckily came across jefferies who told me where to find you and that your wound was not serious so i hurried back here he said that you would be taken to the hospital this evening  yes i am in luck again like the last it is only a flesh wound though it is rather worse for i expect that i shall have to go about with a stiff neck for some weeks to come and it is disgusting being laid up in the middle of an affair like this have we lost many fellows  no scobell is the only officer killed hunter groves and parkinson are woundedparkinson they say seriously we have twentytwo rank and file killed and twenty or thirty wounded i have not seen the returns  and how about the loot marshall mallett said with a smile was that all humbug  it is stupendous we were among the first at the kaiser bagh and i dont believe that there is a man who has not got his pockets stuffed with gold coins there were chests and chests full they did not bother about the jewelsi think they took them for coloured glass i kept my eyes open and picked up enough to pay my debt to you five times over  i am heartily glad of that marshall dont let it slip through your fingers again  that you may be sure i wont i shall send them all home to our agent to sell and have the money put by for purchasing my next step i have had my lesson and it will last me for life  well i must be going now old man the colonel did not like letting me go as of course the men want looking after and the pandies may make an effort to drive us out of the kaiser bagh again so goodbye if i can get away this evening i will come to see you at the hospital  a week later frank mallett was sitting in a chair by his bedside the fighting was all over and a strange quiet had succeeded the long roar of battle his neck was strapped up with bandages and save that he was unable to move his head in the slightest degree he felt well enough to take his place with the regiment again many of his fellow officers dropped in from time to time for a short chat but the duty was heavy all open resistance had ceased but the troops were engaged in searching the houses and turning out all rough characters who had made lucknow their centre and had no visible means of subsistence large gangs of the lower class population were set to work to bury the dead which would otherwise have rendered the city uninhabitable strong guards were posted at night alike to prevent soldiers from wandering in search of loot and to prevent fanatics from making sudden attacks  there is a wounded man in the hospital across the road who wants to see you mallett the surgeon said one morning he belongs to your company but as he only came out with the last draft and was transferred only on the day that the fighting began i dont suppose you know him he said i was to tell you his name was george lechmere though he enlisted as john hilton  i seem to know the name doctor though i dont remember at present where i came across him i suppose i can go in to see him  oh yes there is no objection whatever your wound is doing as well as can be though of course you are still weak from loss of blood i shall send you up this afternoon to the hospital just established in the park of the dil koosha we shall get you all out as soon as we can for the stench of this town at present is dreadful and wounds cannot be expected to do well in such a poisoned atmosphere  is this man badly hit doctor  very dangerously i have scarcely a hope of saving him and think it probable that he may not live another twentyfour hours of course he may take a change for the better i will take you to him i have finished here now  it must have been a bad time for you doctor mallett said as they went across  tremendously hard but most interesting i had not had more than two hours sleep at a time since the fighting began till last night and then i could not keep up any longer of course it has been the same with us all and the heat has made it very trying i am particularly anxious to get the wounded well out of the place for now that the excitement is over i expect an outbreak of fever or dysentery  there that is your man in the corner bed over there  mallett went over to the bedside and looked at the wounded man his face was drawn and pinched his eyes sunken in his head his face deadly pale and his hair matted with perspiration  do you know me captain mallett  no lad i cannot say that i do though when the doctor told me your name it seemed familiar to me very likely i should have recognised you if i had met you a week since but you see we are both altered a good deal from the effect of our wounds  i am the son of farmer lechmere your tenant  good heavens man you dont mean to say you are lechmeres eldest son george what in the world brought you to this  you did the man said sternly your villainy brought me here  frank mallett gave a start of astonishment that cost him so violent a twinge in his wound that he almost cried out with sudden pain  what wild idea have you got into your head my poor fellow he said soothingly i am conscious of having done no wrong to you or yours i saw your father and mother on the afternoon before i came away they made no complaint of anything  no they were contented enough do you know captain mallett that i loved martha bennett  no i have been so little at home of recent years that i know very little of the private affairs of my tenants but i remember her of course and i was grieved to learn by a letter from sir john greendale the other day that in some strange way she was missing  who knew that better than yourself the man said raising himself on his elbow and fixing a look of such deadly hatred upon mallett that the latter involuntarily drew back a step  i saw you laughing and talking to her in front of her fathers house i heard you with her in their garden the evening before you left and she disappeared and it was my voice you heard in the lane had i known that you were going that night i would have followed you and killed you and saved her the next morning you were both gone i waited a time and then went to the depot of your regiment and enlisted i had failed to save her but at least i could avenge her that bullet was mine and had you not stumbled over a pandys body i suppose just as i pulled my trigger you would have been a dead man  i did not know that i had failed and rushing forward with my company was in the thickest of the fight i wanted to be killed but no shot struck me and at last when chasing a pandy along a passage in the kaiser bagh he turned and levelled his piece at me mine was loaded and i could have shot him down as he turned but i stood and let him have his shot when i found myself here i was sorry that he had not finished me at once but when i heard that you were alive and likely to recover i thanked him in my heart that he had left me a few more days of life that i could let you know that it was i who had fired and that marthas wrong had not been wholly unavenged  he sank back exhausted on to the pillow frank mallett had made no attempt to interrupt him the sudden agony of his wound and his astonishment at this strange accusation had given him so grave a shock that he leaned against the wall behind him in silent wonder  hello mallett what the deuce is the matter with you the surgeon exclaimed as looking up from a patient over whom he was bending a short distance away his eyes fell on the officers face you look as if you were going to faint man  here orderly some brandy and water quickly  frank drank some of the brandy and water and sat down for a few minutes then when he saw the surgeon at the other end of the room he got up and went across to lechmeres bed  there is some terrible mistake lechmere he said quietly i swear to you on my honour as a gentleman that you are altogether wrong from the moment that i got into my dog cart at bennetts i never saw martha again i know nothing whatever of this talk in the garden did you think you saw me as well as heard me  no you were on one side of that high wall and i on the other but i heard enough to know who it was you told her that you had to go abroad at once but that if she would come out there you would put her in charge of someone until you could marry her you told her that she could not stay where she was long and i knew what that meant i suppose she is at calcutta still waiting for of course she could not have come out with you i suppose that she is breaking her heart there nowif she is not dead as i hope she is  did you hear the word calcutta or india mentioned lechmere  no i did not but i heard quite enough everyone knew that you were going in a day or two and that was enough for me after what i had seen in the afternoon  you saw nothing in the afternoon captain mallett said angrily the girls father and mother were at home we were all chatting together until we came out she came to the trap with me while they stood at the open window it was not more than a minute before i drove off i have not spoken to the girl half a dozen times since she was a little child  why man if everyone took such insane fancies in his head as you do no man would dare to speak to a woman at all  however he went on in an altered voice this is not a time for anger you are very ill lechmere but the doctor has not given you up and i trust that you will yet get round and will be able to prove to your own satisfaction that whatever has happened to this poor girl i at least am wholly innocent of it but should you not get over this hurt i should not like you to go to your grave believing that i had done you this great wrong i speak to you as to a dying man and having no interest in deceiving you and i swear to you before heaven that i know absolutely nothing of this i too may fall from a rebel shot before long and i thank god that i can meet you before him as an innocent man in this matter  i must be going for i see the doctor coming to fetch me goodbye lad we may not meet again though i trust we shall but if not i give you my full forgiveness for that shot you fired at me it was the result of a strange mistake but had i acted as you believed i should have well deserved the death you intended for me  confound it mallett there seems no end of mischief from your visit here in the first place you were nearly knocked over yourself and now there is this man lying insensible so for goodness sake get off to your room again and lie down and keep yourself quiet for the rest of the day i shall have you demoralising the whole ward if you stay here  captain mallett walked back with a much feebler and less steady step than that with which he had entered the hospital he had some doubts whether the man who had made this strange accusation and had so nearly taken his life was really sane and whether he had not altogether imagined the conversation which he declared he had heard in the garden he remembered now the sudden way in which george lechmere had turned round and gone away when he saw him saying goodbye to martha and how she had shrugged her shoulders in contempt  the man must either be mad or of a frightfully jealous disposition to conjure up harm out of such an incident and one who would do so might well when his brain was on fire conjure up this imaginary conversation still he might have heard some man talking to her from what sir john had said she did leave the house and go into the garden about that hour and she certainly never returned  he remembered all about george lechmere now he had the reputation of being the best judge of cattle in the neighbourhood and a thoroughly steady fellow but he could see no resemblance in the shrunk and wasted face to that he remembered  that evening both the officers and men in the hospital were carried away to the new one outside the town when the doctor came in before they were moved he told mallett that the man he had seen had recovered from his swoon  he was very nearly gone he said but we managed to get him round and it seems to me that he has been better since i dont know what he said to you or you to him and i dont want to know but he seems to have got something off his mind he is less feverish than he was and i have really some faint hopes of pulling him through especially as he will now be in a more healthful atmosphere  it was a comfort indeed to all the wounded when late that evening they lay on beds in the hospital marquees the air seemed deliciously cool and fresh and there was a feeling of quiet and restfulness that was impossible in the town with the constant movement of troops the sound of falling masonry the dust and fetid odour of decay  a week later the surgeon told mallett that he had now hopes that the soldier he was interested in would recover  the chances were a hundred to one against him he said but the one chance has come off  will he be fit for service again doctor  yes i dont see why he should not be though it will be a long time before he can carry his kit and arms on a long days march it is hot enough now but we have not got to the worst by a long way and as there is still a vast amount of work to be done i expect that the regiment will be off again before long  well at any rate i shall be able to go with you doctor  i dont quite say that mallett the doctor said doubtfully in another fortnight your wound will be healed so that you will be capable of ordinary duty but certainly not long marches if you do go you will have to ride there must be no more marching with your company for some time  a week later orders were issued under which the regiment was appointed to form part of the force which under the command of general walpole was to undertake a campaign against rohilcund a district in which the great majority of the rebels who had escaped from lucknow had now established themselves unfortunately the extent of the city and the necessity for the employment of a large proportion of the british force in the actual assault had prevented anything like a complete investment of the town and the consequence had been that after the fall of the kaiser bagh by far the greater portion of the rebel force in the city had been able to march away without molestation  before leaving mallett had an interview with george lechmere who was now out of danger  i should have known you now lechmere he said as he came to his bedside of course you are still greatly changed but you are getting back your old expression and i hope that in the course of two or three months you will be able to take your place in the ranks again  i dont know sir i aint fit to stay with the regiment and have thought of being invalided home and then buying my discharge i know you have said nothing as to how you got that wound not even to the doctor for if you had done so there is not a man in hospital who would have spoken to me but how could i join the regiment again knowing that if there was any suspicion of what i had done every man would draw away from me and that there would be nothing for me to do but to put a bullet in my head  but no one ever will know it it was a mad act and i believe you were partly mad at the time  i think so myself now that i look back i think now that i must have been mad all along it never once entered my mind to doubt that it was you and now i see plainly enough that except what the man said about going awayand anyone might have said thatthere was not a shadow of ground or suspicion against you but even if i had never had that suspicion i should have left home  why sir i know that my own father and mother suspected that i killed her i resented it at the time i felt hard and bitter against it but as i have been lying here i have come to see that i brought their suspicions upon myself by my own conduct and that they had a thousand times better ground for suspecting me than i had for suspecting you  all that happened was my fault martha cared for me once but it was my cursed jealousy that drove her from me she was gay and light hearted and it was natural for her to take her pleasure which was harmless enough if i had not made a grievance of it if i had not driven her from me she would have been my wife long before harm came to her but it was as well that it was not so for as i was then i know i should have made her life a hell  i did it all and i have been punished for it even at the end she might never have gone off if i had not shouted out and tried to climb the wall she must have recognised my voice and knowing that i had her secret feared that i might kill her and him too and so she went she would not have gone as she did without even a bonnet or a shawl if it had not been for that  then you dont think as most people there do that she was murdered  not a bit sir i never thought so for a moment she went straight away with that man i think now i know who it was  never mind about that lechmere you know what the bible says vengeance is mine saith the lord and whoever it may be leave him safely in gods hands  yes sir i shall try to act up to that i was fool enough to think that i could avenge her and a nice business i made of it  well i think it is nonsense of you to think of leaving the regiment there is work to be done here there is the work of punishing men who have committed the most atrocious crimes there is the work of winning back india for england every englishman out here who can carry a weapon ought to remain at his post until the work is done  as to this wound of mine that is a matter between us only as i have told you i have altogether forgiven you and am not even disposed greatly to blame you thinking as you did that i was responsible for that poor girls flight i shall never mention it to a soul i have already put it out of my mind therefore it is as if it had never been done and there is no reason whatever why you should shrink from companionship with your comrades i shall think much better of you for doing your duty like a man than if you went home again and shrank from it  you are too good sir altogether too good  nonsense man besides you have to remember that you have not gone unpunished had it not been for your feeling after you had as you believed killed me you never would have stood and let that sepoy shoot you so that all the pain that you have been going through and may still have to go through before you are quite cured is a punishment that you have yourself accepted after a man has once been punished for a crime there is an end of it and you need grieve no further over it but it will be a lesson that i hope and believe you will never forget  hackett who has been my soldier servant for the last five years was killed in the fight in the kaiser bagh if you like when you rejoin i shall apply for you in his stead it will make your work a good deal easier for you and i should like to have the son of one of my old tenants about me  the man burst into tears  there dont lets say anything more about it mallett went on taking the thin hand of the soldier in his we will consider it settled and i shall look out for you in a couple of months so get well as quick as you can and dont worry yourself by thinking of the past i must be off now for i have to take down a party of convalescents to rejoin this evening  goodbye lad and without waiting for any reply he turned and left the marquee    chapter 5  it is little more than two years and a half since i left lechmere but it seems almost a lifetime  it does seem a time major we must have marched thousands of miles and i could not say how many times we have been engaged there has not been a week that we have not had a fight and sometimes two or three of them  well thank god we are back again still i am glad to have been through it  so am i sir it will be something to look back on and it is curious to think that while we have been seeing and doing so much father and my brother bob have just been going about over the farm and seeing to the cattle and looking after the animals day in and day out without ever going away save to market two or three times a month at chippenham  and you have quite made up your mind to stay with me lechmere  quite sir short of your turning me out there is nothing that would get me away from you no one could be happier than i have been ever since i rejoined after that wound it has not been like master and servant sir you have just treated me as if you had been the squire and i had been your tenants son and that nothing had ever come between us you have made a man of me again and i only wish that i had more opportunities of showing you how i feel it  you have had opportunities enough and you have made the most of them you were by my side when i entered that house where there were a score of desperate rebels and it would have gone hard with us if aid had not come up you stood over me when i was knocked down by that charge of rebel cavalry and got half a dozen wounds before the hussars swept down and drove them back  i was well paid for that sir the man said with a smile  yes you got the victoria cross and no man ever won it more fairly but after all it was not so much by such things as these that you showed your feelings lechmere as by your constant and faithful service and by the care with which you looked after me still as i told you before i dont like standing in your way in the natural course of things you would have had your fathers farm and there is now no reason why you should not go back there  no sir since we heard that that poor girl came back home and died there is no reason why i should not go back to the old place but i dont like to two years of such a life as we have been leading does not fit one for farm work brother bob stopped and took my place while i went soldiering and even if i were willing to go back to it which i am not it would not be fair to him for me to step in just as if nothing had happened but anyhow i shall be glad to be back again at the old place and see them all father and mother will know now that they suspected me wrongly but they were not to blame mad as i was then i might have done it if i had had the chance  well lechmere you know well that i shall be always glad to have you with me as long as you are willing to stay perhaps the time will come when you may wish to make a home for yourself and you may be sure that the first farm on the estate that falls vacant shall be yours or as that does not very often happen i will see that you get a good one somewhere in the neighbourhood  the man shook his head and without answering went on unpacking his masters portmanteau they were at the hummums hotel in covent garden and had arrived half an hour before by the evening train having come overland from marseilles  two years soldiering had greatly altered george lechmere he had lost the heavy step caused by tramping over ploughed fields and was a well setup alert and smartlooking soldier and although now in civilian clothesfor his master had bought him out of the service when he sent in his own papersno one could avoid seeing that he had served for in addition to the military carriage there was the evidence of two deep scars on his face the handiwork of the mutineers sabres on the day when he had stood over his master surrounded by rebel horse his complexion was deeply bronzed by the sun and there was that steady but watchful expression in his eyes that is characteristic of men who have gone through long and dangerous service  i shall stay two or three days in town major mallett said i must get an entire refit before i go down you had better come round with me to the tailors tomorrow the first thing after breakfast you will want three or four suits too  yes sir and besides they would like to know down there when you are coming home they are sure to want to give you a welcome  and you too lechmere i am sure that all your old friends will give you as hearty a welcome as they will give me indeed it ought to be a good deal heartier for you have been living among them all your life while i have been away for the most part ever since i was a boy  four days later they went down to chippenham mr norton the steward was on the platform when the train came in  welcome home again sir he said warmly as frank stepped from the carriage we were all glad indeed when we heard that you were back safe and were coming down among us  i am glad enough to be back again norton frank mallett said as he shook the mans hand we had warm work of it for a bit but at the end when the excitement was over one got pretty tired of it  this is george lechmere norton the major said as he went along with the agent to where george was standing with the pile of luggage you have heard how gallantly he behaved and how he saved my life at the risk of his own  how are you george the agent said as he shook hands with him i should hardly have known you indeed i am sure i should not have done so if i had met you in the street you seem to have grown taller and altogether different  i have lost flesh a bit mr norton and i have learnt to stand upright and i shall be some time before i get rid of this paint the sun has given me  yes you are as brown as a berry george we saw in the gazette about your getting the victoria cross in saving the squires life i can tell you every man on the estate felt proud of you  are you ready to be off sir  yes i suppose you have got the dog cart outside as i asked you  well no sir the agent said in a tone of some embarrassment you see the tenants had made up their minds that you ought to come in a different sort of style and so without asking me about it they ordered an open carriage to be here to meet you i knew nothing about it until last night the dog cart is here and will take up your luggage  well i suppose it cannot be helped mallett laughed of course they meant it kindly  i will see the luggage got in the dog cart and come over with it lechmere said  you can see it into the dog cart george but you must come with me i have got to put up with it and you must too  he stood chatting with mr norton on the platform till george returned and said that the luggage was all packed and that the dog cart had gone on ahead there was an amused look on his face which was explained when on going out mallett found an open carriage with four horses with postilions in new purple silk jackets and orange caps and large rosettes of the same colour at the horses heads  bless me said the major in a tone of dismay i shall feel as if i were a candidate for the county  they are the family colours you see sir  yes i know norton and the conservative colours too well it cannot be helped and it does not make much difference after all  there will be no fuss when i get there i hope norton he went on as he took his place and lechmere climbed up into the seat behind  well sir the agent said apologetically there is an arch or two you see the tenants wanted to do the thing properly and the school children will be on the lawn and there are going to be some bonfires in the evening and they have got a big box of fireworks down from london why sir it would be strange if they did not give you a welcome after going through all that and being wounded three times and getting so much credit why it wouldnt be english sir  i suppose its all right mallett said resignedly and indeed norton one cannot help being pleased at seeing ones tenants glad to have one home again  in halfanhours drive they arrived at the boundary of the estate here an arch had been erected and a score of the tenants and tenants sons assembled on horseback gave a loud cheer as the carriage drove up and as it died away one shouted  why that is george lechmere behind give him a cheer too and again a hearty shout went up  the carriage stopped and major mallett said a few words thanking them heartily for the welcome they had given him and assuring them what pleasure it was to him to be back again  i thank you also he concluded for the cheer that you have given to my faithful comrade and friend george lechmere as you all know he saved my life at the risk of his own and has received the greatest honour a soldier can gainthe victoria cross you have a good right to be proud of him as one of yourselves and to give him a hearty welcome  the carriage then drove on again the farmers riding close behind as an escort at the entrance of the drive up to the house another and larger arch had been erected here the rest of the tenants and the women were collected and there was another hearty greeting and another speech from mallett  then they drove up to the house where a number of the gentry had assembled to welcome him after shaking hands and chatting with these for a short time frank went round among the tenants saying a few words to each when he had done this he invited them all to a dinner on the lawn that day week and then went into the house where the steward had prepared a meal  among the familiar faces frank missed those he would most gladly have seen he had a year before received a letter from lady greendale telling him of sir johns sudden death and had learned from the steward during the drive that she and her daughter were in london  they went there a month ago he said a year had passed after sir johns death and people say that it is not likely that they will be much at home again for some time lady greendale has high connections in london as you know sir  yes she was a daughter of lord huntinglen norton  yes sir they always went up to town for the season and they say lady greendale liked london better than the country and now that miss bertha is outfor she was presented at court a fortnight agopeople think they wont be much down at greendale for the present  has miss greendale grown up pretty i thought she would but of course when i went away she was only a girl not fully developed  she is a beautiful young lady sir everyone says she is quite the belle of the county folks reckon she will make a great match she is very well liked too pleasant and nice without a bit of pride about her and very high spirited and i should say full of fun though of course the place has been pretty well shut up for the last year for four months after sir johns death they went away travelling and were only at home for a few weeks before they went up to london the other day in time for the first drawing room  i suppose we shall not see much of you for a time mallett one of his friends said as they sat at luncheon  no i dont suppose i shall be able to settle down for a bit after the life i have led i am afraid that i shall find the time hang heavily on my hands alone here  you must bring home a wife major mallett one of the ladies said  that is looking quite into the dim future mrs herbert he laughed you see since i first went on active service i have been removed altogether from feminine attractions of course i have been thinking it over but for the present my inclination turns towards yachting i have always been fond of the water and had a strong wish to go to sea when i was a boy but that aspiration was not encouraged however i can follow my bent now norton has been piling up money for me in my absence and i can afford myself the luxury of a big yacht of course i shall be in no hurry about it i shall either build or buy a biggish craft for racing in summer and cruising in winter  that means that you wont be here at all major mallett  oh no it does not mean that i can assure you i shall run down for a month three or four times a year say for shooting in september or october and for hunting a month or two later on besides i have to renew my acquaintance with my tenants and see that everything is going on comfortably i expect that i shall spend four or five months every year on the estate  till you settle down for good  yes till i settle down for good he laughed i suppose it will have to be someday  then you dont think of passing much time in london mallett  no indeed fortunately my father sold his town house three years ago he did not care about going up and of course it was of no use to me i have never had any opportunities for society and my present idea is that it would bore me horribly but ill dare say that i shall be there for a month or so in the season  of course there is my club to go to and plenty of men one knows but even if i had a longing for society i know no one in what are termed fashionable circles and so should be outside what is called the world  oh you would soon get over that major mallett why lady greendale would introduce you everywhere  it is not likely i shall trouble her to do that mallett answered  frank had told george lechmere that as soon as they arrived he would be at liberty to go off at once to his father and mother  stay as long as you like he said i shall get on very well without you for a few days  i shall come up again tonight sir and get your things brushed and your bath ready in the morning i should not be comfortable if i did not do that then after breakfast if you do not want me i can go to the farm for a few hours of course i shall have lots to tell the old people about india but for that i dont know what i should do to pass the time away with no work on hand  oh you will have your old friends to look up george after being over two years on service you have a right to a months leave as you have got your six months batta in hand besides your savings you have enough cash to go on with but when you want money you know that you have only to speak to me  i have a good bit sir i have scarcely spent a penny since i joined and in the two years have laid by a nice little sum besides we all picked up a bit most of those native chiefs and their followers had money or jewels about them and all of us got something some good prizes so one way or another i have made as much or more in the two years soldiering as i should have done in two years farming but if i had not above a few shillings in my pocket i should do well here for i have no occasion to spend any money with all my friends wanting me to go round to see them and tell them of our doings  found everything going on satisfactorily at home george  yes sir all well bob has turned out a great help to my father i was sure he would do well when he got the chance of course so long as i was there he had not much responsibility but i could see then that he would make a good farmer things have been going on just as well as when i was at home  are you going over there now  not until after breakfast sir anyhow i told them that i might look in some time in the morning but that i could not say whether you might want me for anything  no i shant want you at all george i told you so yesterday however after breakfast i will walk over to the farm with you i only had time for a word with your father yesterday but i told him that i would come over to see them sometime today  accordingly after an hours talk with his agent frank mallett walked over to the farm with george the latters father and mother were both in the house an unusual thing at that time of day with the former but he had said at breakfast to his son  you must look after things by yourself today lad the squire said yesterday that he would come over sometime and i would not be out when he came not for a twenty pound note  he and his wife came to the door when they saw frank coming across the field towards the house  well lechmere the latter said when he came up i am glad to see you and your dame looking so well and hearty i had not time to say more than a word to you yesterday and i wanted to have a comfortable talk with you both i wrote you a line telling you how gallantly george had behaved and how he had saved my life but i had to write the day afterwards and my head was still ringing from the sabre cut that had for a time knocked all the sense out of me and therefore i had to cut it very short how gallantly he defended my life against a dozen of the enemys cavalry was shown by the fact that he received the victoria cross and i can tell you that such an immense number of brave deeds were performed during the mutiny that georges must be considered an extraordinary act of bravery to have obtained for him that honour  by this time they had entered the farmhouse parlour george had not followed them in but on inquiring where he was likely to find bob had gone off to join him  i was proud to hear it at the time squire and when it was in the papers that our george had got the victoria cross and all our neighbours came in to congratulate us we felt prouder still up to the time when we got your letter we did not know for sure where he was he had said he meant to enlist and from the humour that he was in when he went away we guessed it to be in some regiment where he could get to the wars we felt the more glad as you may guess from the fact that both the missus and i had wronged him in our thoughts we learnt that before we got the news and it was not until we knew that we had been wrong that either of us opened our lips about it though each of us knew what the other thought  i know what you mean lechmere he told me all about it  well squire you may be sure when we knew that we had wronged him how the wife and i fretted that we did not know where to write to nor how to set about finding out where he was and so you can guess how pleased we were when we heard from you that he was with your regiment and that he had saved your life at the risk of his own  we did not know then squire that if he had had twenty lives he would have done right to have risked them all for you he told us the whole story yesterdayjust to mother me and bob i cant tell you yet squire what we thought of it i do not know that i shall ever be able to tell you and we shall never cease to thank the good lord for saving george from being a murderer in his madnessa murderer of our own squireand to bless you major that you should not only have forgiven him and kept his crime from everyone but should have taken him in hand as he says as if it had never happened  there was no occasion for him to have said anything about it lechmere he was undoubtedly more or less mad at the time upon the whole i think that the affair has made him a better man up to the time when he saved my life he did his duty as a soldier well and was a most devoted servant to me but the weight of this business pressed heavily upon him and in spite of all i could say he held himself aloof as much as possible from his comrades but after that he changed altogether he felt as he told me that god would not have given him this opportunity of saving the life that he had so nearly taken had he not forgiven him and his spirits rose and while before he certainly was not popular among his comradesa reserved man never ishe became a general favourite  the officers of course showed a good deal of interest in him after what he had done he could have been a sergeant in the course of a month but he refused corporals stripes when they were offered to him on the day after the battle saying that he preferred remaining with me though the colonel told him that after what he had done he would stand a good chance of promotion after two or three years service as a sergeant he told me that he knew his jealous disposition had been a sort of trouble to you but i am sure that he will never worry you in that way again i believe that he is now thoroughly master of himself and that even the man who wrought that foul wrong need not fear him  you heard sir that the poor girl came home and died  yes he told me when he heard the news from you  she never said who did it sir but from other things that came out there is no doubt who it was  he told me lechmere but i stopped him short i did not wish to know i had my suspicions but i did not want to have them confirmed the fellow i suspect is no friend of mine and i dont want to know anything about him if i were certain of it i could not meet him without telling him my opinion of him  you are not likely to meet him here squire a year ago he happened to be over at chippenham one market day there were a dozen of us there and i can tell you we gave him such a reception that he mounted his horse and rode straight on again if he hadnt i believe that we should have horsewhipped him through the town three months afterwards his estate was put up for sale and he has never been down in this part of the country since not that he was ever here much before london suited him better you see his mother was as i have heard the daughter of a banker and an only child and even if he hadnt had the estate he would have been a rich man anyhow i am heartily glad that he has left the county  i too am glad that he has gone lechmere i have not met him for years but if we had both been down here we must have run against each other sometimes and after some matters that had passed between us years ago we could scarcely have met on friendly terms however as there is nothing beyond mere suspicion against him he may in this case be innocent you see i was suspected unjustly myself and the same thing may be the case with him  that is so squire though i dont think that there is any mistake this time in fact i believe she told her mother though she kept it from her father for fear he would break the law at any rate it is a good thing he has gone for he was a hard landlord and there was not a good word for him among his tenants  that makes the probability of a mistake all the more likely frank said if i who as a landlord as far as i know have given no grounds for dislike to my tenants was suspected unjustly this would be still more likely to be the case with one who was generally unpopular  and now how has the farm been going on since i was away  just about as usual squire bob is not such a good judge of horses and cattle as george was but in other respects i think he knows more george did not care for reading and bob is always at the papers and getting up the last things these scientific chaps have found out so matters are pretty well squared altogether i have no call to grumble and i aint likely squire to have to ask for time on rent day we were worried sorely about george as long as that matter hung over him but since that was cleared up and we heard of his having saved your life we have been happy again we got a big shock yesterday however when we heard what had happened out there  well that is all past and over long ago and we have none of us any cause to regret it it has done george a great deal of good and as for me i might not be here now talking to you if it had not taken place for it was the memory of that which led george to the desperate action which saved my life besides you see it has gained for me an attached and faithful friend for it is as a friend rather than as a servant that i regard your son  he will always be that i am sure squire he told us that you had offered to set him up on a farm but he is quite right to say no i dont say that if it had been with somebody else his mother and i might not have felt rather sore that our eldest boy should have taken to service but of course it is different with you squire it is only natural that a lechmere should serve a mallett seeing that our fathers have been your fathers tenants for hundreds of years so that even if all this had not happened we should not have minded as it is we are proud that he is with you and it seems natural that after wandering about the world and fighting with those black villains out there he should never be content to go on as he was before or to settle down to farming  it is like man like master in this case mallett laughed after i have once been over the estate and seen all the tenants and learned that everyone is satisfied and everything going on well i shall very soon begin to feel restless and shall be running off somewhere you see i have never been broken in to a country life i have no idea of becoming an absentee but i think a month or two together will be as much as i can stand at any rate as long as i am a bachelor  that is just what i was saying squire the farmers wife said speaking for the first timefor during the first portion of the conversation she had been crying quietly and had since been busying herself in placing decanters and glasses and a huge homemade cake on the table we all hope that you will soon bring a mistress home i said only this morning that you would never be settling down until you did  and now will you take a glass of wine and a slice of cake squire  thank you mrs lechmere i will especially a piece of your cake many and many a slice of it have i had here when a boy and famously good it always was  major mallett ate two big slices of cake drank a glass of wine and refusing the offer of a second glass got up to go saying  no mrs lechmere i must not treat myself to another glass now i am going round to four or five other houses before i return to lunch and i know that the tray will be put on the table everywhere i can say that i have eaten so much cake here that i cannot eat more but i know i shall have to drink a glass of wine at each place and i can assure you that i am not accustomed to tipple in the morning  ah here come your two sons across the fields i will meet them at the gate if i were to begin a regular talk with bob today the morning would be gone  george has changed wonderfully mrs lechmere said as they accompanied him to the gate it aint his face so much though he is well nigh as brown as that cake but it is his figure i should not have known him if he had not come along with bob he walks altogether different  it is the drilling mrs lechmere yes it is wonderful how much drill does for a man and there is a good deal in the cut of the clothes you see there is not much difference in the material but georges were made at a good tailors in london and i suppose bobs were made down here  mallett stayed for a few minutes chatting at the gate with bob and then saying that he would certainly come in again before he went up to town started on a round of calls    chapter 6  and so you have bought a yacht major mallett  yes at least she is scarcely a yacht yet i was going to have one built but i heard of one that had been ordered by lord haverstock who they say has been so hard hit at the derby that he had to tell wanhill the builder that he could not take her as the season was getting rather late the man was glad to sell her a bargain especially as he had already got a thousand pounds towards her so i got her for twelve hundred less that haverstock was to have paid it suited me admirably for he has engaged to finish her in six weeks she is just about the size i wanted 120 tons and looks as if she would turn out fast and a good sea boat of course i shall race a bit with her next year though i have bought her more for cruising  i hope that you and lady greendale will favour me with your company on her first cruise after the season ends i know it is of no use asking before that  i should like it immensely major mallett it would be delightful how many can you carry  eight comfortably the ladies cabin has four berths but will be only really comfortable for three and there are four other state cabinsthat is three besides my own but one of them has two berths of course i could put up three or four others in the saloon for a couple of days but for a cruise of three weeks or a month it would be too many for comfort we could not seat that number at table without crowding and i doubt whether the cooking arrangements would be altogether satisfactory  of course we shall want two more ladies i will leave the selection of those to you and lady greendale for except yourselves i know no ladies though of course i could get plenty of men  that will be delightful bertha said but i dare say that by the time the season is over you will know plenty of ladies that you can ask you see you have met so many people here now that as you have just been grumbling discontentedly you are out nearly every night  yes he laughed at present you see i am regarded rather as an indian lion but i shall bid goodbye to london as soon as the yacht is afloat  what is her name to be  i have not given it a thought yet i only bought her two days ago it seems to me that it is almost as hard to fix on a name for a yacht as for a race horse  oh there are so many pretty names that would do for a yacht  yes but you would be surprised if you knew how many yachts there are of every likely name  it ought to be a water bird the girl said  those are just the names that are most taken  yes but there are lots of sea birds and water birds only i cannot think of them  well you look them out he laughed here is a hunts yachting list that i bought on my way here i will leave it with you and any name that you fix on she shall have only please choose one that only two or three boats and those not about the same size have got it leads to confusion if there are two craft going about of the same name and of about the same size but i warn you that it will involve your having to go down to poole to christen her  do they christen yachts major mallett  i really dont know anything about it he replied but if it is right and proper for ships it must be for yachts and i should regard the ceremony as being likely to bring good luck to her when the time comes i will fix the day to suit your arrangements  i will try to come down major mallett if mamma will agree but it is a long way to poole and somehow one never seems to find an hour to do anything so i really cannot promise  well if you cannot manage it miss greendale i will have her launched without being named and bring her round to southampton and then you could go down and christen her there that would only be a short railway run of a couple of hours after breakfast and say two hours for luncheon there and to have a look at her and you could be home by four oclock in the afternoon  that seems more practicable  captain mallett had been three weeks in town he had called upon lady greendale on the day after he had come up and been received with the greatest cordiality by her and bertha the latter in the two years and a half that he had been away had grown from a somewhat gawky girl whose charm lay solely in her expressive eyes and pleasant smile into a very pretty woman she was slightly over middle height and carried herself exceptionally well her face was a bright and sunny one but her eyes were unchanged and there was an earnestness in their expression which with a certain resolute curve in the lips gave character to the laughing brightness of her face society had received her warmly and consequently she was pleased with society both for her own sake and as an heiress she was made a deal of and though she had been but two months in town she had already taken her place as one of the recognised belles of the season  lady greendale had a dinner party on the day when major mallett called and was discussing with bertha whom they could invite to fill up at such short notice a vacancy which had occurred  you come at the right moment frank she said after they had chatted for some time we were lamenting just now that we had received this morning a note from a gentleman who was coming to dine with us today saying that he could not come but now i regard it as most fortunate for of course we want you to come to us at once i suppose you have not made any engagements yet we shall be sixteen with you and i think they are all nice people  i shall be very happy to come he said i have certainly no engagements i looked in at the club last night it was my first appearance there for my name only came up for election four months ago and i should have felt very uncomfortable if i had not happened to meet two or three old friends one of them asked me to dinner for tomorrow for today i am altogether free  in the course of the evening major mallett received three or four invitations to dances and balls and being thus started in society was soon out every evening for the first week he enjoyed the novelty of the scene but very speedily tired of it at dinners the ladies he took down always wanted him to talk about india but even this was in his opinion preferable to the crush and heat of the dances  how men can go on with such a life as this he said to a friend at the club beats me altogether colonel two or three times in the year one might like to go out to these crowded balls just to see the dresses and the girls but to go out night after night is to my mind worse than hunting the rebels through the jungle it is just as hot and not a hundredth part so exciting i have only had three weeks of it and i am positively sick of it already  then why on earth do you accept mallett i took good care not to get into it what can a man want better than this a wellcooked dinner eaten with a chum and then a quiet rubber and perhaps once a fortnight or so i go out to a dinner party which i like well enough as a change i always get plenty of shooting in winter and am generally away for three months but i am always heartily glad to get back again  i am afraid i should get as tired of the club as i am of society colonel  you have plenty of time lad i am twenty years your senior well there is plenty before you besides society and club life of course you will marry and settle down and become a county magistrate and all that sort of thing thank goodness what money came to me came in the shape of consols and not in that of land a country life would be exile to me but you see you have left the army much younger than i did i suppose you are not thirty yet the crimea and india ran you fast up the tree  no i am only twentyeight you know i was only a brevet major and had two more steps to get before i had a regimental majority  that makes all the difference mallett and it is absurd a young fellow of your age crying out against society  i dont cry out against it mallett laughed i simply say that it is out of my line and i have never been broken into it i was talking of buying a yacht or rather of building one  what size do you want i know of one to be had cheap if you are thinking of a good big craft  and thus it was that mallett came to hear of the yawl at poole  i have fixed on the osprey major mallett bertha greendale said when he took her down to dinner two days after he had last seen her what do you say to that there are two or three yachts of the same name but none of them is over thirty tons  i think the osprey is a pretty name miss greendale i should have accepted the crocodile if you had suggested it the name that you have chosen will suit admirably so henceforth she shall be the osprey pending your formally christening her by that name i might of course be hypercritical and point out that although a fishing eagle the osprey can scarcely be called a water bird inasmuch that it is no swimmer  but it is hypercritical even to suggest such a thing she said pouting the osprey has to do with the sea it is strong and swift on the wing and the sails of the yacht are wings are they not then it is strong and bold and i am sure your boat will not be afraid to meet a storm altogether i think it is an excellent name  i think it a very good name too  you ought to have one for your figurehead  yachts dont have figureheads else i would certainly have it at any rate i will choose an eagle for my racing flag  i have never been on board a yacht yet the girl said i think i only know one man who has one at least a large one that is mr carthew of course you know him he had a new one this springthe phantom he has won several times this season  i saw he had frank said quietly yes i used to know him but its seven or eight years since we met  and you dont like him she said quickly  what makes you think that miss greendale  oh i can tell by the tone of your voice  i dont think it expressed anything but indifference as it is such a long time since i met him but i never fancied him much i suppose we were not the same sort of men and then too perhaps i am rather prejudiced from the fact that i know that he was considered rather a hard landlord  i never heard that she said  no i dare say you would not hear it but i fancy it was so however he sold his estate at least so i heard  yes he told me that he did not care for country life i have seen him several times since we came up to town he keeps race horses you know his horse was second in the derby this spring that takes him a good deal away else one would meet him more often for he knows a great many people we do  yes i know that he races and is i believe rather lucky on the turf  you have no inclination that way major mallett  not a shadow he said earnestly it is the very last vice i should take to i have seen many cases in the service of young fellows being ruined by betting on the turf we had one case in my own regiment in which a man was saved by the skin of his teeth happily he had strength of mind and manliness enough to cut it altogether and is a very promising young officer now but it was only the fact of our embarking when we did for india that saved him from ruin  the man who bets more than he can afford to lose is simply a gambler whether he does so on racehorses or on cards i have seen enough of it to hate gambling with all my heart it has driven more men out of the service than drink has and the one passion is almost as incurable as the other  bertha laughed i think that is the first time i have ever heard you express any very strong opinion major mallett it is quite refreshing to listen to a thoroughgoing denunciation of anything here in london in the country of course it is different all sorts of things are heartily abused there especially perhaps the weather free trade poaching and people in whose covers foxes are scarce but here in london no one seems to care much about anything  people in your set have no time to do so  that is very unkind they think about amusement  they may think about it but it is all in a very languid fashion now in a country town when there is a ball or a dance in the neighbourhood it is quite an excitement and at any rate everyone enters into it heartily people evidently enjoy the dancing for dancings sake and they all look as if they were thoroughly enjoying themselves whereas here people dance as if it was rather a painful duty than otherwise and there is a general expression of a longing for the whole thing to be over  i enjoy the dancing bertha said sturdily at least when i get a really good partner  yes but then you have only been three months at it you have not got broken into the business yet  nor have you major mallett  no but while you are an actor in the piece i am but a spectator and lookerson you know see most of the game  what nonsense dont pretend you are getting to be a blase man i know that you are only about ten years older than i amnot more than nine i thinkand you dance very well and no doubt you know it  i like dancing i can assure you where there is room to dance but i dont call it dancing when you have an area of only a foot square to dance in and are hustled and bumped more than you would be in a crowded lord mayors show my training has not suited me for it and i would rather stand and look on listen to scraps of conversation watch the faces of the dancers and of those standing round it is a study and i think it shows one of the worst sides of nature it is quite shocking to see and hear the envy uncharitableness the boredom and the desperate efforts to look cheerful under difficulties especially among the girls that do not get partners  for shame i am disappointed in you bertha said half in jest half in earnest you are not at all the person i thought you were whatever i may have fancied about you i never imagined you a cynic or a grumbler  i suppose it brings out the worst side of my nature too he laughed when you come down on board the osprey miss greendale you will see the other side i fancy one falls into the tone of ones surroundings here i have caught the tone of the bored man of society there you will see that i shall be a breezy sailorcheerful in storm or in calm ready to take my glass and to toast my lass and all the rest of it in true nautical fashion  i hope so she said gravely i shall certainly need something of the sort to correct the very unfavourable impression you have just been giving me now let us change the subject you have not told me yet whether you had any flirtations in india  flirtations he repeated for once the small section of womankind that i encountered were above and beyond flirtations  i dont think he went on seriously that you in england can quite realise what it was or that a woman in london society can imagine that there can exist a state of things in which dress and appearance are matters which have altogether ceased to engross the female mind the white women i saw there were worn and haggard no matter what their age they bore on their faces the impress of terrible hardship terrible danger and terrible grief and anxiety few but had lost someone dear to them many all whom they cared for a few had made some pitiful attempt at neatness but most had lost all thought of self all care whatever for personal appearance there was an anxious look in their eyes that was painful to witness  i spoke without thinking the girl said gravely it must have been awfulawful as you say it is impossible for us really to imagine quite what it was or to picture up such scenes as you must have witnessed i can understand that all this must seem frivolous and contemptible to you  no i dont go so far as that he smiled it is good that there should be butterflies as well as bees and at any rate the women of india who had the reputation of being as frivolous and pleasureloving as the rest of their sex came out nobly and showed a degree of patience under suffering and of heroic courage unsurpassable in history  i am afraid he said as the hostess gave the signal for the ladies to rise you will long look back upon this dinner as one of unprecedented dullness  not dullness she smiled exceptional certainly but as something so different from the usual thing when one talks of nothing but the opera the theatres and exhibitions as to deserve to be put down in ones diary by a mark i wont flatter you by telling you whether a red or a black one  who are the party going to be mallett his friend colonel severn said as they stood together on the deck of the osprey early in august you guaranteed that it would be a pleasant one when you persuaded me to leave london for the first time since i retired before shooting began  well to begin with there is lady greendale an eminently pleasant woman she comes as general chaperon and i shall consider her under your especial care you will not find it hard work for she is an eminently sympathetic woman ready to chat if you are disposed to talk to interest herself in other ways if you are not she has plenty of common sense is tolerant of tobacco and a thorough woman of the world though her headquarters have for years been in the country with her is her daughter  well what about her i have heard of her as having made quite a sensation this season and between ourselves i had some idea that this party was specially planned on her account  to some extent perhaps it was frank mallett laughed bertha greendale is an old chum of mine i knew her in very short frocks for they were near neighbours of ours in the country and her father sir john was always one of my kindest friends she was a slip of a girl when i went out to india and though i thought that she would turn out pretty i certainly did not expect she would be anything like as good looking as she is she was always a nice girl and success so far has not spoiled her  then there is a miss sinclair a great friend of berthas and jack hawley of the guards i knew him out in the crimea the other two are wilson who is a clever young barrister and a particularly pleasant fellow and his wife who is a sister of miss sinclair so i think there are the elements of a pleasant party all the ladies are broken into smoke for sir john smoked and so does wilson so that you wont be expected to go forward as they do on the p and o whenever you want to enjoy your favourite pipe  that is a comfort anyhow mallett if there is one thing in the world i hate it is having to go and hunt about for some place to smoke in and i never accept an invitation to any shooting party unless i know beforehand that smoking is allowed at what time do you expect the others  they will be down at halfpast twelve they are all coming by the same train and it was because i knew that you would want to be in a smoking carriage that i told you to come down by the earlier one and besides i thought it well to get you here first you are the only stranger as it were the others are all intimate with each other and it was as well to post you as to their various relationships  one thing mallett i hope lady greendale is not in any way a marrying woman i am not like mr pickwick afraid of widows and have perfect confidence in my power to resist temptation but at the same time it makes all the difference in the world to ones comfort i am not ass enough to suppose that lady greendale would even dream for a moment of setting her cap at a colonel on half pay but if a woman is in the marrying line she always expects a certain amount of what you may call delicate attention it is her daily bread for she considers that unless every man she comes across evinces a certain amount of admiration it is a sign that her charms are on the wane and her chances growing more and more remote  mallett laughed you can set your mind at ease for nothing is further from the thoughts of lady greendale than remarriage she was very happy with her husband  the more reason for her marrying again the colonel said a woman who has been happy with her husband is apt to get the idea into her head that every man will make a good husband and a confoundedly mistaken idea it is she is much more likely to marry again than the woman who has had a hard time of it  well you may be right there colonel but putting aside my conviction that lady greendale has no idea of marrying again is the fact that at present all her thoughts are occupied by her daughter she is not at all what you would call a managing mother but i am sure that she has set her heart on berthas making a good match and that the fear that she will succumb to some penniless younger son or other unsuitable partner is at present the dominant feeling in her mind i dont think she would have agreed to jack hawley being of the party had not bertha entertained a conviction that he was rather gone on miss sinclair who by the way has like her sister money enough to disregard the fact that jack is hardly in that respect well endowed  however it is time for me to be off i see the skipper is getting the gig lowered i suppose you will be content to sit here and smoke your pipe until we come back and indeed seven is as many as the gig will carry with any degree of comfort the cutter will go ashore to fetch off the luggage which will probably be of somewhat portentous dimensions  two minutes later mallett took his place in the gig and was rowed to the shore he was delighted with his new purchase she was an excellent sea boat and as he had learned from a short spin with another craft decidedly fast he had not however entered her for any race  there is no hurry he said to his skipper when the latter suggested that they should try her at cowes i should like to win my first race and in the first place we dont know that she is in her best trim in the next place we must get the crew accustomed to each other and to the craft i bought her as a cruiser rather than a racer and dont want to have her full of men as are most of the racers it is a heavy expense and fewer hands accustomed to work well together do just as much work and more smartly than a crowd we found when we sailed round the islands with the royal victoria race that considering we went under reduced canvas we held our own very fairly and i have no doubt that when we get all our light canvas up the osprey will give a good account of herself our gear is scarcely stretched yet  no i will wait until next season and then we will make a bold bid for a queens cup  frank mallett reached the platform at southampton a few minutes before the train came in the party were on the lookout for him and alighted in the highest spirits  now ladies he said the first thing is to point out the luggage my man here will get it all together and stand guard over it till two others arrive to get it on board they will be here in a few minutes in fact they ought to be here now  he looked on with something like dismay while the boxes were picked out and piled together  my dear lady greendale he said i am afraid you must all have very vague ideas as to the amount of accommodation in a 120ton yacht she is not a cunarder or a p and o why two or three of those trunks would absolutely fill one of her cabins  you did not expect major mallett bertha said demurely that we were coming for a months cruise with only handbags especially after telling us that very likely we might not get a chance of getting any washing done all that time  well i dare say we shall stow them away somewhere now as you have got them all together we will go down to the boat  now lads you had better get a hand cart and get these things on board as soon as you can  which is the osprey amy sinclair asked bertha as they took their places in the boat  bertha looked with a rather puzzled face at the fleet of yachts  that is she said confidently after a moments hesitation pointing to one towards which the boat was at the moment heading  frank mallett laughed  really i should have thought miss greendale that although making every allowance for feminine vagueness as to boats you would have known the yacht you christened a month ago or at any rate would not have mistaken a schooner for a yawl after the patient explanation i gave you on your last visit as to the different rigs that is the osprey a hundred yards lower down  oh yes i remember now that when there is a little mast standing on the stern it is a yawl these things seem very simple to you major mallett but they are very puzzling to women who know nothing about them now i venture to say that if i were to show you six different materials for frocks and were to tell you all their names you would know nothing about them when i showed them to you a month afterwards  i suppose the gentleman on board is colonel severn  yes he came down by the train before yours i thought it better that he should do so as in the first place he did not know any of you and in the next as you see we are pretty closely packed as it is  what is that flag at the masthead lady greendale asked bertha said that your flag was going to have an eagle on it  that is on my racing flag let me impress upon you ladies that a racing flag is a square flag and that that is not a flag at all but a burgee every club has its burgee as you see that is a white cross on a blue ground with a crown in the centre and is the burgee of the royal thames of which i was elected a member last month  here we are properly i ought to be on board first but i am too wedged in you and wilson had better go up first that will give more room for the ladies to move  you have got new steps bertha said when i came down with mrs wilson to christen the boat we had to climb up nasty steep steps against the side this is a great deal more comfortable i was thinking that mamma would have a difficulty in getting up those other things if it were at all rough  yes i have had them specially made for the present occasion large cruisers always have them and at any rate they are more comfortable for anysized boats but they take up rather more room to stow away and they are really not so handy in a sea for the boats cannot get so close alongside still no doubt they are more comfortable for ladies now it is your turn  the cruise of the osprey was in all respects a success the party was well chosen and pleasant colonel severn and lady greendale got on well together he liked her because she had no objection whatever to his perpetual enjoyment of his pipe she liked him because he was altogether different from anyone that she had met before his indian stories amused her his views of life were original and his grumbling at modern ways and modern innovations in no way concealed the fact that in spite of it all he evidently enjoyed life thoroughly  the osprey had fine weather as she ran along the south coast anchoring under portland for a day while the party examined the works of the breakwater and paid a visit to the quarries where the convicts were at work she put into torquay dartmouth and plymouth spending a day in the two former ports and two at the last named they looked into fowey and stopped two days at falmouth and then rounding the lands end made for kingstown from here they started for the clyde but meeting with very heavy weather went into belfast lough  the osprey proved to be a fine sea boat and behaved so well that even lady greendale declared she would not be afraid to trust herself on board her in any weather they sailed up the clyde as far as greenock and then returning cruised for a fortnight among the islands on the west coast they had enjoyed their stay at kingstown so much that they put in there again on their return voyage shaped their course for plymouth and then without looking into any other port returned to southampton  jack hawley and miss sinclair had become engaged during the voyage and the colonel and lady greendale had become so confidential that frank laughingly asked him if he had changed his views on the subject of matrimony a suggestion which he indignantly repudiated  i should have thought that you knew me better he said reproachfully i admit that lady greendale is a very charming woman but you dont think that she can imagine for a moment that i have ever entertained any idea of such a thing you said that i was to amuse her if i could i have tried my best to keep the old lady as much to myself as possible so as to enable all you young people to carry out your flirtations to your hearts content by gad sir it would be a nice return for following out your instructions to find myself in such a hole as that  frank had some difficulty in persuading the colonel that his remark was not meant as a serious one and that there was no fear whatever that lady greendale had ever had the slightest reason to suppose that his intentions were not of a most platonic nature  i am heartily glad the colonel said when he was quite pacified that hawleys affair has come off all right even if she had not been an heiress i should have said that he was a lucky fellow for she is an extremely nice and pleasant young woman without any nonsense about her still there is no doubt that her fortune will come in very handy for hawley as to the girl herself i think she has made a very good choice she has plenty of money for both and as he has managed to keep up on his younger sons portion he can have no extravagant tastes and will make her a very good husband there is no other engagement to be announced i suppose  as i am the only other unmarried man on board colonel your question is somewhat pointed no i hope there may be one of these days but i dont think that it would be fair to ask her here where i am her host and she is under the glamour of the sea i doubt whether she has the slightest idea of what i want that is the worst of being very old friends the relations get so fixed that a woman does not recognise that they can ever be changed however i shall try my luck one of these days i dont think that i shall meet with any serious opposition on her mothers part if bertha likes me but i know that lady greendale has very much more ambitious views for her and has quite set her mind upon her making a good match no doubt she has a right to expect that she will do so however i think she is too fond of bertha to thwart her however disappointed she might feel at present i dont think that she has any more suspicion than bertha herself of my intentions  during the voyage bertha and amy sinclair had become quite adroit helmswomen and one or other was constantly at the tiller when the wind was light bertha had learned the names of all the crew and often went forward to ask questions of the men tending the head sails becoming a prime favourite with all hands on arriving at southampton the rest of the party went up at once to town while frank remained behind for a day or two going round in the yacht to gosport where she was to be laid up for the winter    chapter 7  i am so sorry bertha greendale said so awfully sorry i had no idea that you thought of me like that we were such friends so long ago and it has been so pleasant since you came home last year and i like you as if you were a big brother but i have never thought of you in any other light and now it seems dreadful to me to give you pain but i feel sure that i should never come to love you in that way  and she burst into tears  do not think anything more about it dear frank mallett said gently i have felt sometimes when we have been together that you were so kindly and frank and pleasant with me that you could feel as i wanted you to i ought to have known it always but i suppose in such cases a man deceives himself and shuts his eyes to facts you have certainly nothing to blame yourself about of course it is a hard blow but no doubt i shall get over it as other fellows do at any rate i know that we shall always be dear friends and you need not fear that i shall mope over my misfortune i shall run up to town for a bit and as you are going up for the season next week i shall no doubt often meet you dont fret about me i have been hit pretty hard several times though not in the same way and i have always gone through it and no doubt i shall do so now  goodbye and when bertha looked up he had left the room  oh mamma she said when she went into the room where her mother was sitting i am so sorry so dreadfully sorry frank mallett has asked me to be his wife i have never thought of such a thing and of course i had to say no  i have thought such a thing likely for some time bertha but i thought it best to hold my tongue about it in such matters the interference of a mother often does more harm than good i felt sure by your manner with him that you had no idea of it and i must say that much as i like frank mallett i should have been sorry i have great hopes of your making a really firstclass match  i could not make a better match bertha said indignantly no one could be kinder or nicer than major mallett and we know how brave he is and how he has distinguished himself and he has a good estate and everything that anyone could wish only unfortunately i do not love himat least not in that way he has never shown me what i should consider any particular attention and never talked to me in the way men do when they are making love to a girl nothing could be nicer and it was all the nicer because i never thought of this i suppose it is because he is so different from some of the men i met in town last season who always seemed to be trying to get round me no i know it is not a nice expression mamma but you know what i mean  i know my dear her mother smiled of course you are a very good match and though i do not want to flatter you you were one of the belles of the season though some of the men you speak of were by no means desirableyounger sons and barristers and that sort of thingstill there were two or three whom any girl might have been pleased to see at her feet and who i am sure from what i saw only needed but little encouragement from you to be there i was a little vexed dear you see that you did not give any of them that encouragement but i understand of course that the novelty of your first season carried you away altogether and that you liked the dancing and the fetes and the opera for themselves and not because they brought you in contact with men of excellent class so far as i could see it was a matter of indifference to you whether the man was a peer with a splendid rent roll or a younger son without a farthing so that he was a good dancer and a pleasant companion but of course after a season or two you will grow wiser  i do hope not mamma bertha said indignantly i dont mean to say that it might not be better to marry as you say a peer with a good rent roll than a younger son without a penny other things being equal that is to say if one liked them equally but i hope that i shall never come to like anyone a bit more for being a peer  lady greendale smiled indulgently  it is a natural sentiment my dear for a girl of your age and inexperience but in time you will come to see things in a different light  then she changed the subject what is frank going to do it is fortunate that we are going up to town next week  he is going up to town himself tomorrow and i am sure that you will never hear from him or from anyone else what has happened we shall meet in town as usual and i am sure that he will be just the same as he was before and that i shall be a great deal more uncomfortable than he will it is a very silly affair altogether i think and i would give anything if it had not happened  lady greendale did not echo the sentiment she liked frank mallett immensely he had always been a great favourite of hers but since she had guessed what bertha herself had not dreamed of she had been uncomfortable it threatened to disturb all the plans she had formed and she was well contented to learn that she had refused him lady greendale was a thoroughly kindhearted woman but she could not forget that she herself might have made in a worldly sense a better match than she had and her ambition had since bertha was a child and still more since she had shown promise of exceptional good looks been centred on her making a really good match  frank went up to town next day and the greendales followed him a week later they did not often meet him in society as frank seldom went out but he called occasionally in the old friendly and unceremonious way it would have required an acute observer to see any difference in his manner to bertha but lady greendale noticed it and the girl herself felt that although he was no less kind and friendly there was some impalpable change in his manner something that she felt though she could not define it even to herself  have you had a tiff with major mallett bertha mrs wilson asked one day when she was alone with her in the drawing room  frank had just left after spending an hour there  a tiff carrie no what put such an idea into your head  my eyes assisted perhaps by my ears my dear do you think that after being with you on the yacht last autumn i should not notice any change in your manner to each other i had expected before now to have heard an interesting piece of news and now i see that things have gone wrong somehow  we are just as good friends as we always were bertha said shortly every bit  you dont mean to say that you have refused him bertha  i dont mean to say anything of the sort i simply say that major mallett and i have always been great friends and we are so now there is no one that i have a higher regard for  well bertha i do not want to know your secrets if you do not wish to tell me all that i can say is that if you have refused him you have done a very foolish thing i dont know any man that a woman might be happier with when we were out last year with you amy and i agreed that it was certain to come off and thought how well suited you were to each other of course in worldly respects you might do better just at present you have the ball at your feet but choose where you may you will not find a finer fellow than he is yes i told harry that it was lucky that i had not made that trip on board the osprey before i was irrevocably captured for i should certainly have lost my heart to major mallett well i am sorry bertha more sorry than i can say and i am sure that amy will be too  i said nothing whatever carrie that would justify this little explosion which i certainly dont intend to answer i should really feel very vexed if i were not perfectly sure that you would never tell anyone else of this notion that you have got in your head  you may be quite sure of that bertha at least when i say no one else of course i do not include harry but you know him well enough to be certain that it will not go further i am sure he will be as disappointed as i am in fact he will have a small triumph over me for after the usual manner of men he saw nothing on board the yacht and has always maintained that it was pure fancy on my part however i wont tell anyone else not even amy she can find it out for herself which you may be sure she will do when she comes back from the continent if indeed her own happiness with jack has not blinded her to all sublunary matters  well goodbye dear you will forgive my saying that i am disappointed in you terribly disappointed in you  i must try to put up with that carrie i am not aware that you consulted me before you made your own matrimonial arrangements and perhaps i may be able to manage my own  well dont be cross bertha remember that i am not advising or counselling i am simply regretting which perhaps you may do yourself some day or other  and with this parting shot she left  the weeks went on and when may came and frank told her that the osprey was fitted out and that he would join her in a day or two bertha heard the news with satisfaction the season was a gay one and she was enjoying herself greatly the one little drop of bitterness in her cup being that she could no longer enjoy his visits as she formerly did he had been the one man with whom she was able to talk and laugh quite freely who was really an old friend a link not only between her and the past but between her and her country life  and now she thought pettishly he had spoiled all this and what annoyed her almost as much was that the change was more in herself than in him she no longer gave him commissions to execute for her nor made him her general confidant she knew that he would be as ready as before to laugh and to sympathise that he would still gladly execute her commissions and she felt that he tried hard to make her forget that he had aspired to be something nearer to her than a brotherly friend she felt that after what he had said they could never stand in quite the same relation as before  accustomed as frank was to read her thoughts he was not deceived by the expression of regret that she should now see but little of him as he saw the news was really pleasant to her she was not aware that it was a conversation that he had had the evening before with colonel severn which had decided him to go down to the osprey a fortnight earlier than he had intended  you are getting to be almost as regular an attendant here mallett as i am i think you are altogether too young to take regularly to club life it is all very well for an old fogey like me but i dont think it a good thing for a young fellow like you to take so early to a bachelor life  i dont want to do anything of the sort colonel but i cant stand these crushes in hot rooms i cannot for the life of me see where the pleasure comes in i begin to think that i was an ass to leave the army  not at all lad not at all when a man has got a good estate it is much better for him to settle down upon it and to marry and have children and all that sort of thing than it is to remain in the army in times of peace i had wilson and hawley dining with me here yesterday we had a great chat over the pleasant time we had last year on board your yacht i dont know when i enjoyed myself so much as i did then lady greendale is a remarkably clever woman and her daughter is as nice a girl as i have come across for a long time and without a scrap of nonsense about her i wonder that she has not become engaged by this time general matthews who as you know goes in a good deal for that sort of thing for the sake of his daughters told me recently that he fancied from what he had heard that miss greendales engagement was likely to be a settled thing before the season was over he said there were three men making the runninglord chilson the eldest son of the earl of sommerlay george delamorehis father is in the cabinet you know and he is member for ponberry and a man named carthew who keeps race horses and was a neighbour of hers down in the country he is i hear a goodlooking fellow and just the sort of man a girl is likely to fancy matthews thought that the chances were in his favour as you are a neighbour of theirs too i suppose you will know him  i knew him at one time colonel but i have not seen him now for a good many years beyond meeting him two or three times at dinners and so on last season he was away when i was at home before going out to india and he had sold his estate before i came back  they say he has been very lucky on the turf and has made a pot of money  so i have heard frank said but you see one generally hears of mens good luck and not of their bad besides many men do most of their real betting through commissioners especially if they own horses themselves he is a fellow i dont much care for and i hope that whomever miss greendale may marry he will not be the man  i thought when you first asked me down last year that you had got up the party specially for her mallett and that you were going in for the prize yourself but of course i soon saw that i was mistaken as you were altogether too good chums for that to come about i have often noticed that men and girls who are thrown a lot together are often capital friends but although just the pair you would think would come together that they hardly ever do so i have noticed it over and over again well she is an uncommonly nice girl whoever gets her  frank did not return to town until the end of june  i have to congratulate you upon the ospreys victory bertha said the first time he called to see them you may imagine with what interest i read the accounts of the yacht races i saw you won two on the thames and were first once and second once at southampton  yes the osprey has shown herself to be as i thought an uncommonly fast boat we should have had two firsts at southampton if the pilot had not cut matters too fine and run us aground just opposite netley we were a quarter of an hour before we were off again we picked up a lot of our lost ground and got a second but were beaten eight minutes by the winner  have you entered for the queens cup at ryde  i have not entered yet but i am going to do so he said  mamma and i will be down there lord haverleyhe is first cousin to mamma you knowhas taken a house there for the month and he is going to have a large party and we are going down for ryde week  yes and there will be the victoria yacht club ball and all sorts of gaieties i have not entered yet but i am going to do so the entries do not close till next saturday  you will call and see us of course frank lady greendale said haverley has a big schooner yacht and i dare say we shall be a good deal on the water  i shall certainly do myself the pleasure of calling lady greendale  i warn you frank that bertha and i will be very disappointed if the osprey does not win the cup we regard ourselves as being to some extent her proprietors and it will be a grievous blow to us if you dont win  i do not feel by any means sure about it he said i fancy there will be several boats that have not raced yet this season and as two of them are new ones there is no saying what they may turn out  frank only stayed two days in town he learned from jack hawley that it was reported that lord chilson and george delamore had both been refused by bertha greendale  chilson went away suddenly he said as to delamore of course as he is a member he had to stop through the session but from what i hear and as you know i have some good sources of information i am pretty sure that he has got his conge too i fancy carthew is the favourite as a rule i dont like these men who go in for racing but he is a deucednice fellow i have seen a good deal of him he put me up to a good thing for the derby ten days ago he gives uncommonly good supper parties and has asked me several times but i have not gone to them for i believe there is a good deal of play afterwards and i cannot stand unlimited loo  is he lucky himself frank asked  no quite the other way i hear i know a man who has been to three or four of his suppers and he told me that carthew had lost every time once or twice pretty heavily  carthews horse ran second didnt it for the derby  yes the betting was twenty to one against him at starting  i wonder he did not give that tip as well as the other  well he did say that he thought it might run into a place but that he was sure that he had no chance with the favourite as it turned out he was nearer winning than he expected for the favourite went down the day before the race from 5 to 4 on to 10 to 1 against there was a report about that he had gone wrong in some way some fellows said that there had been an attempt to get at him others that he had got a nail in his foot the general feeling had been that he would win in a canter but as it was he only beat carthews horse by a short head  had carthew backed his horse to win  he told me that he had only backed it for a hundred but had put five hundred on it for a place and as he got six to one against it he came uncommonly well out of it  and do you think it likely that miss greendale will accept him  ah that i cannot say he has certainly been making very strong running and if i were a betting man i should not mind laying two to one on the event coming off  frank joined the osprey which was lying off portsmouth harbour on the following day  i am back earlier than i expected george he said as lechmere met him at the station i have got tired of london and want to be on board again  nothing gone wrong in town i hope major george said next day as he was removing the breakfast things you will excuse my asking but you dont seem to me to be yourself since you came on board  well yes george i am upset i confess i am sure you will be sorry too when i tell you that it is more than probable that miss greendale is going to marry mr carthew  george put the dish he was holding down on the table with a crash and stood gazing at frank in blank dismay  why sir i thought he said slowly that it was going to be you and miss greendale i had always thought so excuse me sir i dont mean any offence but that is what we have all thought ever since she came down to christen the yacht  there is no offence george yes i dont mind telling you that i had hoped so myself but it was not to be you see miss greendale has known me since she was a child and she has never thought of me in any other way than as a sort of cousinsomeone she liked very much but had never thought of for a moment as one she could marry that is all past and gone but i should be sorry most sorry for her to marry carthew knowing what i do of him  but it must not be sir george said vehemently you can never let that sweet young lady marry that blackhearted villain  unfortunately i cannot prevent it george  why sir you would only have to tell her about martha and i am sure it would do for his business miss greendale can know nothing about it so far as i can remember she was not more than sixteen at the time i dont suppose lady greendale ever heard of it she knew of course of marthas being missing because it made quite a stir but i dont suppose that she heard of her coming back she was only at home three weeks before she died there were not many that ever saw her and father told me that he and the others made it so hot for carthew one day at chippenham market that he never came down again and sold the place soon after i dont suppose the gentry ever heard anything about it if they had lady greendale would surely never let her daughter marry him  no i feel sure she would not but still george i dont see that i can possibly interfere in the matter the story is three years old now and even if it had only happened yesterday i after what has occurred between us could not come forward as his accuser it would have the appearance of spite on my side and besides i have no proof whatever he would of course deny the whole thing i do not mean that he would deny that she said sohe could not do thatbut he might declare that she had spoken falsely and might even say that it was an attempt to put anothers sin on his shoulders moreover as i told you i have other reasons for disliking the man and on the face of it it would seem that i had raked up this old story against him not only from jealousy but from personal malice  no it is out of the question that i should interfere i would give everything that i am worth to be able to do so but it is impossible if i had full and unquestionable proofs i would go to lady greendale and lay the matter before her but i have no such proofs there is nothing whatever except that poor girls word against his  georges lips closed and an expression of grim determination came over his face  i dare say you are right major he said after a pause but it seems to me hard that miss greendale should be sacrificed to a man like that  frank did not reply he had already thought the matter over and over again and had reached the opinion that he could not interfere if he had not himself proposed to her and been refused he might have moved up to that time he had stood in the position of an old friend of the family and as such could well have spoken to lady greendale on a matter that so vitally concerned berthas happiness now his taking that step would have the appearance of being the interference of a disappointed rival rather than of a disinterested friend he went up on deck sat there for a time and at last arrived at a conclusion  it is my duty there can be no doubt about that he said to himself if bertha really loves carthew she will believe his denial rather than my accusation unsupported as it is by a scrap of real evidence in that case she will put down my story as a piece of malice and meanness but after all that will matter little i had better far lose her liking and esteem than my own self respect i will tell lady greendale about this the responsibility will be off my hands then she may not view the matter as an absolute bar to carthews marrying berthathat is her business and berthasbut at any rate i shall have done my duty i will wait however until bertha has accepted him  i have made up my mind george he said later on if i hear that miss greendale has accepted carthew i shall go to her mother and tell her the story i have little hope that it will do much good it is very hard to make a girl believe anything against the man she loves until it can be proved beyond doubt and as carthew will of course indignantly deny that he had anything to do with it i expect that it will have no effect whatever beyond making her dislike me cordially still that cannot be helped it is clearly my duty not only as her friend but as the friend of her father and mother but i wish that the task did not fall upon me  i am glad to hear you say that major george said quietly i can see sir that as you say it would be better if anyone else could do it but lady greendale has known you for so many years that she must surely know that you would never have told her unless you believed the story to be true  no doubt she will george i hope miss greendale will too but even if she does not see it in that light i cannot help it well i will go ashore to the clubhouse and find out whether they have heard anything about the entries for the cup  when he returned he said to the captain  i hear that the phantom has entered hawkins i am told that she has just come off the slips and that she has had a new suit of racing canvas made by lapthorne  well sir i think that we ought to have a good chance with her she has shown herself a very fast boat the few times she has been raced but so have we and taking the line through boats that we have both sailed against i think that we ought to be able to beat her  i have rather a fancy that we shant do so hawkins we will do our best but i have met mr carthew a good many times for we were at school and college together and somehow or other he has always managed to beat me  ah well we will turn the tables on him this time sir  i hope so but it has gone so often the other way that i have got to be a little superstitious about it i would give a good deal to beat him i should like to win the queens cup as you know but even if i didnt win it i should be quite satisfied if i but beat him    chapter 8  it was the week of the ryde regatta at that time ryde disputed with cowes the glory of being the headquarters of yachting and the scene was a gay one every house in the neighbourhood was crowded with guests many had been let for the week at fabulous rates the town was bright with flags and a great fleet of yachts was moored off the town extending from the pier westward as far as the hulks the lawn of the victoria yacht club was gay with ladies a military band was playing boats rowed backwards and forwards between the yachts and the clubhouses  it was the first day of the regatta and the queens cup was not to be sailed for until the third on the previous morning frank had received a note from lady greendale saying that they had arrived with lord haverleys party the day before and enclosing an invitation from him to dinner that day he went up to call as soon as he received it but excused himself from dining on the ground of a previous engagement as he felt sure that carthew would be one of the party  i suppose lady greendale it is no use asking you and bertha to sail in the osprey on friday  i should not think of going frank a racing yacht is no place for an old lady as for bertha she is already engaged mr carthew asked her a fortnight since to sail on the phantom lady olive marston and her cousin miss haverley are also going i know that it is not very usual for ladies to go on racing yachts but they are all accustomed to yachting and mr carthew declares that they wont be in the way in the least  i dont see why they should be frank said after a short pause of course in a small boat it would be different but in a craft like the phantom there is plenty of room for two or three ladies without their getting in the way of the crew  well i must be going he broke off somewhat hastily for he saw a group coming down the garden path towards the house  it consisted of bertha and two other ladies carthew and another man  what other evening would suit you frank lady greendale asked as he rose  i am afraid i am engaged all through the week lady greendale  i am sorry she said quietly but perhaps it is for the best frank  the door closed behind him just as the party from the garden entered through the french windows  the next morning george lechmere went ashore with the steward when the latter landed to do his marketing the street up the hill was crowded and numbers of yachts sailors were ashore stewards with the flat rush baskets universally used by them were going from shop to shop groups of sailors were chatting over the events of the day and carriages were standing before the fishmongers poulterers and fruit and flower shops while the owners were laying in supplies for their guests people had driven in from all parts of the island to see the races and light country carts with eggs butter fowls and fruit were making their way down the steep hill  george had learnt from a casual remark of franks where the house taken by lord haverley was situated and going up the hill turned to the right and kept on until he came to a large house embowered in trees breakfast was just over when a servant told bertha that a gentleman who said his name was george lechmere wished to speak to her she went out to him in the hall  well george she said holding out her hand to him frankly for he was a great favourite of hers i suppose you have brought me up a message from major mallett  no miss greendale the major does not know that i have come to you it is on my own account that i am here could you spare me a quarter of an hour  certainly george she said in some surprise i will come out into the garden we are likely to have it to ourselves at this hour  she fetched her hat and they went out into the garden together george did not attempt to speak until they reached the other end where there was a seat in a shady corner  sit down george she said  thank you miss greendale i would rather stand and he took his place in front of her  i have a story to tell you he said it is very painful for me to have to tell it and it will be painful for you to hear it but i am sure that you ought to know  bertha did not say anything but looked at him with eyes wide open with surprise  i am sure miss greendale george went on that the major never told you that the bad wound he received at delhi that all but killed him was my doingthat he was wounded by a ball from my musket  no george he certainly never said so i suppose he was in front of you and your musket went off accidentally  no miss greendale i took deliberate aim at him and it was only the mercy of god that saved his life  bertha was too surprised and shocked to speak and he went on  he himself thought that he had been hit by a sepoy bullet and it was only when i sent for him believing that i had received my death wound that he knew that it was i who had hit him  but for what she asked what made you do this terrible thing i thought he was liked by his men  there was no one liked better miss greendale he was the most popular officer in the regiment and if the soldiers had known it and i had escaped being hung for it i should have been shot the first time i went into action afterwards it had nothing to do with the army i enlisted in his company on purpose to shoot him  bertha could hardly believe her ears she looked at the man earnestly surely he could not have been drinking at that time of the morning and she would have doubted his sanity had it not been for the calm and earnest look in his face he went on  i came here to tell you why i shot at him  i dont want to hear she said hurriedly it is no business of mine i know that whatever it was major mallett must have forgiven you besides you saved his life afterwards  excuse me miss greendale but it is a matter that concerns you and i pray you to listen to me you have heard of martha bennett the poor girl who disappeared four years ago and who was thought to have been murdered  yes i remember the talk about it it was never known who had done it  she was not murdered he said she returned some months afterwards but only to die it was about the time that sir john was ill and naturally you would have heard nothing of it  well miss greendale i was at one time engaged to martha i was of a jealous passionate disposition and i did not make enough allowance for her being young and naturally fond of admiration i quarrelled with her and the engagement was broken off but i still loved her with all my heart and soul  then he went on to tell of how maddened he had been when he had seen her talking to major mallett and of the conversation he had overheard in her fathers garden on the evening before she was missing  i jumped at the conclusion at once miss greendale that it was captain mallett as he was then he had been round saying goodbye to the tenants that afternoon and i knew that he was going abroad what could i suppose but that he had ruined my poor girl and had persuaded her to go out to join him in india i waited for a time while they searched for the body i knew they would never find my own father and mother in their hearts thought that i had murdered her in a fit of jealous rage at last i made up my mind to enlist in his regiment to follow him to india kill him find her and bring her home  how dreadful the girl murmured  it was dreadful miss greendale i believe now that i must have been mad at the time however i did it but at the end failed mercifully i was saved from being a murderer as i told you i was badly wounded i thought i was going to die and the doctor thought so too so i sent for captain mallett that i might have the satisfaction of letting him know that it was i who fired the shot and that it was in revenge for the wrong that he had done martha  when i told him i saw by his face even before he spoke that i had been wrong he knew nothing whatever of it well miss he forgave meforgave me wholly he told me that he should never mention it to a soul and as he has never mentioned it even to you you may see how well he has kept his word i wanted to leave the regiment i felt that i could never mix with my comrades knowing as i did that i had tried to murder their favourite officer but the major would not hear of it he insisted that i should stay and even more he promised that as soon as i was out of hospital i should be his servant saying that as the son of an old tenant he would rather have me than anyone else you can well imagine then miss greendale how willingly i would have given my life for him and that when the chance came i gladly faced odds to save him  before that i had come to learn who the man was it was a letter from my father that first gave me the clue he mentioned that another gentleman had left the neighbourhood and gone abroad just at the time that major mallett did he was a man who had once made me madly jealous by his attentions to martha at a fete given to his tenants  the major had the same thought and he told me that he knew the man was a bad fellow though he did not say why he thought so then i heard that martha had returned to die and i learned that she had told her mother the name of her destroyer who deserted her three months after he had taken her away when he came back from abroad her father and mine and some others met him at chippenham market they attacked him and i believe would have killed him had he not ridden off the next day he went up to london and a fortnight later his estate was in the market and he never came into that part of the country again  i have told you all this miss greendale because i have heard that you know the man and i thought you ought to know what sort of a man he is his name is carthew  bertha had grown paler and paler as the story went on and when he ended she sat still and silent for two or three minutes then she said in a low tone  thank you george you have done right in telling me this story it is one that i ought to know i wonder and she stopped  you wonder that the major did not tell you miss greendale i asked him myself when you think it over you will understand why he could not tell you for he had no actual proof save the dying girls words and what i had seen and heard and his motive in telling it might have been misunderstood but he told me that even at the risk of that he should feel it his duty if you became engaged to that villain to tell the story to lady greendale  but if he found it hard to speak there seemed to me no reason why i shouldnt except my father and mother and he no one knows that i was well nigh a murderer and though he has so generously forgiven me and i have in a small way tried to show my gratitude to him it was still painful to me to have to tell the story to anyone else but i felt that i ought to do itnot for his sake because he has told me that what i had looked for and what he had so hoped for is not to bebut because i thought that you ought not to be allowed to sacrifice your life to such a man and partly too because i wished to spare my dear master the pain of telling the story and of perhaps being misunderstood  thank you george she said quietly you have done quite right in telling  at this moment some voices were heard at the other end of the garden  i will be going at once george said seizing the opportunity of getting away and turning he walked down the garden and left the house  who is your friend bertha miss haverley said laughingly as she met bertha coming slowly down the garden  whyis anything the matter she exclaimed as she caught sight of her face  i have become suddenly faint hannah bertha replied i suppose it was the heat yesterday and it is very warm this morning too i am better now and it will soon pass over i will go indoors for half an hour and then i shall be quite right again  my friend is no one particular he is major malletts factotum he only brought me up a message but as i know all the men on the osprey and have not been on board this season of course there was a good deal to ask about  well you must get well as soon as you can miss haverley said you know we shall leave in half an hour for the yacht so as to get under way in time for the start  at the appointed time bertha joined the party below her eyes looked heavy and her cheeks were flushed but she assured miss haverley that she felt quite herself now and that she was sure that the sea air would set her up altogether the schooner was under way a quarter of an hour before the gun was fired and sailed east as the course was twice round the nab and back  yachts were flitting about in all directions for a light air had only sprung up during the last half hour  there is the phantom lord haverley said she has been cruising about the last two days to get her sails stretched and they look uncommonly well carthew told me yesterday that she would be across early this morning and that he should go round with the race to see how she did i think you young ladies will have a very good chance of being able to boast that you have sailed in the yacht that won the queens cup i fancy it lies between her and the osprey mallett is getting up sail too i see but as the phantom is going with the race i dont suppose he will she is a fine craft though i own i like the cutter rig better the phantom will have to allow her time but not a great deal for the yawl is the heaviest tonnage  there is the starting gun they are all close together at the line  that is a pretty sight lady greendale talk about the start of race horses it is no more to be compared with it than light to dark  after cruising about for three or four hours their schooner dropped anchor near the osprey which had come in half an hour before  have you ever been on board the osprey lord haverley bertha asked  no my dear i dont know that i have ever before been in any port with your friend major mallett  well what do you say to our going on board for a few minutes on our way to shore mamma and i are very fond of her and i am her godmother having christened her  godmother and curate coupled in one eh bertha we will go by all means that is to say we cannot invade him in a body but those of us who know mallett can go on board and the gig can come back and take the rest ashore and then come to fetch us  accordingly lord haverley and his daughter lady greendale and bertha and two others of the party were rowed to the osprey frank saw them coming and met them at the gangway  we are taking you by storm major lord haverley said but lady greendale and her daughter claim an almost proprietary interest in the osprey because the latter is her godmother indeed we are all naturally interested in her too as being one of our cracks she is a very smartlooking craft though i think it is a pity that she is not cutter rigged  she would look prettier no doubt frank said but you see though she was built as a racer and i like a race occasionally that was not my primary object i wanted her for cruising and there is no doubt that a yawl is more handy and you can work her with fewer hands than you can a cutter of the same size  they went round the vessel and then returning on deck sat down and chatted while waiting for the boats return  i sincerely hope that you will win frank on friday lady greendale said our sympathies are rather divided but i hope the osprey will win  thank you lady greendale but i am by no means sanguine about it  i fancy miss haverley that you and miss greendale will see the winning flag flying overhead when the race is over  why do you think so major lord haverley asked the general opinion is that your record is better than that of the phantom she has done well in the two or three races she has sailed but she certainly did not beat the lesbia or the mermaid by as much as you did  that may be frank agreed but i regard carthew as having been born under a lucky star and though my own opinion is that if the phantom were in other hands we should beat her i fancy his luck will pull her through  haverley laughed i should not have given you credit for being superstitious major  i dont think that i have many superstitions but i own to something like it in this case  bertha looked earnestly at him just before the gig returned from the shore she and frank were standing together  i am sorry that i shall not have your good wishes tomorrow he said  i have not said that anyone will have my good wishes she replied i shall be on board the phantom because i was invited there before you asked me but my hope is that the best yacht will win i want to speak to you for a minute or two when can i see you  i can come up tomorrow morning early he replied what time will best suit you  ten oclock please ask for mamma  the next morning lady greendale and bertha came together into the sitting room into which frank had been shown on calling at lord haverleys  you are early frank  yes lady greendale i am going for a run round the island it makes me fidgety to sit all day with nothing to do and i am always contented when i am under sail as i shant have time to come in tomorrow morning for you know we start at nine i thought that i would drop in this morning even if the hour was an early one  after chatting for a few minutes lady greendale made some excuse to leave the room  she knew that you were coming and that i wanted to speak to you said bertha  well what is itanything of importance he asked with a smile  she hesitated and then went on  some words you spoke yesterday recalled to me something you said nearly four years ago do you remember when we sat next to each other in the twilight the day before you went to india we were talking about superstitions then and you told me that you had only one and said what it wasyou remember  i remember he said gravely  about someone who had beaten you always and who you thought always would beat you if you came in contact again you would not tell me his name was it mr carthew  i would not answer the question then bertha and you surely cannot expect me to answer it now  i do expect you to answer it  then i must most emphatically decline to do so he said what do you think that if it were he i would be so base as to discredit him now for you must remember that i said that only one of my defeats was due to foul play that most of the others were simply due to the fact that he was a better man than i was the matter has long since been forgotten and whoever it is i would not prejudice him in the opinion of anyone by raising up that old story i have no shadow of proof that it was he who damaged my boat it might have been the act of some boatman about the place who had laid his money against my winning  that is enough she said quietly i did not think that you would tell me whether it was mr carthew but i was sure that if it were not he you would not hesitate to say so thank you that is all i wanted to see you for what you said yesterday brought that talk we had so vividly into my mind that i could not resist asking you it explained what seemed to me at the time to be strange how it was that you who are generally so cordial in your manner were so cold to him when you first met him at our house i thought that there might be something more serious and she looked him full in the face  perhaps i am a prejudiced beggar he said with an attempt to smile and then added somewhat bitterly you see things since have not been calculated to make me specially generous in his case  she did not reply and after a moments pause he said well as lady greendale seems to be busy i will be going  you will come to the ball tomorrow evening wont you she asked  i suppose i shall have to he said if i win though mind i feel sure that i shant it will seem odd if i dont come if i lose it will look as if i sulked  you must come she said and you must have a dance with me you have not been keeping your word major mallett you said that you would always be the same to me and you are not you have never once asked me to dance with you and you are changed altogether  i try to bei try hard bertha but just at present it is beyond me i cannot stand by and see you going and he stopped abruptly  well never mind bertha it will all come right in time but at any rate i cannot stand it at present goodbye  and without giving her time to reply he hastily left the room  bertha stood silent for a minute or two then quietly followed him out of the room  the next day ryde was astir early it was the queens cup day eight yachts were entered three schoonersthe rhodope the isobel and the mayflower four cuttersthe pearl the chrysalis the alacrity and the phantom and the osprey which was the only yawl it was halfpast eight and all were under way under mainsail and jib  the solent was alive with yachts they were pouring out from southampton water they were coming up from cowes and some were making their way across from portsmouth the day was a fine one for sailing  have you got the same extra hands as last time frank asked the skipper  all the same sir they all know their work well and of course if there is anything to be done aloft our own men go up i dont think any of them will beat us in smartness  as the time approached for the start the racers began to gather in the neighbourhood of the starting line and as the fiveminutes gun fired the topsail went up and they began to sail backwards and forwards near it  as the phantom crossed under the lee of the osprey the three ladies waved their handkerchiefs to frank who took off his cap  may the best yacht win bertha called out as the vessels flew quickly apart  we could not want a better day george frank said we can carry everything comfortably and there is not enough wind to kick up much of a sea as far as we are concerned i would rather that the wind had been either north or south so that we could have laid our course all round as it is we shall have the wind almost dead aft till we are round the nab then we shall be closehauled with perhaps an occasional tack along the back of the island then free again back there is no doubt that the cutters have a pull closehauled i fancy with this wind the schooners will be out of it though if it had been a reach the whole way they would have had a good chance  four minutes are gone  he was holding his watch in his hand and after a short pause called out five seconds gone  the osprey had a good position at present though with the wind aft this was of comparatively little consequence she was nearly in a line with the mark boat nearest to the shore and some hundred and fifty yards from it  haul in the main sheet hawkins said quietly and the men stationed there hauled on the rope until he said that will do we must not go too fast  he went on turning to frank who had just called out twenty seconds gone  i think that we shall about do  the latter nodded  a bit more lads the skipper said ten seconds later that will do  fifteen seconds more frank said presently  slack away the sheet slack it away handsomely up foresail that is it shouted the skipper  as the boom ran out and the foresail went up the osprey glided on with accelerated speed and the end of the bowsprit was but a few yards from the starting line when the gun fired  bravo good start frank said as he looked round for the first time  the eight yachts were all within a length of each other and a cheer broke from the boats around as they sped on their way for a time there was but little difference between them and then the cutters began to show a little in front their long booms gave them an advantage over the schooners and the yawl when before the wind the spinnaker was not then invented and the wind was not sufficiently dead aft to enable the schooners to carry their mainsail and foresails wing and wing or for the yawls mizzen to help her  as they passed sea view the cutters were a length ahead the phantom having a slight advantage over her sisters they gained no further for the schooners fell into their wake as soon as they were able to do so thus robbing them of some of their wind the osprey having the inside station kept straight on and came up with the cutters as they were abreast of the end of the island all were travelling very fast through the water  we shall be first round the nab sir hawkins said in delight the schooners are smothering the cutters but they are not hurting us  give her plenty of room when we get there frank said  the skipper nodded i wont risk a foul sir you may be sure  the three ladies on board the phantom were seated on footstools under the weather bulwarkalthough as yet the yachts were travelling on an almost even keel miss haverley and lady olive uttered exclamations of satisfaction as the phantom slowly drew ahead of the others and were loud in their disgust as they saw the effect of the schooners sail behind them on their own speed  i dont call it fair the former said if a vessel cannot sail well herself that she should be allowed to damage the chances of others do you bertha  i dont know i suppose it is equally fair for all and that we should do the same if a boat had got ahead of us still it is very tiresome but it is just as bad for the other cutters  look at the osprey lady olive said soon afterwards she is coming up fast you see she has nothing behind her i do believe that she is going to pass us  it wont make much difference carthew who was standing close to her said confidently the race wont really begin until we are round the nab and after that we shant hamper each other i am quite content with the way that we are going  the osprey rounded the lightship two lengths ahead the phantom came next three lengths before the chrysalis and the others followed in quick succession the sheets were hauled in and the yachts were able to lie closehauled for ventnor the three leading boats maintained their respective places but drew out from each other and when they passed ventnor the osprey was some five lengths ahead of the phantom  dont be downcast ladies carthew said gaily we have a long way to go yet and once round the point we shall have to turn till we pass the needles  the sea was now getting a good deal rougher the wind was against tide and the yachts began to throw the spray over the bows bertha was struck with the confidence with which carthew had spoken and watched him closely  we shall get it a good deal worse off st catherines head he went on there is a race there even in the calmest weather and i should advise you to get your wraps ready for the spray will be flying all over her when we get into it  they were now working tack and tack but the osprey was still improving her position and as they neared st catherines head she was a good quarter of a mile to the good still carthew maintained his good temper but bertha could see that it was with an effort he seemed to pay but little attention to the sailing of the phantom but kept his eyes intently fixed upon the osprey  i should not be surprised at some of us carrying away a spar before long he said the wind is freshening and we shall have to shift topsails and jibs i fancy  they were now lying far over and the water was two or three planks up the lee deck each time the cutter went about the ladies carried their footstools up to windward when the vessel was for a moment on an even keel when there they were obliged to sit with one hand over the rail to prevent themselves from sliding down to leeward as the vessel heeled  there goes the chrysaliss topmast the skipper exclaimed suddenly that does for her chance i think i had better get the jib header ready for hoisting mr carthew the spar is bending like a whip  yes i think you had better get it up at once captain it is no use running any risk  as the phantoms big topsail came down the ospreys was seen to flutter and then to descend  he has only been waiting for us the captain said  carthew made no reply he was still intently watching the craft ahead  it is just as well for him the captain went on he will be in the race directly  bertha was still watching carthews face cheerful as his tones were there was an expression of anxiety in it three minutes later he gave an exclamation as of relief and a shout rose from the men forward  following the direction of his eyes she saw the bowsprit of the osprey swing to leeward and a moment later her topmast fall over her side  what did i tell you carthew said exultingly a race is never lost till it is won  oh i am sorry bertha said i do think it is hard to lose a race by an accident  every yacht has to abide by its own accidents miss greendale and carrying away a spar is one of the accidents one counts on if it were not for that risk yachts would always carry on too long it is a matter of judgment and of attention to gear the loss of a spar is in nine times out of ten the result either of rashness or of inattention  however i am sorry myself that is to say i would prefer winning the cup by arriving first at the flag boat however i am certainly not disposed to grumble at fortune just at present  i should think not mr carthew lady olive said i am sure i congratulate you very heartily of course i have seen scores of races and whenever there is any wind someone is always sure to lose a spar and sometimes two or three will do so i dont think you need fear any of the boats behind  no yet i dont feel quite safe i have no fear of any of the cutters but once round the needles it will be a broad reach and you will see that the schooners will come up fast and i have to allow them a good bit of time however i think we are pretty safe    chapter 9  the phantom presently came along close to the osprey and carthew shouted  is there anything that i can do for you  no thank you frank replied  then bertha called out  i am so sorry  frank waved his hand in reply the men were all busy trying to get the wreckage alongside the crosstrees had been carried away by the fall of the topmast and her deck forward was littered with gear the difficulty was greatly increased by the heavy sea in the race  as soon as you have got everything on board hawkins we will put a couple of reefs in the mainsail she will go well enough under that and the foresail if the mizzen is too much for her we can take it off  it was nearly half an hour before all was clear and the last of the yachts in the race had passed them before the leeward sheet of the foresail was hauled aft and the phantom resumed her course as soon as she did so the captain came aft with part of the copper bar of the bobstay  there has been foul play sir he said i thought there must have been for i could not imagine that this bar would have broken unless there had been a flaw in the metal or it had been tampered with i unshackled it myself for i thought it was better that the men should not see it until i had told you about it  quite right hawkins yes there is no doubt that there has been foul play the bar has been sawn threequarters of the way through with a fine saw and of course it went as soon as she began to dip her bowsprit well into it in the race you see whoever has done it has poured some acid into it and darkened the copper partly perhaps to prevent the colour of the freshlycut metal from being noticed and partly to give it the appearance after it was broken of being an old cut  it cannot have been that sir for we were out in quite as rough a sea as this last week and the bowsprit would have gone then if this cut had been there besides we should have been sure to have noticed it when we went round her to polish up her sides  i dont know about that hawkins you see the cut is from below and it is only two or three inches above the waterline it might very well have been there without being noticed still i agree with you it could not have been there last week or it must have gone when she put her nose into it then in point of fact i have no doubt that it was done last night or the night before it could easily have been managed of course everyone was below both here and in the yachts lying round us and a man might very well have come out in a small boat between one and two oclock in the morning and done this without being noticed  he might have done that sir but we should have heard the grating down in the forecastle  i dont know hawkins a fine steel saw such as burglars use will work its way through an iron bar almost noiselessly and i should say that it would go through copper almost as easily as it would through hard wood it is as well to say nothing to the crew about it but i think it my duty to lay the matter before the club committee and they can do as they like about it mind i dont say for a moment that it was done by anyone on board the phantom it may have been someone on shore who had laid a bet of a few pounds against us and wanted to make sure of winning his money besides the phantom might very well have hoped to have beaten us fairly for she was just as much fancied as we were take it below and lay it in my cabin and when we get in unshackle the other bit of the bar and put it with this  it was impossible however when the bowsprit and bobstay were brought on board that the crew should have failed to notice the break in the bar and the news that there had been foul play had at once been passed round seeing the angry faces of the men and the animated talk forward frank told the captain to call all hands aft  look here my men he said i see that you are all aware of what has taken place it is most disgraceful and unfortunate and i need hardly say that i am as much vexed as yourselves at losing the cup which but for that we must have carried off however it is one of those cases in which there is nothing to be done and we should only make things worse by making a fuss about it we have no ground whatever for believing that it was the work of one of the phantoms crew and it is far more likely that it was the work of some longshore loafer who had laid more than he could afford against us it has partly been our own fault but we shall know better in future and your captain will take good care that there shall be an anchor watch set for two or three nights before we sail another race  what i have called you up for is to beg of you not to make this an occasion for disputes or quarrels ashore hitherto i have been proud of the good behaviour of my crew and i should be sorry indeed to hear that there was any row ashore between you and the phantoms men they at least have nothing to boast of they have won the cup but we have won the honour we have shown ourselves the better yacht and should have beaten them by something like a mile if it had not been for this accident therefore it is my express wish and order that you do not show your natural disappointment on shore you can give the real reason of our defeat but do not say a word of blame to anyone for we know not who was the author of the blackguardly act  of course the matter cannot be kept altogether a secret for it will be my duty to lay it before the committee i shall make no protest if they choose to institute an inquiry they must do so but i shall take no steps in the matter and it is unlikely in the extreme that we shall ever know who did it i shall pay you all winning money for that you did not win was no fault of yours one thing i will wager though i am not a betting man and that is that the next time we meet the phantom we shall beat her by as much as we should have done today but for this accident  the appearance of the osprey as she sailed into the anchorage without topmast or bowsprit excited great attention and many of the yachtsmen came on board to inquire how the disaster had happened to save going through the story a score of times frank had the broken pieces of the bobstay bar brought up and laid on the deck near the tiller and in reply to inquiries simply pointed to them saying  i think that tells the tale for itself  all were full of indignation at the dastardly outrage  what are you going to do major  i am not going to do anything except take it ashore and hand it to the sailing committee that it has been cut is certain as to who cut it there is no shadow of evidence  if i were in carthews place one of them said i should decline to take the cup under such circumstances and would offer to sail the race over again with you as soon as you had repaired damages  i should decline the offer if he made it he said quietly it is probable that we shall meet in a race again some day and then we can fight it out but for the present it is done with he has won the queens cup and i must put up with my accidents  the effect produced by the facts reported to the committee and their examination of the broken bar was very great such a thing had not been known before in the annals of yachting and the committee ordered a poster to be instantly printed and stuck up offering a reward of 100 pounds for proof that would lead to the conviction of the author of the outrage  frank returned on board at once and sent off a boat towing behind it the broken bowsprit and topmast to cowes with instructions to messieurs white to have two fresh spars got ready by the following afternoon if possible  he did not go ashore again until he landed at halfpast ten at the clubhouse every window was lit up and dancing had begun an hour before frank at once obtained a partner in order to avoid having to talk the unpleasant business over with yachting friends  presently he sat down by the side of lady greendale  i am so sorry frank she said it does seem hard when you had set your mind on it  i had hoped to win he said but it is not as bad as all that after all it would have been more mortifying to lose because the osprey was not fast enough than to lose from an accident when she had already proved herself to be the best in the race you know that i never went in for being a racing yachtsman i look upon racing as being a secondary part of yachting i can assure you i dont feel that i am greatly to be pitied it might have been better and it might have been a great deal worse  well i am glad that you take it in that way she said i can assure you that i was greatly upset over it when i heard it  he sat chatting with her for some time presently bertha was brought back by her partner to her mothers side  thank you for your hail as you passed us miss greendale it sounded hearty and really cheered me up for just at the moment i was in an exceedingly bad temper i can assure you you see my forebodings came true and luck was against me  not luck she said indignantly you would have won but for treachery  treachery is rather a hard word he said however it is of no use crying over spilt milk i have lost and shall live to fight another day i hope and next time i shall win still you know there is really nothing to grumble at i have been fortunate altogether this season and as i bought the osprey as a cruiser i have done a great deal better with her than i could have expected  at this moment another partner of berthas came up and was about to carry her off when she said  i suppose the osprey can sail still major mallett  oh yes she is a lame duck you know but she can get about all right  well why dont you ask mamma and me to take a sail with you tomorrow afternoon  i shall be very happy to do so he said but i almost think that you had better wait until she gets her spars i dont think that they will be finished before tomorrow evening the men can get to work early in the morning and we can be here by two oclock next day  no i think that we will come tomorrow major mallett  it will be a novelty to sail in a cripple wont it mamma  besides you know or you ought to know that the day after tomorrow is sunday and that at present our plans are arranged for going up to town on monday  that being so frank said with a smile by all means come tomorrow will you come to lunch or afterwards  afterwards i think we will be down at the club landing stage at halfpast two  bertha is bent upon taking possession of you tomorrow lady greendale said smiling as the girl turned away and i shall be glad for her to have a quiet two or three hours out of the racket a large party is very fatiguing and i think that it has been too much for her yesterday and today she has been quite unlike herself at one time sitting quiet and saying nothing at other times rattling away with miss haverley and lady olive and absolutely talking down both of them which i should have thought impossible she seems to me to be altogether overexcited i thought it would have been a rest for her to get away for a week from the fag in london but i am sorry now that we came down altogether i am a little worried about it frank  well the season is drawing towards its end now lady greendale and if you can get a short time at home no doubt it will do you good i did not think that bertha was looking well when i saw her yesterday  frank danced a couple more dances and then went to lady greendale and said  will you make my excuses to bertha and tell her that having shown myself here so that it might not be thought that i was out of temper at my bad luck i shall be off indeed i do not feel quite up to entering into the thing you can understand dear lady greendale that at present things are going rather hardly with me  she gave him a sympathetic look i can understand frank she said but here she comes you can make your excuses yourself  i can quite understand that you dont care about staying bertha said when he repeated what he had said to her mother well i will give you the next dance or what will be nicer i will sit it out with you ah here is my partner  i am afraid i have made a mistake mr jennings and have got my card mixed up do you mind taking the thirteenth dance instead of this i shall be very much obliged if you will  her partner murmured his assent  thank you frank said as she took his arm now shall we go out on the balcony or on the lawn  the lawn i think it is a lovely evening and there is no fear of catching cold  i am afraid that you are very disappointed she went on as they went out i am disappointed too i told you i wanted the best yacht to win and it has not done so  thank you he replied quietly i should have liked to have won just this once but all along i felt that the chances were against me and that fortune would play me some trick or other  it was not fortune fortune had nothing to do with it she said indignantly you were beaten by a crimeby a mean miserable crimeby the same sort of crime by which you were beaten before  i have no reason for supposing that there is any connection  frank she broke in suddenly and he started as for the first time for years she called him by his christian name you are an old friend of ours and you promised me that you would always be my friend do you think that it is right to be trying to throw dust into my eyes dont you think on the contrary that as a friend you should speak frankly to me  frank was silent for a moment  on some subjects yes bertha on others what has passed between us makes it very difficult for a man to know what he ought to do but be assured that if i saw you make any fatal mistake any mistake at least that i believed to be fatal i should not hesitate even if i knew that i should be misunderstood and that i should forfeit your liking by so doing this is just one of the cases when i do not feel justified as yet in speaking carthew is not my friend and you know it if i had had no personal feudfor it has become that with himi should be more at liberty to speak but as it is i would rather remain silent i tell you this now that you may know in case i ever do meddle in your affairs how painful it is for me to do so and how unwillingly i do it at any rate there is nothing whatever to connect the accident that took place today with him the event is one of a series of successes that he has gained over me it does not affect me much for though i should have liked to have won today i dont feel about such matters as i used to  you see when a man has suffered one heavy defeat he does not care about how minor skirmishes may go  they walked up and down in silence for some time then she said quietly  the music has stopped i think frank that i had better go in again so you will take us tomorrow  certainly he said  he took her in to lady greendale and then went off to the osprey he was feeling in higher spirits than he had done for some time as he walked up and down the deck for an hour before turning in it seemed to him that she might not after all accept carthew and that he would not be obliged to bring trouble upon her by telling the shameful story  it will be all the same as far as i am concerned he said to himself but i am sure that i could stand her marrying anyone else which of course she will do before long better than carthew i hear whispers that he was hard hit at ascot though he gives out that he won not that that matters much but it is never a good lookout for a girl to marry a man who gambles even though she be rich and her friends take good care to settle her money upon herself she evidently suspects that he is at the bottom of this trick and she would hardly think so if she really cared for him but if she does think so i fancy that the winning of the queens cup will cost him dearly  i wonder why she has apparently so set her mind on going out with us tomorrow  carthew enjoyed his triumph that evening loudly expressed his indignation and regret at the scandalous affair to which he owed his victory frankly said that he could hardly have hoped to win the cup had it not been for that and expressed his determination to add another hundred pounds to the reward offered by the club for the discovery of the author of the outrage the men felt that it was hard on a fellow to win the cup by the breakdown of an opponent in that way and the ladies admired the sincere way in which he expressed his regrets he was a good dancer a good talker and a handsome man and as few of them knew frank they had no particular interest in his misfortune  he danced only once with bertha who said  as the hero of the occasion mr carthew you must be generous in your attentions and please everyone  i suppose i must obey you miss greendale he said but i had hoped to have had an opportunity of saying something particular to you tonight  really she answered innocently well i shall be at home tomorrow morning and if you come up about eleven you are sure to find me  miss greendale is at the other end of the garden sir the servant said as he enquired for her the next morning she asked me to tell you if you called that she was there  with considerable assurance of success carthew walked into the garden she must know what he wanted to say to her and he had of late felt sure that her answer would be favourable when the question was put she was sitting on the same bench on which two days before she had heard george lechmeres story  you know what i have come for miss greendale he began at once i think that you know how i feel towards you and how deeply i love you i have come to ask you to be my wife  before i answer you mr carthew she said calmly i must ask you to listen to a story it was told me here two days ago by a man named george lechmere do you know him  i seem to have heard his name though i cannot say where he replied surprised at the coolness with which she spoke  he is a farmers son i believe and he was an interested party though not the chief actor of the story the chief actor i suppose i should say actress was martha bennett you know her  carthew stepped back as if he had received a sudden blow his face paled and he gave a short gasp  i see you know her she went on she was a poor creature i fancy and her story is one that has often been told before she threw away the love of an honest man and trusted herself to a villain he betrayed the trust took her away to america and then cast her off and she went home to die her destroyer did not altogether escape punishment he was attacked and pelted by her father and his friends in the market place at chippenham you see it all happened in my neighbourhood and the villain not daring to show his face in the county again disposed of his estate  you dont believe this infamous lie carthew said hoarsely  how do you know that it is an infamous lie mr carthew i have mentioned no names i have simply told you the story of a hapless girl whom you once knew your face is the best witness that i can require of its truth thank god i heard it in time had it not been for that i might have been fool enough to have given you the answer you wanted for i own that i liked you i am sure now that i did not love you for had i done so i should not have believed this tale or if i had believed it it would have crushed me but i liked you i found you pleasanter than other men and i even fancied that i loved you had i not known this story i might have married you and been the most miserable woman alive for a man who could play the villain to a hapless girl who could stoop to so mean and dastardly an action as to cripple a rival yacht is a creature so mean so detestable that wretched indeed would be the fate of the woman that married him  do not contradict it sir she said rising from her seat now with her face ablaze with indignation i was watching you i had heard that story and had heard another story of how the boat of an antagonist of yours at henley had been crippled before a race and i watched you from the time i came on board i saw that you were strangely confident i saw how you were watching for something i saw the flash of triumph in your face when that something happened and i was absolutely certain that the same base manoeuvre that had won you your heat at henley had been repeated in your race for the queens cup  i dont think sir you will want any more specific answer to your question  you will repent this he panted his face distorted by a raging disappointment i do not contradict your statements it would be beneath me to do so but some day you may have cause to regret having made them  i may tell you she said as she turned that it is not my intention to make public the knowledge that i gained of your conduct yesterday i have no proof save my own absolute conviction and the knowledge that i have of your past  he did not look round but walked at a rapid pace down the garden half an hour later the phantoms anchor was got up and she sailed for southampton water beyond giving the necessary order to get under way carthew did not speak a word until she anchored off the pier then he went ashore at once and took the next train for town sending off a telegram before starting  when he got home he asked the servant briefly if mr conking had come  yes sir he is waiting for you in the dining room  well carthew how have things gone off i see by the papers this morning that you won the cup and also that the ospreys bobstay burst at the right time and that a great sensation had been caused by the discovery that there had been foul play  why what is the matter with you you look as black as a thundercloud  and no wonder i won the race but i have lost the girl  the deuce you have why i thought that you felt quite certain of that  so i did and it would have come off all right if some infernal fellow had not turned up and told her about an old affair of mine that i thought buried and forgotten three or four years ago and it took me so aback that as she said my face was the best evidence of the truth of the story more than that she declared that she knew that i was at the bottom of the ospreys business however she has no evidence about that but the other story did the business for me and the game is all up in that quarter there never was such bad luck she as much as told me that if i had proposed to her before she had heard the story she would have said yes  no chance of her changing her mind  not a scrap  it is an awkward affair for you  horribly awkward yes i have only got fifteen thousand left and unless things go right at goodwood i shall be cleaned right out i calculated that everything would be set right if i married this girl things have gone badly of late  yes your luck has been something awful it did seem that with the pains that we took and the way i cleared the ground for you by bribing jockeys and so on we ought to have made pots of money of course we did pull off some good things but others we looked on as safe and went in for heavily all turned out wrong  well there will be nothing for me but to get across the channel unless as i say things go right at goodwood  i should not be nervous about it for unless there is some dark horse i feel sure that your rosney has got the race in hand  yes i feel sure of that too we have kept him well back all the season and never let him even get a place it ought to be a certainty  then they sat some time smoking in silence  by gad i have half a mind to carry her off carthew broke out suddenly it is the only way that i can see of getting things straightened out she acknowledged that she liked me before she heard this accursed story and if i had her to myself i have no doubt that i could make her like me again in spite of it  it is a risky thing to carry a woman off in our days conkling said thoughtfully and a deuced difficult one to do i dont see how you are going to set about it or what in the world you would do with her and where you would put her when you had got her i have done some pretty risky things for you in my time carthew but i should not care about trying that we might both find ourselves in for seven years  well you would have as much as that for getting at a horse and i dont know that you wouldnt for bribing a jockey still i see that it is an uncommonly difficult thing  for five minutes nothing more was said then conkling suddenly broke the silence  by jove i should say that the yacht would be just the thing  that is a good idea jim a firstrate idea if it could be worked out it would want a lot of scheming but i dont see why it should not be done if i could once get her on board i could cruise about with her for any time until she gave in  you would have to get a fresh crew carthew i doubt whether your fellows would stand it  no i suppose some of them might kick at any rate i would not trust them no i should have to find a fresh crew foreigners would be best but it would look uncommonly rum for the phantom to be cruising about with a foreign crew besides i know men in almost every port i should put into  couldnt you alter her rig or something of that sort so that she could not be recognised it seems to me that if you were to take her across to some foreign port pay off the crew there and send them home then get her altered and ship a foreign crew you might cruise about as long as you liked especially abroad without a soul being any the wiser and the girl must sooner or later give in and if she would not you could make her  that is a big idea jim yes if i once got my lady on board you may be sure that she would have to say yes sooner or later i dont often forgive and it would be a triumph to make her pay for the dressing down she gave me this morning besides i am really fond of her and i could forgive her for that outbreak which i suppose was natural enough after we were married and there is no reason why we should not get on very well together  i tell you what i will go down the first thing tomorrow to southampton and will sail at once for ostend there i will pay her off alter her rig and ship a fresh crew i will draw my money from the bank if things go well i shall be set up again if they go badly there will be some long faces at tattersalls on settling day but i shall be away and the money will be enough if we have to cruise for a couple of years or double that before she gives in  i shall try mild measures for a good bit be very respectful and repentant and all that if i find after a time that that does not fetch her i must try what threats will do anyhow she wont leave until she steps on shore to be married or safer still till i can get a clergyman on board to marry us there would you like to go with us  if the thing bursts up there is nothing i should like better  you will have to help me carry her off jim and the day that she signs her name bertha carthew i will give you a couple of thousand pounds  that is a bargain the man said it is a good scheme altogether if we can hit upon some plan for carrying her away  it is of no use to think of that until we know where she will be i dont see at present how it is to be done but i know that there is always a way if one can think of it you telegraph to me every day poste restante ostend or wherever i am stopping i will send you the name of the hotel i put up at directly i get there you had better send someone down at once to ryde to let you know what she is doing and when she comes up to town it is just on the cards that they may not come for a bit but may go for a cruise in malletts yacht as they did last autumn anyhow let me know and if i telegraph for you to come over cross by the next boat  likely enough i may run over myself as soon as i get the business there going all right but of course i shall stay there if i can i should get it done in half the time if i were present to push things on of course you will run down and see how the horse is getting on and pick up any information that you can and let me know about it  i will put that into good hands carthew it is better that i should stay here and watch things at tattersalls then i can keep you informed how things are looking every day and be ready to start as soon as i get your telegram but of course you wont do anything until after the race is run  no i feel as safe as a man can as to rosney but even if he wins i shall carry my idea out i have had enough of the turf and burnt my fingers enough over it and i shall be glad to settle down as a country gentleman again if i lose i shall make a private sale of all my horses before i leave the course that ought to bring me in another seven or eight thousand pounds for our trip    chapter 10  there is the phantom getting under way the skipper said as his turn up and down the deck brought him close to frank  so she is i saw her owner go ashore less than an hour ago  yes he came on board again five minutes ago the men began to bustle about directly he got on deck i do hope they wont put in again as long as we are here the hands are as savage as bulls and though they remembered what you told them and there were no rows on shore last night i shall be glad when we aint in the same port with the phantom for i am sure that if two or three men of each crew were to drop in to the same pub there would be a fight in no time and really i could not blame them it is not in human nature to lose a race like that without feeling very sore over it i hope she is off anyhow as we are going to cowes this evening it will be a day or two before the hands are likely to run against each other and that will give them time to cool down a bit  there is one thing i bet the phantom wont enter against us at cowes if we were to give them a handsome beating there it would show everyone that they would have had no chance of winning the cup if it had not been for the accident  no i dont suppose that we shall meet again this season and indeed i dont know that i shall do any more racing myself except that i shall feel it as a sort of duty to enter for the squadrons open race  i think by the course she is laying that the phantom is off to southampton perhaps she is going to meet somebody there anyhow she is not likely to be back until we have started for cowes  frank sat for some time with the paper in his hand but although he glanced at it occasionally his mind took in nothing of its contents again and again he watched the phantom yes she was certainly going to southampton water  from what bertha had said to him the evening before he had received a strong hope that she would reject carthew nothing was more probable than that he should have gone ashore that morning fresh from his victory to put the question to her and his speedy return and his order to make sail as soon as he got on deck certainly pointed to the fact that she had refused him  a load of care seemed to be lifted from franks mind from the first when he had found that carthew was a visitor at lady greendales he had been uncomfortable he knew the mans persevering nature and recognised his power of pleasing when he desired to do so he was satisfied that when he himself was refused the reason bertha gave him was as far as she knew the true one but he had since thought that possibly she might then although unsuspected by herself have been to some extent under the spell of carthews influence when she had declined two unexceptional offers he had been almost convinced that carthew when the time came would receive a more favourable answer but he had watched them closely on the few occasions when he had seen them together in society and certain as he had felt at other times he had come away somewhat puzzled and said to himself  she is captivated by his manner as any girl might be but i doubt whether she loves him  this impression however had always died out in a short time and he had somehow come to accept the general opinion unquestioningly that she would accept carthew when he proposed he had been prepared to face the alternative of either suffering her to marry a scoundrel or of taking a step more repugnant to him which would probably end by an entire breach of his friendship with the greendales that of telling them this story he was therefore delighted to find that the difficulty had been solved by bertha herself without his intervention and felt absolutely grateful for the accident which had cost him the queens cup but had at the same time opened berthas eyes to the mans true character soon after two oclock he went ashore in the gig and at the half hour lady greendale and bertha came down  the osprey looks like a bird shorn of its wings he said as he handed them into the boat and though the men have made everything as tidy as they could the two missing spars quite spoil her appearance  that does not matter in the least frank lady greendale said we know how she looks when she is at her best we shall enjoy a quiet sail in her just as much as if she were in applepie order  you look fagged lady greendale though you are pretty well accustomed to gaiety in town  lady greendale did indeed look worn and worried for the last two or three days berthas manner had puzzled her and caused her some vague anxiety that morning the girl had come in from the garden and told her that she had just refused mr carthew and although she had never been pleased at the idea of berthas marrying him the refusal had come as a shock  personally she liked him she believed him to be very well off but she had expected bertha to do much better and she by no means approved of his fondness for the turf she had been deeply disappointed at the girls refusal of lord chilson on whom she had quite set her mind the second offer had also been a good one still she had reconciled herself to the thought of berthas marrying carthew his connection with the turf had certainly brought him into contact with a great many good men he was to be met everywhere and she could hardly wonder that bertha should have been taken with his good looks and the brilliancy of his conversation the refusal then came to her not only as an absolute surprise but as a shock  she considered that bertha had certainly given him as well as everyone else reason to suppose that she intended to accept him many of her intimate friends had spoken to her as if the affair was already a settled matter and when it became known that bertha had refused him she would be set down as a flirt and it would certainly injure her prospects of making the sort of match that she desired she had said something of all this to the girl and had only received the reply  i know what i am doing mamma i can understand that you thought i was going to marry him i thought so myself but something has happened that has opened my eyes and i have every reason to be thankful that it has i dare say you think that i have behaved very badly and i am sorry but i am sure that i am doing right now  what have you discovered bertha i dont understand you at all  i dont suppose you do mamma i cannot tell you what it is i told him that i would not tell anybody  but you dont seem to mind bertha that is what puzzles me a girl who has made up her mind to accept a man and who finds out something that seems to her so bad that she rejects him would naturally be distressed and upset you seem to treat it as if it were a matter of no importance  i dont quite understand it myself mamma i suppose that my eyes have been opened altogether at any rate i feel that i have had a very narrow escape i was certainly very much worried when i first learned about this two days ago and i was even distressed but i think that i have got over the worry and i am sure that i have quite got over the distress  then you cannot have cared for him lady greendale said emphatically  that is just the conclusion that i have arrived at myself mamma bertha said calmly i certainly thought that i did and now i feel sure that i was mistaken altogether  lady greendale could say nothing further  i had better send off a note to frank my dear she said plaintively of course you are not thinking of going out sailing after this  indeed i am mamma why shouldnt we of course i am not going to say anything here of what has happened if he chooses to talk about it he can but i dont suppose that he will it is just the end of the season and we need not go back to town at all and next spring everyone will have forgotten all about it you know what people will say i thought that greendale girl was going to marry carthew i suppose nothing has come of it did she refuse him i wonder or did he change his mind and there will be an end of it  the end of the season wipes a sponge over everything people start afresh and as somebody saystennyson isnt it or longfellowthey let the dead past bury its dead  lady greendale lifted her hands in mild despair put on her things and went down to the boat with bertha  i have brought a book mamma the latter said as they went down i shall tell frank about this though i shall tell no one else i always knew that he did not like mr carthew so you can amuse yourself reading while we are talking  you are a curious girl bertha her mother said resignedly i used to think that i understood you now i feel that i dont understand you at all  i dont know that i understand myself mamma but i know enough of myself to see that i am not so wise as i thought i was and somebody says that when you first discover you are a fool it is the first step towards being wise or something of the sort  there is major mallett standing at the landing and there is the gig i think that she is the prettiest boat here  the mainsail was hoisted by the time they reached the side of the yacht and the anchor hove short so that in two or three minutes they were under way  she looks very nice lady greendale said i thought that she would look much worse  you should have seen her yesterday mamma when we passed her with the jagged stumps of the topmast and bowsprit and all her ropes in disorder the sails hanging down in the water and the wreckage alongside i could have cried when i saw her at any rate she looks very neat and trim now  where is the phantom major mallett  she got under way at eleven oclock and has gone up to southampton he replied quietly but with a halfinterrogatory glance towards her  she gave a little nod and took a chair a short distance from that in which lady greendale had seated herself  has he gone for good frank asked as he sat down beside her  of course he has she said you dont suppose after what i told you last night that i was going to accept him  i hoped not he said gravely you cannot tell what a relief it has been to me of course dear you will understand that so long as you were to marry a man who would be likely to make you happy i was content but i could not bear to think of your marrying a man i knew to be altogether unworthy of you  you know very well she said that you never intended to let me marry him as i said to you last night i feel very much aggrieved major mallett you had said you would be my friend and yet you let this go on when you could have stopped it at once you let me get talked about with that man and you would have gone on letting me get still more talked about before you interfered that was not kind or friendly of you  but bertha he remonstrated the fact that we had not been friends and that he had beaten me in a variety of matters was no reason in the world why i should interfere still less why you should not marry him when i was stupid enough to tell you that story years ago i stated that i had no grounds for saying that it was he who played that trick upon my boat and it would have been most unfair on my part to have brought that story up again  quite so but there was the other story  what other story frank asked in great surprise  the story that george lechmere came and told me two days ago she said gravely  george lechmere you dont mean to say  i do mean to say so he behaved like a real friend and came to tell me the story of martha bennett  he told me she went on as he was about to speak that you had made up your mind to tell mamma about it directly you heard that i was engaged to mr carthew that would have been something but would hardly have been fair to me if i had once been engaged to him it would have been very hard to break it off and naturally it would have been much greater pain to me then than it has been now  i felt that but you see bertha until you did accept him i had no right to assume that you would do so at least so i understood it and i did not feel that in my position i was called upon to interfere until i learned that you were really in danger of what i considered wrecking your lifes happiness  i understand that she said gently and i know that you acted for the best but there are other things you have not told me major mallettother things that george lechmere has told me did you think that it would have been of no interest to me to know that you had forgiven the man who tried to take your life and more than that had restored his self respect taken him as your servant treated him as a friend  the tears stood in her eyes now  dont you think frank that was a thing that i might have been interested to knowa thing that would raise you immeasurably in the eyes of a womanthat would show her vastly more of your real character than she could know by meeting you from day to day as a friend  it was his secret and not mine bertha it was known to but him and me never was a man more repentant or more bitterly regretful for a faultthat was in my eyes scarcely a fault at allexcept that he had too rashly assumed me to be the author of the ruin of the girl he loved the poor fellow had been half maddened and was scarce responsible for his actions he had already suffered terribly and the least i could do was to endeavour to restore his self respect by showing him that i had entirely forgiven him any kindness that i have shown him he has repaid tenfold not only by saving my life but in becoming my most sincere and attached friend i promised him that i would tell no one and i have never done so and no one to this day knows it save his father and mother  how then could i tell even you you must see yourself that it was impossible that i could tell you besides the story was of no interest save to him and me and above all as i said it was his secret and not mine  i see that now she said still i am so sorry so very sorry that i did not know it before  you see frank she went on after a pause we women have to make or unmake our lives very much in the dark no one helps us and if we have not a brother to do so we are groping in the dark look at me here was i believing that mr carthew whom i met everywhere in society was except that he kept race horses and bet heavily as good as other men he was very pleasant very good looking generally liked and infinitely more amusing than most men one meets how was i to tell what he really was  on the other hand there were you my dear friend who i knew had shown yourself a very brave soldier and whom also everyone liked and spoke well of but of whose real character i did not know much except on the side that was always presented to me and now i find you capable of what i consider a grand act of generosity  you overrate the matter altogether bertha the man shot me by mistake the fellow he took me for richly deserved shooting when he found it was a mistake the poor fellow was bitterly sorry for it surely there was nothing more to be said about it  the girl sat silent for some time  well it is all cleared up now she said at last there is no reason why we should not be friends as of old  none whatever he said there has been only and he stopped short  only what frank  nothing he said we will be just as we were bertha i will try and be the good elder brother and scold you and look after you and warn you if it should be necessary until you get under other guidance  it will be some time she said quietly before that happens i have had a sharp lesson  and did you really care for him much bertha  i dont think that i really cared for him at all she said that is not the lesson that i was thinking of  he saw the colour mount into her cheeks as she twisted the handkerchief she held into a knot then turning to him she said  frank are you never going to give me a chance again  he could not misunderstand her  do you meancan you mean bertha he said in a low tone do you mean that if i ask you the same question again you will give me a different answer  i did not know then she said i had never thought of it you took me altogether by surprise and what i said i thought was true afterwards i knew that i had been mistaken i hoped that you would ask me again but you did not and i soon felt that you never would you tried hard to be as you were before but you were not the same and i was not the same then i did not seem to care there were three men who wanted me i did not care much which it was but i would not have anyone say that i had married for positioni hated the idea of thatand so i would have taken the third he was bright and pleasant and all that sort of thing and i thought that i could be happy with him until george lechmere opened my eyes then of course that was over but his story showed me still more what a fool i had been what a heart i had thrown away and i said i will at least make an effort to undo the past i will not let my chance of happiness go away from me merely from false pride if he loves me still he will forgive me if not at least i shall not all through my life feel that i might have made it different could i have brought myself to speak a word  i love you as much as ever frank said taking her hand i love you more for speaking as you have i can hardly believe my happiness can it be that you really love me bertha  i think i have proved it frank i do love you i have known it for some time but it seemed all too late it was a grief rather than a pleasure every time you came it was a pain to me for i felt that i had lost you and it was only when i learned two days ago how you could forgive and that at the same time i could free myself from the chain i had allowed to be wound round me and which i dont think i could otherwise have broken that i made up my mind that it should not be my fault if things were not put right between us  now let us tell mother  her hand was still in his and they went across the deck together  mamma she said please put down that book i have a piece of news for you frank and i are going to be married  lady greendale sat for a moment speechless in astonishment she knew that bertha had wished to tell him that she had refused carthews offer but that this would come of it she had never dreamt a year before she had approved of berthas rejection of frank but since then much had happened bertha had shown that she would not marry for position only and that she would be likely to take her own way entirely in the matter and although this was a downfall to the hopes that she had once entertained lady greendale was herself very fond of frank and it was at any rate better than having bertha marry a man of whose real means she was ignorant and who as everyone knew bet heavily on the turf these ideas flashed rapidly through her mind and holding out one hand to each she said  there is no one to whom i could more confidently entrust her happiness frank god bless you both  then she betook herself to her pocket handkerchief for her tears came easily and on this occasion she herself could hardly have said whether they were the result of pleasure in berthas happiness or regret at the downfall of the air castles she had once built  i think bertha our best plan will be to go below now frank suggested quietly  what for bertha asked shyly  the thing had been done she felt radiantly happy but more shocked at her own boldness than she had been when she perpetrated it  well my dear i thought that perhaps you would rather not kiss me in sight of the whole crew and certainly i shant be able to restrain myself much longer  then in that case she said demurely perhaps we had better go below  it was half an hour before they came on deck again  well my dears lady greendale said the more i think of it the better i am pleased as far as i am concerned nothing could be nicer i shall have bertha within a short drive of me and it wont be like losing her  do you know bertha your father said to me once i would give anything if some day frank mallett and our bertha were to take a fancy to each other there is nothing i should like more than to have her settled near us and there is no one i know more likely to make her happy than he would be i am sure dear that you will be glad to know that your engagement would have had his approval as it has mine  bertha bent down and kissed her mother with tears standing in her eyes  it will be a great pleasure to us both to have you so near us frank said earnestly you know that having lost my own mother so long ago i have always looked upon you as more of a mother than anyone else and have always felt almost as much at home in your house as in my own  now let us sit down and talk it over quietly in the first place i propose that on monday when you leave lord haverleys you shall both come here for a time the solent will be very pleasant for the next fortnight and we can then take a fortnights cruise west and if you like land at plymouth and go straight home  i should be very glad lady greendale said at once rejoiced at the thought that she would thus avoid the necessity of answering any questions about bertha and there will be no occasion at all to speak of this at my cousins there might be all sorts of questions asked and expressions of surprise and so on it will be quite time enough to write to our friends after we have been comfortably settled at home for a time we can talk over all that afterwards  yes and i should think lady greendale that it would save the trouble of two letters if while mentioning that bertha is engaged to your neighbour major mallett you could add that the marriage will come off in the course of a few weeks  dont you think so bertha  certainly not she said saucily it will be quite time to talk about that a long time hence  well i will put off talking about it for a short time but you see i have had a years waiting already  very pleasant was the three hours cruise no one gave a thought of the missing topmast and bowsprit there was a nice sailing breeze and clipped as her wings were the osprey was still faster than the majority of the yachts  as soon as the two ladies had been put ashore frank sailed for cowes it was too late when they got there for anything to be done that evening but frank went ashore with the captain and found that the spars were all ready to receive the iron work and sheaves from the old ones and as these had been towed up to the yard to be in readiness messieurs white promised that they would arrange for a few hands to come to work early and that the spars should be brought off by halfpast eight on monday morning  as soon as he had returned in the gig after putting the ladies ashore at ryde frank had called george lechmere to him  it is all right george thanks to your interview with miss greendale it was a bold step to take but it was the best possible thing and succeeded splendidly and everything is to be as i wish it  i am glad indeed to hear it major and i hoped that you would have something of the sort to tell me there was a look about you both that i took to mean that things were going on well  yes george at first when she told me that you had told her about that affair at delhi i felt that there was really no occasion for you to have said anything about it but it did me a great deal of good she made much more of it than there was any occasion for but you know when women are inclined to take a pleasant view of a thing they will magnify molehills into mountains  i thought that it would do good major i dont mean that it would do you any good but that it would do good generally i had to tell the other story and that came naturally with it and at any rate she could not but see that there was a deal of difference between the nature of the man who had been so good to me and that of that scoundrel  that is just the effect it did have well dont say anything about it forward at present the men shall be told later on  by one oclock on monday the osprey was back at ryde and at two oclock the dinghy went ashore with the mate and two of the hands who waited a quarter of an hour till a vehicle brought down the ladies luggage soon afterwards frank went ashore in the gig and brought lady greendale and bertha off  as they went down to their cabin bertha looking into the saloon saw george lechmere preparing the tea tray to bring it up on deck she at once went to him  i did not thank you before she said holding out her hand but i thank you now and shall thank you all my life you did me the greatest service  i am glad indeed miss greendale that it was so for i know that the major would never have been a happy man if this had not come about  for the next fortnight the osprey was cruising along the coast getting as far as torquay and returning to cowes frank did not enter her for any of the races lady greendale although a fair sailor grew nervous when the yacht heeled over far and even bertha did not care for racing the memory of the last race being too fresh in her mind for her to wish to take part in another for the present    chapter 11  that is an uncommonly pretty trading schooner bertha frank mallett said as he rose from his chair to get a better look at a craft that was passing along to the eastward i suppose she must be in the fruit trade and must just have arrived from the levant i should not be surprised if she had been a yacht at one time she is not carrying much sail but she is going along fast i think they would have done better if they had rigged her as a foreandaft schooner instead of putting those heavy yards on the foremast that broad band of white round her spoils her appearance her jib boom is unusually long and she must carry a tremendous spread of canvas in light winds i should think that she must be full up to the hatches for she is very low in the water for a trader  the osprey was lying in the outside tier of yachts off cowes the party that had been on board her for the regatta had broken up a week before and only lady greendale and bertha remained on board the former had not been well for some days and had had her maid down from town as soon as the cabins were empty it had been proposed indeed that she and bertha should return to town but being unwilling to cut short the girls pleasure she said that she should do better on board than in london and moreover she did not feel equal to travelling she was attended by a doctor in cowes and the osprey only took short sails each day generally down to the needles and back or out to the nab  yes she is a nicelooking boat bertha agreed and if her sails were white and her ropes neat and trim she would look like a yacht except for those big yards  her skipper must be a lubber to have the ropes hanging about like that of course he may have had bad weather in crossing the bay but if he had any pride in the craft he might at least have got her into a good deal better trim while coming in from the needles still all that could be remedied in an hours work and certainly she is as pretty a trader as ever i saw how did your mother seem this afternoon bertha  about the same i think i dont feel at all anxious about her because i have often seen her like this before i think really frank that she is quite well enough to go up to town but she knows that i am enjoying myself so much that she does not like to take me away i have no doubt that she will find herself better by saturday when you know we arranged some time back that we would go up you wont be long before you come will you  certainly not directly you have landed i shall take the osprey to gosport and lay her up there i need not stop to see that done i can trust hawkins to see her stripped and everything taken on shore and of course the people at the yard are responsible for hauling her up i shall probably be in town the same evening but if you like and think that your mother is only stopping for you we will go across to southampton at once  oh no i am sure that she would not like that and i dont want to lose my last three days here of course when we get home at the end of next week and you are settled down there too you will be a great deal over at greendale but it wont be as it is here  not by a long way however we shall be able to look forward to the spring bertha when i shall have you all to myself on board and we shall go on a long cruise together though i do think that it is ridiculous that i should have to wait until then  not at all ridiculous sir you say that you are perfectly happyand everyone says that an engagement is the happiest time in ones lifeand besides it is partly your own fault you have made me so fond of the osprey that i have quite made up my mind that nothing could possibly be so nice as to spend our honeymoon on board her and to go where we like and to do as we like without being bothered by meeting people one does not care for and besides if you should get tired of my company we might ask jack harley and amy to come to us for a month or so  i dont think that it will be necessary for us to do that he laughed starting as we shall in the middle of march we shant find it too hot in the mediterranean before we turn our head homewards and i think we shall find plenty to amuse us between gibraltar and jaffa  no three months wont be too much frank tomorrow is the dinner at the clubhouse isnt it  yes i should be sorry to miss that for having only been just elected a member of the squadron i should like to put in an appearance at the first set dinner  of course frank i certainly should not like you to miss it  the next evening frank went ashore to dine at the club an hour and a half later a yachts boat came off  i have a note for miss greendale the man in the stern said as she came alongside i am to give it to her myself  bertha was summoned and much surprised came on deck  the man handed up the note to her she took it into the companion where a light was burning her name and that of the yacht were in straggling handwriting that she scarcely recognised as franks  she tore it open  my darling i have had a nasty accident having been knocked down just as i landed i am at present at dr maddisons i wish you would come ashore at once it is nothing very serious but if you did not see me you might think that it was dont agitate your mother but bring anna with you the boat that brings this note will take you ashore  bertha gave a little gasp and then summoning up her courage ran down into the cabin  mamma dear you must spare me and anna for half an hour i have just had a note from frank he has been knocked down and hurt he says that it is nothing very serious and he only writes to me to come ashore so that i can assure myself i wont stop more than a quarter of an hour if i find that he is worse than i expect i will send anna off to you with a message  scarcely listening to what her mother said in reply she ran into her cabin told anna to put on her hat and shawl to go ashore with her and in a minute descended to the boat with her maid it was a fouroared gig and the helmsman had taken his place in the stern behind them  bertha sat cold and still without speaking she was sure that frank must be more seriously hurt than he had said or he would have had himself taken off to the yacht instead of to the surgeons the shaky and almost illegible handwriting showed the difficulty he must have had in holding the pencil  the boat made its way through the fleet till it reached the shallow water which they had to cross on their way to the shore here with the exception of a few small craft the water was clear of yachts  suddenly the long line of lights along the shore disappeared and something thick heavy and soft fell over berthas head an arm was thrown round her and anna pressed tightly against her in vain she struggled there was a faint strange smell and she lost consciousness  an hour passed without her return to the yacht and lady greendale began to fear that she had found frank too ill to leave and had forgotten to send anna back with the message at last she touched the bell  will you tell the captain that i want to speak to him  captain she said i am much alarmed about major mallett that boat that came off here an hour ago brought a note for my daughter saying that he had been hurt and she went ashore with her maid to see him she said that she would be back in a short time and that if she found that he was badly hurt she would send her maid back with a message to me she has been gone for more than an hour and i wish you would take a boat and go ashore find out how the major is and bring me back word at once he is at dr maddisons you know the house  the skipper hurried away with a serious face a little more than a minute after he had left the cabin lady greendale heard the rattle of the blocks of the falls the boat was little more than half an hour away lady greendale in her anxiety had told the steward to let her know when it was coming alongside and went up on deck to get the news as quickly as possible  it is a rum affair altogether my lady hawkins said as he stepped on deck i went to the doctors and he has seen nothing whatever of the major and miss greendale and her maid have not been to his house at all  lady greendale stood for a moment speechless with surprise and consternation  this is most extraordinary she said at last what can it mean you are sure that there is no mistake captain it was to dr maddisons house she went  yes my lady there aint no mistake about that i have been there to fetch medicine for you two or three times besides i saw the doctor myself  major mallett must have been taken to some other doctors she said and must have made a mistake and put in the name of dr maddison his house is some little distance from the club there may be another doctors nearer what is to be done  i am sure i do not know my lady the captain said in perplexity  where can my daughter and her maid be lady greendale went on they went ashore to go to dr maddisons  perhaps my lady they might have heard as they went ashore that the major was somewhere else or some messenger might have been waiting at the landing stage to take them there direct  that must be it i suppose but it is all very strange i think the best thing captain will be for you to go to the club they are sure to know there about the accident and where he is you see the landing stage is close to the club and he might have been just going in when he was knocked downby a carriage i suppose  like enough he is at the club still my lady at any rate i will go there in the first place and find out there is sure to be a crowd about the gates listening to the musicthey have got a band over from newportso that if they do not know anything at the club there are sure to be some people outside who saw the accident and will know where the major was taken anyhow i wont come back without news  even to lady greendale anxious and alarmed as she was it did not seem long before the steward came down with the news that the boat was just alongside this time she was too agitated to go up she heard someone come running down the companion and a moment later to her astonishment frank mallett himself came in he looked pale and excited  what is all this lady greendale he exclaimed the skipper tells me that a letter came here saying that i had been hurt and taken to dr maddisons and that bertha and her maid went off at once and have not returned though it is more than two hours since they went i have not been hurt i wrote no letter to bertha but was at dinner at the club when the skipper came for me what is it all about  i dont know frank i cannot even think lady greendale said in an agitated voice what can it all mean and where can bertha be and she burst into tears  i dont know i cant think frank said slowly  he stood silent for a minute or two and then went on  i cannot suggest anything i will go ashore at once the waterman at our landing stage must have noticed if two ladies got out there he could hardly have helped doing so for it would be curious their coming ashore alone after dark then i will go to the other landing places and ask there there are always boys hanging about to earn a few pence by taking care of boats i will be back as soon as i can  the boat was still alongside and the men stretched to their oars th a very few minutes they were at the club landing stage the waterman here declared that no ladies whatever unaccompanied by gentlemen had landed after dark  i must have seen them sir he said for you see i go down to help out every party that arrives here they must have gone to one of the other landing places  but at neither of these could he obtain any information there were several boys at each of them who had been there for hours and they were unanimous in declaring that no ladies had landed there after dark at all he then walked up and down between the watch house and the club  he had when he landed intended to go to the police office as soon as he had inquired at the landing stagesthe natural impulse of an englishman who has suffered loss or wrongbut the more he thought it over the more inexpedient did such a course seem to him it was highly improbableindeed it seemed to him impossiblethat they could do more than he had in the matter the passage of two ladies through the crowded streets would scarcely have attracted the attention of anyone and any idea of violence being used was out of the question if they had landed which he now regarded as very improbable they must have at least gone willingly to the place where they believed they should find him and unless every house in cowes was searched from top to bottom there was no chance of finding them carefully hidden away as they would be he could not see therefore that the police could at present be of any utility whatever it might be necessary finally to obtain the aid of the police but in that case it was scotland yard and not cowes that the matter must be laid before and even this should be only a last resort for above all things it was necessary for berthas sake that the matter should be kept a profound secret and once in the hands of the police it would be in all the papers the next day if the aid of detectives was to be called in it would be far better to put it into the hands of a private detective  having made up his mind upon this point he returned to the yacht  i am sorry to say that i have no news he said to lady greendale who was lying on the couch worn out with weeping i have ascertained almost beyond doubt that they did not land at the club stage or either of the other two landing places  what can it be she sobbed what can have become of them  i am afraid there is little doubt that they have been carried off he replied i can see no other possible solution of it  but who can have done such a thing  ah that is another matter i have been thinking it over and over and there is only one man that i know capable of such a dastardly action at present i wont mention his name even to you but i will soon be on his track do not give way lady greendale even he is not capable of injuring her and no doubt she will be restored to you safe and sound but we shall need patience ah there is a boat coming alongside  he ran up on deck it proved however to be only a shore boat bringing off george lechmere who having met a comrade in the town had asked leave to spend the evening with him he was of course ignorant of all that had happened since he had left and frank told him  i have no doubt whatever that she has been carried off he said and there is only one man who could have done it  that villain carthew george lechmere exclaimed  yes he is the man i suspect george i heard this evening that he had been hit tremendously hard on the turf at goodwood he would think that if he could force miss greendale to marry him it would retrieve his fortune and would moreover satisfy his vindictive spirit for the manner in which she had rejected him and in addition give him another triumph over me  that is it sir i have no doubt that that is it but his yacht is not hereat least i have not seen her  no i am sure that she is not here but i believe for all that that miss greendale must have been taken on board a yacht they never would have dared to land her in cowes of course i made inquiries as a matter of form at the landing places but as she knew the way to dr maddisons and as the streets were full of people at the time she landed they could never have attempted to use violence especially as she had her maid with her on the other hand it would have been comparatively easy to manage it in the case of a yacht they had but to row alongside to seize and gag them before they had time to utter a cry and then to carry them below the phantom is not hereat any rate was not here this afternoon but there is no reason why carthew should not have chartered a yacht for the purpose ask the skipper to come aft  captain he said when hawkins came aft what men went ashore this afternoon  harris and williams and marvel sir they went ashore in the dinghy and harris went to the doctors for that medicine  ask them to come here  did anyone speak to you harris he went on as the three men came aft while you were ashore todayi mean anyone that you did not know  no sir the man said promptly leastwise the only chap that spoke to me was a gent as was standing on the steps by the watch house as i went down to the boat and he only says to me i noticed you go in to dr maddisons my man there is nothing the matter with my friend major mallett i hope  no sir says i he is all right i was just getting a bottle of medicine for an old lady on board  that was all that passed between us  thank you harris that is just what i wanted to know  after the men had gone forward again he said to the captain  i have a strong conviction hawkins indeed i am almost certain that miss greendale has been carried off to one of the yachts here but whether it is a large one or a small one i have not the slightest idea the question is what is to be done it is past eleven now and it is impossible to go round the fleet and make enquiries besides the craft may have made off already they would have been sure to have placed her in the outside tier so as to get up anchor as soon as they had miss greendale on board  we might get out the boats sir and lie off and see if any yachts set sail the skipper suggested  that would be of no use hawkins you could not stop them even if you hailed to know what yacht it was they might give you a false name  one thing i have been thinking of that can be done i wish in the first place that you would ask all the men if anyone has noticed among the yacht sailors in the streets one with the name of the phantom on his jersey some of them may have been paid off for she has not been raced since ryde in any case i want two of the men to go ashore the first thing in the morning and hang about all day if necessary in hopes of finding one of the phantoms crew if they do find one bring him off at once and tell him that he will be well paid for his trouble  by the way you may as well ask harris what the gentleman was like who spoke to him at the landing place  he walked slowly backwards and forwards with george lechmere without exchanging a word until in five minutes hawkins returned  it was a cleanshaven man who spoke to harris sir he judged him to be about forty he wore a sort of yachting dress and he was rather short and thin about the other matter rawlins says that he noticed when he was ashore yesterday two of the phantoms men strolling about being a cowes man himself he knew them both but as they were not alone he just passed the time of day and went on without stopping  does he know where they live i dont think it at all likely they would be on leave now or that he would find either of them at home tomorrow morning but it is possible that he might do so at any rate it is worth trying it is curious that two of them should be here when we have seen nothing of the phantom since the race for the cup unless of course her owner has laid her up which is hardly likely if she had been anywhere about here she would have entered for the race yesterday  i will send rawlins and one of the other cowes men ashore at six oclock major if they dont meet the men they are safe to be able to find out where they live  and tell them and the others hawkins that on no account whatever is a word to be said on shore as to the disappearance of miss greendale it is of great importance that no one should obtain the slightest hint of what has taken place  when the captain had again gone forward frank went down and with some difficulty persuaded lady greendale to go to bed  we can do nothing more tonight he said you may well imagine that if i saw the least chance of doing any good i should not be standing here but nothing can be done till morning  having seen her to her stateroom he returned to the deck where he had told george lechmere to wait for him  it is enough to drive one mad george he said as he joined him to think that somewhere among all those yachts miss greendale may be held a prisoner  i can quite understand that major by what i feel myself i have seen so much of miss greendale and she has always been so kind to me knowing that you considered that i had saved your life and knowing about that other thing that i feel as if i could do anything for her and i feel it all the more because it is the scoundrel i owed such a deep debt to before but i hardly think that she can be on board one of the yachts here  i feel convinced that she is not george they could hardly keep her gagged all this time and at night a scream would be heard though the skylights were closed  no sir if she was put on board here i feel sure that they would have got up sail at once  that is just what i feel likely enough they had the mainsail already up and the chain short and directly the boat was up at the davits they would have got up the anchor and been off they may be twenty miles away by this time though whether east or west one has no means of even guessing the wind is nearly due north and they may have gone either way or have made for cherbourg or havre it depends partly upon her size if she is a small craft they cant get far beyond that range if she is a large one she may have gone anywhere the worst of it is that unless we can get some clue as to her size we can do absolutely nothing a good many yachts went off today both east and west and by the end of the week the whole fleet will be scattered and even if we do get the size of the yacht i dont see that we can do anything unless we can get her name too  if we could do that we could act at once i should run up to town lay the case before the authorities at scotland yard and get them to telegraph to every port in the kingdom that upon her putting in there the vessel was at once to be searched for two ladies who were believed to have been forcibly carried away in her  and have those on board arrested i suppose major  well that would have to be thought over george carthew could not be brought to punishment without the whole affair being made public that is the thing above all others to be avoided  yes i see that sir and yet it seems hard that he should go off unpunished again  he would not go unpunished you may be sure frank said grimly for if the fellow ever showed his face in london again i would thrash him to within an inch of his life however sure as i feel it is possible that i am mistaken miss greendale is known to be an only daughter and an heiress and some other impecunious scamp may have conceived the idea of making a bold stroke for her fortune it is not likely but it is possible  until morning broke the two men paced the deck together scarcely a word was spoken frank was in vain endeavouring to think what course had best be taken if the search for the men of the phantom turned out unavailing george was brooding over the old wrong he had suffered and longing to avenge that and the present one  thank god the night is over frank said at last and i have thoroughly tired myself i have thought until i am stupid now i will lie down on one of the sofas and perhaps i may forget it all for a few hours  sleep however did not come to him and at seven oclock he was on deck again  the men went ashore at six sir the skipper said i expect they will be back again before long  ten minutes later the dinghy came out between two yachts ahead  rawlins is not on board the skipper said as they came close i told him to send off the instant they got any news whatever that is simpson in the stern  well simpson what news frank asked as she rowed alongside  well sir we have found out as how all the phantoms crew are ashore some of the chaps told us that they came back a fortnight ago the crew having been paid off rawlins said that id better come off and tell you that he has gone off to look one of them up and bring him off in a shore boat he knows where he lives and i expect we shall have him alongside in a few minutes  do you think that is good news or bad sir george lechmere asked  i think that it is bad rather than good frank said before it seemed to me that whatever the craft was in which she was carried away she would probably be transferred to the phantom which might be lying in portland or in dover or be cruising outside the island and if i had heard nothing of the phantom i should have searched for her however i suppose that the scoundrel thought that he could not trust a crew of cowes men to take part in a business like this but we shall know more when rawlins comes off  in half an hour the shore boat came alongside with rawlins and a sailor with a phantom jersey on  so you have all been paid off my lad frank said to the sailor as he stepped on deck  yes sir it all came sudden like we had expected that she would be out for another month at least however as each man got a months pay we had nothing to grumble about although it did seem strange that even the skipper should not have had a hint of what mr carthew intended till he called him into his cabin and paid him his money  and where is she laid up  well sir she is at ostend i dont know whether she is going to be hauled up there or only dismantled and left to float in the dock the governor told the skipper that he thought he might go to the mediterranean in december but that till then he should not be able to use her it seemed a rum thing leaving her out there instead of having her hauled up at southampton or gosport and specially that he should not have kept two or three of us on board in charge but of course that was his affair mr carthew is rather a difficult gentleman to please and very changeablelike we had all made sure that we were going to race here after winning the cup at ryde and indeed after the race he said as much to the skipper  has he anyone with him frank asked  only one gentleman sir i dont know what his name was  what was he like  he was a smallish man and thin and didnt wear no hair on his face  thank you here is a sovereign for your trouble  that is something at any rate george he went on as the man was rowed away the whole proceeding is a very strange one and you see the description of the man with carthew exactly answers to that of the man who found out from the boats crew that dr maddison was attending lady greendale and now you see that it is quite possible that the phantom is somewhere near or was somewhere near yesterday afternoon carthew may have hired a foreign crew and sailed in her a couple of days after her own crew came over or he may have hired another craft either abroad or here at any rate there is something to do i will go up to town by the midday train and then down to dover and cross to ostend tonight  begging your pardon major could not you telegraph to the harbour master at ostend asking if the phantom is there  i might do that george but if i go over there i may pick up some clue i may find out what hotel he stopped at after the crew had left and if so whether he crossed to england or left by a train for france there is no saying what information i may light on you stay on board here you can be of no use to me on the journey and may be of use here i will telegraph to you from ostend possibly i may want the yacht to sail at once to dover to meet me there or you may have to go up to town to do something for me  now i must go down and tell lady greendale as much as is necessary it will of course be the best thing for her to go up to town with me but if she is not well enough for that of course she must stay on board  lady greendale had just come into the saloon when he went down  i think i have got a cluea very faint one he said i am going up to town at once to follow it up how are you feeling lady greendale  i have a terrible headache but that is nothing of course i will go up with you  but do you feel equal to it  oh yes quite she said feverishly what is your clue frank  well it concerns the yacht in which i believe bertha has been carried off at any rate i feel so certain as to who had a hand in it that i have no hesitation in telling you that it was carthew  mr carthew impossible frank he always seemed to me a particularly pleasant and gentlemanly man  he might seem that but i happen to know other things about him he is an unmitigated scoundrel of course not a word must be said about it lady greendale you see that for berthas sake we must work quietly it would never do for the matter to get into the papers  it would be too dreadful frank i do think that it would kill me i will trust it in your hands altogether i have only one comfort in this dreadful affair and that is that bertha has anna with her  that is certainly a great comfort and it is something in the mans favour that when he enticed her from the yacht with that forged letter he suggested that she should bring her maid    chapter 12  frank mallet and lady greendale crossed to southampton by the twelve oclock boat and arrived in london at three  i have been thinking she said as they went up that it will be better for me to stop in town i shall have less difficulty in answering questions there than i should have at home everyone is leaving now and in another week there will be scarcely a soul in london i know and i shall keep down the front blinds and no one will dream of my being there i shall only have to mention to berthas own maid that my daughter has remained at cowes that i have left anna with her and that she can wait upon me until she returns there will be another advantage in ityou can see me whenever you are in town i shall get your letters a post quicker when you are away and you can telegraph to me freely whereas if you telegraphed to chippenham whoever received the message there might mention its contents as curious to someone or other and then of course it would become a matter of common gossip  frank agreed that it would certainly be better and more bearable than having to answer questions about bertha to every visitor who called on her he crossed that evening to ostend and at ten oclock next morning george lechmere received the following message  make inquiries as to small brigantine that looked like converted yacht had very large yards on foremast i saw her pass cowes on tuesday afternoon let hawkins go to portsmouth and southampton find out yourself whether she anchored between osborne and ryde if not inquire at seaview whether she passed there going east telegraph result tomorrow morning to my chambers shall cross again tonight  lechmere had the gig at once lowered and started with four hands at the oars eastward while the captain went ashore in the dinghy to leave for southampton by the next boat the tide was against lechmere who keeping close in round the point steered the boat along at the foot of the slopes of osborne and kept eastward until he reached the coastguard station at the mouth of wootton creek  oh yes we noticed her the boatswain in charge replied in answer to his question we saw her as you say on tuesday afternoon going east we could not help noticing her for she was something out of the way we should not have thought so much of it if she had not come back again just before dusk the next day and anchored a mile to the west we kept a sharp lookout that night thinking that she might be trying to smuggle some contraband ashore but everything was quiet and next morning she was gone the man who was on the watch said he thought that he made her out with his night glass going east at about eleven oclock but it was a dark night and it might have been a schooner yacht or a brig  you dont happen to know whether she stopped at ryde the first time she passed  yes having been all talking about her we watched to see if she was going to anchor there or keep on to the east she lowered a boat as she passed and two men landed they threw her up into the wind and waited until the boat came off again the men did not come back in her they hoisted the boat up again and went east she stopped off seaview then she came back and sent the boat ashore and two men went off in her of course i cant say whether they were the same it was as much as i could do to make out that there were two of them though our glass is a pretty good one is there anything wrong about the craft  not that i know of but there was a good deal of curiosity about her among the yachts she being an outoftheway sort of craft and i fancy there were some bets about her there was an idea that she was seen going west two days later and the governor asked me to take the boat and find out whether she had been noticed here or at ryde thank you very much for your information i have no doubt that it will be sufficient to decide any bets there may be about her  so saying he took his seat in the gig again and rowed back to the osprey the skipper returned in the evening  no such craft has gone into southampton or portsmouth he said so i have had my journey for nothing  no i dont think you have george replied it is something to know that she is not in either of the ports now and has been to neither of them  george returned in time to send off a full account of what he had learned from the coastguardsman by the mail that would be delivered in london that night on his return to town the next morning frank found the letter awaiting him and at ten oclock after wiring to hawkins and the steward to stock the yacht at once with provisions of all kinds for a long voyage he went into the city and called upon the secretary at lloyds  after giving his name he told him that he believed that a young lady had been carried off forcibly in the craft which he minutely described and that he was desirous of having a telegram sent to every signal station between hull and the lands end asking if such a craft had passed  of course he added i am ready to defray the expense of the telegrams and replies she left the solent late on wednesday evening and on thursday would have been between beachy head and dover if she had gone that way and yesterday up the thames or somewhere between harwich and yarmouth  well major mallett if you will sit down and write the telegram with the description that you have given i will send it off at once then if you will call again in an hours time i have no doubt all the answers will have come in  your craft has gone west he said when frank returned all the answers the other way are negative saint catherine says craft answering description was seen well out at sea on thursday morning portland noticed her in the afternoon and she was off the start yesterday morning the wind was light then and the lizard reports seeing her this morning when abreast of them she headed south apparently making a departure as she could be made out keeping that course as long as seen these are the four telegrams so i think that there can be little doubt that she has made for the mediterranean  thank you very much indeed frank said can you tell me if i have any chance of getting similar information from the south  you could get it from finisterre if she passed within sight but by her holding on as far west as the lizard instead of taking a departure from the start it is likely that she will take a more westerly course and then cape st vincent is the first point where she is likely to be noticed if not there she would probably be observed at tarifa although if she kept on the southern side of the straits she might not be noticed i should think that she would do so she would not be likely to put into gibraltar although from what you tell me the owner would believe that no suspicion whatever of being concerned in this affair would be likely to rest upon him but you must bear in mind that it is probable that as a measure of precaution he has painted out the white streak sent down the yards and converted her into a foreandaft schooner in which case she would attract no attention whatever if she passed without making her number  i certainly think that they will convert her back into a schooner yacht as otherwise there will be a difficulty about papers whenever she enters a port there is one more thing i wish to ask you you see she might not turn into the mediterranean she might for example make for the west indies in which case she would be almost certain to touch at madeira or palmas  or possibly at teneriffe major of course we have an agent at each of these places and i will gladly request them if a brigantine or schooner looking like her puts in there to find out if possible where she is bound for and to let you know atshall i say gibraltar i am afraid it is of no use trying to get the portuguese authorities to arrest the ship or to search her you see to a certain extent it is an extradition case still i will ask them to get it done if possible though i fear that it is quite beyond their power  thank you very much indeed it would be an immense thing only to find out that she has gone in that direction of course she may not put in at any of these places as she is sure to have provisioned for a long voyage but at any rate i will wait at gibraltar until i get the letters unless i can get some clue that she has gone up the mediterranean  of course if i dont hear of her at cape saint vincent or tarifa i shall try ceuta and tangier if she goes up on the southern side of the straits she may anchor off either and send a boat in to get fresh meat and fruit  the royal mail and the mail down the african coast will start one tomorrow the other on monday and i will send letters by them to the islands they are sure to get there before this craft that you are in search of and our agents will be on the lookout for her it may not be long before you hear from madeira but it may be some time before you get the other letters as the craft may be anything between three weeks and five in getting there of course i shall mention when she sailed and they will not write until all chance of her having arrived is passed  would you kindly give me the addresses of your three agents i will wait for the answer from madeira but i am afraid my patience will never hold out until the others can come it will be giving the schooner a fearfully long start as it is and as you may suppose i shall be almost mad at having to wait and do nothing  the secretary wrote the three addresses and thanking him very warmly for his kindness and courtesy frank went out and despatched a telegram to the skipper telling him to engage ten extra hands at once and to buy muskets and cutlasses for the whole crew  i shall come down by the twelve oclock train from town be at the steamboat pier to meet me if all is ready shall sail at once  having despatched this he drove at once to lady greendales and told her that he had learnt that the craft in which bertha had been carried off had sailed for the south probably the mediterranean and that he should start that evening in pursuit  it may be a long chase lady greendale but never fear but that i will bring her back safely it will be for you to decide whether you will continue to remain here or go down into the country after a time but of course there is no occasion for you to make up your mind now i must be off at once for i have several things to do before i catch the twelve oclock train  god bless you frank she said you are looking terribly worn and fagged  i shall be all right when i am once fairly off he said i have not had an hours sleep for the last two nights and not much the night before at first the whole thing seemed hopeless now that i am fairly on the track and know what i have to do i shall soon be all right again  i dont know what i should have done without you frank and i do believe that you will succeed  i have no doubt about it he said so keep your courage up motherfor you know that you are almost that to me now  he kissed her affectionately and then hurried downstairs and drove to his chambers  here he packed a portmanteau with indian suits and underclothing took his pistol and rifle cases drove to a gunmakers in the strand for a stock of ammunition called at his bank and cashed a cheque for two thousand pounds and then drove to waterloo  hawkins and george lechmere were on the landing stage at cowes  how are things going on hawkins frank asked as he came across the gangway  all right sir i have had my hands pretty full sir since i got your second telegram lechmere saw to getting the arms of course he could not help me as to hiring the hands i think i have got ten firstclass men a few of the yachts have paid off already and i know something about all of those i have engaged while i was ashore the mate looked after getting on board and stowing the goods as they came alongside  quite right hawkins did you think of ammunition george  yes major i was not likely to forget that i got twentyfive muskets and cutlasses luckily they kept them at pascal aikeys for the use of steam yachts going out to the east and they had ammunition too so i got fifty rounds for each musket it is not likely that we shall want to use that much but it is best to be on the right side  i think sir hawkins said as it is going to be a long voyage and as we have doubled our crew that i had better get another mate purvis is a very good man but he is no navigator and we shall have to keep watches regularly i met an old shipmate of mine just now who would be just the man he commanded the amphitrite for ten years and i know that he is a good navigator he has been up in the scotch waters since the spring and was paid off last week i told him that it might be that i could give him a berth as second mate and he jumped at it  by all means hawkins of course you will want an officer for each watch you can find him without loss of time i hope  yes sir i have told him to hang about outside the gate here and i would give him an answer  very well when you have seen him you will find me at aikeys i have to go there to get a lot of charts i have only those for british waters  george do you see to getting these traps down to the boat i shall be there in a quarter of an hour is there anything else that you can think of or that you want yourself  nothing sir  when you go on board you may as well get your traps in one of the spare cabins aft  you had better move too captain you and one of the mates can have the stern cabin for the present the other mate can have yours and the steward can sleep in the saloon that will make more room for the extra hands forward  it will be a tight stow sir the captain said i have ordered ten more hammocks and hooks but i doubt whether there will be room to sling them all  i am sure there wont hawkins you had better put the hooks in the saloon beams and swing five or six of the hammocks there we can take the hooks out and stop up the holes when we dont need them any longer we may be having hot weather before we have done and i dont want the men crowded too closely forward  twenty minutes later frank came down to the boat with the skipper carrying a large roll of charts and a man with a handcart containing a bundle of jerseys and caps and fifty white duck trousers a large shore boat was alongside when they reached the osprey  is this the last lot the captain asked the man in charge of the pile of casks and boxes with which it was filled  yes sir this is the last batch  get them on deck hawkins frank said and we can get them down and stowed when we are under sail get the anchor short at once the sail covers off and the mainsail up  i dont want to lose a minute he went on turning to george lechmere i know that an hour or even a day will make no material difference but i am in a fever to be off  have you found out which way they have gone major  i have found out that they have sailed for the south but whether for the mediterranean or for the west indies or south america i have no idea but i have some hopes of finding out by the time we get to gibraltar  and they have got a three days start of us  yes i can hardly believe that it is not more it seems to me a fortnight since i went ashore to dine at the club three days is a long start and unless the change of rig has spoiled her the phantom is as fast or very nearly as fast as we are we cant hope to catch her up unless she stops for two or three days in a port and that she is certain not to do no i dont think that there is any chance of our overtaking her until she has got to whatever may be her destination of course what carthew counts upon is that in time he will get miss greendale to consent to marry him that is one reason why i think that he will not go up the mediterranean the further he takes her the more hopeless the prospect will seem to her  but she will never give in major george lechmere said confidently  i have no fear of thatno fear whatever and we may be quite sure that as long as he thinks that he will be able to tire her out he will show himself in his best light and try to make everything as pleasant for her as is possible under the circumstances it is only when he loses all hope of her consenting willingly that he will show himself in his true light and you know george he is scoundrel enough for anything however i consider that she is perfectly safe for a long time and i hope to be alongside the craft long before he becomes desperate  half an hour later the anchor was on the rail and the osprey started on her voyage the tide being in her favour she passed the needles just as it was getting dark the breeze fell very light and although every stitch of canvas was put on she was still some miles east of portland when morning broke as the sun rose the wind freshened a bit and she moved faster through the water the hands were mustered and divided into two watches and the jerseys and red caps served out to the new hands  you had better give them the whole of the duck trousers to fit themselves from captain frank said there are assorted sizes you know and when they have suited themselves you can take the other ten pairs into store you and the mates will want some when we get into warmer climates  are we bound for the mediterranean hawkins asked  to gibraltar to begin with what we shall do afterwards will depend upon what news i get there we may have to go round the world for all i know  well sir i hope not for your sake and the young ladys but as far as we are concerned we would as lief go round the world as anything else though she is not a very big craft for such a journey as that  how long will the water tanks hold out  that is where the pinch will come in sir i reckon that at ordinary times we might make shift to go on for three weeks without filling up but you see we have twenty hands instead of ten and that will make all the difference i did get ten goodsized casks yesterday morning and got them filled as well as the tanks they are stowed away forward but they wont improve her speed they have brought her head down over two inches but of course we shall use the water in them first  you had better bring them amidships captain and stow them round the saloon skylight appearances are of no consequence whatever and the great thing is to get her in her best sailing trim if bad weather comes on we must put half in the bow and half in the stern where we can wedge them in tightly together it would not do to risk having them rolling about the decks  well then he went on seeing that the captain did not like the thought of having weight at each end of the yacht if the weather gets bad we will take the saloon skylight off and lower them down into it i can eat my meals on deck or in my stateroom but the water we must keep if we get a spell of head winds or calms we may be three weeks getting to gib  that would be a very good plan sir if you can do without the saloon and dont mind its being littered up  well i hope we shant get any bad weather until we get well across the bay hawkins i dont mind the discomfort but it would stop her speed we want a wind that will just let us carry all our canvas we can travel a deal faster so than we can in heavy weather when we might be obliged to get down the greater part of our canvas and perhaps to lie to  it looks like a strong crew doesnt it he went on as he glanced forward  that it does sir a craft of this size can do well with more when she is racing but for a crew it is more than one wants a good deal and people would stare if we went into an english port still i dont say that it is not an advantage to be stronghanded if we get heavy weather and it makes light work of getting up sail or shifting it and one wants to shift pretty often when he is trying to get high speed out of a craft  the wind continued fitful and in spite of having her racing sails the ospreys run to the start was a long one it was not until thirtysix hours after getting up anchor that they were abreast of the lighthouse  i try to be patient george mallett said but it is enough to make a saint swear we have lost eight or ten hours instead of making a gain although we had the advantage of coming through the needles passage while they had to go round at the back of the island to escape observation  yes sir but you know we have often found that sometimes one sometimes another makes a gain in these shifty winds perhaps tomorrow we may be running along fast and the phantom be lying without a breath of wind  that is so george i will try to bear it in mind there you see the skipper is taking the exact bearing of the lighthouse and we shall soon be heading south  in five minutes the captain gave the order to the helmsman and the craft was then laid on her new course  the wind is northing a bit the skipper said as after giving the helmsman instructions he came up to frank it has shifted two points round in the last half hour and you see we have got the boom off a bit if it goes round a point more we will get the squaresail ready for hoisting it will help her along rarely when the headsails cease to be of any good  half an hour later the wind had gone round far enough for the squaresail to be used to advantage and it was accordingly hoisted the captain then had the barrels brought aft and ranged along each side of the bulwark  for eightandforty hours the osprey maintained her speed leaving all the sailing vessels she overtook far behind her and keeping for hours abreast of a cargo steamer going in the same direction  she is bound for finisterre the skipper said and we shall pass it some thirty miles to the west so our courses will gradually draw apart but we shall see her smoke anyhow until we are pretty nigh abreast of the capethat is if the wind holds as it is now it is falling lighter this afternoon  two or three hours later the wind died away altogether the squaresail was got down and the skipper then said  i will get the topsail down too sir we can easily get it up again and i will put a smaller jib on her i dont at all think by the look of the sky that we are going to have a blow the glass would have altered more if we were but one never can tell i would not risk the loss of a spar for anything  i should think that you might put a couple of reefs in the mainsail hawkins  well perhaps it would be the best sir for a puff that one thinks nothing of one way or the other when a craft has way will take her over wonderfully when it catches her becalmed  just as he had finished his dinner the captain came down and asked frank to come on deck  there is a steamer bearing down on us i can see both her side lights and as she is coming in from the west she may not notice our starboard light it is burning all right but one never can see these green lights they are the deceivingest things at a distance i have just sent down for the man to bring up the riding light and as it is a firstrate one if we put it on deck it will light up the mainsail i have told them to bring up the big horn that ought to waken them if anything will  how far is she off now hawkins  about a mile and a half major there are no signs of her altering her course as she ought to have done by this time if she had made us out you see her head light shows up fair and square between her side lights which shows that she is coming as near as possible on to us i think that i had better light a blue light  frank nodded the blue light at once blazed out  they ought to see that if they are not all asleep frank said as he looked up at the sails standing out white against the dark sky  set to work with that foghorn the skipper said and a man began to work the bellows of a great foghorn which uttered a roar that might have been heard on a still night many miles away again and again the roar broke out  that has fetched them the captain said she is starboarding her helm to go astern of us there we have lost her red light so it is all right how i should have liked to have been behind the lookout or the officer of the watch with a marlinespike or a capstan bar i will warrant that they would not have nodded when on watch again for a long time to come  here she comes she is closer than i thought she was she will pass within fifty yards of the stern it is lucky that we had that big horn major mallett for if we had not woke them up when we did she would have run us down to a certainty  as the steamer came along scarcely more than a length astern of the yacht a yell of execration broke from the sailors gathered forward  that was a near shave george frank mallett said when the steamer had passed it brought me out in a cold sweat at the thought that if the osprey were to be run down there was an end to all chance of rescuing bertha from that scoundrels clutches i dont know that i thought of myself at all i am a good swimmer and i suppose she would have stopped to pick us up it was the osprey i was thinking of even if every life on board had been saved i dont see how we could have followed up the search without her    chapter 13  three hours later the breeze came frank was pacing up and down the deck when there was a slight creak above he stopped and looked up  is that the breeze he asked the first mate whose watch it was  i think so sir though it may be just the heaving from a steamer somewhere i dont feel any wind not a breath from any quarter  there was another and more decided sound above  there is no mistake this time the mate said as the boom which had been hanging amidships slowly swung over to port its somewhere about the quarter that we expected it from and coming as gently as a lamb  five minutes later there was sufficient breeze to cause her to heel over perceptibly as she moved quietly through the water  hands aft to shake out the reefs the mate called  the order was repeated down the focastle hatch by one of the two men on the lookout the rest of the watch who had been allowed to go below tumbled up  the sailors hastened to untie the reef points all were aware of the nature of the chase in which they were embarked the whole crew were full of ardour they felt it as a personal grievance that the young lady to whom their employer was engaged had not only been carried off but carried off from the deck of the yacht moreover she was very popular with them as she had often asked them questions and chatted with them when at the helm or when she walked forward she knew them all by name and had several times come off from shore with a packet of tobacco for each man in her basket she had been quick in learning to steer and her desire to know everything about the yacht had pleased the sailors who were all delighted when they learned of her engagement to the owner the new hands on learning the particulars had naturally entered to some extent into the feeling of the others and the alacrity with which every order was obeyed showed the interest felt in the chase  as soon as the reef points were untied came the order  slack away the reef tackle and see that the caring will run easy  now up with the throat halliard that will do  now the gaff a little more belay there  now get that topsail up from the sail locker we wont shift jibs just yet until we see whether the breeze is going to freshen  it was not long before the increasing heel of the craft and rustle of water along her side told that she was travelling faster  the wind is freeing her a bit sir it has shifted a good half point in the last ten minutes  that is a comfort frank said you may as well heave the log i should like to know how she is going before i turn in  seven knots sir the mate reported that is pretty fair considering how closehauled she is  well i will turn in now let me know if there is any change  at five oclock frank was on deck again purvis was in charge of the watch now  good morning sir he said touching his hat as frank came up we are going to have a fine day and the wind is likely to keep steady  all right purvis what speed were we going when you heaved the log  seven and a half sir perry tells me that she has been doing just that ever since the wind sprang up i reckon that we are pretty well abreast of finisterre now we shall have the sun up in a few minutes and i expect that it will come up behind the land  lambert go up to the crosstree and keep a sharp lookout as the sun comes up and see if you can make land  i can make out the land sir the sailor called down as soon as he reached the crosstree it stands well up i should say that you can see it from deck  the mate and frank walked further aft and looked out under the boom the land was plainly visible against the glow of the sky  there it is sure enough the mate said i looked over there before you came up and could not make it out but the sky has brightened a lot in the last ten minutes i should say that it is about fiveandtwenty miles away it is a very bold coast sir  that is finisterre over the quarter you see the land breaks off suddenly there we ought to have made out the light but of course it is not very bright at this distance and there was a slight mist on the water when i came up at eight bells  i suppose in another fortyeight hours we shall not be far from the southern point of portugal  we shall be there or thereabouts by that time if the wind keeps the same strength and in the same quarter that would make an uncommonly good run of it considering that we were lying twentyfour hours becalmed if it had not been for that we should have been only four days from the start to saint vincent  the mates calculations turned out correct and at seven in the morning they anchored a mile off cape saint vincent the gig was lowered and frank was rowed ashore taking with him a signal book in which questions were given in several languages including spanish he had purchased it at cowes before starting  the signal officer was very polite and fortunately understood a little english so frank managed with the aid of the book to make him understand his questions no craft at all answering to the description had been noticed passing during the last five or six days certainly no yacht had passed she might of course have gone by after dark  he showed frank the record of the ships that had been sighted going east and of those that had made their numbers as they passed the phantom was not among the latter nor did the rig or approximate tonnage as guessed of any of the others at all correspond with hers  after thanking the officer frank returned to his boat and half an hour later the osprey was again under weigh  at ceuta tarifa and tangier there was a similar want of success such a craft might have passed but if so she was either too far away to be noted or had passed during the night from tangier he crossed to gibraltar and anchored among the shipping there  so far everything had gone to confirm his theory that the phantom would not go up the mediterranean of course she might have passed the three places as well as saint vincent at night or have kept so nearly in the middle of the strait as to pass without being remarked still the chances were against it and he regarded it as almost certain that she would have put into one or other of the african ports as she passed them for water fresh meat and fruit  it was six days after the osprey passed saint vincent before she anchored off gib she had made her number as she came in and in a short time the health officer came out in a boat the visit was a formal one the white ensign on her taffrail was in itself sufficient to show her character and that she must have come straight from england and the questions asked were few and brief  we are ten days out frank said we have touched at tarifa ceuta and tangier but that is all the crew are all in good health here is the list of them if you wish to examine them  as a matter of formality it is better that it should be done the health officer said  i will order them to muster frank said and while they are doing so will you come below and take a glass of wine  can you tell me if a craft about this size a schooner or brigantine has put in here during the last fortnight i dont know whether she is still flying yacht colours or has gone into trade but at any rate you could see at once that she had been a yacht  certainly no such craft has put in here major mallett yours is the first yacht that has come round this season and as i board every vessel that anchors here i should certainly have noticed any trader that had formerly been a yacht the decks and fittings would tell their story at once do you know her name  i dont know much about her frank said but a craft of that kind sailed from cowes a day or two before i started and as i believe for the mediterranean being about our own size and heavily sparred for a schooner i was rather curious to know if i had beaten her we did not make her out as we came along  you must have passed her in the night i should say unless as is likely enough she did not put in but kept eastward  as frank had touched at gibraltar three times before the place had no novelty for him he however went ashore at once to make arrangements for filling up again with water the steward and george lechmere accompanied him into the town to purchase fresh meat fruit and vegetables  frank then made his way to the post office he was scarcely disappointed at finding that there was nothing for him as yet  the next three days he spent in wandering restlessly over the rock as long as the osprey was under weigh and doing her best he was able to curb his anxiety and impatience but now that she was at anchor he felt absolutely unable to remain quietly on board several officers of his acquaintance came off to the osprey and he was invited to dine at their mess dinner every night he however declined  the fact is my dear fellow he said to each i am at present waiting with extreme anxiety for news of a most important nature and until i get it i am so restless and so confoundedly irritable that i am not fit to associate with anyone when i look in here again i hope that it will be all right and then i shall be delighted to come to you and have a chat over our indian days but at present i really am not up to it  his appearance was sufficient to testify that his plea was not a fictitious excuse  on the fourth day he found a letter awaiting him at the post office he tore it open and read  funchal madeira august 30  sir at the request of mr greenwood i beg to inform you that a brigantine precisely answering to the description given me anchored in the roads here on the 21st she only remained a few hours to take in water and stores i was at the landing place when the master came on shore he said that they had had a wonderfully fast voyage from england having come from the lizard under seven days and holding a leading wind all the way she was flying the belgian flag and i learned from the portuguese official who visited her that her papers were all in order and that she had been purchased at ostend from an englishman only three weeks before and had been named the dragon he did not remember what her english name had been  most unfortunately she had left a few hours before the mail steamer came in bringing me the letter from lloyds i do not know that i could in any case have stopped her but i think that i could have got the officials to have searched her and if the ladies had been on board and had appealed to them for protection i think the vessel would certainly have been detained or at any rate the authorities would have insisted upon the ladies being set on shore  her papers had the cape as her destination though this may of course have been only a blind i regret much that i am unable to give you further information beyond the fact that there were two male passengers on board i shall be happy to reply to any communication i may receive from you  frank hurried down to the landing place  lay out men he said i want to be under way in a quarter of an hour  the men bent to their oars and the gig flew through the water there was no one on shore for frank had given strict orders that no one was to land of a morning until he returned from the post office  get under way at once he called to the captain as soon as he came within hailing distance  there was an instant stir on board some of the men ran to the capstan others began to unlace the sail covers while some gathered at the davits to hoist the boat up directly she came alongside  i have news lads frank said in a loud voice as he stepped on board she has touched at madeira  there was a cheer from the men it was something to know that a clue had been obtained and in a wonderfully short time the osprey was under way and heading for the point of the bay  then they did not stop them there major george lechmere asked after frank had stated the news  no the mail did not arrive with the letter in time for lloyds agent to act upon it the phantom had sailed some hours before she is still under her square yards and her name has been changed to the dragon she was there on the 21st and the letter is dated the 30th  and today is the 6th george said so he has fifteen days start of us besides the distance to madeira  yes she must be among the west indies long before we can hope to overtake herthere or at some south american port  then you have learnt for certain that she has gone that way major  it is not quite certain but i have no doubt about it her papers say that she is bound for the cape which is quite enough to show me that she is not going there i think it is the west indies rather than south america for if she went to any brazilian port or monte video or buenos ayres she would be much more likely to attract attention than she would in the west indies where there are scores of islands and places where she could cruise or lie hidden as long as she liked  yes i have no doubt that is her destination it is a nasty place to have to search but sooner or later we ought to be able to find her fortunately the negroes pretty nearly all speak english spanish or french and we shall have no difficulty in getting information wherever there is any information to be had  four days later the osprey anchored off funchal the dinghy at once put off with six water casks and frank was rowed ashore in the gig and had a talk with his correspondent the latter however could give him no more information than had been contained in his letter except that the white streak had been painted out and that the craft carried fourteen hands all of whom were foreigners he could give no information as to whether she would be likely to touch at either the canaries or the cape de verde islands but was inclined to think that she would not  they took a very large stock of water on board he said and a much larger amount of meat vegetables and fruit than they would have required had they intended to put in there and meat is a good deal dearer here than it would be at saint vincent or even teneriffe i should think from this that they had no intention of putting in there though they might touch at saint helena or ascension if they are really on their way to the cape  but after what you tell me i should think that your idea that they have made for the west indies is the correct one i should say that they were likely to lie up in some quiet and sheltered spot there for it is the hurricane season now and no one would be cruising about among the islands if he could help it there are scores of places where he could lie in shelter and no one be any the wiser except perhaps negro villagers on the shore  yes i should think that is what he would do frank agreed how long does the hurricane season last  the worst time is between the middle of september and the middle of november but you cannot depend upon settled weather until the new year begins  well hurricane or no hurricane i shall set out on the search as soon as i get over there  two hours later the osprey was again on her way the breeze was fresh and steady and with her square sail set and her mizzen furled she ran along at over nine knots an hour one day succeeded another without there being the least occasion to make any shift in the canvas and it was not until they were within a days sail of porto rico that the wind dropped almost suddenly purvis at once ran below  the glass has fallen a long way since i looked at it at breakfast he said as he returned  then we are in for a blow the skipper said i am new to these latitudes but wherever you are you know what to do when there is a sudden lull in the wind and a heavy fall in the glass  now lads get her canvas off her  all down captain  every stitch  andrews do you and two others get down into the sail locker and bring up the storm jib the small foresail trysail and storm mizzen if it is a tornado we shant want to show much sail to it  if we are going to have a tornado captain i should recommend that you get the mainsail loose from the hoops put the cover on roll it up tightly to the gaff and lash it to the bulwarks on one side and get the boom off and lash it on the other side  that will be a very good plan the lower we get the weight the better  when this was done the topmast was also sent down and lashed by the sail the barrels which were now all empty were lowered down into the saloon while the trysail was fastened to the hoops ready for hoisting and all the reefs tied up a triangular mizzen was then hoisted and a storm jib  we wont get up the foresail at present the captain said i have reefed it right down sir but i wont hoist it until we have got the first blow over  you had better see that everything is well secured on deck and if i were you i would put the jib in stops we can break it out when we like but from all accounts the first burst of these tornadoes is terrible i should leave the mizzen on her that will bring her head up to it whichever way it comes and she will lie to under that and the jib  yes sir but it is likely enough that we shall have to sail i have been reading about the tornadoes i picked up a book at cowes the day we sailed when i saw that you were ordering the charts of these seas and have learnt what is the proper thing to do the wind is from the southeast at present which means that the centre of the hurricane lies to the southwest  if the wind comes more from the east as long as we can sail we are to head northwest or else lie to on the port tack if it shifts more to the south we are to lie to on the starboard tack  that sounds all right hawkins it is very easy to describe what ought to be done but it is not so easy to do it when you are in a gale that is almost strong enough to take her mast out of her i will tell you what i would do i would break up a couple of those casks and nail the staves over the skylights and then nail tarpaulins over them i have no fear whatever about her weathering the gale but i expect that for a bit we shall be more under water than above it  i see perry is getting the two anchors below that will help to ease her at any rate she will be in good fighting trim i think we began none too soon there is a thick mist over the sky and it looks as dark as pitch ahead  there is only one thing more sir and the captain shouted  all hands get the boats on deck and see that they are lashed firmly  will you see to getting in the davits out of the sockets purvis and getting them below  i ought to have done that before he went on apologetically but i did not think of it however with such a strong crew it wont take five minutes and we have got that and something to spare i think  you have got the bowsprit reefed hawkins  yes sir full reefed  there is only one thing more that i can suggest i fancy that these tornadoes begin with heavy lightning get those wire topmast stays and twist them tightly round the shrouds and lash them there leaving the ends to drop a fathom or two in the water in that way i dont think that we need be afraid of the lightning if it strikes us it will run down the wire shrouds and then straight into the water  in five minutes all was in readiness the boats securely lashed on deck the davits down below and the lightning protectors tied tightly to the wire shrouds  now captain i think we have done all that we can do what are you doing now  i am running a life line right round her sir it may save more than one life if the seas make a sweep of her  you are right captain these eighteeninch bulwarks are no great protection  four sailors speedily lashed a threeinch rope four feet above the deck from the forestay round the shrouds and aft to the mizzen hove as tight as they could get it and then fastened while this was being done one of the mates cut up a piece of twoinch rope into several foot lengths and gave one to each of the men and officers including frank and george lechmere  if you tie the middle of that round your chest under the arms you will have the two ends ready to lash yourself to windward when it gets bad a couple of twists round anything will keep you safe however much water may come over her  do you mean to stay on deck sir the skipper asked you wont be able to do any good and the fewer hands there are on deck the less there will be to be anxious about i shall only keep four hands forward after the first burst is over and they will be lashed to the shrouds purvis will be there with them perry and andrews will take the helm and i shall stay with them  we have battened the fore hatch down one of the men will be in the after cabin and if i want to hoist the trysail or make any change i shall give three knocks and that will be a signal for them to send half a dozen hands up they will come through the saloon and up the companion we shant be able to open the fore hatch  very well skipper i will go down when the hands do we are going to have it soon  it was now indeed so dark that he could scarcely see the face of the man he was speaking to  i really think captain that i should send some of them down below at once if a flash of lightning were to strike the mast it would probably go down the shrouds harmlessly but might do frightful damage among the men crowded as they are up here or it might blind some of them besides the weight forward is no trifle  i think that you are right sir and raising his voice the captain shouted  all hands below except the four men told off go down by the companion  would you mind their stopping in the saloon sir it would make her more lively than if they all went down into the focastle  certainly not captain and accordingly the men were ordered to remain in the saloon  you can light your pipes there my lads frank said as they went down and make yourselves as comfortable as you can  the last man had scarcely disappeared when the captain said  look there major mallett and looking up frank saw a ball of phosphorescent light some eighteen inches in diameter upon the masthead  plenty of electricity about he said cheerfully if they are all as harmless as that it wont hurt us  but as he ceased speaking there was a crash of thunder overhead that made the whole vessel quiver and at the same instant a flash of lightning so vivid that for a minute or two frank felt absolutely blinded without a moments intermission flash followed flash while the crashes of thunder were incessant  i think that plan of yours has saved the ship sir the captain said when after five minutes the lightning ceased as suddenly as it had begun i am sure that a score of those flashes struck the mast and yet no damage has been done to it so far as i could see by the last flash are you all right there purvis  all right the mate replied scared a bit i fancy i know i am myself but none the worse for it  it is coming now sir the captain said listen  frank could hear a low moaning noise rapidly growing louder and then he saw a white line on the water coming along with extraordinary velocity  hard down with the helm perry the captain said  hard down it is sir  hold on all the captain shouted  a few seconds later the gale struck them the yacht shook as if in a collision and heeled over till the water was half up her deck then the weight of her lead ballast told and as the pressure on the mizzen did its work she gradually came up to the wind getting on to an almost even keel as she did so  break out the jib and haul in the weather sheet the captain shouted  purvis was expecting this and although he did not hear the words above the howl of the storm at once obeyed the order  there she is sir lyingto like a duck the skipper shouted in franks ear and none the worse for it an ordinary craft would have turned turtle but i have seen her as far over when she has been racing  well i will go below now hawkins frank shouted back it is enough to blow the hair off ones head  come down george with me you can be of no use here    chapter 14  for eight hours the osprey struggled with the storm the sea swept over her decks and the dinghy was smashed into fragments but the yacht rode with far greater ease than an ordinary vessel would have done as save for her bare mast the wind had no hold upon her there were no spars with weight of furled sails to catch the wind and hold her down she was in perfect trim and her sharp bows met the waves like a wedge and suffered them to glide past her with scarce a shock while the added buoyancy gained by reefing the bowsprit and getting the anchors below lifted her over seas that as they approached seemed as if they would make a clean sweep over her  from time to time frank went up for a few minutes lashing himself to the runner to windward the three men at the helm were all sitting up lashed to cleats and sheltering themselves as far as they could by the bulwarks movement toward them was impossible beyond a wave of the hand no communication could be held  frank could not have ventured out had he not before going down below for the first time stretched a rope across the deck in front of the companion so that before going out he obtained a firm grasp of it and was by its assistance able to reach the side safely each time he went out four of the crew from below followed him and relieved those lashed to the shrouds forward  the skipper was carrying out the plan he had decided on and the foresail was hoisted a few feet the osprey by its aid gradually edging her way out from the centre of the tornado the hands as they came down received a stiff glass of grog and were told to turn in at once two hours after the storm broke purvis came down for a few minutes  she is doing splendidly sir he said i would not have believed if i had not seen it that any craft of her size could have gone through such a sea as this and shipped so little water we have had a few big uns come on board but in general she goes over them like a duck it is hard work forward you have got to keep your back to it for you can hardly get your breath if you face it if it was not for the lashings it would blow you right away  i have been at sea in gales that we thought were big ones but nothing like this of course with our heavy ballast and bare poles she dont lie over much it is the sea and not the wind that affects her and her low free board is all in her favour but i believe a ship with a high side and yards and top hamper would be blown down on her beam ends and kept there  do you think that it blows as hard as it did purvis  there aint much difference sir but i do think there aint quite so much weight in it i expect we are working our way out of it we have been twice round the compass it is lucky we had not got down among the islands before we caught it i would not give much for our chances if we had been there for these gales gradually wear themselves out as they get farther from the islands  in six hours the weather had so far moderated that they were able to hoist the reefed foresail and two hours later the trysail was set with all the reefs in these were shaken out in a short time the wind dying away fast half the crew had turned into their hammocks some time before and the regular watch was now set the motion of the ship however was very violent for there was a heavy tumbling sea still on the waves having no general direction but tossing in confused masses and coming on to the deck now on one side now on the other  at midnight frank also turned in in his clothes but he was soon up again for the motion of the yacht was so violent that he found it next to impossible to keep from being jerked out of his berth the first mate had had four hours off duty and had just come up again to relieve the captain  it is lucky sir that all our gear is nearly new he said for if it had not been this rolling would have taken the mast out of her the strain on the shrouds each time that she gets chucked over must be tremendous  it would have been better for this sort of work if we had had ten feet taken off that stick before we started  well just for the present it would have been better sir but even if we had had time i would not have done it we should not have much chance of overhauling the phantom if we clipped our wings  in another two hours the sea had sensibly moderated frank again went down and this time was able to go to sleep when he went on deck the sun was some way up the mainsail was set and the reefs had been shaken out  this is a change for the better captain  it is indeed sir i think that we have reason to be proud of the craft she has gone through a tornado without having suffered the slightest damage except the loss of the dinghy i shall be getting the topmast up in another hour you see i have got her numbertwo jib on her and shifted the mizzen but she is still a bit too lively to make it safe to get up the spar like as not if we did it would snap off before we could get the stays taut  i am terribly anxious about the phantom frank said and only trust that she was in a snug harbour on the lee side of one of the islands  i hope so sir i was thinking of her lots of times when the gale was at its height if she was as you say in a good port she would be right enough of course if she was out she would run for the nearest shelter  if she had no more wind than we had before it came on she had not much chance of doing that  that is true enough sir but you see the glass gave us notice three hours before we caught it besides they certainly took native pilots on board as soon as they got out here and these must have got them into some safe place at the first sign of a gale  yes they must certainly have had a pilot on board frank agreed and there is every ground to hope that they were snugly at anchor they were three weeks ahead of us and must know that it is the hurricane season as well as we do it is likely that the first thing they did on their arrival was to search for some quiet spot where they could lie up safely till the bad season was over  late on the following afternoon land was seen ahead  there is porto rico sir it may not be quite our nearest point to make but there are no islands lying outside it so that it was safer to make for it than for places where the islands seemed to be as thick as peas  yes and for the same reason it is likely that carthew made for it of course naturally we should have both gone for either barbadoes or antigua or barbuda the most northern of the leeward islands but he would not do so if he intends to keep his belgian colours flying and indeed it would seem curious that two english gentlemen should be cruising about in a belgian trader you may take it that he is certain to put into a port for water and vegetables just as we have to do there seem to be at least half a dozen on this side of the island he may have gone into any of them but he would be most likely to choose a small place however at one or other of them we are likely to get news and the first thing for us to do is to get a good black pilot who can talk some english as well as spanish  it is likely we shall have to take three or four of them before we have done a man here might know the virgin islands and perhaps most of the leeward islands but he might not know anything east west or north of san domingo we should certainly want another pilot for the bahamas and a third for cuba and the islands round it which can be counted almost by the hundred then again none of these would know the islands fringing almost the whole of the coast from honduras to trinidad however i hope we shall not have to search them there is an ample cruising ground and any number of hiding places without having to go so far out of the world as that at any rate at present he is not likely to have gone far and i think that he will either have sought some secluded shelter among the virgin islands or on the coast of san domingo  when within a few miles of porto rico they lay to for the night and the next morning coasted westward and dropped anchor in the port of san juan de porto rico  a quarter of an hour after dropping anchor the port officials came on board the inspection of the ships papers was a short formality the white ensign and the general appearance of the craft showing her at once to be an english yacht and as she had only touched at madeira on her way from gibraltar and all on board were in good health she was at once given pratique  the first thing to do is to get an interpreter frank said as he was rowed to shore accompanied by george lechmere the secretary of lloyds gave me a list of their agents all over the world it is a spanish firm here and it is probable that none of them speaks english but if so i have no doubt that by aid of this signal book i shall be able to make them understand what i want i have a circular letter of introduction from lloyds secretary  he had no difficulty in discovering the place of business of senor juan cordovo and on sending in his card and the letter of introduction was at once shown into an inner office he was received with grave courtesy by the merchant who on learning that he did not speak spanish touched a bell on his table a clerk entered to whom he spoke a few words  the young man then turned to frank and said  i speak english sir senor cordovo wishes me to assure you that all he has is at your disposal and that he will be happy to assist you in any way that you may point out  please assure senor cordovo of my high consideration and gratitude for his offer will you inform him that i intend to cruise for some time among the islands and that i desire to obtain the services of an interpreter speaking english and spanish and if he possesses some knowledge of french so much the better  the reply was translated to the merchant who conversed with the interpreter for two or three minutes the latter then turned to frank  i have a brother senor who like myself speaks the three languages he is at present out of employment and would i am sure be very glad to engage himself to you as your interpreter  that would be the very thing frank said does he live in the town  yes senor i could fetch him here in a few minutes if senor cordovo will permit me to do so  the merchant at once granted the clerks request  will you tell senor cordovo frank said that i do not wish to occupy his valuable time and that i will return here in a quarter of an hour  the merchant however through the clerk assured frank that he would not hear of his leaving and producing a box of cigars begged him to seat himself until the arrival of the interpreter he then said something else to the clerk and the latter asked frank if he wanted any supplies for the yacht as his employer acted as agent for shipping  certainly frank said glad to have the opportunity of repaying the civility shown him i require fresh meat fruit and vegetables sufficient for twentyfive persons i shall also be glad if he will arrange for boats to take off water my barrels and tanks are nearly empty and i shall want a supply of about a thousand gallons  while the clerk was absent frank with the assistance of the signal book kept up a somewhat disjointed conversation with the spaniard the clerk was however away but a few minutes and returned with his brother an intelligentlooking young fellow of seventeen or eighteen he did not speak english quite as well as the clerk but sufficiently well for all purposes frank asked him his terms which seemed to him ridiculously low and a bargain was forthwith arranged  will you ask senor cordovo if any other english yacht has been here during the past three weeks or a month i have a friend on board one and i fancy that she is cruising out here also  the merchant replied that no english yacht had touched at the port for some months and that such visits were extremely rare he assured him that the stores ordered would be alongside in the course of the afternoon and expressed his regret when frank declined his invitation to stay with him for a day or two at his country house  after renewed thanks frank took his departure with his new interpreter whose name was pedro george lechmere was waiting at the corner of the street  i have arranged everything satisfactorily george this young man is coming with me as interpreter and as he speaks both french and spanish we shall get on well in future  when will you be ready to come on board pedro  in half an hour senor  you will find my boat at the quay take your things down to it it is a white boat with a british flag at the stern but i dont want you to go off yet i have two things i want you to do before you go  in the first place i want a pilot i want one who knows the virgin islands well and also the coast of san domingo  there will be no difficulty about that senor  in the second place i want to find out from the boatmen at the quays whether a belgian schooner of seventy or eighty tons has touched here during the last month she carries large yards on her foremast and is a very fastlooking craft she was at one time an english yacht if she called here i wish to know whether she sailed east or west and if possible to obtain an idea as to her destination  there was such a vessel here senor for i noticed her myself she only remained a few hours while her boats took off water and vegetables i happened to notice her for having nothing to do i was down at the quays and the boatmen were talking about her she being a craft such as is seldom seen now some of the old men said that she reminded them of the privateers in the great war i went down to the boats when they first came ashore the men only spoke french and they paid me a dollar to go round with them to make their purchases they took them and also the water off in their own boats which surprised me for they were very handsome boats much more handsome than i have seen in any ship that ever came here i said that it would cost them but a very small sum to send the barrels off in the native boats but they insisted upon taking them themselves  i dont know which way they sailed because i went home as soon as they went away from the quay but the boatmen will be able to tell me  he went away and talked with some of the negro boatmen and soon returned saying that she sailed westward  at what time did she sail  it was just getting dark senor for they said that they could scarcely make her out but she certainly went west  well all you have to do now pedro is to hire a pilot get the best man that you can find i want one who knows every foot of the virgin islands we are going there first it does not matter so much about his knowing san domingo for as we shall probably come back here we can put him ashore and get another pilot specially for san domingo be sure you get the best man that you can find whatever his terms are we will be back again here in half an hour  that is satisfactory indeed george frank went on as they turned away of course strongly as we believed that he might be here there was no absolute certainty about it for he might have gone to the south american ports or even have headed for the gulf of florida you see he is not only here but came to the very island we thought that he would most likely make for as for his going west no doubt that was merely a ruse he did not get up anchor until it was getting so dark that he would be able in the course of half an hour to change his course and make for the virgin islands without fear of being observed i dont suppose that they have any idea whatever of being followed but they take every precaution in their power to cover up their traces you noticed of course their anxiety that no shore boat should go off to them  well george we have succeeded so well thus far that i feel confident that we shall overhaul them before long as far as one can see on the chart most of these virgin islands are mere rocks and the number we shall have to search will not be very great and if the pilot really knows his business he ought to be able to take us to every inlet where they would be likely to anchor  pedro was awaiting them when they returned to the boat and was accompanied by a big negro who by the grin on his goodnatured face was evidently highly satisfied with the bargain that he had made  this is the man senor pedro said i met one of the port officers i know and he told me that he was considered to be the best pilot in the island he speaks a little englishmost of the pilots do for several of the virgin islands belong to your peopleand of course when he goes down to the windward islands  the windward islands frank repeated why they are not anywhere near here  i should have said the leeward islands senor the english call them so but we and the danes and the dutch all call them the windward islands  oh i understand  what is your name my man  dominique sar me talk english bery well me take you to any port you want to go me know all de rocks and shoals bery plenty dey is but dominique knows ebery one of dem  that is all right you are just the man i want well are you ready to go on board at once  me ready in an hour sar go home now say goodbye to wife and piccaninnies pedro just tell me that boat go off with water in one two hours dominique go off with him me like five dollars to give wife to buy tings while me am away  all right dominique here you are now dont you miss the boat or we shall quarrel at starting and i shall send ashore at once and engage someone else  dominique come sar that for sure me good man always keep promise  well here is another couple of dollars dominique that is a present you give that to the wife and tell her to buy something for the piccaninnies with it  so saying frank george lechmere and pedro stepped on board the boat while the pilot walked off his black face beaming with satisfaction  he came off duly with the last water boat and while the contents of the barrels were being transferred to the tanksfor now that the long run was accomplished there was no longer any necessity for carrying a greater supply than these could holdfrank had a talk with him  now dominique this is you know a yacht cruising about on pleasure  yes sar me know dat  at the same time frank went on we have an object in view just at present we want to find that schooner or brigantine that put in here nearly a month ago she carried a heavy spread of canvas on her yards and lay very low in the water  the pilot nodded  me remember him sar could not make out de craft nohow some people said she pirate but dar aint no pirates now  that is so dominique still there may be reasons sometimes for wanting to overhaul a vessel and i have such a reason what it is is of no consequence pedro tells me that when she got under sail she went west but as it was just dark when she sailed she may very well have turned as soon as she was hidden from sight and have gone east and it seems to me likely that she would in the first place have made for one of the virgin islands  it depends sar upon the trade that he wanted to do not much trade dere sar the trade is done at tortola dat english island and at saint thomas or santa cruz dem danish islands all de oders do little trade  yes dominique but i dont think that she wants to trade at all what she wants to do is to lie up quietly where she would not be noticed  plenty of places in the islands for dat sar  did they take a pilot here  dominique shook his head  no sar several offers but no take if want to hide they no want pilot from here they take up a fisherman among the islands to show dem good place but plenty of places much better in san domingo or cuba why dey stop virgin islands little places many got no water no food no noting but bare rock  i think that they would go in there because as the hurricane season had begun when they got here they would think it better to run into the port  hurricane not bad here sar bery bad down at what english call leeward islands have dem sometimes here not bery often had one four days ago one ob de worse me remember we not likely to have another dis year  that is satisfactory dominique we got caught in it the other day and i dont want to meet another well you understand what i want to begin with to search all the places a vessel that did not want to attract notice would be likely to lie up in we want to question people as to whether she has been seen and if we dont find her to hear whether when last seen she was sailing in the direction of the leeward islands or going west  me find out sar the negro said confidently someone sure to have seen her  well you had better come below i have got a chart and you shall mark all the islands where there are any bays that she would be likely to take shelter in and we can then see the order in which we had better take them  this was a little beyond dominiques english but pedro explained it to him and at franks request went below with them frank telling hawkins to weigh anchor as soon as the tanks were filled and the stores were on board he had before he came off returned to senor cordovo and paid for all the things supplied  going through the islands one by one dominique made a cross against all that possessed harbours or inlets that would each have to be examined  tortola is the least likely of the places for them to go frank said as it is a british island  not many people dar sar most people in town de rest of island rock all hills broken up many good harbours  what is its size dominique  twelve miles long sar two miles wide  well that is not a great deal to search if we have to examine every inch of the coast how many people are there  two three hundred white men dey live in de town most all two three thousand blacks  well we will begin with the others i should think that in a fortnight we ought to be able to do them all  the next twelve days were occupied in a fruitless search every fishing boat was overhauled and questioned and frank and pedro went ashore to every group of huts the only fact that they learned was that a schooner answering to the description had been seen some time before the information respecting her was however very vague for some asserted that she was sailing one way some another and frank concluded that she had cruised about for some days before deciding where to lie up it was at tortola that they first gained any useful information many vessels had during the last six weeks entered one or other of the deep creeks and one of them had laid up for nearly a month in a narrow inlet with but one or two negro huts on shore it was undoubtedly the phantom or rather the dragon for the negroes had noticed that name on her stern she had sailed on the day after the hurricane and as they learned from shore villages at other points had gone west  well it is a comfort to think that even if we had sailed direct here from porto rico we should not have caught her frank said to george lechmere she had left here two days before we got there i suppose they have someone on board who has been in the islands before for certainly the harbours are the best in the group no doubt they got some fishermen to bring them into the creek well there is nothing to do but to turn her head west it is but fortyeight hours sail to san domingo and i fancy that it is likely that he will have stopped there you see on the chart that there are numberless bays and there would be no fear of questions being asked by the blacks if we dont find him there we must try cuba but san domingo is by far the most likely place for him to choose for his headquarters and there are at least four biggish rivers he could sail up beside a score of smaller ones  i should say that we had better try the south and west first the coast is a great deal more indented there than it is to the north there seem to be any number of creeks and bays i should think that he would be likely to make one of these his headquarters and spend his time cruising about  although dominique professed a thorough knowledge of the coast of san domingo and hayti frank could see that he was not so absolutely certain as he was of the virgin islands and he told him to land at villages as he passed along and bring fishermen off acquainted with the waters in their locality  dat am de safest way for sure sar dominique said dis chile know de coast bery well can pilot ship into town of san domingo or any oder port that ships go to but he could not say for certain where all de rocks and shoals are along places where de ships neber go in  three days later the osprey after sailing along the northern shore arrived at porto rico and passing through the mona channel between that island and san domingo dropped anchor in the port of the capital dominique went ashore with pedro and spent some hours in boarding coasting craft and questioning negroes whether they had seen the brigantine several of them had noticed her she had been cruising off the coast and had put in at the mouth of the nieve and at jaquemel on the south coast of hayti they heard of her too in the deep bay at the west of the island between capes dame marie and la move some had seen her sailing one way some another she had evidently been as frank had expected cruising about  pedro put down the dates of the times at which she had been seen but negroes are very vague as to time and beyond the fact that some had seen her about a week before while in other cases it was nearer a fortnight he could ascertain nothing with certainty so far as he could learn she had only put into three ports although the coasters he boarded came from some twenty different localities  i fancy that it is as i expected frank said they have one regular headquarters to which they return frequently it may be some very secluded spot it may be up one of these small rivers marked on the chartthere are a score of them between cape la move and here she does not seem to have been seen as far east as this of course she has not put in here because there are some eight or ten foreign ships here now every one of these twenty rivers has plenty of water for vessels of her draught for some miles up i fancy our best chance will be to meet her cruising  the worst of that would be major george lechmere said that she would know us and if she sails as well as she used to do we should not catch her before night came onif she had seven or eight miles startespecially if we both had the wind aft  that is just what i am afraid of i have no doubt that we could beat her easily working to windward in her present rig but i am by no means certain that she could not run away from us if we were both free and if she once recognised us there is no saying where she might go to after she had shaken us off certainly she would not stay in these waters  the question is how can we disguise ourselves if we took down our mizzen and dirtied the rest of our sails it would not be much of a disguise nothing but a yacht carries anything like as big a mainsail as ours and our big jib and foresail and the straight bowsprit would tell the tale of course we could fasten some wooden battens along her side and stretch canvas over them and paint it black and so raise her side three feet but even then the narrowness of her hull seen end on as it would be in comparison to the height of the mast and spread of canvas would strike carthew at once  we could follow his example sir and make her into a brig i dare say we could get it done in a week  that might spoil her sailing and as soon as he found that we were in chase of him he would at once suspect that something was wrong that would of all things be the worst especially if he foundwhich would be just as likely as notthat he had the legs of us  i believe the most certain way of all would be to search for her in the boats if we were to paint the gig black so that it would not attract attention give a coating of grey paint to the oars and hire a black crew we could coast along and stop at every village and search every bay and row far enough up each river to find some village or hut where we could learn whether the phantom has been in the habit of going up there it would take some time of course but it might be a good deal of time saved in the long run we could do a great deal of sailing the gig stands well up to canvas when the crew are sitting in the bottom and we could fit her out with a native rig  from here to cape la move following the indentations must be somewhere between five and six hundred miles perhaps more than that the breeze is regular and with a sail we ought to make from forty to fifty miles a daysay fortyso that in three weeks we should thoroughly have searched the coast even allowing for putting in three or four times a day to make inquiries the yacht must follow keeping a few miles astern at any rate she must not pass us  at night when she anchors she must have two head lights one at the crosstrees and one at the topmast head i shall be on the lookout for her and we will take some blue lights and some red lights with us every night i will burn a blue light say at nine oclock a man in the crosstrees will make it out twenty miles away and that will tell them where i am and that i dont want them if i burn a red light it will be a signal for the yacht to come and pick me up  then you will go in the boat yourself major  yes i must be doing something i shall take pedro with me and perhaps dominique we can get another pilot here dominique is a shrewd fellow and can get more out of the negroes than pedro can certainly that will be the best plan and will avoid the necessity of spoiling the yachts speed which may be of vital importance to us at a critical moment  call dominique down i will send him ashore at once with pedro to get hold of a good pilot and four good negro boatmen and a native sail i think that is all we want    chapter 15  as soon as the dinghy with dominique and pedro had left the side of the yacht the captain by franks orders set four men to work to paint the gig black while others gave a coat of dull lead colour to the varnished oars the order was received with much surprise by the men who audibly expressed their regret at seeing their brightly varnished boat and oars thus disfigured  after about three hours on shore the dinghy returned loaded with fruit and vegetables which pedro had purchased and a native mast and sail the former was at once cut so as to step in the gig the sail was hoisted and was then taken in hand by one of the crew who was a fair sailmaker to be altered so as to stand flatter half an hour later the new pilot and four powerful negroes came alongside in a shore boat  it was now late in the afternoon so the start was postponed until the next morning a few other arrangements were made as to signalling and it was settled that if frank showed a red light a rocket should be sent up from the yacht to show that the signal had been observed and that they were getting up sail they were to keep their lights up so that frank could make them out as they came up and put off to meet them  george lechmere saw to the preparations for victualling the gig two large hampers of fresh provisions were placed on board and two fourandahalf gallon kegs of water a bundle of rugs was placed in the stern sheets and the boats flagstaff was fixed in its place in the stern the yard of the sail was at night to be lashed from the mast to the staff at a height of four feet above the gunwale and across this the sail was to be thrown to act as a tent a kettle frying pan plates knives and forks were put in forward and a box of signal lights under the seat aft canisters of tea sugar coffee and all necessaries had been stowed away in the hamper together with a plentiful supply of tobacco and a bag of twentyeight pounds of flour wrapped up in tarpaulin was placed under one of the thwarts  as soon as it was daylight anchor was got up and when the yacht had sailed for seven or eight miles to the west the gig was lowered and the four black boatmen took their places in her frank took the rudder lines and dominique sat near him the sail was then hoisted and as the wind was light the boatmen got out their oars and shot ahead of the osprey directing their course obliquely towards the shore  it was not necessary to land at the coast villages here as it was morally certain that the phantom had not touched anywhere within twenty or thirty miles of san domingo and she would hardly have entered any of the narrow rivers at night nevertheless they did not pass any of these without rowing up them when some native huts were reached dominique closely questioned the negroes  the pilot had by this time been informed of the cause of their search for the phantom which had until they left san domingo been a profound mystery to him frank however being now fully convinced both of the negros trustworthiness and of his readiness to do all in his power to assist thought it as well to confide in him and when they were together in the boat informed him that the brigantine they were searching for had carried off a young lady and her maid from england  that man must be a rascal the negro said angrily what do he want dat lady for sar he love her bery much  no dominique what he loves is her fortune she is rich he has gambled away a fine property and wants her money to set him on his legs again  bery bad fellow dat the pilot said shaking his head earnestly ought to be hung dat chap dominique do all he can to help you sar do more now for you and dat young lady we find him for suah you tink there will be any fighting sar  i think it likely that he will show fight when we come up with him but you see i have a very strong crew and i have arms for them all  dat good me wonder often why you have so many men nothing for half of dem to do now me understand well sar if there be any fighting you see me fight you gib me cutlass me fight like debil  thank you dominique frank said warmly though with some difficulty repressing a smile i shall count on you if we have to use force as far as i am concerned i own that i should prefer that they did resist for i should like nothing better than to stand face to face with that villain each of us armed with a cutlass  if he know you here he go up river get plenty of black men fight for him black fellow bery foolish give him little present he fight  i had not thought of that dominique yes if he has made some creek his headquarters he might as you say get the people to take his side by giving them presents that is if he knew that we were here however at present he cannot dream that we are after him and if we can but come upon him unawares we shall make short work of him  no news whatever was obtained of the schooner until the headland of la catarina was passed but at the large village of azua they learned that she had anchored for a night in the bay five days before she had been seen to sail out and certainly had not turned into the river niova  touching at every village and exploring every inlet frank continued his course until after rounding the bold promontory of la beata he reached the bay at the head of which stands jaquemel  every two or three days they had communicated with the osprey and slept on board her leaving her at anchor with her sails down until they had gone some ten miles in advance she had at times been obliged to keep at some distance from the shore owing to the dangers from rocks and shoals the pilot on board would have taken her through but frank was unwilling to encounter any risk unless absolutely necessary  at jaquemel he learnt that the schooner had put in there a fortnight before but neither there nor at any point after leaving azua had she been seen since that time she had sailed west  the next night after looking in at bainette some twenty miles beyond jaquemel frank rejoined the osprey  the gig was hoisted up and they sailed round the point of gravois the coast intervening being so rocky and dangerous that although there was a passage through the shoals to the town of st louis frank felt certain that the schooner would not be in there the coast from here to cape dame marie was high and precipitous with no indentations where a ship could lie concealed and the voyage was continued in the yacht as far as this cape they were now at the entrance of the great bay of hayti  i take it as pretty certain frank said as he george lechmere the skipper and dominique bent over the chart that the schooner is somewhere in this bay she has certainly not made her headquarters anywhere along the south coast in the first place she has seldom been seen and in the second we have examined it thoroughly therefore i take it that she is somewhere here unless of course she has sailed for cuba but i dont see why she should have done that the coast there is a good deal more dangerous than that of san domingo he could not want a better place for cruising about than this bay you see it is about ninety miles across the mouth and over a hundred to port au prince with indentations and harbours all round and with the island of genarve some forty miles long to run behind in the centre he could get everything he wants at port au prince or at petit gouve which looks a goodsized place  i should say in the first place that we could not do better than run down at night to the island of genarve and anchor close under it from there we shall see him if he comes out of port au prince or petit gouve whichever side he may take and by getting on to an elevated spot have a view of pretty nearly the whole bay looking at it at present the two most likely spots for him to make his headquarters are in that very sheltered inlet behind the point of halle on the north side or in the equally sheltered bay and inlet under the bec de marsouin on the south from genarve we ought to be able to see him coming out of either of them it is not above fiveandtwenty miles from the island to the bec de marsouin and forty to the point of halle we might not see him come out from there but we should soon make him out if he were coming down from port au prince  it was agreed that this was the best plan to adopt it might lead to their sighting the schooner in a day or two while to row round the bay and search every inlet in it would take them a fortnight from genarve too a fortymile sail in the gig would take them into port au prince which the brigantine might possibly have made its headquarters accordingly after waiting until nightfall they got up sail and anchored at six in the morning in a small bay in the island of genarve here they would not be likely to attract the notice of any ship passing up to port au prince unless which was very unlikely one came along close to the shore  as soon as the anchor was dropped both boats rowed to shore frank george lechmere pedro and four sailors with a basket of provisions started at once for the highest point in the island some four miles distant dominique went along the shore with two sailors to make inquiries at any villages they came to  on reaching the top of the hill frank saw that as he had expected it commanded an extensive view over the bay on each side of the island which was but some six miles across a village could be seen on the northern shore some three miles distant and to this pedro with one of the sailors was at once despatched both parties rejoined frank soon after midday the schooner had been noticed passing the island several times but much more often on the southern side than on the northern the negroes on that side were all agreed that she generally kept on the southern side of the passage and that more than once she had been seen coming from the south shore and passing the western point of the island on her way north  that looks as if she came from petit gouve or the bay of mitaquane or that under the bec de marsouin frank said  dat is it sar dominique agreed if she want to go north side of bay from port au prince she would have gone either side of island i expect she lie under de bec fine safe place dat no town there plenty of wood all round and villages where she get fruit and vegetables sure to be little stream where she can get water  the watch was maintained until sunset but although a powerful telescope had been brought up no vessel at all corresponding to the appearance of the brigantine was made out  at six oclock the next morning frank was again at the lookout and scarcely had he turned his telescope to the south shore than he saw the brigantine come out from behind the bec de marsouin and head towards the west the wind was blowing from that quarter and after a few minutes deliberation frank told the men to follow him and dashed down the hill in half an hour he reached the shore opposite the yacht and at his shout the dinghy which was lying at her stern at once rowed ashore  get up the anchor captain and make sail i have seen her she has just come out from the bec and is making west as the wind is against her it seems to me that he would never choose that direction to cruise in unless he was starting for cuba and i dare not let the opportunity slip if he once gets clear away we may have months of work before we find him again and as the wind now is i am sure that we can overhaul him long before he can make cuba indeed as we lie we are nearer to that coast than he is and can certainly cut him off  in five minutes the osprey was under way with all sail set the wind was nearly due west and as cuba lay to the north of that point she had an advantage that quite counterbalanced that gained by the start the phantom had obtained in two hours the lookout at the head of the mast shouted down that he could perceive the brigantines topsail  she is sailing in towards the land on that side he said she has evidently made a tack out and is now on the starboard tack again  it will be a long leg and a short one with her sir the skipper said i think that if we were in her place we could just manage to lay our course along the coast but with those square yards of hers she cannot go as close to the wind as we can as it is we can lay our course to cut her off  it would be rather a close pinch to do so before she gets to the head of the bay frank said  yes sir and i dont suppose that we shall overhaul her before that but we certainly shant be far behind her by the time she gets there i think that we shall cut her off if the wind holds as it does now at any rate if she should get there first we should certainly lie between her and cuba and she will have either to run back or to round the cape or to run east or south i wish the wind would freshen but i fancy that it is more likely to die away still she is walking along well at present  even frank anxious as he was could not but feel satisfied as he looked at the water glancing past her side she was heeling well over and the rustle of water at her bow could be heard where they were standing near the tiller andrews the best helmsman on board the yacht held the tiller rope and perry was standing beside him  from time to time frank went up to the crosstrees  we are drawing in upon her fast he said but she is travelling well too much better than i should have thought she would have done with that rig i think she has got a better wind than we have she has only made one short tack in for the last two hours  the captains prognostication as to the wind was verified and to franks intense annoyance it gradually died away and headed them so much that they could no longer lie their course  what shall we do sir shall we hold across to the south shore and work along by it as the schooner is doing or shall we go about at once  go about at once hawkins you see we can see her topsails from the deck and of course she can see ours i dont suppose she has paid any attention to us yet and if we stand away on the other tack we shall soon drop her altogether while if we hold on she will when we reach that shore be three or four miles behind us of course she will have a full view of us  they sailed on the port tack for an hour and then came round again the brigantine could no longer be seen from the deck and could only just be made out from the crosstrees  i think on this tack the skipper said as he stood by the compass after she had gone round we shall make the point and i think that we shall make it ahead of her  i think so too hawkins what pace is she going now  not much more than four knots sir  my only fear is that we shant get near her before it is dark  i think that we have plenty of time for that sir you see we got up anchor at halfpast six and it is just twelve oclock now another five hours should take us up to her if the wind holds at this  by two oclock the topsails of the brigantine could be again made out from the deck she was still working along shore and was on their port bow  another three hours and we shall be alongside of her the skipper said and if i am not mistaken we shall come out ahead of her  there is one advantage in the course we are taking hawkins viewing us as she will pretty nearly end on till we get nearly abreast of her she wont be able to make out our rig clearly  by four oclock they were within five miles of the brigantine the wind then freshened and laying her course as she did while the brigantine was obliged to make frequent tacks the osprey ran down fast towards her  they must have their eyes on us by this time the captain said though they cannot be sure that it is the osprey they can see that she is a yawl of over a hundred tons and as they cannot doubt that we are chasing them they wont be long in guessing who we are shall we get the arms up sir  yes you may as well do so the muskets can be loaded and laid by the bulwarks but they are not to be touched until i give the order no doubt they also are armed i am anxious not to fire a shot if it can be helped and once alongside we are strong enough to overpower them with our cutlasses only with the five blacks we are now double their strength and even carthew may see the uselessness of offering any resistance  they ran down until they were within a mile of the shore not being now more than a beam off the brigantine two female figures had some time before been made out on her deck but they had now disappeared it was evident that the osprey was being closely watched by those on board the brigantine presently two or three men were seen to run aft  they are going to tack again sir if they do they will come right out to us  frank made no reply but stood with his glass fixed on the brigantine suddenly he exclaimed  round with her hawkins  up with your helm andrews hard up man the skipper shouted as he himself ran to slack out the main sheet four men ran aft to assist him  that will do he said as she fell off fast from the wind now then gather in the main sheet ready for a jibe slack off the starboard runner a couple of hands aft and get the square sail out of the locker  mr purvis get the yard across her lower her down ready for the sail and see that the braces and guys are all right  now in with the sheet lads handsomely that will do that is it over she goes slack out the sheet steadily  she is round too frank said as the boom went off nearly square we have gained and she is not more than half a mile away  the manoeuvre had in fact brought the yachts nearer to each other both had their booms over to starboard  quick with that square sail frank shouted she is drawing away from us fast  two minutes later the square sail was hoisted and the foot boomed out on the port side every eye was now fixed on the brigantine but to their disappointment they saw that she was still though very much more slowly drawing ahead  that is just what i feared frank said in a tone of deep vexation with those big yards i was certain that she would leave us when running ahead before the wind however there is no fear of our leaving her what are we doing now seven knots  about that sir and she is doing a knot better  what do you think that she will do now hawkins  i dont see what she has got to do sir if she were to get five miles ahead of us and then haul her wind she would know that she could not go away from us for we should be to windward and we are evidently a good bit faster than she is when we are both close hauled the only other thing that i can see for her to do is to run straight on to port au prince at the rate we are going now she would be in soon after daylight tomorrow we should be seven or eight miles astern of her and he might think that we should not venture to board her there  i dont think that he would rely on that hawkins now that he knows who we are he will guess that we shall stick at nothing what i am afraid of is that he will lower a boat and row miss greendale and her maid ashore he might do it either there or what would be much more likely row ashore to some quiet place during the night take his friend and two or three of his men with him and leave the rest to sail her to port au prince  i dont think that the wind is going to hold the skipper said looking astern i reckon that it will drop as it generally does at sunset it is not blowing so hard now as it did just before we wore round  in half an hour indeed it fell so light that the osprey was standing through the water only at three and a half knots an hour the light wind suited the phantom with her great sail spread she had now increased her lead to a mile and a half and was evidently leaving them fast  there is only one thing to be done george we must board them in boats  i am ready major but it will be a rather risky business  frank looked at him in surprise  i dont mean for us sir george said with a smile but for miss greendale you may be sure that those fellows will fight hard and as we come up behind we shall get it hot now sir if anything happens to you you must remember that the osprey will be as good as useless towards helping her you as her owner might be able to justify what we are doing but if you were gone there would be no one to take the lead carthew would only have to sail into port au prince and denounce us as pirates i hear from the pilot that these niggers have got some armed ships and they might sink us as soon as we came into the harbour and then there would be an end to any chance of miss greendale getting her liberty  that is true enough george but i think that it must be risked now that he knows we are here he has nothing to do but to send her ashore under the charge of his friend and two or three of the sailors and take her up into the hills or he might go with her himself which is perhaps more likely then when we came up with her at port au prince the skipper would simply deny that there had ever been any ladies on board and would swear that he had only carried out two gentlemen passengers as his papers would show and might declare that he had landed them at porto rico of course they are certain to fight now for they can do so without risk as they can swear that they took us for a pirate  how many do you think that the gig will carry hawkins  well sir you might put nine in her you brought ten off at southampton but if you remember it put her very low in the water and we should run a good deal heavier than your party then  yes i think that we had better take only nine if we overload her she will row so heavily that we shall be a long time overhauling them  i am not quite sure that we shall overhaul them anyhow sir look at those clouds coming over the hills they are travelling fast and i should say that we are likely to have a squall no doubt they get them here pretty often with such high land all round  well we must chance that hawkins if one does come you must pick us up as we come along i agree with you it does look as if we should have a squall it may not be anything very serious but anyhow if it comes it will take her along a great deal faster than we can row  purvis i suppose that the dinghy will carry seven  yes she will do that easily  very well we can but try that will give sixteen of us which is about their strength you must remain on board purvis shall command the dinghy lechmere will go with me pick out thirteen hands you and perry can manage with seven and the five negroes but keep a sharp lookout for that squall remember that you will have very short warning we are only a mile from the shore and as it is coming down from the hills you may not see it on the water until it is quite close to you  the boats were lowered and the men armed with musket and cutlass took their places frank and george lechmere each had a cutlass and a revolver buckled to the waist  now give way lads frank said she is about two miles ahead of us and we ought to overtake her in half an hour  it was now getting dusk the light fading out suddenly as the clouds spread over the sky franks last orders to the skipper before leaving were  edge her in hawkins until you are dead astern of the brigantine then if the squall comes down before we reach her we shall be right in your track  i have put a lighted lantern into the stern sheets of each boat sir and have thrown a bit of sail cloth over them so that if she leaves you behind and you hold it up there wont be any fear of our missing you  the men rowed hard but the gig had to stop frequently to let the dinghy come up they gained however fast upon the brig and in half an hour were but a few hundred yards astern then came a hail from the brigantine in french  keep off or we will sink you  no reply was made they were but two hundred yards away when there were two bright flashes from the stern of the brigantine and a shower of bullets splashed round the boats there were two or three cries of pain and george lechmere felt frank give a sudden start  are you hit sir  i have got a bullet in my left shoulder george but it is of no consequence  row on lads he shouted we shall be alongside before they have time to load again  i never thought of their having guns though he went on as the men recovered from their surprise and dashed on again with a cheer by the sharp crack they must be brass i suppose he picked up a couple of small guns at ostend thinking that they might be useful to him in these waters  a splattering fire of musketry now broke out from the brigantine they had lessened their distance by half when they saw the brigantine without apparent cause heel over farther and farther she went until her lee rail was under water  the firing instantly ceased and there were loud shouts on board then as she came up into the wind the square yards were let fall and the crew ran up the ratlines to secure the sails simultaneously the foresail came down then her head payed off again and she darted away like an arrow from the boats  these however had ceased rowing frank as he saw the brigantine bowing over had shouted to purvis to put the boats head to the wind doing the same himself a few seconds afterwards the squall struck them with such force that some of the oars were wrenched from the hands of the men who were unprepared for the attack  steady men steady frank shouted it wont last long keep on rowing so as to hold the boat where you are till the yacht comes along it wont be many minutes before she is here  in little over a quarter of an hour she was seen approaching and frank saw that in spite of the efforts of the men at the oars the boats had been blown some distance to leeward however as soon as the lanterns were held up the osprey altered her course and the captain taking her still further to leeward threw her head up to the wind until they rowed alongside her  frank had by this time learned that one of the men in the bow had been killed and that three besides himself had been wounded two were wounded on board the dinghy  so they have got some guns the skipper said as they climbed on deck no one hurt i hope  there is one killed i am sorry to say and five wounded frank replied but none of them seriously i have got a bullet in my shoulder but that is of no great consequence so you got through it all right  yes sir it looked so nasty that i got the squaresail off her and the topsail on deck before it struck us and as we ran the foresail down just as it came we were all right and only just got the water on deck it was as well though that we were lying becalmed as it was she jumped away directly she felt it i was just able to see the brigantine and it seemed to me that she had a narrow escape of turning turtle  yes they were too much occupied with us to be keeping a sharp lookout at the sky and if it had been a little stronger it would have been a close case with her thank god that it was no worse can you make her out still  yes sir i can see her plainly enough with my glasses  in a quarter of an hour the strength of the squall was spent the wind then veered round to its former quarter taking the osprey along at the rate of some five knots an hour  the wounded were now attended to george lechmere found that the ball had broken franks collarbone and gone out behind both he and frank had had sufficient experience to know what should be done and after bathing the wound and with the assistance of two sailors who pulled the arm into its place george applied some splints to the broken bone to keep it firm and then bandaged it and the arm  one of the sailors had a wound in the cheek the ball in its passage carrying off part of the ear one of the men sitting in the bow had a broken arm but only one of the others was seriously hurt frank went on deck again as soon as his shoulder was bandaged and his left arm strapped tightly to his side  i suppose that she is still gaining on us hawkins  yes she is dropping us i reckon she has gone fast sir fully half a knot though we have got all sail set  there is one comfort frank said the coast from here as far as the bec is so precipitous that they wont have a chance of putting the boat ashore until they get past that point and by the time they are there daylight will have broken    chapter 16  the stars were bright and with the aid of a night glass the brigantine was kept in sight the sailors relieving each other at the masthead every half hour frank would have stayed on deck all night had not george lechmere persuaded him to go below  look here major he said it is like enough that we may have a stiff bit of fighting tomorrow now we know that those fellows have guns though they may be but two or three pounders and it is clear that it is not going to be altogether such a onesided job as we looked for you have had a long day already sir you have got an ugly wound and if you dont lie down and keep yourself quiet you wont be fit to do your share in any fighting tomorrow and i reckon that you would like to be in the front of this skirmish you know in india wounds inflamed very soon if one did not keep quiet with them and i expect that it is just the same here  it is not as if you could do any good on deck the men are just as anxious to catch that brigantine as you are they were hot enough before but now that one of their mates has been killed and five or six wounded i believe that they would go round the world rather than let her slip through their hands i shall be up and down all night major and the captain and both mates will be up too and i promise that we will let you know if there is anything to tell you  well i will lie down george but i know that i shall get no sleep still perhaps it will be better for me to keep my arm quite quiet  he was already without his coat for that had been cut from the neck down to the wrist to enable george to get at the wound he kicked off his light canvas shoes and george helped him to lie down in his berth  you will be sure to let me know if she changes her course or anything  i promise you that i will come straight down major  three quarters of an hour later george stole noiselessly down and peeped into the stateroom he had turned down the swinging lamp before he went up but there was enough light to enable him to see that his master had fallen off to sleep he took the news up to hawkins who at once gave orders that no noise whatever was to be made the men still moved about the deck but all went barefooted  the wind keeps just the same hawkins said i cant make it more than three and a half knots through the water i would give a years pay if it would go round dead ahead of us we should soon pick her up then as it is she keeps crawling away however we can make her out on such a night as this a good deal further than she is likely to get before morning besides we shall be having the moon up soon and as we are steering pretty nearly east it will show her up famously  now i will give you the same advice that you gave the governor you had much better lie down for a bit purvis has gone down for a sleep perry will go down when he comes up at twelve and i shall get an hour or two myself later on  i wont go down george said but i will bring a couple of blankets up and lie down aft i promised the major that i would let him know if there was any change in the wind or in the brigantines course so wake me directly there is anything to tell him i have put his bell within reach i have no doubt i shall hear it through that open skylight if he rings but if not wake me at once  all right trust us for that  twice during the night george got up and went below the first time frank had not moved the second he found that the tumbler of lime juice and water on the table at the side of the bunk was nearly half emptied and that his master had again gone off to sleep and was breathing quietly and regularly  he is going on all right he said to hawkins when he went up there is no fever yet anyhow for he has drunk only half that glass of lime juice if he had been feverish he would not have stopped until he had got to the bottom of it  when george next woke the morning was breaking  anything new he asked purvis who was now at the tiller  nothing whatever the governor has not rung his bell the wind is just as it was neither better nor worse and the brigantine is eight miles ahead of us  george went forward to have a look at her  i think i had better wake him he said to himself he will have had nine hours of it and he wont like it if i dont let him know that it is daylight i will get two or three fresh limes squeezed and then go in to him  this time frank opened his eyes as he entered  morning is breaking major and everything is as it was i hope that you are feeling better for your sleep let me help you up here is a tumbler of fresh lime juice  i feel right enough george i can scarcely believe that it is morning how i have sleptand i fancied that i should not have gone off at all  drinking off the lime juice frank at once followed lechmere on deck and after a word or two with purvis hurried forward  she is a long way ahead he said with a tone of disappointment  the mate reckoned it between seven and eight miles major  how far is she from the bec  i dont know sir i did not ask purvis  frank went aft and repeated the question  i fancy that that is the bec the furthermost point that we can see purvis said and i reckon that she is about halfway to it  keep her a point or two out purvis the line of shore is pretty straight beyond that and i want of all things not to lose sight of her for a moment i would give a good deal to know what she is going to do i cannot think that she is going to try to go round the southeast point of the island for if she were she would have laid her head that way before  the osprey edged out until they opened the line of coast beyond the headland and then kept her course again there was a trifle more wind as the sun rose higher and the yacht went fully a knot faster through the water in less than two hours the brigantine was abreast of the headland presently frank exclaimed  she is hauling in her wind  that she is sir hawkins who had just come on deck exclaimed she surely cannot be going to run into the bay  she can be going to do nothing else frank said what on earth does she mean by it no doubt that scoundrel is going to land with miss greendale but why should he leave the phantom at our mercy when he could have sent her on to port au prince  i cannot think what he is doing sir but he must have some game on or he would never act like that  of course he may have arranged to go with the lady to some place up in the hills but why should he sacrifice the yacht  it is a rum start anyhow and i cannot make head or tail of it of course you will capture her sir  i dont know hawkins it is one thing to attack her when she has miss greendale on board but if she has gone ashore it would be very like an act of piracy  yes sir but then you see they fired into our boat and killed one of our men and wounded you and four or five others  that is right enough hawkins but we cannot deny that they did it in self defence of course we know that they must have recognised us and knew what our errand was but her captain and crew would be ready to swear that they didnt and that they were convinced by our actions that we were pirates at any rate you may be sure that the blacks would retain both craft and that we should be held prisoners for some considerable time while miss greendale would be a captive in the hands of carthew i should attack the brigantine if i knew her to be on board and should be justified in doing so even if it cost a dozen lives to capture her but i dont think i should be justified in risking a single life in attacking the brigantine if she were not on board to do so would in the first place be a distinct act of piracy and in the second if we got possession of the brigantine we should have gained nothing by it  we might burn her sir  yes we might and run the risk of being hung for it we might take her into port au prince but we have no absolute evidence against her we could not swear that we had positive knowledge that miss greendale was on board and certain as i am that the female figures i made out on the deck were she and her maid they were very much too far away to recognise them and the skipper might swear that they were two negresses to whom he was giving a passage  moreover if i took the brigantine i should only cut off carthews escape in that direction his power over miss greendale would be just as great if he had her up among those mountains among the blacks as it was when he had her on board i can see that i have made a horrible mess of the whole business and that is the only thing that i can see yesterday i thought it was the best thing to start on a direct chase as it seemed absolutely certain to me that we should overhaul and capture her now i see that it was the worst thing i could have done and that i ought to have waited until i could take her in the bay  but you see major said george lechmere who was standing by if we had gone on searching with the boat before we had made an examination of the whole bay there would be no knowing where she had gone and it might have been months before we could have got fairly on her track again  no we acted for the best but things have turned out badly and i feel more hopelessly at sea as to what we had better do next than i have done since the day i got to ostend at any rate there is nothing to be done until we have got a fair sight of the brigantine  it seemed to all on board that the osprey had never sailed so sluggishly as she did for the next hour and a half as they expected no craft was to be seen on the waters of the bay as they rounded the point but dominique and the other pilot had been closely questioned and both asserted that at the upper end of the bay there was a branch that curved round like dat sar the latter said half closing his little finger  progress up the bay was so slow that the boats were lowered and the yacht was towed to the mouth of the curved branch here they were completely landlocked and the breeze died away altogether  how long is this bend jake frank asked the second pilot in french  two miles sir perhaps two miles and a half  deep water everywhere  plenty of water can anchor close to shore country boats run in here very often if bad weather comes on foreign ships never come here they always run on to the town  you told us that there were a few huts at the end  yes sir there is a village there two others near  the crew had all armed themselves and the muskets were again placed ready for use  you had better go round hawkins frank said and tell them that on no account is a shot to be fired unless i give orders tell the men that i am just as anxious to fight as they are and that if they give us a shadow of excuse we will board them  i went round among the men half an hour ago sir and told them how the land lay and lechmere has been doing the same they all want to fight but i have made them see that it might be a very awkward business for us all  the men in the boats were told to take it easy and it was the best part of an hour before they saw on turning the last bend the brigantine lying at anchor a little more than a quarter of a mile away  she looks full of men frank exclaimed as turned his glasses upon her  yes sir said the captain who was using a powerful telescope they are blacks there must be fifty of them beside the crew and as far as i can see most of them are armed  that explains why he came in here hawkins they have been using this place for the last three weeks and no doubt have made good friends with the negroes i dare say carthew has spent his money freely on them  well this settles it we would attack them at sea without hesitation however many blacks there might be on board but to do so now would be the height of folly five of our men are certainly not fit for fighting so that their strength in whites is nearly equal to ours they have got those two little cannon which would probably reduce our number a bit before we got alongside and with fifty blacks to help them it is very doubtful whether we should be able to take them by boarding certainly we could not do so without very heavy loss  we will anchor about two hundred and fifty yards outside her as long as she lies quiet there we will leave her alone if she tries to make off we will board her at once anchor with the kedge that will hold her here have a buoy on the cable and have it ready to slip at a moments notice and the sails all ready to hoist  easy rowing the captain called to the men in the boats and come alongside we have plenty of way on her to take up a berth  in two or three minutes the anchor was dropped and the sails lowered  now i will row across to her frank said and tell them that i dont want to attack them but i am determined to search their craft  no major george lechmere said firmly we are not going to let you throw away your life and you have no right to do itat any rate not until after miss greendale is rescued you may be sure of one thing that carthew has left orders before going on shore that you are to be shot if you come within range he will know that if you are killed there will be an end of the trouble i will go myself sir  frank made no answer for a minute or two then he said  in that case you would be shot instead of me if carthew is on shore as i feel sure he is the others wont know you from me i agree with you that i cannot afford to risk my life just now and yet we must search that brigantine  me go sar dominique who was standing by said suddenly me take two black fellows in dinghy dey no fire at us me go dere tell captain dat you no want to have to kill him and all his crew but dat you got to search dat craft if he let search be made den no harm come of it if he say no den we take yacht alongside and kill every man jack say dat white sailors all furious because dey fire at us yesterday and want bad to have fight  very well dominique it can do no harm anyhow and as i feel sure that the lady has been taken ashore i dont see why they should refuse  accordingly dominique called to two of the negro boatmen to get into the dinghy and took his seat in the stern when the boat was halfway between the two vessels there was a hail in french  what do you want if you come nearer we will fire  what want to fire for dominique shouted back me pilot me no capture ship single handed me want to speak to captain  it was evident the answer was understood for no reply came for a minute or two  well come along then  the words could be heard perfectly on board the yacht  the skipper talks english george i thought that he would do so carthew was sure to have shipped someone who could understand him i dont suppose his french is any better than mine  the dinghy was rowed to within ten yards of the brigantine  now what message have you brought me from that pirate  him no pirate at all you know dat bery well massa captain dat english yacht anyone see dat with half an eye de gentleman there says you have a lady on board dat has been carried off  then he is a liar the belgian said there is no woman on board at all  well sar dat am a matter ob opinion english gentleman tink dat you hab you say no dat prove bery easy de gentleman say he wants to search ship if as you say she is no here den ob course no reason for you to say no to dat if on de other hand you say no den he quite sure he right and he come and search whether you like it or no den der big fight bery strong crew on board dat yacht plenty guns men all bery savage cause you kill one of der fellows last night dey want to fight bad and if dey come dey kill many what de use of dat sar why say wont let search if lady not here nothing to fight about but if you not let us see she not here den we board de ship and when we take her we burn her  the belgian stood for two or three minutes without answering they had seen that there were two or three and twenty men on board the osprey and they were by no means sure that this was the entire number there were three blacks and there might be a number of them lying down behind the bulwarks or kept below the issue of a fight seemed to him doubtful he was by no means sure that his men would fight hard in a cause in which they had no personal interest and as for the blacks they would not count for much in a handtohand fight with english sailors  he had received no orders as to what to do in such a contingency presently he turned to three of his men and said in french  go to that stern cabin and see that there is nothing about that would show that it has been occupied they have asked to search us let them come and find nothing things will go quietly if not they say they will attack us and kill every man on board and burn the ship and as we do not know how many men they may have on board and as they can do us no harm by looking round if there is nothing for them to find we had best let them do it but mind the orders hold good if the owner of that troublesome craft comes alongside you are to pour in a volley and kill him and the sailors with him that will make so many less to fight if it comes to fighting but the owner tells me that if he is once killed there will be an end of it  he then went to the side and said to dominique  there is nothing for you to find here we are an honest trader and there is nothing worth a pirates stealing but in order to show you that i am speaking the truth i have no objection to two hands coming on board and going through her we have nothing to hide  dominique rowed back to the yacht  dey will let her be searched sar  i thought they would frank said and of course that is a sign that there is no one there  i will go sir the skipper said as we agreed he would give anything to get rid of you and you might be met with a volley when you came alongside and now there aint no use in running risks if they have been told what you are like they cannot mistake me for you you are pretty near a foot taller and you are better than ten years younger and i havent any hair on my face i will go through her i am sure the lady aint there or they would not let me still i will make sure there are no hiding places in a yacht where anyone could be stowed away and of course she is like us chock full of ballast up to the floor i shant be many minutes about it sir dominique may as well go with me he can stay on deck while i go below and may pick up something from the black fellows there  you may as well take him hawkins but you may be very sure that they wont give him a chance to speak to anyone  the captain stepped into the boat and was rowed to the yacht he and dominique stepped on to the deck and were lost sight of among the blacks in ten minutes they appeared at the gangway again and stepped into their boat another minute and she was alongside the osprey  of course you found nothing hawkins  nothing whatever sir anything the lady may have left behind had been stowed away in lockers i looked about to see if i could sight a bit of ribbon or some other womans fallal but they had gone ever it carefully two of the other state cabins had been occupied there were mens clothes hanging there of course i looked into every cupboard where as much as a child could have been stowed away and looked round the forecastle anyhow there is no woman there now  dominique had to go round with me the captain evidently did not want to give him a chance of speaking to anyone the mate and two of the sailors posted themselves at the gangway so that the two blacks should not be able to talk to the niggers on board and now sir what is to be done next  we will go below and talk it over captain  you come down too george yes and dominique he may be useful  now hawkins he went on when they had taken their seats at the table of course i have been thinking it over all the morning and i have come to the conclusion that our only chance now is to fight them with their own weapons as long as we lie here there is no chance whatever of miss greendale being brought on board again so the chase now has got to be carried on on land if we go to work the right way there is no reason why we should not be able to trace her i propose to take lechmere and dominique and the four black boatmen if we stain our faces a little and put on a pair of duck trousers white shirts red sashes and these broad straw hats i bought at san domingo we shall look just like the halfcaste planters we saw in the streets there i should take pedro too but you will want him to translate anything you have to say to jake  i propose that as soon as it is dark tonight we muffle the oars of the dinghy and row away and land lower down say a mile or so and then make off up into the hills before tomorrow morning dominique will try to find out something by inquiring at some of the huts of the blacks they are not likely to know but if he offers them a handsome reward to obtain news for him they will go down to the villages and ferret out something the people there would not be likely to know where they have been taken but they would be able to point out the direction in which they went on starting then we could follow that up and inquire again  we might take a couple of the villagers with us belonging here they would have more chance of getting news from other blacks than strangers would have  dont you think sir that it would be as well to have four or five men with you hawkins said there is no doubt this fellow that you are after is a desperate chap and he may have got a strong body of these blacks as a guard he might suspect that after having pursued him all this way you might try to follow him on land you could put the men in hiding somewhere every day while you were making inquiries and they would be mighty handy if it came to fighting which it seems to me it is pretty sure to do before you see the lady off  well perhaps it would be best hawkins and as you say by keeping them hid all day i dont see that they could increase our difficulties but then you see you will want all your hands here for if the brigantine sails whether by night or day you are to sail too and to keep close to her wherever she goes it is not likely that carthew and miss greendale will be on board but he may very well send orders down to the brigantine to get up the anchor he would know that we should stick to her as miss greendale might have been taken on board again at night in that way he would get rid of us from here and would calculate that we should get tired of following the brigantine in time or that she would be able to give us the slip and would then make for some place where he could join her again so my orders to you will be to stick to her but not to interfere with her in any way unless by any chance you should discover that miss greendale is really on board in that case i authorise you to board and capture her they wont have the blacks on board and as the wounded are going on all right and three of them anyhow will be able to lend a hand in a couple of days you will be a match for them especially as they will soon make up their minds that you dont mean to attack them and you will get a chance of running alongside and taking them by surprise  well sir i think that we can do that with four hands less than we have now you see there are nineteen and the two mates and myself say two of the wounded wont be able to lend a hand that makes us twenty to say nothing of jake and pedro so even if you took four hands we should be pretty even in numbers and if our men could not each whip two belgians they had better give up the sea  yes i have no doubt that they could do that and were it not for carthew and his friend i would not hesitate to take eight men i dont know about the other but you may be sure that carthew will fight hard he is playing a desperate game still i think that i might take four especially as i think the chance of miss greendales being brought on board until he believes that we have left these waters is very small  very well then that is settled the five blacks lechmere and myself and four of the sailors will make a strong party serve muskets and cutlasses out to the blacks and the same with a brace of pistols to each of the hands that go with us while we are away let two of the men dress up in my white duck shirts and jackets and in white straw hats let them always keep aft and sit about in the deck chairs and always go down below by the main companion that will make them think that i am still on board while if there is no one on the deck aft they will soon guess that we have landed  you understand all that we have been saying dominique  me understand sar and tink him bery good plan me suah to find out which way dat rascal hab gone plenty of black fellows glad to earn two dollar to guide us dey no money here two dollars big sum to them  all right dominique but we wont stick at two dollars if it were necessary i would pay two hundred cheerfully for news  we find dem widout dat the black said confidently not good offer too much if black man offered two dollars he bery glad if offered twenty he begin to say to himself dis bery good affair perhaps someone else give forty  there is something in that dominique anyhow i shall leave that part of the business to you as a rule i shall keep in hiding with the boatmen and sailors all day i shall be no good for asking questions for i dont know much french and the dialect the negroes of these islands speak is beyond me altogether i cannot understand the boatmen at all  black men here bad sar not like dem in de other islands here dey tink themselves better than white men bery ignorant fellows sar most of dem lost religion and go back to fetish bery bad dat all sorts of bad things in dat affair kill children and women to make fetish bad people sar and dey are worse here than at san domingo  there was nothing to do all day but to sit on deck and watch the brigantine most of the blacks had been landed and only three or four sailors remained on watch on deck frank and george lechmere in their broad straw hats sat and smoked in the deck chairs the formers eyes wandering over the mountains as if in search of something that might point out berthas hiding place the hills were for the most part covered with trees with here and there a little clearing and a patch of cultivated ground with two or three huts in the centre with the glasses solitary huts could be seen half hidden by trees here and there and an occasional little wreath of light smoke curling up showed that there were others entirely hidden in the forest  dont you think major george lechmere said after a long pause that it would be a good thing to have the gig every night at some point agreed on such as the spot where we land you see sir there is no saying what may happen we may have to make a running fight of it and it would be very handy to have the boat to fall back upon  yes i think that a good idea george i will tell hawkins to send it ashore say at ten oclock every night there is no chance whatever of our being down before that they are sure to have taken her a long distance up the hills and though of course one cannot say at present it is pretty certain that we shall have to attack after dark  it is important that we should land where there is some sort of a path i noticed one or two such places as we came along we may as well get into the dinghy and row down and choose a spot now of course they will be watching from the brigantine but when they see the same number that went come back again they will suppose that we have only gone for a row or perhaps to get a shot at anything we come across we may as well take a couple of guns with us  a mile down the inlet they came upon just the spot they were searching for the shore was level for a few yards from the waters edge and from here there was a wellmarked path going up the slope behind  we will fix upon this spot george it will be easy for the boats to find it in the dark from that big tree close to the waters edge now we will paddle about for half an hour before we go back  an hour later they returned to the yacht and george began at once to make arrangements for the landing    chapter 17  i should keep watch and watch regularly hawkins i do not say that it is likely but it is quite possible that they may make an attempt to surprise us cut all our throats and then sink the osprey he might attack with his boats and with a lot of native craft at any rate it is worth while keeping half the crew always on deck be sure and light the cabin as usual they would suspect that i was away if they did not see the saloon skylights lit up  there is no saying when i may be back it may be three nights it may be six or for all that i know it may be longer than that you may be sure that if i get a clue i shall follow it up wherever it leads me  the strictest silence was maintained among the men the two men at the oars were told to row very slowly and above all things to avoid splashing the boat was exceedingly low in the water much too low for safety except in perfectly calm water as including the two men at the oars there were thirteen on board  frank had thought it however inadvisable to take the dinghy also for this was lying behind the stern and it might have been noticed had they pulled her up to the gangway the gig had been purposely left on the side hidden from the brigantine and as they rowed away pains were taken to keep the yacht in a line with her they held on this course indeed until they were close in to the shore and then kept in under its shelter until the curve hid them altogether  be very careful as you row back lads and go very slowly a ripple on this smooth water might very well be noticed by them even if they could not make out a boat  ay ay sir we will be careful  they had brought a lantern with them covered with canvas except for a few inches in front  me take him sar and go first dominique said den if we meet anyone you all stop quiet and me go on and talk with them  frank followed dominique george keeping beside him where there was room for two to walk abreast at other times falling just behind then came the sailors and the four black boatmen were in the rear they had been told that in case they were halted and heard dominique in conversation they were to pass quietly through the others and be ready to join him and help him if necessary with the exception of dominique frank and george lechmere all carried muskets the pilot declined to take one  me neber fired off gun in my life sar me more afraid of gun than of dose rascals dominique fight with um sword dat plenty good for him  the path mounted the hill until they were as frank thought some three hundred feet above the water here the ground was cultivated and after walking for ten minutes they saw two or three lights in front  you stop here sar dominique said handing the lantern to frank me go on and see how best get round de village must not be seen here if native boat come in at night suah to go up to end ob water and land at village dere  the negro soon returned and said that the cultivated land extended on both sides of the village and there was no difficulty in crossing it the village was passed quietly and when it was once well behind them they came down upon the path again which was much larger and better marked than it had been before after following it for half a mile they came upon a road which led obliquely up from the water and ran somewhat inland  this is no doubt the road from the village at the head of the arm of the bay they have probably come along here though they may have turned more directly into the hills that is the first point to find out dominique  yes sar next village we see me go in wid two ob de boatmen and ask a few questions  following the path along for another few hundred yards they saw a road ahead of them here they halted and two of the blacks handed over their muskets and cutlasses to the care of the sailors dominique also left his cutlass behind him and as he went on gave instructions to his two companions  now look here he said in negro french dont you say much i will do the talking but just say a word or two if they ask questions mind we three belong to the brigantine i am the pilot the captain has given me a message to send to his friends who have gone up into the hills he asked me to take it but i am not sure about the way i am ready to pay well for a guide i expect that they will say that the ladies came along but that they do not know how they went afterwards then we ask him to come as guide and promise to pay him very well  by this time they were close to the hut which as dominique assured himself before knocking at the door stood alone there was an old man and woman inside and a boy of about seventeen dominique took off his hat as he entered and said in french  excuse me for disturbing you so late i am the pilot of a vessel now in the bay and have been sent by the captain to carry an important message to a gentleman who landed with another and two ladies and some armed men he did not give me sufficient directions to find him and i thought that if they passed along here you might be able to put me in the way  they came along here between eleven and twelve i think we saw them the old man said and we heard afterwards that the ladies were being taken away because the ship was they thought going to be attacked by a pirate that had followed them the people from the villages went to help fight for the gentleman had bought many things and had paid well for them and each man was promised a dollar if there was no fighting and four dollars if they helped beat off the pirate  yes that was so dominique said but it seems that it was a mistake still we had cause for alarm for the other vessel followed us strangely however it is all explained now and i have been sent with this message because the captain thought that if he sent a white sailor they would not give him the information  do you know sebastian the old man asked his son  yes they turned off to the right two miles further on  look here boy dominique said we were promised twenty dollars if we took the message straight now if you will go with us and find out we will give you five of them as we are strangers to the people here they might not answer our questions but if you go and say that you have to carry the message no doubt they will tell you which way they have gone  the lad jumped up  i will go with you he said but perhaps when we get there you will not give me the money  look here dominique said taking three dollars from his pocket i will leave these with your father and will hand you the other two as soon as we get within sight of the place where they are  the lad was quite satisfied five dollars was more than he could earn by two months work as soon as they went out dominique whispered to one of the boatmen to go back and tell frank what had taken place and to beg him to follow at some distance behind whenever they took a fresh turning one of the boatmen would always be left until he came up  frank had some difficulty in understanding the boatmans french and it was rather by his gestures than his words that he gathered his meaning as soon as the message was given the negro hurried on until he overtook dominique  i am sorry now that we did not bring pedro frank said however i think we made out what he had to say dominique has got someone to go with him to do the questioning as he arranged with me and he will leave one or other of the men every time he turns off from the road he is following that will be a very good arrangement so far we have been most fortunate we know now that we are following them and it will be hard if we dont manage to keep the clue now that we have once got hold of it  when they came to the road that branched off to the right the other boatman was waiting he pointed up the road and then ran on silently ahead no fresh turn was made for a long distance twice they were stopped by one of the blacks who managed to inform them that dominique and the guide were making inquiries at a hut ahead  the road had now become a mere track and was continually mounting other tracks had branched off leading frank supposed to small hill villages after going some ten miles the lad told dominique that it was useless for him to go further for that there were no more huts near the track beyond the fact that the two women were on horseback when they passed the last hut nothing was learned there  it is of no use to go further the guide said there are no houses near here to inquire at and there are three or four more paths that turn off from here we must stop until morning and then i will go on alone and make inquiries of shepherds and cottagers but you see i thought that we should find them tonight if i work all day tomorrow i shall expect three more dollars  you shall have them dominique said here is my blanket i will share one with one of my boatmen  the lad at once lay down and pulled the blanket over his head as soon as he did so dominique motioned to the two boatmen to do the same and then went back along the track until he met franks party as the hills were for the most part covered with trees almost up to their summits frank and his party had only to turn a short distance off from the path on receiving dominiques news that the guide had stopped  it is half past one frank said holding the lantern which the pilot had left with them to his watch we shall get four hours sleep you had better serve a tot of grog all round george it will keep out the damp night air  one of the blacks was carrying a basket and each of the men had brought a water bottle and pannikin  put some water in it lads frank said and it would be a good thing to eat a bit of biscuit with it  dominique had told frank that the guide had made some remark about the two blacks dropping behind so often and the latter took out his handkerchief tore it into eight pieces and gave it to him  wherever you turn off dominique drop one of these pieces on the path that will be quite sufficient  yes sar but you see we dont know when we start up path whether it be right path or no we go up one if find dat hit not de one dey go den come back again and try anoder what we to do  after thinking for some little time frank suggested that dominiques best way would be to tell the guide that he was footsore and that as several paths would have to be searched he and one of the men would sit down there the other would accompany the boy and bring down word when the right path had been discovered  as soon as it became light frank without rousing the men went out into the path and moved cautiously up it he had but just started when he saw dominique coming towards him  all right sar boy gone on he hunt about when he find he send sam back to fetch me de oder stay with him  oh you have sent both with him  yes sar me thought it better if only one man go when he come back boy could talk to people perhaps talk too much so sent both men  that was the best plan no doubt frank agreed i will join the men and remain there until you come for me  dat best thing sar people might come along better dey not see you  it was twelve oclock before dominique joined the waiting group in the wood  they have been a long time finding the track dominique  yes sar bery long time dey try four tracks all wrong den dey try nother sam say boy tell him try that last because bad track lead ober hills to place where obi man live black fellow no like to go there bad men there steal children away make sacrifice to fetish all people here believe that obi man bery strong dey send presents to him to make rain or to kill enemy but dey no like go near him demselves dere was a hut a little up dat road party went by dere yesterday no more houses on road sam say boy wait dere till he bring me back to him den go home not like to go further say cant miss way dat path leads straight to obi mans place fetish on road strike people dead dat go dar without leab ob obi man  that will suit us well altogether frank said how far is it to where the guide is  one and a half hours walk  then we will be off at once  all were glad to be on the move again and in spite of the heat they proceeded at a rapid pace until the boatman sam said that they were close to the spot where he had left his companions with the guide the rest then entered the wood and dominique went on with the boatman  ten minutes later a young negro came down the path they had no doubt that it was the guide dominique arrived two or three minutes later  i suppose that was the guide that went down frank said as he stepped out  dat him sar he said quite sure path go to obi mans place it was miles away in centre of hills i pretend want him to go on he said no go for thousand dollars so me pay him his money and he go back he tell me no use hunt for friends if obi man hab not giben dem leab to go and see him den the fetish change dem all into snakes if he gib leab and not know dat me and oder two men were friends den de fetish change us into snakes  well there is one comfort dominique we shall be able to march boldly along without being afraid of meeting anyone  yes sar sam be a little frightened but not much not believe much in san domingo about fetish dey better dan dese hayti people still sam not like it  i suppose you told him that he was a fool dominique  yes sar me tell him too dat white man tink nothing ob obi man hang him by neck if he tries fetish against dem  having picked up sam they proceeded at a brisk pace along the path frank leading the way with george lechmere  you see he said carthew must have been uneasy in his mind all along i have no doubt that directly he put into the bay and decided to make this his headquarters he set about preparing some place where he could carry them off to and where there would be very little chance of their being traced down at the village by the water he heard of this obi man he has evidently great power in this part of the island these fellows are all great rascals and carthew may have either gone or sent to him and made arrangements that he and a party should if necessary be allowed to establish a camp in the valley where this fellow lives of course promising him a handsome present he could have chosen no safer place following hard as we have done on his track we have obtained a clue but it is not probable that any of the natives whom dominique has questioned has the smallest idea that the party were going towards this fetish mans place in fact the only man that could know it was the negro at that last hut and you may be sure that were he questioned by any searching party he would not dare to give any information that might excite the anger of this man  it is likely enough that this fellow has a gang of men with him bound to him partly by interest and partly by superstitious fears we shall probably have to reckon with these fellows in addition to carthews own force he seems to have taken ten or twelve of the blacks from the village with him they would have no fear of going when he told them that he was under the special protection of the fetish man then you see he has four of his own sailors his friend and himself so that we have an equal number of white men and five negroes against his ten or twelve and the fetishmans gang  however i hope that we shall have the advantage of a surprise if so i think that we may feel pretty confident that we shall at any rate in the first place carry off miss greendale and her maid the danger wont be in the attack but in the retreat that obi fellow may raise the whole country against us there is one thingthe population is scanty up here and it wont be until we get down towards the lower ground that they will be able to muster strongly enough to be really formidable but we may have to fight hard to get down to the boats you see it is a twenty miles march we shant be able to go very fast for although miss greendale and her maid might keep up well for some distance they would be worn out long before we got to the shore while the black fellows would be able to travel by other paths and to arouse the villagers as they went and make it very hot indeed for us  there is one thingwe shall have the advantage of darkness major and in the woods it would be difficult for them to know how fast we were going we might strike off into other paths and if necessary carry miss greendale and her maid we could make a couple of litters for them and with four to a litter could travel along at a good rate of speed  in another three hours they found that the path was descending into a deep and narrow valley on the way they passed many of the fetish signs so terrible to the negros imagination pieces of blue string with feathers and rags attached to them were stretched across the path clumps of feathers hung suspended from the trees flat stones with berries shells and crooked pieces of wood were nailed against the trunks of the trees  at first the four negro boatmen showed signs of terror on approaching these mysterious symbols and grew pale with fright when frank broke the strings that barred the path but when they saw that no evil resulted from the audacious act and that no avenging bolt fell upon his head they mustered up courage and in time even grinned as the sailors made jeering remarks at the mysterious emblems  as soon as they began to descend into the valley and it was evident that they were nearing their destination frank halted  now dominique do you object to go down and find out all about it i am quite ready to go but you are less likely to be noticed than i am there is no hurry for we dont wish to move until within an hour of sunset or perhaps two hours there is no fear of our meeting with any interruption until we get back to the point where we started this morning and it would be as well therefore to be back there just before dark  me go sar me strip dat best not seen so easy among de trees  quite right dominique what we want to find out is the exact position of the camp and the hut for no doubt they built a hut of some sort where miss greendale is and see how we can best get as close to it as possible then it would be as well to find out what sort of village this obi man has got and how many men it probably contains but dont risk anything to do this our object is to surprise carthews camp and we must take our chance as to the blacks if you were seen and an alarm given carthew might carry miss greendale off again so dont mind about the obi village unless you are sure that you can obtain a view of it without risk of being seen  me manage dat sar the negro said confidently dey not on de lookout me crawl up among de trees and see eberyting no fear whatsomeber  dominique stripped and started down the path while the rest retired into the shelter of the trees an anxious two hours passed the party listening intently for any sound that might tell of dominiques being discovered all however remained quiet except that they were once or twice startled by the loud beating of a drum and the deep blasts from the fetish horn at the end of that time there was a general exclamation of relief as dominique stepped in from among the trees  well dominique what have you found frank exclaimed as he started to his feet  me found eberyting sar first come to village not bery big twenty or thirty men dere den a hundred yards furder tree huts stand dey new huts but not built last night leaves all dead built eight or ten days ago me crawl on tomack among de trees and lay and watch in de furder hut two white lady dey come in and out dey talk togeder de oders not go near them next hut to them twenty thirty yards away two white men dey sit on log and smoke cigar in de next hut four white sailor den a little distance away twelve black fellows sit round fire and cook food plenty of goats down in valley good gardens and lots of bananas  how did the white ladies seem  not seem anyting particular sar dey neber look in de direction ob oders just talk togeder bery quiet me see dere lips move but hear no voice hear de voice of men quite plain  how close can we get without being seen  about fifty yards sar huts put near stream under big trees trees not tick just dar little way lower down banana trees run down to edge ob stream if can get round de village on dat side widout being seen can go through bananas den dash across de stream and run for de ladies can get dere before de oders besides if dey run dat way we shoot dem down  thank god that is all satisfactory frank said but it is hard having to wait here another five hours before doing anything  we are ready to go and pitch into them at once sir one of the sailors said you have only to say the word  thank you lads but we must wait till within an hour or two of sunset i expect that we shall have to fight our way back and we shall want darkness to help us it would be folly to risk anything just as success seems certain after these months of searching still it is hard to have to wait  it is getting on to twelve oclock you had better get that basket out and have your dinners  the next four hours seemed to him interminable the sailors and negroes had gone to sleep as soon as they had finished their meal and smoked a pipe frank moved about restlessly sometimes smoking in short sharp puffs sometimes letting his pipe go out every minute and relighting it mechanically and constantly consulting his watch at last he sat down on a fallen tree and remained there without making the slightest motion until george lechmere said  i think it is time now major  thank goodness for that george i made up my mind that i would not look at my watch again until it was time  now lads before we start listen to my final orders if we are discovered as we go past the village we shall turn off at once and make straight for the camp dont waste a shot on the blacks they are not likely to have time to gather to oppose us but cut down anyone that gets in your way when we are through the village make straight to the farthest hut dont fire a shot till we have got between that and the next and then go straight at carthew and his gang if i should fall lechmere will take the command if he too should fall you are to gather round the ladies and fight your way down to the landing place take dominiques advice as to paths and so on he and his men know a good deal better than you dobut remember the great duty is to take the ladies on board safe  the moment you get them there tell the captain my orders are that you are to man the two boats row straight at the brigantine drive the crew overboard and sink her then you are to sail for england with miss greendale the brigantine must be sunk for if carthew gets down there he will fill her with blacks and sail in pursuit and as there is not much difference in speed between the two boats she might overtake you if you carried away anything you must get rid of her before you sail  what have you got there george  two stretchers major dominique and i have been making them for the last two hours we can leave them here sir by the side of the path and pick them up as we come along back  a couple of minutes later the party started they followed the path down until nearly at the bottom of the hill here the trees grew thinner and dominique who was leading turned to the right they made their way noiselessly through the wood dominique taking them a much wider circuit round the village than he himself had made and bringing them out from the trees at the lower end of the plantation of bananas  hitherto they had been walking in single file but frank now passed along the order for them to close up  keep together as well as you can he said when they were assembled and mind how you pass between the trees if you set these big trees waving it might be noticed at once  very cautiously they stole forward until they reached the edge by the stream frank looked through the trees four white sailors were lying on the ground smoking in front of their hut carthew and his companion were stretched in two hammocks hung from the tree under which their hut stood bertha and her maid had retired into their bower  now lads he said as with his revolver in his right hand he prepared for the rush dont cheer but run silently forward the moment they catch sight of us you can give a cheer  now and he sprang forward into the stream which was but ankle deep  the splash as the whole party followed him at once attracted the attention of the sailors who leaped to their feet with a shout and ran into their hut while at the same moment carthew and his companion sprang from their hammocks paused for a moment in surprise at the men rushing towards them and then also ran into their hut carthew shouting to the blacks to take to their arms  go straight at them george frank shouted running himself directly towards the nearest hut just as bertha startled at the noise came to its entrance  she stood for an instant in astonishment then with a scream of joy ran a step or two and fell forward into his arms  thank god i have found you at last he said wait here a moment darling i will be back directly go into the hut until i come  but bertha was too overpowered with surprise and delight to heed his words and frank handed her to her maid who had run out behind her  take her in he said as he carried her to the entrance of the hut and stay there until i come again  then he ran after his party a wild hubbub had burst forth muskets and pistols were cracking carthew as he ran out of the hut discharged his pistol at the sailors but in his surprise and excitement missed them and before he had time to level another george lechmere bounded upon him and with a shout of this is for martha bennett brought his cutlass down upon his head  he fell like a log and at the same moment one of the sailors shot his companion then they dashed against the belgian sailors who had been joined by the blacks  give them a volley lads george shouted  the four sailors fired as a moment later did the boatmen and then cutlass in hand rushed upon them  just as they reached them frank arrived there was but a moments resistance two of the sailors had fallen under the volley a third was cut down and the fourth as well as the blacks fled towards the village here the obi drum was beating fiercely  load again lads frank shouted two of you come back with me  he ran with them back to the end hut but bertha had now recovered from her first shock  come darling he said there is not a moment to lose we must get out of this as soon as we can  come along anna  thompson do you look after her i will see to miss greendale  just as they reached the others a volley was fired from the village by the blacks of carthews party who were armed with muskets then they with thirty other negroes rushed out with loud shouts  dont fire until they are close frank shouted now let them have it  the volley poured into them at but ten paces distance had a deadly effect the blacks paused for a moment and the rescuing party led by george lechmere and dominique rushed at them the sailors pistols cracked out and then they charged cutlass in hand  for a moment the blacks stood but the fierce attack was too much for them and they again fled to the village  stop dominique frank shouted for the big pilot who had already cut down three of his opponents was hotly pursuing them we must make for the path at once    chapter 18  in a couple of minutes they had gained it  anyone hurt frank asked  one of the boatmen had an arm broken by a bullet and two of the sailors had received spear wounds at the hands of the villagers they were not serious however and leaving george lechmere to cover the rear they started up the path dominique as usual leading the way frank following behind him with bertha who had hitherto not spoken a word  am i dreaming she asked now in a tone of bewilderment is it really you frank  you are not dreaming dear and it is certainly ifrank mallett now tell me how you got on  as well as might be frank but it was a terrible time please do not talk about it yet but how is it that you are here it seems a miracle  oh how ill you are looking and your arm is in a sling too  that is nothing he said merely a broken collarbone as to my looking ill you must remember i have had almost as anxious a time as you  then it was the osprey after all she exclaimed suddenly that we saw the last day that we were out sailing we were on deck and i was not noticingi did not notice much thenwhen anna said to me that looks like an english yacht miss i am sure mr carthew thinks she is chasing us  then i got up and looked round i could not see for certain but it did look like a yacht and i thought that it was about the size of the osprey those two men were standing with their backs to us looking at it through their glasses and carthew happened to turn round and saw me standing up and at once said you must go below i believe that is a pirate chasing us  i said that it was nothing to me if it was one pirate was just as good as another then he said that if i would not go down he should be obliged to use force and called four men aft so as it was of no use resisting we went down presently we felt that the course had been changed late in the evening we heard them fire the two guns and then some musket shots later on the man came down and told us that the pirates had tried to attack us in their boats and that they had beaten them off and that there was no further danger but for all that i could see that he was troubled  that was when i was hit dear we had not reckoned on the two guns and with only the gig and dinghy with one man killed and five of us wounded it was too stiff a business though we should have persevered but that squall came down on us from the hills and the phantom moreover left us standing still we believed that we should come up with the schooner in the morning  but how did you come here frank how did you know where we had been taken  it is a long story dear we started in pursuit four days after you had been carried off i will tell you all about it when we get safe again on board the yacht i am afraid we shall have some trouble yet now if you are quite recovered from your surprise do you feel equal to hurrying on every moment is of importance  oh yes she said he will be after us  he wont frank said george lechmere cut him down whether he killed him or not i cannot say but i dont fancy anyhow that he will be able to take up the chase it is that rascally obi man i am afraid of he has great power over the people and may raise the whole country to attack us  i am ready to run as fast as you like frank  we may as well go at a trot for a bit  then raising his voice he said  we will go at double lads now  put your arm on my shoulder bertha and we can fancy that we are going to waltz  i feel so happy that i want to cry frank she said as they started  dont do that until you get on board the osprey  as they passed the spot where they had halted george lechmere told two of the blacks to pick up the stretchers and carry them along they were merely two light poles with a wattle work formed of giant creepers worked for some six feet in length between them  what are those for bertha asked as she passed them  those are to carry you and anna along when you get exhausted it is twenty miles to the coast you know  i feel as if i could walk any distance to get on board the osprey again  i have no doubt that you have the spirit bertha but i question whether you have the strength especially after being over three months without any exercise at all i felt it myself yesterday although we did little more than ten miles  oh but then you have been wounded and you do look so ill frank  i dare say the wound had a little to do with it he said but of course the climate is trying too though it is cooler up on the hills than it is in that bay  now frank the first question of all ishow is my mother what did she do when i was missing it must have been awful for her  of course it was a terrible anxiety bertha but she bore it better than would be expected especially as she had not been well before  it troubled me more frank than even my own affairs as soon as i had time to think at all i could not imagine what she would do and the only comfort was that she had you to look after her  no doubt it was a comfort dear that she had someone to lean upon a little  halt he broke off suddenly as there was the sound of a stick breaking among the trees close by stand to your arms men and gather closely  bertha do you and anna take your place in the centre and please lie down  i cannot do that frank she said positively here you are all risking your lives for us and now you want me to put myself quite safe while you are all in danger  i want to be able to fight bertha free of anxiety and to be able to devote my whole attention to the work this i cant do if i know that you are exposed to bullets  well i cant lie down anyhow frank but anna and i will crouch down if you say that we must when they begin to fire  they were silent for two or three minutes and no sounds were heard in the wood  we shall be attacked sooner or later frank said quietly to the men we will take to the trees on our right if we are attacked from the left and to those on the left if they come at us from the right if we are attacked on both sides at once take to the right  george do you and harrison and jones get behind trees next to the path it will be your business to prevent anyone from passing on that side i with the other two will take post behind trees facing the other way the four boatmen with dominique will shelter themselves in the bushes between us with miss greendale and her maid in the middle they will be the reserve and if a rush is made from either side they will at once advance and beat it back  you understand dominique  me understand sar if those fellows come we charge at them these fellows no used to shoot sar better give muskets to others we do best with our swords  that is the best plan  you take one of the muskets george and give one to harrison the two men on my side had better have the others as i cant use one  you understand lads these will be spare arms keep them in reserve if possible so as to check the fellows when they make a rush now do you all understand  you explain it to your men dominique  now we will go on again and at the double it will be as much as those fellows can do to keep up with us in this thick wood  ten minutes passed then there was a loud shout and the blowing of a deep horn on their left followed by a yell from the wood on both sides  to the right frank shouted and the party ran in among the trees  get in among that undergrowth with anna he said to bertha  gather there dominique with your men we shall want you directly they are sure to make a rush at first  now lads one of you take that tree the other the one to the right and he placed himself behind one between them on glancing round he saw that george had already posted his two men and had taken up his station between them  all hands kneel down he said these bushes will hide us from their sight if we stand up we may be hit by shots from behind  a moment later there was a general discharge of firearms round them and then some forty negroes rushed at them  on your feet now men frank shouted take steady aim and bring down a man with each shot  a cheer broke from the sailors four shots were fired from franks side and five from george lechmeres and with them came the cracks of franks revolver followed almost directly afterwards by those of the pistols carried by the men and george lechmeres revolver  scarce a shot missed ten of the negroes fell and those attacking from the right turned and bolted among the trees the negroes on the left however inspired by the roaring of the horns and the shrieking yells of the obi man came on with greater determination and dashed across the path  now dominique at them frank shouted as with the two sailors he rushed across  the numbers now were not very uneven of the twenty negroes on that side five had fallen under the musketry and pistol fire and two others were wounded and as franks party and the blacks fell upon them they hesitated the struggle was not doubtful for a moment six of the negroes were cut down and the rest fled  dont pursue them men frank shouted and the sailors at once drew off but dominique and his black boatmen still pursued hotly overtaking and cutting down three more of their assailants  all is over for the present frank said going to the spot where bertha and anna were crouching not one of us is hurt as far as i know and we have accounted for sixteen or seventeen of these rascals  bertha got up she was a little pale but perfectly calm and quiet  it is horrid being hidden like that when you are all fighting frank she said reproachfully  we were hidden too till they came at us he said and very lucky it was for some of us would probably have been hit bad shots though they are  no frank not before all these men she remonstrated  what do i care for the men he laughed do you think if they had their sweethearts with them they would mind who was looking on  there i must be content with that for the present we must push on again  dominique had returned now with his men and the party started again at a trot as soon as the firearms had all been reloaded  we shant have any more trouble shall we bertha asked  not for the present he said we have fairly routed the blacks who came here with you and the villagers and they certainly wont attack us again until they are largely reinforced which they cannot be until we get down towards the sea for there are no villages of any size in the hills  after keeping up the pace for a mile frank ordered the men to drop into a walk again  now frank about my mother bertha asked again as soon as she had got her breath and frank related all that had taken place up to the time that the osprey sailed  then she is all alone in town it must be terrible for her waiting there without any news of me it is a pity that she did not go home it would not have mattered about me and it would have been so much better for her among her old friends they would all have sympathised with her so much  i quite agreed with her bertha and think still that it was better that she should stay in london i am sure the sympathy would do her harm rather than good as it is now she will be kept up by the belief that she is doing all in her power for you by saving you from the hideous amount of talk and chatter there would be if this affair were known  of course it would be horrid frank and perhaps you are right but it must be an awful trial  i have done all i could to set her mind at rest frank said i wrote to her directly i arrived at gibraltar and again as soon as i got the letter from madeira saying that the brigantine had touched there i wrote from madeira again with what news i could pick up and again from porto rico from the virgin islands and from san domingo of course from there i was able to say that the scent was getting hot and that i had no doubt i should not be long before i fell in with the brigantine then i sent another letter from jaquemel that seems to me a long time ago for we have done so much since but it is not more than ten days back we will post another letter the first time that we touch anywhere on the off chance of its going home by a mail steamer and getting there before us  it was wonderful your finding out that i had been carried off in the phantom that was what troubled me most except about mother i did not see how you could guess that the brigantine we had both noticed the day before was the phantom i felt sure that you would suspect who it was but i could not see how you would connect the two together  you see i did not guess it at first he replied i felt sure that it was carthew from the first minute when i found that you had not landed and it was just the luck of finding out that the phantoms crew had returned and that they had been paid off at ostend that put me on the track of course directly i heard that she had been altered and turned into a brigantine i felt sure that she was the craft that we had noticed and as soon as i learned through lloyds that she had sailed south from the lizard i felt certain that she must have gone up the mediterranean or to the west indies i felt sure it was the latter however it was a great relief when i got a letter from lloyds agent at madeira telling me that the brigantine had touched there and i felt certain that i should hear of you either here or at one of the south american ports  they kept on until they reached the hut at the point where the path forked it was found to be empty  open the basket frank said we must have a meal before we go further we have come about half the distance  now bertha there is the bay you see and it is all downhill which is a comfort do you feel tired dear  not tired she said but my feet are aching a bit you see i had thin deck shoes on when we were hurried ashore and they are not good for walking long distances in  well we will have a quarter of an hours rest he said it is getting dark fast and by the time we go on it will be night and will be a great deal cooler than it has been  i can go on at once if you like she said  no dear there is no use in hurrying we may as well stop half an hour as a quarter dont you hear that  the girl listened  it is a horn is it not she asked after a pause  yes i can hear it in half a dozen directions he said that scoundrel of an obi man is down there ahead of us and that unearthly row he and his followers are making will rouse up all the villagers within hearing we will try to give him the slip i intend to take the path we came by for four or five miles and then to strike off by one to the right and hit the main road to port au prince a good bit to the east of where we quitted it the country is all cultivated there and we will strike down towards the bay and make our way through the fields and if we have luck we may be able to get down to the place where the gig will be waiting for us without meeting any of them  oh i do hope there will be no more fighting frank you may not all get off as well as you did last time  we must take our chance of that dear at any rate the country will be open and we shall be able to keep in a solid body and i have no doubt that we shall be able to beat them off  could we not go down to the shore and get a boat somewhere and row to the yacht  yes we might manage that perhaps that is a capital idea bertha there is a place called nipes twelve or fourteen miles east of our inlet it wont be very much further to go for we have been bearing eastward all the way here making sure that we shall go straight for the yacht they will gather in that direction first and wont think of giving the alarm so far east there was a path if i remember right that came up from that direction a quarter of a mile further on we will turn off by it  as soon as the meal was over they started again they found the path frank had spoken of and followed it down until they came among trees then dominique lighted his lantern again  for a time the two women kept on travelling but after five miles bertha was compelled to stop and take off her shoes altogether for two miles further she refused the offers to carry her but at last was forced to own that she could go no further  the two litters were at once brought up and the four sailors dominique and the three uninjured boatmen lifted them and went along at a trot george lechmere leading the way with a lantern the weight of the girls divided between four strong men was a mere trifle and they now made much more rapid progress than they had before and in three quarters of an hour arrived at nipes  as they got to the little town bertha and anna got out and walked so as to attract as little attention as possible among the negroes in the streets dominique answered all questions stating that they were a party belonging to a ship in marsouin bay that they had been on a sporting expedition over the hills and had lost their way and now wanted a boat to take them back  as soon as they reached the strand half a dozen were offered to them dominique chose the one that looked the fastest he told the boatman that the ladies were very tired and they wanted to get back as soon as possible and he must therefore engage ten men to row as the wind was so slight as to be useless  as he did not haggle about terms the bargain was speedily concluded and in a few minutes they put off the men animated by the handsome rate of pay they were to receive rowed hard and in a little over two hours they entered the inlet at the end of which the osprey was lying as they neared the end the boatmen were surprised at seeing a large number of people with torches on the rising ground and something like panic seized them when they heard the obi horns sounding they dropped their oars at once  tell them to row on dominique frank said and to keep close along the opposite side tell them that if they dont do so we will shoot them no tell them that we will chuck them overboard and row on ourselves  there is the place where we landed frank said presently to bertha the men had resumed their rowing just under where you see that clump of torches  ah there is our boat he broke off suddenly as it appeared in the line of the reflection of the torches on the water  it was half a mile away lying a few hundred yards from shore he took out the dog whistle that he used when coming down to the landing stage to summon the boat from the yacht and blew it there was a stir in the boat and a moment later it was speeding towards them  row on dominique she will pick us up in no time  and long before they reached the osprey the gig was alongside  thank god that you are back sir they cried as they came abreast we have been in terrible anxiety about you have you succeeded sir  dont cheer i want to get back to the yacht before they know that we are here yes thank god i have succeeded miss greendale and her maid are on board  a low cheer which even his order could not entirely suppress came from the three men in the boat the mate was himself rowing stroke  we did not dare bring any more hands sir he said there has been such a hubbub on shore for the last hour and a half that we thought it likely that they and the phantoms people might be going to attack us we rowed to the landing at ten oclock as you ordered us but in a short time a party of men came along close to the water and as soon as they saw us they opened fire on us and we had to row off sharp we have been lying off here since we did not see how you could get down through that lot but we thought it better to wait i did think there was just a hope that you might make your way down to the coast somewhere else and come on in a shore boat  well here we are sir  as he spoke they came alongside the osprey  is it you sir hawkins asked eagerly  look here lads frank replied standing up above all things i dont want any cheering or any noise whatever i dont want them to know that we have got on board i know that you will all rejoice with me for i have brought off miss greendale and none of our party except one of the boatmen has been wounded in any way seriously  there was a murmur of deep satisfaction from the crew as bertha stepped on deck the men crowded round with low exclamations of god bless you miss this is a good day indeed for us  bertha in reply to the greeting shook hands all round  i see you have not put out the lights in the cabin yet hawkins i will just go down with miss greendale and see that she is comfortable and then i will come up again  oh frank the girl exclaimed bursting into tears as they entered the saloon this is happiness indeed i feel at home already  frank remained with her for three or four minutes  now dear take possession of your old cabin again no doubt anna is there already she had better share it with you  now i must go up and finish with the phantom at once do not be afraid i shall take them by surprise and there will be very little fighting  and without waiting for remonstrance he hurried on deck  are the men armed hawkins  that they are sir we have been expecting an attack every minute there have been three or four shore boats going off to the brigantine within the last quarter of an hour  i am going to be beforehand with them hawkins  theyve got both those guns pointing this way sir  i am not coming from this way to attack them hawkins i am going to put all hands in that native craft i came in row off a little distance from this side then make a circuit and come down on the other side of them i will leave george lechmere here with four men with three muskets apiece so that if they should start before we get there they can keep them off until we arrive if i can get a few of the boatmen to enlist i will do so  he spoke to dominique who went to the side and asked  if any of you are disposed to stop here to guard the craft for a quarter of an hour in case she is attacked the gentleman here will pay twenty dollars a man but remember that you may have to fight  the whole crew rose twenty dollars was a fortune to them  come on board then dominique said  i dont know whether these fellows are to be trusted george but i hope you wont be attacked keep these fifteen muskets for yourselves put four apiece by the bulwarks and station yourselves by them keep your eyes on these boatmen put the oars of the boat handy for them and let them arm themselves with them if you are attacked an oar is not a bad weapon for repelling boarders  all right major i will station two of them between each of us  by this time the captain had picked out the four men that were to remain and had the rest drawn up in readiness to get into the boat  get in quietly lads frank said ten of you man the oars we will put an end to the phantoms wanderings tonight  that we will sir was the hearty rejoinder of the men  frank took the tiller and they rowed straight away from the osprey for a hundred yards when frank steered towards the right bank where there were no torches and where all was quiet the brigantine could be seen plainly standing up against the glare of the torches on the other side they rowed three or four hundred yards beyond her then taking a turn approached her on the side opposite to that facing the osprey three native boats like their own were lying beside her and there was a crowd of men on her deck  frank brought her round alongside of these boats he had already ordered that firearms were not to be used in the first place  i dont want to kill any of these blacks he said they have nothing to do with the affair and they believe us to be pirates i expect that we shall get on board unnoticed then with a cheer go at them with the flat of your cutlasses you can use the edge on the whites if they resist but i expect that the blacks will all jump overboard in a panic and that then the whites seeing that they are outnumbered will surrender  no one indeed noticed them there was a great hubbub and confusion and the captain was endeavouring to get them into something like order when suddenly there was a loud cheer and franks party fell upon them yells of terror rose as the sailors dominique and his blacks sprang among them striking heavily with the flat of their cutlasses and the sailors using their fists freely frank had brought with him a heavy belaying pin and used it with great effect  the blacks in the panic fell over each other and rushing to the side jumped overboard some into their boats and some into the water the white sailors carried away by the stampede and separated from each other were unable to act the captain drawing a brace of pistols from his belt fired one shot but before he could fire another frank hurled the iron belaying pin at him it struck him in the face and he fell insensible the belgian sailors seeing themselves altogether outnumbered and without a leader threw down their arms  tie their hands and feet frank ordered and bundle them into one of the native boats  two of these had pushed off and lay fifty yards away and the sea was dotted with the heads of swimmers making towards them the belgian sailors were placed in the other boat  put their captain in too frank said he will come round presently  now four of you jump into our boat and cast her off  captain will you look about for the oil and pour it over all the beds but dont set them on fire until i give the order  now lads two of you run below and get the cushions off the starboard sofa  purvis get the skylight open on the port side and wheel the two guns round and point them down into the cabin i will train them myself on the same spot just at the back of that seat they might come off and extinguish the fire though i dont think they will but we will make sure by blowing a hole through her side under the water line  five minutes were sufficient to make the preparations and the captain came up and reported that all was ready  i have heaped up all the bedding on the floor sir and poured plenty of oil over it he said  very well then take two men aft and begin there and work your way forward and finish with the focsle hammocks you can begin at once  in a minute there was a glare of light through the stern cabin skylight while almost at the same moment a dense cloud of smoke poured up the companion then the light shone up through the bullseyes on deck of the other staterooms then the captain and the two hands ran through the saloon forward frank went to the focastle hatch and stooping down saw the captain apply the fire to a great heap of bedding  that will do hawkins he said come up at once with the men or you will be suffocated down there  they ran up on deck and a minute later a volume of flame burst out through the hatch frank went to the guns and lighting two matches gave one to hawkins  now he said both together  the two reports were blended in one and as the smoke cleared away frank could see by the cabin lamp that was still burning a spurt of water shooting up from a ragged hole at the back of the sofa fired at such a short distance the bullets with which the guns were crammed had struck like solid shot  into the boats men frank shouted  shall we take these chaps off with us sir the captain said they will be keepsakes  all right hawkins in with them  the tongue of fire leaping up from the forecastle followed by the discharge of the guns had been the first intimation to those on the osprey of what had happened bertha and her maid ran up on deck at the sound of the cannon  what is that the former asked in alarm  it is all right miss greendale george lechmere said leaving the side and coming up to her the major has captured the brigantine almost without fighting there was only one pistol shot fired i did not hear a single clash of a sword and the blacks on board jumped straight into the water i was just coming to call you as you came up the brigantine is well on fire you see  but i thought i heard the cannon  yes the major has fired them down the skylight so as to make sure of her do you see miss they are putting the guns in the boat now they will be back here in a few minutes  by the time the boat came alongside the flames from the after skylight had lit the mainsail and were running up the rigging a minute later they burst out from the companion and the skylight  thank god that is all over frank bertha said as they stood together watching the sight  the inlet was now lit up from side to side on shore a state of wild excitement prevailed the boats had reached the shore and the negroes there had rushed down to hear what had taken place and to inquire after friends above the yells and shouts of the frenzied negroes sounded the deep roar of the horns and the angry beating of the obi drums numbers of torch bearers were among the crowd and although nearly half a mile away the scene could be perfectly made out from the yacht  the boatmen had received their promised pay as soon as frank had reached the yacht and had taken their places in their boat but dominique told frank that they would not go till the osprey sailed as they were afraid of being pursued and attacked by the villagers boats if they did so    chapter 19  as frank stood gazing at the scene george lechmere touched him frank looking round saw that he wished to speak to him privately  what is it george he asked when he had stepped a few paces from bertha  look there major george said handing him a field glass i thought i had settled old scores with him but the devil has looked after his own  you dont mean to say george that it is carthew again  it is he sure enough sir i would have sworn that i had done for him if i had thought there had been the slightest doubt about it i would have put a pistol ball through his head  frank raised the glass to his eyes just where the torches were thickest he could make out a mans figure raised above the heads of the rest he was supported on a litter his head was swathed with bandages he had raised himself into a sitting position supported by one arm while he waved the other passionately he was evidently haranguing the crowd  as frank looked he saw the figure sink down then there was a deep roll of the drum and a fantasticlooking figure daubed as it seemed with paint and wearing a huge mask appeared in his place the drum and the horns were silent and the shouting of the negroes was at once hushed this man too harangued the crowd and when he ceased there was a loud yell and a general movement among the throng at that moment hawkins came up  the chain is up and down sir shall i make sail the wind is very light but i think that it is enough to take her out  yes make sail hawkins as quickly as you can i am afraid that those fellows are coming out to attack us and i dont want to kill any of the poor devils there is a small boat coming out from the shore towards that craft the white sailors are on board and we shall have them on us too  up with the anchor hawkins shouted make sail at once look sharp my hearties work with a will or we shall have those niggers on us again  never was sail made on the osprey more quickly and by the time that the anchor was apeak all the lower sails were set  shall i tell the blacks to tow their boat behind us hawkins asked frank as the yacht began to steal through the water  no let them tow alongside hawkins i dont suppose the people ashore know that we have a native boat with us if they did they would be sure that it came from nipes and it might set up a feud and cost them their lives especially as that obi scoundrel is concerned in the affair  then he moved away to george lechmere  dont say a word about that fellow carthew he said miss greendale thinks he is killed and it is just as well that she should continue to think that she is safe from him in the future  so far as she is concerned i think that is true but i would not answer for you major you have ruined his plans and burned his yacht and as long as he lives he will never forgive you  well it is of no use to worry about it now george but i expect that we shall hear more about him someday  what are they doing frank bertha asked as he rejoined her i think that they are getting into the boats again  yes i fancy they are going to try to take us but they have no more chance of doing so than they have of flying the obi man has worked them up to a state of frenzy but it will evaporate pretty quickly when they get within range of our muskets  but we have got the cannon on board have we not  yes but we did not bring off any ammunition with us it was the mens idea to bring them as a trophy however i have plenty of powder and can load them with bullets but i certainly wont use them if it can be possibly avoided i have no grudge against the poor fellows who have been told that we are desperate pirates and who are only doing what they believe to be a meritorious action in trying to capture us  in a few minutes six boats put out from the shore the osprey was not going through the water more than two miles an hour though she had every stitch of canvas spread frank had the guns taken aft and loaded as the boats came within the circle of the light of the burning yacht it could be seen that they were crowded with men who encouraged themselves with defiant yells and shouts which excited the derision of the ospreys crew when they got within a quarter of a mile they opened a fusillade of musketry but the balls dropped in the water some distance astern of the yacht as the boats came nearer however they began to drop round her  sit down behind the bulwarks frank said they are not good shots but a stray ball might come on board and there is no use running risks  by this time he had persuaded bertha to go below the boats rowed on until some seventy or eighty yards off the osprey the shouting had gradually died away for the silence on board the yacht oppressed them there was something unnatural about it and their superstitious fear of the obi man disappeared before their dread of the unknown  as if affected simultaneously by the disquietude of their companions the rowers all stopped work at the same moment dominique had already received instructions and at once hailed them in french  if you value your lives turn back we have the guns of the brigantine they are crammed with bullets and are pointed at you the owner has but to give the word and you will all be blown to pieces he is a good man and wishes you no harm we have come here not to quarrel with you poor ignorant black fellows but to rescue two ladies the villain that ship belongs to had carried off therefore go away back to your wives and families while you are able to for if you come but one foot nearer not one of you will live to return  the news that the osprey had the cannon from the brigantine on board came like a thunderbolt upon the negroes the prospect of a fight with the men who had so easily captured the brigantine was unpleasant enough but that they were also to encounter cannon was altogether too much for them and a general shout of dont fire we go back rose from the boats  for a minute or two they lay motionless afraid even to dip an oar in the water lest it should bring down a storm upon them but as the osprey glided slowly away the rearmost boat began to turn round the others followed her example and they were soon rowing back even more rapidly than they had come  you can cast off that boat hawkins as soon as we are out into the bay frank said and then went down below  our troubles are all over at last dear and we can have a quiet talk he said as i expected the negroes lost heart as soon as they came near and the threat of a round of grape from the guns finally settled them they are off for home and we shall hear no more of them now you had best be off to bed at once you have had a terrible day of it and it is just two oclock  ah that is right he broke off as the steward entered carrying a tray with tea things i had forgotten all about that necessity you had better call anna in she must want a cup too poor girl  yes i should like a cup of tea bertha said as she sat down to the tray but i really dont feel so tired as you would think  you will feel it all the more afterwards i am afraid frank replied the excitement has kept you up  yes we felt dreadfully tired didnt we anna before we gave up but the two hours row in the boat and all this excitement here have made me almost forget it it seems to me now quite impossible that it can be only about nine hours since you rushed out so suddenly with your men it seems to me quite far off further than many things do that happened a week ago and please to remember that your advice to go to bed is quite as seasonable in your case as in mine  when he had seen them leave the saloon frank went on deck for a last look round  i dont think that there is a chance of anything happening before morning hawkins but you will of course keep a sharp lookout and let me know  i will look out sir i have sent the four hands who were with you down to their berths as soon as the niggers turned back lechmere has turned in too  is the wind freshening at all  not yet sir i dont suppose that we shall get more than we have now till day begins to break still we are crawling on and shall be out in the bay in another quarter of an hour  when frank got up at sunrise he found that the yacht was just rounding the point of the bay he looked behind no boat was in view  nothing moving i see he said as the first mate who was in charge came up  we have not seen a thing on the water sir  i hardly expected that there would be it is probable that as soon as the boats got back carthew sent his skipper or mate off with a couple of the men to port au prince to lay a complaint for piracy against me but even if they got horses it would take them a couple of days to get there that is if they are not much better riders than the majority of sailors are then it is likely that there would be some time lost in formalities and even if there was a government steamer lying in the port it would take her a long time to get up steam moreover i am by no means sure that even carthew would venture on such an impudent thing as that it is certain that we should get into a bad scrape for boarding and burning a vessel in haytian waters but that is all the harm he could do us the british consul would certainly be more likely to believe the story of the owner of a royal squadron yacht backed by that of her captain mates and crew and by miss greendale and her maid than the tale of the owner of a vessel that could give no satisfactory explanation for being here besides he will know that before a steamer could start in chase we should be certainly two or perhaps three days away and whether we should make for jamaica or bermuda or round the northwestern point of the bay and then for england he could have no clue whatever  how shall i lay her course sir the wind has freshened already and we are slipping through the water at a good four knots now  we will keep along this side as far as the point at any rate if carthew has sent for a steamer he is likely to have ordered a man down to this headland to see which course we are taking when we have got so far that we cannot be made out from there we will sail north for cape la mole i think it would be safe enough to lay our course at once but i do not wish to run the slightest risk that can be avoided  the wind continued to freshen and to franks satisfaction they were when bertha came on deck at eight oclock running along the coast at seven knots an hour  have you slept well he asked as he took her hand  yes i thought when i lay down that it would be impossible for me to sleep at allit had been such a wonderful day it was all so strange so sudden and so happyand just as i was thinking so i suppose i dropped off and slept till anna woke me three quarters of an hour ago and told me what time it was  frank i did not say anything yesterday not even a single word of thanks for all that you have done for me but you know very well that it was not because i did not feel it but because if i had said anything at all i should have broken down and that was the very thing that i knew i ought not to do but you know dont you that i shall have all my life to prove how thankful i am  i know dear and between us surely nothing need be said i am as thankful that i have been the means of saving you as you can be that i was almost miraculously enabled to follow your track so successfully  breakfast is ready sir the steward announced from the companion  coming steward  i have told them bertha to lay for three i thought that it would be pleasanter for you to have anna with you at meals as i suppose she has taken them with you since you were carried off  thank you she said gratefully it wont be quite so nice for you i know but perhaps it will be better  well anna you are looking very well frank said as he sat down  you must officiate with the coffee bertha i will see after the eatables  yes anna does look well bertha said she has borne up capitally ever since the first two days we have had all our meals together in our cabin  miss greendale has been a great deal braver than i have sir anna said quietly she has been wonderfully brave and though she is very good to say that i have borne up well i know very well that i have not been as brave as i ought and i could not help breaking down and crying sometimes for i did think that we should never get home again  except carrying you away carthew did not behave altogether so badly bertha  no the first day that we got on board he told me that i was to stay there until i consented to marry him i told him that in that case i should become a permanent resident on board but that sooner or later i should be rescued he only said then that he hoped that i should change my mind in time he admitted that his conduct had been inexcusable but that his love for me had driven him to it and that he had only won me as many a knight had won a bride before now  at first i made sure that when we put into a port i should be able somehow to make my condition known but i realised for the first time what it was going to be when i saw us stand off the lizard and lay her head for the south up to that time i had scarcely exchanged a word with him i had said at once that unless i had my meals in my own cabin with anna i would eat nothing at all and he said quite courteously i must confess that i should in all respects do as i pleased consistent with safety  from that time he said good morning gravely when i came up on deck with anna and made a remark about the weather i made no reply and did not speak until he came to me in the morning and said quietly that is the lizard astern of us miss greendale we are bound for the west indies the finest cruising ground in the world full of quiet little bays where we can anchor for weeks  it is monstrous i said desperately for i own that for the first time i was really frightened some day you will be punished for this  i must risk that he said quietly of course at present you are angry it is natural that you should be so but in time you will forgive me and will make allowance for the length to which my affection for you has driven me it may be six months it may be ten years but however long it may be i can promise you that save for this initial offence you will have no cause to complain of me i am possessed of boundless patience and can wait for an indefinite time in the end i feel sure that your heart will soften towards me  that was his tone all along he was perfectly respectful perfectly polite sometimes for days not a word would be exchanged between us sometimes he would come up and talk or rather try to talk for it was seldom that he got any answer from me as a rule i sat in my deck chair with anna beside me and he sat on the other side of the deck or walked up and down smoking or talking with that man who was with him  so it went on till the afternoon when we saw you as i told you he made us go down at once i could see that he was furiously angry and excited the steward came to our cabin early in the morning and said that mr carthew requested that we would dress and come up at once as i was anxious to know what was going on i did so and he said when we came on deck i am very sorry miss greendale but i have to ask you to go on shore with us at once  i had no idea where we were save that it was somewhere in the island of san domingo but i was ready enough to go ashore thinking that i might see some white people that i could appeal to  i did speak to some negroes as we landed but he said it is of no use your speaking to them miss greendale for none of them understands any language but his own  i saw that they did not understand me at any rate i was frightened when i saw that four of the sailors were going with us and that a dozen of the blacks armed with muskets also formed round us i said that i would not go afoot but carthew answered  it would pain me greatly were i obliged to take such a step but if you will not go there is no course open to me but to have you carried i am sorry that it should be so but for various reasons it is imperative that you should take up your abode on shore for the present  seeing that it was useless to resist i started with him a short distance on two blacks came up with the horses which had evidently been sent for we mounted and were taken up among the hills to the place where you found us every mile that we went i grew more frightened for it seemed to me that it was infinitely worse being in his power up in those hills than on board his yacht where something might happen by which i might be released from him those huts you saw had been built beforehand so that he had evidently been preparing to take us there if there should be any reason for leaving the yacht there was bedding and a couple of chairs and a table in ours  in the morning while still speaking politely he made it evident to me that he considered he could take a stronger tone than before  i assure you miss greendale he said that this poor hut is but a temporary affair i will shortly have a more comfortable one erected for you you see your residence here is likely to be a long one unless you change your mind pray do not nourish any idea that you can someday escape me it is out of the question and certainly no white man is ever likely to come to this valley nor is any negro except those who live in this village its head is an obi man whose will is law to the negroes their belief in his power is unlimited and i believe that they imagine that he could slay them with the look of his eye or turn them into frogs or toads by his magic power i pray you to think the matter over seriously why should you waste your life here you did not always regard me as so hateful and the love that i bear you is unchangeable even could you months or years hence make your escape which i regard as impossible what would your position be if you returned to england what story would you have to tell it might be a true one but would it be believed  i have my maid sir i said passionately who would confirm my report of what i have suffered  no doubt she would he said quietly but a maids testimony as to her mistresss doings does not go for very much i endeavoured to make the voyage which i foresaw might be a long one pleasant to you by requesting you to bring her with you and i believe that ladies who elope not unfrequently take their maids with them but we need not discuss that this valley will be your home miss greendale until you consent to leave it as my wife i do not say that i shall always share your solitude here i shall cruise about and may even for a time return to england but that will in no way alter your position i have been in communication with the obi gentleman since i first put into the bay and he has arranged to take charge of your safety while i am away he is not a pleasant man to look at and i have no doubt that he is an unmitigated scoundrelbut his powers are unlimited if he ordered his followers to offer you and your maid as sacrifices to his fetish they would carry out his orders not only willingly but joyfully he is a gentleman who like his class has a keen eye to the main chance and will i doubt not take every precaution to prevent a source of considerable income from escaping him  you understand he went on in a different manner i do not wish to threaten youvery far from it i have endeavoured from the time that you set foot on board to make you as comfortable as possible and to abstain from thrusting myself upon you in the slightest degree and i shall always pursue the same course but please understand that nothing will shake my resolution it will pain me deeply to have to keep you in a place like this but keep you i must until you consent to be mine you must see yourself the hopelessness as well as the folly of holding out on the one side is a life wasted here on the other you will be the wife of a man who loves you above all things who has risked everything by the step that he has taken and who when you consent will devote his life to your happiness you will be restored to your friends and to your position and nought will be known except that we made a runaway match as many have done before us do not answer now at any rate i will remain here for a couple of months and by the end of that time you may see that the alternative is not so terrible a one  then without another word he turned and walked away and nothing further passed between us until in the afternoon when you so suddenly arrived  thank god he behaved better than i should have given him credit for frank said when she had finished he must have felt absolutely certain that there was no chance whatever of your rescue and that in time you would be forced to accept him or he would hardly have refrained from pushing his suit more urgently his calculations were well made and if we had not noticed that brigantine at cowes and i had not had the luck to come upon some of his crew and pick up his track he might have been successful  you dont think that i should ever have consented to marry him bertha said indignantly  i am sure that such a thought never entered your head bertha but you cannot tell what the effect of a hopeless captivity would have had upon you the fellow had judged you well and he saw that the attitude of respect he adopted would afford him a far better chance of winning you than roughness or threats would do but he might have resorted to them afterwards and you were so wholly and absolutely in his power that you would almost have been driven to accept the alternative and become his wife  she shook her head decidedly  i would have killed him first she said i suppose some girls would say i would have killed myself but i should not have thought of thatat any rate not until i had failed to kill him every woman has the same right to defend herself that a man has and i should have no more felt that i was to blame if i had killed him than you would do when you killed a man who had done you no individual harm in battle  we only want mamma here she said a little later as she took her seat in a deck chair to complete the illusion that we are sailing along somewhere on the devonshire coast the hills are higher and more wooded but the general idea is the same i suppose i ought to feel it very shocking cruising about with you without anyone but anna with me but somehow it does not feel so  no wonder dear you see we have been looking forward to doing exactly the same thing in the spring  i think we had better not talk about that now she said flushing i intend to make believe till we get to england that mamma is down below and that i may be called at any moment how long shall we be before we are there  i cannot say bertha i shall have a talk with hawkins presently as to what course we had better take it may be best to sail to bermuda if we find a mail steamer about to start from there we might go home in it and get there a fortnight earlier than we should do in the yacht perhaps more however that we can talk over i can see there may be difficulties but undoubtedly the sooner you are home the better you see we are well in november now  what day is it he reflected  i have lost all count frank  he consulted a pocketbook  today is the twentyfirst of november i should think that if we get favourable winds we might make bermuda in a weekten days at the outside and if we could catch a steamer a day or two after getting there you might be able to spend your christmas at greendale  that would be very nice the difficulty would be that i might afterwards meet some of the people who were with us on the steamer  it would not be likely he said still we can talk it over at any rate from the bermudas we can send a letter to your mother and set her mind at rest  the captain and purvis consulting the book of sailing directions came to the conclusion that the passage via the bermudas would be distinctly the best and shortest the wind was abeam and steady and with all sail set the osprey maintained a speed of nine knots an hour until bermuda was in sight they were still undecided as to whether they had better go home by the mail but it was settled for them by their finding on entering the port that the steamer had touched there the day before and gone on the same evening and that it was not probable that any other steamer would be sailing for england for another ten days  they stopped only long enough to lay in a store of fresh provisions and water of which the supply was now beginning to run very short indeed had not the wind been so steady all hands would have been placed on half rations of water  bertha did not land she was nervously afraid of meeting anyone who might recognise her afterwards and six hours after entering the port the osprey was again under way the wind as is usual at barbadoes was blowing from the southwest and it held with them the whole way home so that after a remarkably quick run they dropped anchor off southampton on the fifteenth of december frank had already made all arrangements with the captain to lay up the osprey at once  i shall want her out again in the first week in april so that she will not be long in winter quarters  on landing frank despatched a telegram to lady greendale  returned all safe and well just starting for town shall be with you about six oclock  the train was punctual and five minutes before six frank arrived with bertha at lady greendales he had already told bertha that he should not come in  it is much better that you should be alone with her for a time she will have innumerable questions to ask and would of course prefer to have you to herself i will come round tomorrow morning after breakfast  anna had been instructed very carefully by her mistress not to say anything of what had happened and in order that she might avoid questions george lechmere had seen her into a cab for liverpool street as she wished to spend a week with some friends at chelmsford then she was to join bertha at greendale  frank went to his chambers where george lechmere had driven with the luggage the next morning he went early to lady greendales so early that he found her and bertha at breakfast  my dear frank the former said embracing him warmly how can i ever thank you for all that you have done for us bertha has been telling me all about how you rescued her i hear that you were wounded too  the wound was of no great importance and as you see i have thrown aside my sling this morning yes we went through some exciting adventures which will furnish us with a store of memories all our lives  how have you been lady greendale i am glad to see that at any rate you are looking well  i have had a terribly anxious time of it as you may suppose but your letters were always so bright and hopeful that they helped me wonderfully the first fortnight was the worst your letter from gibraltar was a great relief and of course the next saying that you had heard that the yacht really did touch at madeira showed that you were on the right track when you wrote from madeira i sent to wilds for the largest map of the west indies that they had and thus when i got your letters i was able to follow your course and understand all about it you are looking better than when i saw you last  you should have seen him when i first met him mamma i hardly knew him he looked so thin and worn but during the last three weeks he has filled out again and he seems to me to be looking quite himself  and bertha is looking well too  so i ought to do mamma i dont think i ever looked very bad in spite of my troubles and the splendid voyage we have had would have set anyone up  it has been a wonderful comfort to me lady greendale said that i have met hardly anyone that i know the last three weeks or so i have met two or three people but i only said that i was up in town for a short time of course they asked after you and i said that you were not with me as you were spending a short time with some people whom you knew we intend to go down home tomorrow  the best thing that you can do lady greendale i shall be down for christmas and the first week in april you know i am to carry her off so you see this excursion of ours has not altered any of our plans    chapter 20  christmas passed off quietly as soon as it was known that lady greendale had returned the neighbours called and for the next few months there was the usual round of dinner parties to all remarks as to the length of time that she had been away lady greendale merely replied that bertha had been staying among friends and that as she herself had not been in very good health she had preferred staying in town where she could always find a physician close at hand if she needed one  it was not until they had been back for more than a month that the engagement between bertha and major mallett was announced by lady greendale to her friends and it was generally supposed that it had but just taken place the announcement gave great satisfaction for the general opinion had been that bertha would get engaged in london and that greendale would be virtually lost to the county  the marriage was to take place in april  there is no reason for a long delay lady greendale explained they have known each other ever since bertha was a child they intend to spend their honeymoon on board major malletts yacht the osprey and will go up the mediterranean until the heat begins to get too oppressive when they talk about sailing round the islands or at any rate cruising for some time off the west of scotland  about the same time george lechmere in a rather mysterious manner told frank that he wished for a few minutes conversation with him  what is it george anything wrong with the cellar  no sir it is not that the fact is that anna parsons miss greendales maid you know and i have settled to get married too  capital george i am heartily glad of it frank said shaking him warmly by the hand  i never thought that i should get to care for anyone again but you see we were thrown a good deal together on the voyage home and i dont know how it came about but we had pretty well arranged it before we got back and now we have settled it altogether  i am not surprised to hear it george i rather fancied from what i saw on board that something was likely to come of it it is the best thing by far for you  well sir as i said i never thought that i should care for anyone else but i am sure that i shall make a better husband now than i should have done had i married five years ago  that i am sure you will you have had a rough lesson and it has made a great impression and i doubt whether your marriage would have been a happy one had you married then after what you told me of your jealous temper now i am sure that neither anna nor anyone else could wish for a better husband than you will make well now what are you thinking of doing for i suppose you have thought it over well  that is what we cannot quite settle major i should like to stay with you all my life just as i am  i dont see that you could do thatat least not in your present condition there is no farm vacant and if there were one i must give the late tenants son the option of it that has always been the rule on the estate however we need not settle on that at present when are you going to get married i should like it to be at the same time as we are i am sure that miss greendale would be pleased we both owe you a great deal and as you know i regard you as my closest friend  thank you major but i am sure that neither anna nor i would care to be married before a church full of grand people and we have agreed that we wont do it until after you come back from your trip miss bertha has promised anna that she shall go with her as her maid and of course major i shall want to go with you  well you might get married the week before and still go with us  george shook his head  i think that it would be better the other way major we will go with you as we are and get married after you come back  the next day frank had a long talk with mr norton  well sir your plan would suit me very well nothing could be better said the old steward in fact i was going to tell you that i was beginning to find that the outdoor work was getting too much for me and that though i should be very sorry to give it up altogether i must either arrange with you to have help or else find a successor i am sure that the arrangement you propose would suit me exactly  george lechmere would be just the man for the work we used to think him the best judge of livestock in the county and he is a good allround farmer if he were to take the work of the home farm off my hands i could keep on very well with the rest of the estate for another two or three years and as he would act as my assistant he would by the end of that time be quite capable of taking it over altogether i should then move into chippenham we have two married daughters living and now that we have no one at home my wife has been saying for some time that she would rather settle there than go on living in the country and there is really no more occasion for me to go on working so as soon as lechmere has got the whole thing in hand i shall be quite ready to hand it over to him  well i am very glad that it is so norton of course i should never have made any change until you yourself were perfectly willing to give it up but as you are willing i am certainly glad to be able to put him into it as you know he saved my life and has done me many other great services and i regard him as a friend and want to keep him near me of course he will go into the farmhouse and after you retire he can either move into yours or remain there as he likes naturally as long as you live norton i shall continue the rate of pay you have always had you were over thirty years with my father and i should certainly make no difference in that respect  well george i have arranged your business frank said that evening norton is getting on in life now and he begins to find his work in winter a little too hard for him so i have arranged that you are to take the management of the home farm altogether off his hands and will of course establish yourself at the house you will be a sort of assistant to him in other matters and get up the work and in the course of a couple of years at the outside he will retire altogether and you will be steward if you like you can work the home farm on your own account but that will be for your consideration how do you think that you will like that  i should like it above everything major and i am grateful to you indeed  well i am glad that you like the arrangement george i had it in my mind when i was talking to you two days ago but until i saw norton and found that he was willing to retire i did not propose it  towards the end of february lady greendale and bertha went up to town for a fortnight intimating to frank that they would be so busy with important business that his presence there would not be desired he however travelled with them to london and then went round to southampton where he had a consultation with the firm in whose yard the yacht was laid up and the head of the great upholstering firm there and arranged for material alterations in the plans of the cabins and their redecoration everything was to be completed by the beginning of april he had written to hawkins to meet him on board  you must have everything ready by the fifth he said we shall arrive late in the afternoon or perhaps in the evening of the fifth and shall get under way next morning i hope that you have been able to get the same crew  there is no fear of their not all coming sir except purvis he has been bad all the winter and i doubt whether he will be able to go with us  i am sorry to hear that tell him that i shall make him an allowance of a pound a week for the season and that i shall give him a little pension of ten shillings a week as long as he lives i shall consider that all who went with me on that cruise to the west indies have a claim upon me  the time for the wedding approached there was some consultation between frank and lady greendale as to whether the dinner to the tenants should be given on that occasion or on their return and it was settled that it would be more convenient to postpone it  i am sure they would rather have you and bertha here and it would be much more convenient in every way we have so much to think about now and there will be so many arrangements to be made  i quite agree with you i will put it all in the hands of rafters of chippenham i think that it is only right to give it to local people we shall want two big marquees one for your tenants and mine and their wives and families and the other for all the labourers and farm servants  and there must be another for all the children bertha put in  very well bertha  then of course we must have a military band and fireworks and we had better have a big platform put down for those who like to dance and a lot of shows and things for the elders and children and a conjurer with a big lucky basket and things of that sort of course at present one cannot give even an approximate date but i will tell them that they shall have a fortnights notice  i wonder what has become of carthew major george lechmere said as he was having a last talk with frank on the eve of the wedding he will gnash his teeth when he sees it in the papers  i have thought of him a good many times george he is an evil scoundrel and nothing would please me more than to hear that he was dead when i remember how many years he kept up his malice against me for having beaten him in a fight i know how intense must be his hatred of me now that i have thwarted all his plans and burned his yacht it is not that i am afraid of him personally but there is no saying what form his vengeance will take for that he will sooner or later try to be revenged i feel absolutely certain  i have often thought of it myself sir perhaps he is out in hayti still  no chance of that george miss greendale said that he told her that he had money sufficient to pay for a ten years cruise that may have been a lie but he must have had money sufficient to last him for some time anyhow and you may be sure that he took it on shore with him he may have died from the effects of that wound you gave him but if he is alive i have no doubt that he is in england somewhere of course he would not show himself where he was known having been a heavy defaulter last year but he may have let his beard grow and so disguised himself that he would not be easily recognised as to what he is doing of course i have not the slightest idea but we may be quite sure that he is not up to any good  well george then it is quite settled that you and anna are to go off with the luggage directly the wedding is over you will come ashore with the gig and meet us at eight oclock at the station with a carriage to take us down to the boat  i will be there major and see that everything is ready for you on board  when packing up his things in the morning george lechmere put aside a pistol and a dagger that he had taken from the sash of a mutineer whom he had killed in india  they are not the sort of things a man generally carries at a wedding he said grimly but until i know something of what that villain is doing i mean to keep them handy for use there is never any saying what he may be up to and i know well enough that the major whatever he says will never give the matter a thought  he loaded the pistol and dropped it into his coat pocket then he opened his waistcoat cut a slit in the lining under his left arm and pushed the dagger down it until it was stopped by the slender steel crosspiece at the handle  i will make a neater job of it afterwards he said to himself that will do for the present and i can get at it in a moment  the wedding went off as such things generally do the church was crowded the girls of the village school lined the path from the gate to the church door and strewed flowers as the bridal party arrived and as they drove off to greendale tenants of both estates collected in the churchyard cheered them heartily there was a large gathering at breakfast but at last the toasts were all drunk and the awkward time of waiting over and at three oclock major mallett and his wife drove off amidst the cheers of the crowd assembled to see them start  thank god that is all over frank said heartily as they passed out through the lodge gates  at halfpast eight captain hawkins was standing at the landing stage in a furious passion  where can that fellow jackson have got to he said stamping his foot i said that you were all to be back in a quarter of an hour when we landed and it is three quarters of an hour now i never knew him to do such a thing before and i would not have had such a thing happen this evening for any money what will the major think when he finds only five men instead of six in the gig on such an occasion as this we shall be having them down in a minute or two jackson had better not show his face on board after this it is the most provoking thing i ever knew  it aint his way captain one of the men said jackson can go on the spree like the rest of us but i never knew him to do such a thing all the years i have known him when there was work to be done and i am sure he would not do so this evening he may have got knocked down or run over or something  i will take an oar if you like captain said a man in a yachtsmans suit who was loitering near i have nothing to do and may as well row off as do anything else you can put me on shore in the dinghy afterwards  all right my lad take number two athwart it is too dark to see faces and the owner is not likely to notice that there is a strange hand on board i will give you half a crown gladly for the job  the man got into the boat and took his seat  here they come the captain went on we are only just in time upend your oars lads we aint strong enough to cheer but we will give them a hearty god bless you as they come down  george lechmere came on first and handed in a bundle of wraps parasols and umbrellas the captain stood at the top of the steps and as frank and bertha came up took off his hat  god bless you and your wife sir he said and the men reechoed the words in a deep chorus  thank you captain  thank you all lads for my wife and myself frank said heartily and a minute later the boat pushed off  the tide was running out strong and they were halfway across it towards the dark mass of yachts when there was a sudden crash forward  what is it frank exclaimed  this fellow has stove in the boat sir the bow oar exclaimed and then came a series of hurried exclamations  frank had not caught the words but the rush of water aft told him that something serious had happened  row men row he shouted  steer to the nearest yacht hawkins  we shall never get there sir she will be full in half a minute  let each man stick to his oar frank said standing up we aft will hold on to the boat  then he raised his voice in a shout  yachts ahoy send boats we are sinking  dont be frightened darling he said to bertha keep hold of the gunwale i can keep you up easily enough until help comes but it is better to stick to the boat we must have run against something that has stove her in  a moment later the water was up to the thwarts the boat gave a lurch and then rolled over frank threw his arm round bertha and as the boat capsized clung to it with his disengaged hand  dont try to get hold of the keel he said it would turn her over again just let your hands rest on her and take hold of the edge of one of the planks  that is it hawkins do you get the other side and just keep her floating as she is we shall have help in a minute or two  are you all right george  yes i am at her stern do you want assistance sir  no we are all right george  a moment later a man came up beside the major and put his hand heavily on his shoulder  you won last time mallett he hissed in his ear it is my turn now  the mans weight was pressing him under water and the boat gave a lurch  frank loosed his hold of bertha with the words hold on dear for a minute and turning grappled with his enemy at the same moment grasping his right wrist as the arm was raised to strike him with a knife  in a moment both went below the water they came up beyond the stern and frank said  take care of bertha georgecarthew and then went down again  furiously they struggled they were well matched in strength but frank felt that his antagonist was careless of his own life for he had wound his legs round him and unable to wrench his arm from his grasp was doing his utmost to prevent their coming to the surface  suddenly when he felt that he could no longer retain his breath he felt arms thrown round them both and a moment later came to the surface then he heard an exclamation of thank god an arm was raised and two blows struck rapidly  carthews grasp relaxed the knife dropped from his hand and as frank shook himself free he sank under the water  are you all right major his rescuer said  yes he gasped  put your hand on my shoulder the boat is not a length away  a minute later frank was beside bertha again  where have you been frank i was frightened  one of the men grasped me he said and i should have turned the boat over if i had not let go however thanks to george lechmere who came to my rescue i have shaken him off  ah here is help  three or four boats from the yachts were indeed rowing up the four clinging to the gig were taken on board by one of them while the others picked up the men who were floating supported by their oars  dont say a word about it george frank whispered  the osprey was lying but two or three hundred yards away and they were soon alongside  this is not the sort of welcome i thought to give you on board dear he said as he helped bertha on deck and went down the companion with her  anna burst into exclamations of dismay at seeing the dripping figures  we have had an accident anna frank said cheerfully but i dont think that we are any the worse for it please take your mistress aft and get her into dry things at once  steward open one of those bottles of champagne and give me half a tumbler full  he hurried after the others with it  please drink this at once bertha he said yes you shall have some tea directly but start with this it will soon put you in a glow oh yes i am going to have one too but a ducking is no odds to me  then he ran up on deck  you have saved my life again george for that scoundrel would have drowned us both  i saw the knife in his hand as you went down and knew that you wanted me more than missi mean mrs mallett did  how did you make him let go so quickly  i had a sort of fear that sooner or later that villain would be up to something and had made up my mind that i would always have a weapon handy this morning i stuck that dagger of mine inside the lining of my waistcoat so that it might be handy and it was handy you were not five yards from me when you went down and i dived for you but could not find you at first and had to come up once for air of course i could not use the dagger until i found which was which and then i put an end to it  then you killed him george  i dont think that he will trouble you any more sir and if ever a chap deserved his fate that villain did why sir do you know how it all happened  no i did not catch what the man at the bow said there was such a confusion forward  he said that he had staved the boat in somehow he must have taken the place of one of the men on purpose to do it  well george i cant say that im sorry  i am heartily glad sir i am no more sorry for killing him than for shooting one of those murderous niggers less sorry a great deal the man deserved hanging he was intending to murder you and perhaps mrs mallett and i killed him as i should have killed a mad dog that was attacking you  well say nothing about it at present george it would be a great shock to my wife if she were to know it now you had better go and change your things at once as i am going to do are all the men rescued  yes sir they are all five on board  hawkins frank said putting his hand in his pocket give the men who came to help us a couple of sovereigns each and tell our men that i dont want them to talk about the affair i will see you about it again  frank was not long in getting into dry clothes and a few minutes later bertha came in  are you none the worse for it dear  not a bit frank that champagne has thoroughly warmed me what a sudden affair it all was is everyone safe  yes they stuck to the oars and all our crew were picked up it was a bad start was it not but it has never happened to me before and i hope that it will never happen to me again  some people would be inclined to think this an unlucky beginning said bertha with a slight tone of interrogation  i am certainly not one of them he laughed i had only one superstition and that is at an end you know what it was dear but the spell is broken he had a long run of minor successes but i have won the only prize worth having for which we have been rivals  some days later the body of a sailor was washed ashore near selsey bill an inquest was held and a verdict returned that the man had been murdered by some person or persons unknown but although the police of portsmouth southampton cowes and ryde made vigilant inquiries they were unable to ascertain that any yacht sailor hailing from those ports had suddenly disappeared  there was much discussion in the forecastle of the osprey as to the identity and motives of the man who had first got into conversation with jackson and then asked him to take a drink which must have been hocussed for jackson remembered nothing afterwards it was evident that the fellow had done it in order to take his place he had staved in the boat and as they supposed afterwards swam to shore but the crime seemed so singularly motiveless that they finally put it down as the work of a madman  it was not until the day before the osprey anchored again in cowes three months later that bertha on expressing some apprehension of further trouble from carthew if he had survived the wound george lechmere gave him learned the true account of the sinking of the gig as she went on board at southampton on her wedding day
