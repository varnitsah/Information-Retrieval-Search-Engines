at saving money as a rule said the nightwatchman as he wistfully toyed with a bad shilling on his watchchain though to ’ear ’em talk of saving when they’re at sea and there isn’t a pub within a thousand miles of ’em you might think different  it ain’t for the want of trying either with some of ’em and i’ve known men do all sorts o’ things as soon as they was paid off with a view to saving i knew one man as used to keep all but a shilling or two in a belt next to ’is skin so that he couldn’t get at it easy but it was all no good he was always running short in the most inconvenient places i’ve seen ’im wriggle for five minutes right off with a tramcar conductor standing over ’im and the other people in the tram reading their papers with one eye and watching him with the other  ginger dick and peter russet—two men i’ve spoke of to you afore—tried to save their money once they’d got so sick and tired of spending it all in p’r’aps a week or ten days arter coming ashore and ’aving to go to sea agin sooner than they ’ad intended that they determined some way or other to ’ave things different  they was homeward bound on a steamer from melbourne when they made their minds up and isaac lunn the oldest fireman aboard—a very steady old teetotaler—gave them a lot of good advice about it they all wanted to rejoin the ship when she sailed agin and ’e offered to take a room ashore with them and mind their money giving ’em what ’e called a moderate amount each day  they would ha’ laughed at any other man but they knew that old isaac was as honest as could be and that their money would be safe with ’im and at last after a lot of palaver they wrote out a paper saying as they were willing for ’im to ’ave their money and give it to ’em bit by bit till they went to sea agin  anybody but ginger dick and peter russet or a fool would ha’ known better than to do such a thing but old isaac ’ad got such a oily tongue and seemed so fairminded about wot ’e called moderate drinking that they never thought wot they was letting themselves in for and when they took their pay—close on sixteen pounds each—they put the odd change in their pockets and ’anded the rest over to him  the first day they was as pleased as punch old isaac got a nice respectable bedroom for them all and arter they’d ’ad a few drinks they humoured ’im by ’aving a nice ’ot cup o’ tea and then goin’ off with ’im to see a magiclantern performance  it was called the drunkard’s downfall and it begun with a young man going into a nicelooking pub and being served by a nicelooking barmaid with a glass of ale then it got on to ’arf pints and pints in the next picture and arter ginger ’ad seen the lost young man put away six pints in about ’arf a minute ’e got such a raging thirst on ’im that ’e couldn’t sit still and ’e whispered to peter russet to go out with ’im  you’ll lose the best of it if you go now ses old isaac in a whisper in the next picture there’s little frogs and devils sitting on the edge of the pot as ’e goes to drink  ginger dick got up and nodded to peter  arter that ’e kills ’is mother with a razor ses old isaac pleading with ’im and ’olding on to ’is coat  ginger dick sat down agin and when the murder was over ’e said it made ’im feel faint and ’im and peter russet went out for a breath of fresh air they ’ad three at the first place and then they moved on to another and forgot all about isaac and the dissolving views until ten o’clock when ginger who ’ad been very liberal to some friends ’e’d made in a pub found ’e’d spent ’is last penny  this comes o’ listening to a parcel o’ teetotalers ’e ses very cross when ’e found that peter ’ad spent all ’is money too here we are just beginning the evening and not a farthing in our pockets  they went off ’ome in a very bad temper old isaac was asleep in ’is bed and when they woke ’im up and said that they was going to take charge of their money themselves ’e kept dropping off to sleep agin and snoring that ’ard they could scarcely hear themselves speak then peter tipped ginger a wink and pointed to isaac’s trousers which were ’anging over the foot of the bed  ginger dick smiled and took ’em up softly and peter russet smiled too but ’e wasn’t best pleased to see old isaac asmiling in ’is sleep as though ’e was ’aving amusing dreams all ginger found was a ha’penny a bunch o’ keys and a cough lozenge in the coat and waistcoat ’e found a few tracks folded up a broken penknife a ball of string and some other rubbish then ’e set down on the foot o’ their bed and made eyes over at peter  wake ’im up agin ses peter in a temper  ginger dick got up and leaning over the bed took old isaac by the shoulders and shook ’im as if ’e’d been a bottle o’ medicine  time to get up lads ses old isaac putting one leg out o’ bed  no it ain’t ses ginger very rough we ain’t been to bed yet we want our money back  isaac drew ’is leg back into bed agin goo’ night he ses and fell fast asleep  he’s shamming that’s wot ’e is ses peter russet let’s look for it it must be in the room somewhere  they turned the room upside down pretty near and then ginger dick struck a match and looked up the chimney but all ’e found was that it ’adn’t been swept for about twenty years and wot with temper and soot ’e looked so frightful that peter was arf afraid of ’im  i’ve ’ad enough of this ses ginger running up to the bed and ’olding his sooty fist under old isaac’s nose now then where’s that money if you don’t give us our money our ’ardearned money inside o’ two minutes i’ll break every bone in your body  this is wot comes o’ trying to do you a favour ginger ses the old man reproachfully  don’t talk to me ses ginger cos i won’t have it come on where is it  old isaac looked at ’im and then he gave a sigh and got up and put on ’is boots and ’is trousers  i thought i should ’ave a little trouble with you he ses slowly but i was prepared for that  you’ll ’ave more if you don’t hurry up ses ginger glaring at ’im  we don’t want to ’urt you isaac ses peter russet we on’y want our money  i know that ses isaac you keep still peter and see fairplay and i’ll knock you silly arterwards  he pushed some o’ the things into a corner and then ’e spat on ’is ’ands and began to prance up and down and duck ’is ’ead about and hit the air in a way that surprised ’em  i ain’t hit a man for five years ’e ses still dancing up and down— fighting’s sinful except in a good cause—but afore i got a new ’art ginger i’d lick three men like you afore breakfast just to git up a appetite  look ’ere ses ginger you’re an old man and i don’t want to ’urt you tell us where our money is our ’ardearned money and i won’t lay a finger on you  i’m taking care of it for you ses the old man  ginger dick gave a howl and rushed at him and the next moment isaac’s fist shot out and give ’im a drive that sent ’im spinning across the room until ’e fell in a heap in the fireplace it was like a kick from a ’orse and peter looked very serious as ’e picked ’im up and dusted ’im down  you should keep your eye on ’is fist he ses sharply  it was a silly thing to say seeing that that was just wot ’ad ’appened and ginger told ’im wot ’e’d do for ’im when ’e’d finished with isaac he went at the old man agin but ’e never ’ad a chance and in about three minutes ’e was very glad to let peter ’elp ’im into bed  it’s your turn to fight him now peter he ses just move this piller so as i can see  come on lad ses the old man  peter shook ’is ’ead i have no wish to ’urt you isaac he ses kindly excitement like fighting is dangerous for an old man give us our money and we’ll say no more about it  no my lads ses isaac i’ve undertook to take charge o’ this money and i’m going to do it and i ’ope that when we all sign on aboard the planet there’ll be a matter o’ twelve pounds each left now i don’t want to be ’arsh with you but i’m going back to bed and if i ’ave to get up and dress agin you’ll wish yourselves dead  he went back to bed agin and peter taking no notice of ginger dick who kept calling ’im a coward got into bed alongside of ginger and fell fast asleep  they all ’ad breakfast in a coffeeshop next morning and arter it was over ginger who ’adn’t spoke a word till then said that ’e and peter russet wanted a little money to go on with he said they preferred to get their meals alone as isaac’s face took their appetite away  very good ses the old man i don’t want to force my company on nobody and after thinking ’ard for a minute or two he put ’is ’and in ’is trouserpocket and gave them eighteenpence each  that’s your day’s allowance ses isaac and it’s plenty there’s ninepence for your dinner fourpence for your tea and twopence for a crust o’ bread and cheese for supper and if you must go and drown yourselves in beer that leaves threepence each to go and do it with  ginger tried to speak to ’im but ’is feelings was too much for ’im and ’e couldn’t then peter russet swallered something ’e was going to say and asked old isaac very perlite to make it a quid for ’im because he was going down to colchester to see ’is mother and ’e didn’t want to go empty’anded  you’re a good son peter ses old isaac and i wish there was more like you i’ll come down with you if you like i’ve got nothing to do  peter said it was very kind of ’im but ’e’d sooner go alone owing to his mother being very shy afore strangers  well i’ll come down to the station and take a ticket for you ses isaac  then peter lost ’is temper altogether and banged ’is fist on the table and smashed ’arf the crockery he asked isaac whether ’e thought ’im and ginger dick was a couple o’ children and ’e said if ’e didn’t give ’em all their money right away ’e’d give ’im in charge to the first policeman they met  i’m afraid you didn’t intend for to go and see your mother peter ses the old man  look ’ere ses peter are you going to give us that money  not if you went down on your bended knees ses the old man  very good says peter getting up and walking outside then come along o’ me to find a policeman  i’m agreeable ses isaac but i’ve got the paper you signed  peter said ’e didn’t care twopence if ’e’d got fifty papers and they walked along looking for a policeman which was a very unusual thing for them to do  i ’ope for your sakes it won’t be the same policeman that you and ginger dick set on in gun alley the night afore you shipped on the planet ses isaac pursing up ’is lips  ’tain’t likely to be ses peter beginning to wish ’e ’adn’t been so free with ’is tongue  still if i tell ’im i dessay he’ll soon find ’im ses isaac there’s one coming along now peter shall i stop ’im  peter russet looked at ’im and then he looked at ginger and they walked by grinding their teeth they stuck to isaac all day trying to get their money out of ’im and the names they called ’im was a surprise even to themselves and at night they turned the room topsyturvy agin looking for their money and ’ad more unpleasantness when they wanted isaac to get up and let ’em search the bed  they ’ad breakfast together agin next morning and ginger tried another tack he spoke quite nice to isaac and ’ad three large cups o’ tea to show ’im ’ow ’e was beginning to like it and when the old man gave ’em their eighteenpences ’e smiled and said ’e’d like a few shillings extra that day  it’ll be all right isaac he ses i wouldn’t ’ave a drink if you asked me to don’t seem to care for it now i was saying so to you on’y last night wasn’t i peter  you was ses peter so was i  then i’ve done you good ginger ses isaac clapping ’im on the back  you ’ave ses ginger speaking between his teeth and i thank you for it i don’t want drink but i thought o’ going to a music’all this evening  going to wot ses old isaac drawing ’imself up and looking very shocked  a music’all ses ginger trying to keep ’is temper  a music’all ses isaac why it’s worse than a pub ginger i should be a very poor friend o’ yours if i let you go there—i couldn’t think of it  wot’s it got to do with you you graywhiskered serpent screams ginger arf mad with rage why don’t you leave us alone why don’t you mind your own business it’s our money  isaac tried to talk to ’im but ’e wouldn’t listen and he made such a fuss that at last the coffeeshop keeper told ’im to go outside peter follered ’im out and being very upset they went and spent their day’s allowance in the first hour and then they walked about the streets quarrelling as to the death they’d like old isaac to ’ave when ’is time came  they went back to their lodgings at dinnertime but there was no sign of the old man and being ’ungry and thirsty they took all their spare clothes to a pawnbroker and got enough money to go on with just to show their independence they went to two music’ails and with a sort of idea that they was doing isaac a bad turn they spent every farthing afore they got ’ome and sat up in bed telling ’im about the spree they’d ’ad  at five o’clock in the morning peter woke up and saw to ’is surprise that ginger dick was dressed and carefully folding up old isaac’s clothes at first ’e thought that ginger ’ad gone mad taking care of the old man’s things like that but afore ’e could speak ginger noticed that ’e was awake and stepped over to ’im and whispered to ’im to dress without making a noise peter did as ’e was told and more puzzled than ever saw ginger make up all the old man’s clothes in a bundle and creep out of the room on tiptoe  going to ’ide ’is clothes ’e ses  yes ses ginger leading the way downstairs in a pawnshop we’ll make the old man pay for today’s amusements  then peter see the joke and ’e begun to laugh so ’ard that ginger ’ad to threaten to knock ’is head off to quiet ’im ginger laughed ’imself when they got outside and at last arter walking about till the shops opened they got into a pawnbroker’s and put old isaac’s clothes up for fifteen shillings  first thing they did was to ’ave a good breakfast and after that they came out smiling all over and began to spend a ’appy day ginger was in tiptop spirits and so was peter and the idea that old isaac was in bed while they was drinking ’is clothes pleased them more than anything twice that evening policemen spoke to ginger for dancing on the pavement and by the time the money was spent it took peter all ’is time to get ’im ’ome  old isaac was in bed when they got there and the temper ’e was in was shocking but ginger sat on ’is bed and smiled at ’im as if ’e was saying compliments to ’im  where’s my clothes ses the old man shaking ’is fist at the two of ’em  ginger smiled at ’im then ’e shut ’is eyes and dropped off to sleep  where’s my clothes ses isaac turning to peter closhe ses peter staring at ’im  where are they ses isaac  it was a long time afore peter could understand wot ’e meant but as soon as ’e did ’e started to look for ’em drink takes people in different ways and the way it always took peter was to make ’im one o’ the most obliging men that ever lived he spent arf the night crawling about on all fours looking for the clothes and four or five times old isaac woke up from dreams of earthquakes to find peter ’ad got jammed under ’is bed and was wondering what ’ad ’appened to ’im  none of ’em was in the best o’ tempers when they woke up next morning and ginger ’ad ’ardly got ’is eyes open before isaac was asking ’im about ’is clothes agin  don’t bother me about your clothes ses ginger talk about something else for a change  where are they ses isaac sitting on the edge of ’is bed  ginger yawned and felt in ’is waistcoat pocket—for neither of ’em ’ad undressed—and then ’e took the pawnticket out and threw it on the floor isaac picked it up and then ’e began to dance about the room as if ’e’d gone mad  do you mean to tell me you’ve pawned my clothes he shouts  me and peter did ses ginger sitting up in bed and getting ready for a row  isaac dropped on the bed agin all of a ’cap and wot am i to do he ses  if you be’ave yourself ses ginger and give us our money me and peter’ll go and get ’em out agin when we’ve ’ad breakfast that is there’s no hurry  but i ’aven’t got the money ses isaac it was all sewn up in the lining of the coat i’ve on’y got about five shillings you’ve made a nice mess of it ginger you ’ave  you’re a silly fool ginger that’s wot you are ses peter  sewn up in the lining of the coat ses ginger staring  the banknotes was ses isaac and three pounds in gold ’idden in the cap did you pawn that too  ginger got up in ’is excitement and walked up and down the room we must go and get ’em out at once he ses  and where’s the money to do it with ses peter  ginger ’adn’t thought of that and it struck ’im all of a heap none of ’em seemed to be able to think of a way of getting the other ten shillings wot was wanted and ginger was so upset that ’e took no notice of the things peter kept saying to ’im  let’s go and ask to see ’em and say we left a railwayticket in the pocket ses peter  isaac shook ’is ’ead there’s on’y one way to do it he ses we shall ’ave to pawn your clothes ginger to get mine out with  that’s the on’y way ginger ses peter brightening up now wot’s the good o’ carrying on like that it’s no worse for you to be without your clothes for a little while than it was for pore old isaac  it took ’em quite arf an hour afore they could get ginger to see it first of all ’e wanted peter’s clothes to be took instead of ’is and when peter pointed out that they was too shabby to fetch ten shillings ’e ’ad a lot o’ nasty things to say about wearing such old rags and at last in a terrible temper ’e took ’is clothes off and pitched ’em in a ’eap on the floor  if you ain’t back in arf an hour peter ’e ses scowling at ’im you’ll ’ear from me i can tell you  don’t you worry about that ses isaac with a smile i’m going to take ’em  you ses ginger but you can’t you ain’t got no clothes  i’m going to wear peter’s ses isaac with a smile  peter asked ’im to listen to reason but it was all no good he’d got the pawnticket and at last peter forgetting all he’d said to ginger dick about using bad langwidge took ’is clothes off one by one and dashed ’em on the floor and told isaac some of the things ’e thought of ’im  the old man didn’t take any notice of ’im he dressed ’imself up very slow and careful in peter’s clothes and then ’e drove ’em nearly crazy by wasting time making ’is bed  be as quick as you can isaac ses ginger at last think of us two asitting ’ere waiting for you  i sha’n’t forget it ses isaac and ’e came back to the door after ’e’d gone arfway down the stairs to ask ’em not to go out on the drink while ’e was away  it was nine o’clock when he went and at ha’past nine ginger began to get impatient and wondered wot ’ad ’appened to ’im and when ten o’clock came and no isaac they was both leaning out of the winder with blankets over their shoulders looking up the road by eleven o’clock peter was in very low spirits and ginger was so mad ’e was afraid to speak to ’im  they spent the rest o’ that day ’anging out of the winder but it was not till ha’past four in the afternoon that isaac still wearing peter’s clothes and carrying a couple of large green plants under ’is arm turned into the road and from the way ’e was smiling they thought it must be all right  wot ’ave you been such a long time for ses ginger in a low fierce voice as isaac stopped underneath the winder and nodded up to ’em  i met a old friend ses isaac  met a old friend ses ginger in a passion wot d’ye mean wasting time like that while we was sitting up ’ere waiting and starving  i ’adn’t seen ’im for years ses isaac and time slipped away afore i noticed it  i dessay ses ginger in a bitter voice well is the money all right  i don’t know ses isaac i ain’t got the clothes  wot ses ginger nearly falling out of the winder well wot ’ave you done with mine then where are they come upstairs  i won’t come upstairs ginger ses isaac because i’m not quite sure whether i’ve done right but i’m not used to going into pawnshops and i walked about trying to make up my mind to go in and couldn’t  well wot did you do then ses ginger ’ardly able to contain hisself  while i was trying to make up my mind ses old isaac i see a man with a barrer of lovely plants ’e wasn’t asking money for ’em only old clothes  old clothes ses ginger in a voice as if ’e was being suffocated  i thought they’d be a bit o’ green for you to look at ses the old man ’olding the plants up there’s no knowing ’ow long you’ll be up there the big one is yours ginger and the other is for peter  ’ave you gone mad isaac ses peter in a trembling voice arter ginger ’ad tried to speak and couldn’t  isaac shook ’is ’ead and smiled up at ’em and then arter telling peter to put ginger’s blanket a little more round ’is shoulders for fear ’e should catch cold ’e said ’e’d ask the landlady to send ’em up some bread and butter and a cup o’ tea  they ’eard ’im talking to the landlady at the door and then ’e went off in a hurry without looking behind ’im and the landlady walked up and down on the other side of the road with ’er apron stuffed in ’er mouth pretending to be looking at ’er chimneypots  isaac didn’t turn up at all that night and by next morning those two unfortunate men see ’ow they’d been done it was quite plain to them that isaac ’ad been deceiving them and peter was pretty certain that ’e took the money out of the bed while ’e was fussing about making it old isaac kept ’em there for three days sending ’em in their clothes bit by bit and two shillings a day to live on but they didn’t set eyes on ’im agin until they all signed on aboard the planet and they didn’t set eyes on their money until they was two miles below gravesend     the castaway     mrs john boxer stood at the door of the shop with her hands clasped on her apron the short day had drawn to a close and the lamps in the narrow little thoroughfares of shinglesea were already lit for a time she stood listening to the regular beat of the sea on the beach some halfmile distant and then with a slight shiver stepped back into the shop and closed the door  the little shop with its widemouthed bottles of sweets was one of her earliest memories until her marriage she had known no other home and when her husband was lost with the north star some three years before she gave up her home in poplar and returned to assist her mother in the little shop  in a restless mood she took up a piece of needlework and a minute or two later put it down again a glance through the glass of the door leading into the small parlour revealed mrs gimpson with a red shawl round her shoulders asleep in her easychair  mrs boxer turned at the clang of the shop bell and then with a wild cry stood gazing at the figure of a man standing in the doorway he was short and bearded with oddly shaped shoulders and a left leg which was not a match but the next moment mrs boxer was in his arms sobbing and laughing together  mrs gimpson whose nerves were still quivering owing to the suddenness with which she had been awakened came into the shop mr boxer freed an arm and placing it round her waist kissed her with some affection on the chin  he’s come back cried mrs boxer hysterically  thank goodness said mrs gimpson after a moment’s deliberation  he’s alive cried mrs boxer he’s alive  she halfdragged and halfled him into the small parlour and thrusting him into the easychair lately vacated by mrs gimpson seated herself upon his knee regardless in her excitement that the rightful owner was with elaborate care selecting the most uncomfortable chair in the room  fancy his coming back said mrs boxer wiping her eyes how did you escape john where have you been tell us all about it  mr boxer sighed it ’ud be a long story if i had the gift of telling of it he said slowly but i’ll cut it short for the present when the north star went down in the south pacific most o’ the hands got away in the boats but i was too late i got this crack on the head with something falling on it from aloft look here  he bent his head and mrs boxer separating the stubble with her fingers uttered an exclamation of pity and alarm at the extent of the scar mrs gimpson craning forward uttered a sound which might mean anything—even pity  when i come to my senses continued mr boxer the ship was sinking and i just got to my feet when she went down and took me with her how i escaped i don’t know i seemed to be choking and fighting for my breath for years and then i found myself floating on the sea and clinging to a grating i clung to it all night and next day i was picked up by a native who was paddling about in a canoe and taken ashore to an island where i lived for over two years it was right out o’ the way o’ craft but at last i was picked up by a trading schooner named the pearl belonging to sydney and taken there at sydney i shipped aboard the marston towers a steamer and landed at the albert docks this morning  poor john said his wife holding on to his arm how you must have suffered  i did said mr boxer mother got a cold he inquired eying that lady  no i ain’t said mrs gimpson answering for herself why didn’t you write when you got to sydney  didn’t know where to write to replied mr boxer staring i didn’t know where mary had gone to  you might ha’ wrote here said mrs gimpson  didn’t think of it at the time said mr boxer one thing is i was very busy at sydney looking for a ship however i’m ’ere now  i always felt you’d turn up some day said mrs gimpson i felt certain of it in my own mind mary made sure you was dead but i said ’no i knew better’  there was something in mrs gimpson’s manner of saying this that impressed her listeners unfavourably the impression was deepened when after a short dry laugh a propos of nothing she sniffed again—three times  well you turned out to be right said mr boxer shortly  i gin’rally am was the reply there’s very few people can take me in  she sniffed again  were the natives kind to you inquired mrs boxer hastily as she turned to her husband  very kind said the latter ah you ought to have seen that island beautiful yellow sands and palmtrees cocoanuts to be ’ad for the picking and nothing to do all day but lay about in the sun and swim in the sea  any public’ouses there inquired mrs gimpson  cert’nly not said her soninlaw this was an island—one o’ the little islands in the south pacific ocean  what did you say the name o’ the schooner was inquired mrs gimpson  pearl replied mr boxer with the air of a resentful witness under crossexamination  and what was the name o’ the captin said mrs gimpson  thomas—henery—walter—smith said mr boxer with somewhat unpleasant emphasis  an’ the mate’s name  john brown was the reply  common names commented mrs gimpson very common but i knew you’d come back all right—i never ’ad no alarm ’he’s safe and happy my dear’ i says ’he’ll come back all in his own good time’  what d’you mean by that demanded the sensitive mr boxer i come back as soon as i could  you know you were anxious mother interposed her daughter why you insisted upon our going to see old mr silver about it  ah but i wasn’t uneasy or anxious afterwards said mrs gimpson compressing her lips  who’s old mr silver and what should he know about it inquired mr boxer  he’s a fortuneteller replied his wife reads the stars said his motherinlaw  mr boxer laughed—a good ringing laugh what did he tell you he inquired nothing said his wife hastily ah said mr boxer waggishly that was wise of ’im most of us could tell fortunes that way  that’s wrong said mrs gimpson to her daughter sharply right’s right any day and truth’s truth he said that he knew all about john and what he’d been doing but he wouldn’t tell us for fear of ’urting our feelings and making mischief  here look ’ere said mr boxer starting up i’ve ’ad about enough o’ this why don’t you speak out what you mean i’ll mischief ’im the old humbug old rascal  never mind john said his wife laying her hand upon his arm here you are safe and sound and as for old mr silver there’s a lot o’ people don’t believe in him  ah they don’t want to said mrs gimpson obstinately but don’t forget that he foretold my cough last winter  well look ’ere said mr boxer twisting his short blunt nose into as near an imitation of a sneer as he could manage i’ve told you my story and i’ve got witnesses to prove it you can write to the master of the marston towers if you like and other people besides very well then let’s go and see your precious old fortuneteller you needn’t say who i am say i’m a friend and tell ’im never to mind about making mischief but to say right out where i am and what i’ve been doing all this time i have my ’opes it’ll cure you of your superstitiousness  we’ll go round after we’ve shut up mother said mrs boxer we’ll have a bit o’ supper first and then start early  mrs gimpson hesitated it is never pleasant to submit one’s superstitions to the tests of the unbelieving but after the attitude she had taken up she was extremely loath to allow her soninlaw a triumph  never mind we’ll say no more about it she said primly but i ’ave my own ideas  i dessay said mr boxer but you’re afraid for us to go to your old fortuneteller it would be too much of a showup for ’im  it’s no good your trying to aggravate me john boxer because you can’t do it said mrs gimpson in a voice trembling with passion  o’ course if people like being deceived they must be said mr boxer we’ve all got to live and if we’d all got our common sense fortunetellers couldn’t does he tell fortunes by tealeaves or by the colour of your eyes  laugh away john boxer said mrs gimpson icily but i shouldn’t have been alive now if it hadn’t ha’ been for mr silver’s warnings  mother stayed in bed for the first ten days in july explained mrs boxer to avoid being bit by a mad dog  tchee—tchee—tchee said the hapless mr boxer putting his hand over his mouth and making noble efforts to restrain himself tchee—tch  i s’pose you’d ha’ laughed more if i ’ad been bit said the glaring mrs gimpson  well who did the dog bite after all inquired mr boxer recovering  you don’t understand replied mrs gimpson pityingly me being safe up in bed and the door locked there was no mad dog there was no use for it  well said mr boxer me and mary’s going round to see that old deceiver after supper whether you come or not mary shall tell ’im i’m a friend and ask him to tell her everything about ’er husband nobody knows me here and mary and me’ll be affectionate like and give ’im to understand we want to marry then he won’t mind making mischief  you’d better leave well alone said mrs gimpson  mr boxer shook his head i was always one for a bit o’ fun he said slowly i want to see his face when he finds out who i am  mrs gimpson made no reply she was looking round for the marketbasket and having found it she left the reunited couple to keep house while she went out to obtain a supper which should in her daughter’s eyes be worthy of the occasion  she went to the high street first and made her purchases and was on the way back again when in response to a sudden impulse as she passed the end of crowner’s alley she turned into that small byway and knocked at the astrologer’s door  a slow dragging footstep was heard approaching in reply to the summons and the astrologer recognising his visitor as one of his most faithful and credulous clients invited her to step inside mrs gimpson complied and taking a chair gazed at the venerable white beard and small redrimmed eyes of her host in some perplexity as to how to begin  my daughter’s coming round to see you presently she said at last  the astrologer nodded  she—she wants to ask you about ’er husband faltered’ mrs gimpson she’s going to bring a friend with her—a man who doesn’t believe in your knowledge he—he knows all about my daughter’s husband and he wants to see what you say you know about him  the old man put on a pair of huge horn spectacles and eyed her carefully  you’ve got something on your mind he said at last you’d better tell me everything  mrs gimpson shook her head  there’s some danger hanging over you continued mr silver in a low thrilling voice some danger in connection with your soninlaw there he waved a lean shrivelled hand backward and forward as though dispelling a fog and peered into distance—there is something forming over you you—or somebody—are hiding something from me  mrs gimpson aghast at such omniscience sank backward in her chair  speak said the old man gently there is no reason why you should be sacrificed for others  mrs gimpson was of the same opinion and in some haste she reeled off the events of the evening she had a good memory and no detail was lost  strange strange said the venerable mr silver when he had finished he is an ingenious man  isn’t it true inquired his listener he says he can prove it and he is going to find out what you meant by saying you were afraid of making mischief  he can prove some of it said the old man his eyes snapping spitefully i can guarantee that  but it wouldn’t have made mischief if you had told us that ventured mrs gimpson a man can’t help being cast away  true said the astrologer slowly true but let them come and question me and whatever you do for your own sake don’t let a soul know that you have been here if you do the danger to yourself will be so terrible that even i may be unable to help you  mrs gimpson shivered and more than ever impressed by his marvellous powers made her way slowly home where she found the unconscious mr boxer relating his adventures again with much gusto to a married couple from next door  it’s a wonder he’s alive said mr jem thompson looking up as the old woman entered the room it sounds like a storybook show us that cut on your head again mate  the obliging mr boxer complied  we’re going on with ’em after they’ve ’ad supper continued mr thompson as he and his wife rose to depart it’ll be a fair treat to me to see old silver bowled out  mrs gimpson sniffed and eyed his retreating figure disparagingly mrs boxer prompted by her husband began to set the table for supper  it was a lengthy meal owing principally to mr boxer but it was over at last and after that gentleman had assisted in shutting up the shop they joined the thompsons who were waiting outside and set off for crowner’s alley the way was enlivened by mr boxer who had thrills of horror every ten yards at the idea of the supernatural things he was about to witness and by mr thompson who not to be outdone persisted in standing stockstill at frequent intervals until he had received the assurances of his giggling betterhalf that he would not be made to vanish in a cloud of smoke  by the time they reached mr silver’s abode the party had regained its decorum and except for a tremendous shudder on the part of mr boxer as his gaze fell on a couple of skulls which decorated the magician’s table their behaviour left nothing to be desired mrs gimpson in a few awkward words announced the occasion of their visit mr boxer she introduced as a friend of the family from london  i will do what i can said the old man slowly as his visitors seated themselves but i can only tell you what i see if i do not see all or see clearly it cannot be helped  mr boxer winked at mr thompson and received an understanding pinch in return mrs thompson in a hot whisper told them to behave themselves  the mystic preparations were soon complete a little cloud of smoke through which the fierce red eyes of the astrologer peered keenly at mr boxer rose from the table then he poured various liquids into a small china bowl and holding up his hand to command silence gazed steadfastly into it i see pictures he announced in a deep voice the docks of a great city london i see an illshaped man with a bent left leg standing on the deck of a ship  mr thompson his eyes wide open with surprise jerked mr boxer in the ribs but mr boxer whose figure was a sore point with him made no response  the ship leaves the docks continued mr silver still peering into the bowl as she passes through the entrance her stern comes into view with the name painted on it the—the—the——  look agin old chap growled mr boxer in an undertone  the north star said the astrologer the illshaped man is still standing on the forepart of the ship i do not know his name or who he is he takes the portrait of a beautiful young woman from his pocket and gazes at it earnestly  mrs boxer who had no illusions on the subject of her personal appearance sat up as though she had been stung mr thompson who was about to nudge mr boxer in the ribs again thought better of it and assumed an air of uncompromising virtue  the picture disappears said mr silver ah i see i see a ship in a gale at sea it is the north star it is sinking the illshaped man sheds tears and loses his head i cannot discover the name of this man  mr boxer who had been several times on the point of interrupting cleared his throat and endeavoured to look unconcerned  the ship sinks continued the astrologer in thrilling tones ah what is this a piece of wreckage with a monkey clinging to it no noo the illshaped man again dear me  his listeners sat spellbound only the laboured and intense breathing of mr boxer broke the silence  he is alone on the boundless sea pursued the seer night falls day breaks and a canoe propelled by a slender and pretty but dusky maiden approaches the castaway she assists him into the canoe and his head sinks on her lap as with vigorous strokes of her paddle she propels the canoe toward a small island fringed with palm trees  here look ’ere— began the overwrought mr boxer  h’sh h’sh ejaculated the keenly interested mr thompson w’y don’t you keep quiet  the picture fades continued the old man i see another a native wedding it is the dusky maiden and the man she rescued ah the wedding is interrupted a young man a native breaks into the group he has a long knife in his hand he springs upon the illshaped man and wounds him in the head  involuntarily mr boxer’s hand went up to his honourable scar and the heads of the others swung round to gaze at it mrs boxer’s face was terrible in its expression but mrs gimpson’s bore the look of sad and patient triumph of one who knew men and could not be surprised at anything they do  the scene vanishes resumed the monotonous voice and another one forms the same man stands on the deck of a small ship the name on the stern is the peer—no paris—no no no pearl it fades from the shore where the dusky maiden stands with hands stretched out imploringly the illshaped man smiles and takes the portrait of the young and beautiful girl from his pocket  look ’ere said the infuriated mr boxer i think we’ve ’ad about enough of this rubbish i have—more than enough  i don’t wonder at it said his wife trembling furiously you can go if you like i’m going to stay and hear all that there is to hear  you sit quiet urged the intensely interested mr thompson he ain’t said it’s you there’s more than one misshaped man in the world i s’pose  i see an ocean liner said the seer who had appeared to be in a trance state during this colloquy she is sailing for england from australia i see the name distinctly the marston towers the same man is on board of her the ship arrives at london the scene closes another one forms the illshaped man is sitting with a woman with a beautiful face —not the same as the photograph  what they can see in him i can’t think muttered mr thompson in an envious whisper he’s a perfick terror and to look at him——  they sit hand in hand continued the astrologer raising his voice she smiles up at him and gently strokes his head he——  a loud smack rang through the room and startled the entire company mrs boxer unable to contain herself any longer had so far from profiting by the example gone to the other extreme and slapped her husband’s head with hearty goodwill mr boxer sprang raging to his feet and in the confusion which ensued the fortuneteller to the great regret of mr thompson upset the contents of the magic bowl  i can see no more he said sinking hastily into his chair behind the table as mr boxer advanced upon him  mrs gimpson pushed her soninlaw aside and laying a modest fee upon the table took her daughter’s arm and led her out the thompsons followed and mr boxer after an irresolute glance in the direction of the ingenuous mr silver made his way after them and fell into the rear the people in front walked on for some time in silence and then the voice of the greatly impressed mrs thompson was heard to the effect that if there were only more fortunetellers in the world there would be a lot more better men  mr boxer trotted up to his wife’s side look here mary he began  don’t you speak to me said his wife drawing closer to her mother because i won’t answer you  mr boxer laughed bitterly this is a nice homecoming he remarked  he fell to the rear again and walked along raging his temper by no means being improved by observing that mrs thompson doubtless with a firm belief in the saying that evil communications corrupt good manners kept a tight hold of her husband’s arm his position as an outcast was clearly defined and he ground his teeth with rage as he observed the virtuous uprightness of mrs gimpson’s back by the time they reached home he was in a spirit of mad recklessness far in advance of the character given him by the astrologer  his wife gazed at him with a look of such strong interrogation as he was about to follow her into the house that he paused with his foot on the step and eyed her dumbly  have you left anything inside that you want she inquired  mr boxer shook his head i only wanted to come in and make a clean breast of it he said in a curious voice then i’ll go  mrs gimpson stood aside to let him pass and mr thompson not to be denied followed close behind with his faintly protesting wife they sat down in a row against the wall and mr boxer sitting opposite in a hangdog fashion eyed them with scornful wrath  well said mrs boxer at last  all that he said was quite true said her husband defiantly the only thing is he didn’t tell the arf of it altogether i married three dusky maidens  everybody but mr thompson shuddered with horror  then i married a white girl in australia pursued mr boxer musingly i wonder old silver didn’t see that in the bowl not arf a fortuneteller i call ’im  what they see in ’im whispered the astounded mr thompson to his wife  and did you marry the beautiful girl in the photograph demanded mrs boxer in trembling accents  i did said her husband  hussy cried mrs boxer  i married her said mr boxer considering—i married her at camberwell in eighteen ninetythree  eighteen ninetythree said his wife in a startled voice but you couldn’t why you didn’t marry me till eighteen ninetyfour  what’s that got to do with it inquired the monster calmly  mrs boxer pale as ashes rose from her seat and stood gazing at him with horrorstruck eyes trying in vain to speak  you villain cried mrs gimpson violently i always distrusted you  i know you did said mr boxer calmly you’ve been committing bigamy cried mrs gimpson  over and over agin assented mr boxer cheerfully it’s got to be a ’obby with me  was the first wife alive when you married my daughter demanded mrs gimpson  alive said mr boxer o’ course she was she’s alive now—bless her  he leaned back in his chair and regarded with intense satisfaction the horrified faces of the group in front  you—you’ll go to jail for this cried mrs gimpson breathlessly what is your first wife’s address  i decline to answer that question said her soninlaw  what is your first wife’s address repeated mrs gimpson  ask the fortuneteller said mr boxer with an aggravating smile and then get ’im up in the box as a witness little bowl and all he can tell you more than i can  i demand to know her name and address cried mrs gimpson putting a bony arm around the waist of the trembling mrs boxer  i decline to give it said mr boxer with great relish it ain’t likely i’m going to give myself away like that besides it’s agin the law for a man to criminate himself you go on and start your bigamy case and call old redeyes as a witness  mrs gimpson gazed at him in speechless wrath and then stooping down conversed in excited whispers with mrs thompson mrs boxer crossed over to her husband  oh john she wailed say it isn’t true say it isn’t true  mr boxer hesitated what’s the good o’ me saying anything he said doggedly  it isn’t true persisted his wife say it isn’t true  what i told you when i first came in this evening was quite true said her husband slowly and what i’ve just told you is as true as what that lying old fortuneteller told you you can please yourself what you believe  i believe you john said his wife humbly  mr boxer’s countenance cleared and he drew her on to his knee  that’s right he said cheerfully so long as you believe in me i don’t care what other people think and before i’m much older i’ll find out how that old rascal got to know the names of the ships i was aboard seems to me somebody’s been talking     blundell’s improvement     venia turnbull in a quiet unobtrusive fashion was enjoying herself the cool livingroom at turnbull’s farm was a delightful contrast to the hot sunshine without and the drowsy humming of bees floating in at the open window was charged with hints of slumber to the middleaged from her seat by the window she watched with amused interest the efforts of her father—kept from his sunday afternoon nap by the assiduous attentions of her two admirers—to maintain his politeness  father was so pleased to see you both come in she said softly it’s very dull for him here of an afternoon with only me  i can’t imagine anybody being dull with only you said sergeant dick daly turning a bold brown eye upon her  mr john blundell scowled this was the third time the sergeant had said the thing that he would have liked to say if he had thought of it  i don’t mind being dull remarked mr turnbull casually  neither gentleman made any comment  i like it pursued mr turnbull longingly always did from a child  the two young men looked at each other then they looked at venia the sergeant assumed an expression of careless ease while john blundell sat his chair like a human limpet mr turnbull almost groaned as he remembered his tenacity  the garden’s looking very nice he said with a pathetic glance round  beautiful assented the sergeant i saw it yesterday  some o’ the roses on that big bush have opened a bit more since then said the farmer  sergeant daly expressed his gratification and said that he was not surprised it was only ten days since he had arrived in the village on a visit to a relative but in that short space of time he had to the great discomfort of mr blundell made himself wonderfully at home at mr turnbull’s to venia he related strange adventures by sea and land and on subjects of which he was sure the farmer knew nothing he was a perfect mine of information he began to talk in low tones to venia and the heart of mr blundell sank within him as he noted her interest their voices fell to a gentle murmur and the sergeant’s sleek wellbrushed head bent closer to that of his listener relieved from his attentions mr turnbull fell asleep without more ado  blundell sat neglected the unwilling witness of a flirtation he was powerless to prevent considering her limited opportunities miss turnbull displayed a proficiency which astonished him even the sergeant was amazed and suspected her of long practice  i wonder whether it is very hot outside she said at last rising and looking out of the window  only pleasantly warm said the sergeant it would be nice down by the water  i’m afraid of disturbing father by our talk said the considerate daughter you might tell him we’ve gone for a little stroll when he wakes she added turning to blundell  mr blundell who had risen with the idea of acting the humble but in his opinion highly necessary part of chaperon sat down again and watched blankly from the window until they were out of sight he was half inclined to think that the exigencies of the case warranted him in arousing the farmer at once  it was an hour later when the farmer awoke to find himself alone with mr blundell a state of affairs for which he strove with some pertinacity to make that aggrieved gentleman responsible  why didn’t you go with them he demanded because i wasn’t asked replied the other  mr turnbull sat up in his chair and eyed him disdainfully for a great big chap like you are john blundell he exclaimed it’s surprising what a little pluck you’ve got  i don’t want to go where i’m not wanted retorted mr blundell  that’s where you make a mistake said the other regarding him severely girls like a masterful man and instead of getting your own way you sit down quietly and do as you’re told like a tame—tame—  tame what inquired mr blundell resentfully  i don’t know said the other frankly the tamest thing you can think of there’s daly laughing in his sleeve at you and talking to venia about waterloo and the crimea as though he’d been there i thought it was pretty near settled between you  so did i said mr blundell  you’re a big man john said the other but you’re slow you’re all muscle and no head  i think of things afterward said blundell humbly generally after i get to bed  mr turnbull sniffed and took a turn up and down the room then he closed the door and came toward his friend again  i dare say you’re surprised at me being so anxious to get rid of venia he said slowly but the fact is i’m thinking of marrying again myself  you said the startled mr blundell  yes me said the other somewhat sharply but she won’t marry so long as venia is at home it’s a secret because if venia got to hear of it she’d keep single to prevent it she’s just that sort of girl  mr blundell coughed but did not deny it who is it he inquired  miss sippet was the reply she couldn’t hold her own for half an hour against venia  mr blundell a great stickler for accuracy reduced the time to five minutes  and now said the aggrieved mr turnbull now so far as i can see she’s struck with daly if she has him it’ll be years and years before they can marry she seems crazy about heroes she was talking to me the other night about them not to put too fine a point on it she was talking about you  mr blundell blushed with pleased surprise  said you were not a hero explained mr turnbull of course i stuck up for you i said you’d got too much sense to go putting your life into danger i said you were a very careful man and i told her how particular you was about damp sheets your housekeeper told me  it’s all nonsense said blundell with a fiery face i’ll send that old fool packing if she can’t keep her tongue quiet  it’s very sensible of you john said mr turnbull and a sensible girl would appreciate it instead of that she only sniffed when i told her how careful you always were to wear flannel next to your skin she said she liked daredevils  i suppose she thinks daly is a daredevil said the offended mr blundell and i wish people wouldn’t talk about me and my skin why can’t they mind their own business  mr turnbull eyed him indignantly and then sitting in a very upright position slowly filled his pipe and declining a proffered match rose and took one from the mantelpiece  i was doing the best i could for you he said staring hard at the ingrate i was trying to make venia see what a careful husband you would make miss sippet herself is most particular about such things— and venia seemed to think something of it because she asked me whether you used a warmingpan  mr blundell got up from his chair and without going through the formality of bidding his host goodby quitted the room and closed the door violently behind him he was red with rage and he brooded darkly as he made his way home on the folly of carrying on the traditions of a devoted mother without thinking for himself  for the next two or three days to venia’s secret concern he failed to put in an appearance at the farm—a fact which made flirtation with the sergeant a somewhat uninteresting business her sole recompense was the dismay of her father and for his benefit she dwelt upon the advantages of the army in a manner that would have made the fortune of a recruitingsergeant  she’s just crazy after the soldiers he said to mr blundell whom he was trying to spur on to a desperate effort i’ve been watching her close and i can see what it is now she’s romantic you’re too slow and ordinary for her she wants somebody more dazzling she told daly only yesterday afternoon that she loved heroes told it to him to his face i sat there and heard her it’s a pity you ain’t a hero john  yes said mr blundell then if i was i expect she’d like something else  the other shook his head if you could only do something daring he murmured halfkill somebody or save somebody’s life and let her see you do it couldn’t you dive off the quay and save somebody’s life from drowning  yes i could said blundell if somebody would only tumble in  you might pretend that you thought you saw somebody drowning suggested mr turnbull  and be laughed at said mr blundell who knew his venia by heart  you always seem to be able to think of objections complained mr turnbull i’ve noticed that in you before  i’d go in fast enough if there was anybody there said blundell i’m not much of a swimmer but—  all the better interrupted the other that would make it all the more daring  and i don’t much care if i’m drowned pursued the younger man gloomily  mr turnbull thrust his hands in his pockets and took a turn or two up and down the room his brows were knitted and his lips pursed in the presence of this mental stress mr blundell preserved a respectful silence  we’ll all four go for a walk on the quay on sunday afternoon said mr turnbull at last  on the chance inquired his staring friend  on the chance assented the other it’s just possible daly might fall in  he might if we walked up and down five million times said blundell unpleasantly  he might if we walked up and down three or four times said mr turnbull especially if you happened to stumble  i never stumble said the matteroffact mr blundell i don’t know anybody more surefooted than i am  or thickheaded added the exasperated mr turnbull  mr blundell regarded him patiently he had a strong suspicion that his friend had been drinking  stumbling said mr turnbull conquering his annoyance with an effort stumbling is a thing that might happen to anybody you trip your foot against a stone and lurch up against daly he tumbles overboard and you off with your jacket and dive in off the quay after him he can’t swim a stroke  mr blundell caught his breath and gazed at him in speechless amaze  there’s sure to be several people on the quay if it’s a fine afternoon continued his instructor you’ll have half dunchurch round you praising you and patting you on the back—all in front of venia mind you it’ll be put in all the papers and you’ll get a medal  and suppose we are both drowned said mr blundell soberly  drowned fiddlesticks said mr turnbull however please yourself if you’re afraid——  i’ll do it said blundell decidedly  and mind said the other don’t do it as if it’s as easy as kissing your fingers be halfdrowned yourself or at least pretend to be and when you’re on the quay take your time about coming round be longer than daly is you don’t want him to get all the pity  all right said the other  after a time you can open your eyes went on his instructor then if i were you i should say ’goodbye venia’ and close ’em again work it up affecting and send messages to your aunts  it sounds all right said blundell  it is all right said mr turnbull that’s just the bare idea i’ve given you it’s for you to improve upon it you’ve got two days to think about it  mr blundell thanked him and for the next two days thought of little else being a careful man he made his will and it was in a comparatively cheerful frame of mind that he made his way on sunday afternoon to mr turnbull’s  the sergeant was already there conversing in low tones with venia by the window while mr turnbull sitting opposite in an oaken armchair regarded him with an expression which would have shocked iago  we were just thinking of having a blow down by the water he said as blundell entered  what a hot day like this said venia  i was just thinking how beautifully cool it is in here said the sergeant who was hoping for a repetition of the previous sunday’s performance  it’s cooler outside said mr turnbull with a wilful ignoring of facts much cooler when you get used to it  he led the way with blundell and venia and the sergeant keeping as much as possible in the shade of the dustpowdered hedges followed the sun was blazing in the sky and scarce halfadozen people were to be seen on the little curved quay which constituted the usual sunday afternoon promenade the water a dozen feet below lapped cool and green against the stone sides  at the extreme end of the quay underneath the lantern they all stopped ostensibly to admire a fullrigged ship sailing slowly by in the distance but really to effect the change of partners necessary to the afternoon’s business the change gave mr turnbull some trouble ere it was effected but he was successful at last and walking behind the two young men waited somewhat nervously for developments  twice they paraded the length of the quay and nothing happened the ship was still visible and the sergeant halting to gaze at it the company lost their formation and he led the complaisant venia off from beneath her father’s very nose  you’re a pretty manager you are john blundell said the incensed mr turnbull  i know what i’m about said blundell slowly  well why don’t you do it demanded the other i suppose you are going to wait until there are more people about and then perhaps some of them will see you push him over  it isn’t that said blundell slowly but you told me to improve on your plan you know and i’ve been thinking out improvements  well said the other  it doesn’t seem much good saving daly said blundell that’s what i’ve been thinking he would be in as much danger as i should and he’d get as much sympathy perhaps more  do you mean to tell me that you are backing out of it demanded mr turnbull  no said blundell slowly but it would be much better if i saved somebody else i don’t want daly to be pitied  bah you are backing out of it said the irritated mr turnbull you’re afraid of a little cold water  no i’m not said blundell but it would be better in every way to save somebody else she’ll see daly standing there doing nothing while i am struggling for my life i’ve thought it all out very carefully i know i’m not quick but i’m sure and when i make up my mind to do a thing i do it you ought to know that  that’s all very well said the other but who else is there to push in  that’s all right said blundell vaguely don’t you worry about that i shall find somebody  mr turnbull turned and cast a speculative eye along the quay as a rule he had great confidence in blundell’s determination but on this occasion he had his doubts  well it’s a riddle to me he said slowly i give it up it seems— halloa good heavens be careful you nearly had me in then  did i said blundell thickly i’m very sorry  mr turnbull angry at such carelessness accepted the apology in a grudging spirit and trudged along in silence then he started nervously as a monstrous and unworthy suspicion occurred to him it was an incredible thing to suppose but at the same time he felt that there was nothing like being on the safe side and in tones not quite free from significance he intimated his desire of changing places with his awkward friend  it’s all right said blundell soothingly  i know it is said mr turnbull regarding him fixedly but i prefer this side you very near had me over just now  i staggered said mr blundell  another inch and i should have been overboard said mr turnbull with a shudder that would have been a nice how d’ye do  mr blundell coughed and looked seaward accidents will happen he murmured  they reached the end of the quay again and stood talking and when they turned once more the sergeant was surprised and gratified at the ease with which he bore off venia mr turnbull and blundell followed some little way behind and the former gentleman’s suspicions were somewhat lulled by finding that his friend made no attempt to take the inside place he looked about him with interest for a likely victim but in vain  what are you looking at he demanded impatiently as blundell suddenly came to a stop and gazed curiously into the harbour  jellyfish said the other briefly i never saw such a monster it must be a yard across  mr turnbull stopped but could see nothing and even when blundell pointed it out with his finger he had no better success he stepped forward a pace and his suspicions returned with renewed vigour as a hand was laid caressingly on his shoulder the next moment with a wild shriek he shot suddenly over the edge and disappeared venia and the sergeant turning hastily were just in time to see the fountain which ensued on his immersion  oh save him cried venia  the sergeant ran to the edge and gazed in helpless dismay as mr turnbull came to the surface and disappeared again at the same moment blundell who had thrown off his coat dived into the harbour and rising rapidly to the surface caught the fastchoking mr turnbull by the collar  keep still he cried sharply as the farmer tried to clutch him keep still or i’ll let you go  help choked the farmer gazing up at the little knot of people which had collected on the quay  a stout fisherman who had not run for thirty years came along the edge of the quay at a shambling trot with a coil of rope over his arm john blundell saw him and mindful of the farmer’s warning about kissing of fingers etc raised his disengaged arm and took that frenzied gentleman below the surface again by the time they came up he was very glad for his own sake to catch the line skilfully thrown by the old fisherman and be drawn gently to the side  i’ll tow you to the steps said the fisherman don’t let go o’ the line  mr turnbull saw to that he wound the rope round his wrist and began to regain his presence of mind as they were drawn steadily toward the steps willing hands drew them out of the water and helped them up on to the quay where mr turnbull sitting in his own puddle coughed up salt water and glared ferociously at the inanimate form of mr blundell sergeant daly and another man were rendering what they piously believed to be first aid to the apparently drowned while the stout fisherman with both hands to his mouth was yelling in heartrending accents for a barrel  he—he—push—pushed me in gasped the choking mr turnbull  nobody paid any attention to him even venia seeing that he was safe was on her knees by the side of the unconscious blundell  he—he’s shamming bawled the neglected mr turnbull  shame said somebody without even looking round  he pushed me in repeated mr turnbull he pushed me in  oh father said venia with a scandalised glance at him how can you  shame said the bystanders briefly as they watched anxiously for signs of returning life on the part of mr blundell he lay still with his eyes closed but his hearing was still acute and the sounds of a rapidly approaching barrel trundled by a breathless samaritan did him more good than anything  goodbye venia he said in a faint voice goodbye  miss turnbull sobbed and took his hand  he’s shamming roared mr turnbull incensed beyond measure at the faithful manner in which blundell was carrying out his instructions he pushed me in  there was an angry murmur from the bystanders be reasonable mr turnbull said the sergeant somewhat sharply  he nearly lost ’is life over you said the stout fisherman as plucky a thing as ever i see if i ’adn’t ha’ been ’andy with that there line you’d both ha’ been drownded  give—my love—to everybody said blundell faintly goodbye venia goodbye mr turnbull  where’s that barrel demanded the stout fisherman crisply going to be all night with it now two of you——  mr blundell with a great effort and assisted by venia and the sergeant sat up he felt that he had made a good impression and had no desire to spoil it by riding the barrel with one exception everybody was regarding him with moisteyed admiration the exception’s eyes were perhaps the moistest of them all but admiration had no place in them  you’re all being made fools of he said getting up and stamping i tell you he pushed me overboard for the purpose  oh father how can you demanded venia angrily he saved your life  he pushed me in repeated the farmer told me to look at a jellyfish and pushed me in  what for inquired sergeant daly  because— said mr turnbull he looked at the unconscious sergeant and the words on his lips died away in an inarticulate growl  what for pursued the sergeant in triumph be reasonable mr turnbull where’s the reason in pushing you overboard and then nearly losing his life saving you that would be a fool’s trick it was as fine a thing as ever i saw  what you ’ad mr turnbull said the stout fisherman tapping him on the arm was a little touch o’ the sun  what felt to you like a push said another man and over you went  as easy as easy said a third  you’re red in the face now said the stout fisherman regarding him critically and your eyes are starting you take my advice and get ’ome and get to bed and the first thing you’ll do when you get your senses back will be to go round and thank mr blundell for all ’e’s done for you  mr turnbull looked at them and the circle of intelligent faces grew misty before his angry eyes one man ignoring his sodden condition recommended a wet handkerchief tied round his brow  i don’t want any thanks mr turnbull said blundell feebly as he was assisted to his feet i’d do as much for you again  the stout fisherman patted him admiringly on the back and mr turnbull felt like a prophet beholding a realised vision as the spectators clustered round mr blundell and followed their friends’ example tenderly but firmly they led the hero in triumph up the quay toward home shouting out eulogistic descriptions of his valour to curious neighbours as they passed mr turnbull churlishly keeping his distance in the rear of the procession received in grim silence the congratulations of his friends  the extraordinary hallucination caused by the sunstroke lasted with him for over a week but at the end of that time his mind cleared and he saw things in the same light as reasonable folk venia was the first to congratulate him upon his recovery but his extraordinary behaviour in proposing to miss sippet the very day on which she herself became mrs blundell convinced her that his recovery was only partial     bill’s lapse     strength and goodnature—said the nightwatchman musingly as he felt his biceps—strength and goodnature always go together sometimes you find a strong man who is not goodnatured but then as everybody he comes in contack with is it comes to the same thing  the strongest and kindest’earted man i ever come across was a man o’ the name of bill burton a shipmate of ginger dick’s for that matter ’e was a shipmate o’ peter russet’s and old sam small’s too not over and above tall just about my height his arms was like another man’s legs for size and ’is chest and his back and shoulders might ha’ been made for a giant and with all that he’d got a soft blue eye like a gal’s blue’s my favourite colour for gals’ eyes and a nice soft curly brown beard he was an ab too and that showed ’ow goodnatured he was to pick up with firemen  he got so fond of ’em that when they was all paid off from the ocean king he asked to be allowed to join them in taking a room ashore it pleased everybody four coming cheaper than three and bill being that goodtempered that ’e’d put up with anything and when any of the three quarrelled he used to act the part of peacemaker  the only thing about ’im that they didn’t like was that ’e was a teetotaler he’d go into public’ouses with ’em but he wouldn’t drink leastways that is to say he wouldn’t drink beer and ginger used to say that it made ’im feel uncomfortable to see bill put away a bottle o’ lemonade every time they ’ad a drink one night arter ’e had ’ad seventeen bottles he could ’ardly got home and peter russet who knew a lot about pills and suchlike pointed out to ’im ’ow bad it was for his constitushon he proved that the lemonade would eat away the coats o’ bill’s stomach and that if ’e kept on ’e might drop down dead at any moment  that frightened bill a bit and the next night instead of ’aving lemonade ’e had five bottles o’ stone gingerbeer six of different kinds of teetotal beer three of sodawater and two cups of coffee i’m not counting the drink he ’ad at the chemist’s shop arterward because he took that as medicine but he was so queer in ’is inside next morning that ’e began to be afraid he’d ’ave to give up drink altogether  he went without the next night but ’e was such a generous man that ’e would pay every fourth time and there was no pleasure to the other chaps to see ’im pay and ’ave nothing out of it it spoilt their evening and owing to ’aving only about ’arf wot they was accustomed to they all got up very disagreeable next morning  why not take just a little beer bill asks ginger  bill ’ung his ’ead and looked a bit silly i’d rather not mate he ses at last i’ve been teetotal for eleven months now  think of your ’ealth bill ses peter russet your ’ealth is more important than the pledge wot made you take it  bill coughed i ’ad reasons he ses slowly a mate o’ mine wished me to  he ought to ha’ known better ses sam he ’ad ’is reasons ses bill  well all i can say is bill ses ginger all i can say is it’s very disobligin’ of you  disobligin’ ses bill with a start don’t say that mate  i must say it ses ginger speaking very firm  you needn’t take a lot bill ses sam nobody wants you to do that just drink in moderation same as wot we do  it gets into my ’ead ses bill at last  well and wot of it ses ginger it gets into everybody’s ’ead occasionally why one night old sam ’ere went up behind a policeman and tickled ’im under the arms didn’t you sam  i did nothing o’ the kind ses sam firing up  well you was fined ten bob for it next morning that’s all i know ses ginger  i was fined ten bob for punching ’im ses old sam very wild i never tickled a policeman in my life i never thought o’ such a thing i’d no more tickle a policeman than i’d fly anybody that ses i did is a liar why should i where does the sense come in wot should i want to do it for  all right sam ses ginger sticking ’is fingers in ’is ears you didn’t then  no i didn’t ses sam and don’t you forget it this ain’t the fust time you’ve told that lie about me i can take a joke with any man but anybody that goes and ses i tickled—  all right ses ginger and peter russet together you’ll ’ave tickled policeman on the brain if you ain’t careful sam ses peter  old sam sat down growling and ginger dick turned to bill agin it gets into everybody’s ’ead at times he ses and where’s the ’arm it’s wot it was meant for  bill shook his ’ead but when ginger called ’im disobligin’ agin he gave way and he broke the pledge that very evening with a pint o’ six ’arf  ginger was surprised to see the way ’e took his liquor arter three or four pints he’d expected to see ’im turn a bit silly or sing or do something o’ the kind but bill kept on as if ’e was drinking water  think of the ’armless pleasure you’ve been losing all these months bill ses ginger smiling at him  bill said it wouldn’t bear thinking of and the next place they came to he said some rather ’ard things of the man who’d persuaded ’im to take the pledge he ’ad two or three more there and then they began to see that it was beginning to have an effect on ’im the first one that noticed it was ginger dick bill ’ad just lit ’is pipe and as he threw the match down he ses i don’t like these ’ere safety matches he ses  don’t you bill ses ginger i do rather  oh you do do you ses bill turning on ’im like lightning well take that for contradictin’ he ses an’ he gave ginger a smack that nearly knocked his ’ead off  it was so sudden that old sam and peter put their beer down and stared at each other as if they couldn’t believe their eyes then they stooped down and helped pore ginger on to ’is legs agin and began to brush ’im down  never mind about ’im mates ses bill looking at ginger very wicked p’r’aps he won’t be so ready to give me ’is lip next time let’s come to another pub and enjoy ourselves  sam and peter followed ’im out like lambs ’ardly daring to look over their shoulder at ginger who was staggering arter them some distance behind a ’olding a handerchief to ’is face  it’s your turn to pay sam ses bill when they’d got inside the next place wot’s it to be give it a name  three ’arf pints o’ four ale miss ses sam not because ’e was mean but because it wasn’t ’is turn three wot ses bill turning on ’im  three pots o’ six ale miss ses sam in a hurry  that wasn’t wot you said afore ses bill take that he ses giving pore old sam a wipe in the mouth and knocking ’im over a stool take that for your sauce  peter russet stood staring at sam and wondering wot bill ud be like when he’d ’ad a little more sam picked hisself up arter a time and went outside to talk to ginger about it and then bill put ’is arm round peter’s neck and began to cry a bit and say ’e was the only pal he’d got left in the world it was very awkward for peter and more awkward still when the barman came up and told ’im to take bill outside  go on he ses out with ’im  he’s all right ses peter trembling we’s the truest’arted gentleman in london ain’t you bill  bill said he was and ’e asked the barman to go and hide ’is face because it reminded ’im of a little dog ’e had ’ad once wot ’ad died  you get outside afore you’re hurt ses the barman  bill punched at ’im over the bar and not being able to reach ’im threw peter’s pot o’ beer at ’im there was a fearful todo then and the landlord jumped over the bar and stood in the doorway whistling for the police bill struck out right and left and the men in the bar went down like skittles peter among them then they got outside and bill arter giving the landlord a thump in the back wot nearly made him swallow the whistle jumped into a cab and pulled peter russet in arter ’im  i’ll talk to you byandby he ses as the cab drove off at a gallop there ain’t room in this cab you wait my lad that’s all you just wait till we get out and i’ll knock you silly  wot for bill ses peter staring  don’t you talk to me roars bill if i choose to knock you about that’s my business ain’t it besides you know very well  he wouldn’t let peter say another word but coming to a quiet place near the docks he stopped the cab and pulling ’im out gave ’im such a dressing down that peter thought ’is last hour ’ad arrived he let ’im go at last and after first making him pay the cabman took ’im along till they came to a public’ouse and made ’im pay for drinks  they stayed there till nearly eleven o’clock and then bill set off home ’olding the unfortunit peter by the scruff o’ the neck and wondering out loud whether ’e ought to pay ’im a bit more or not afore ’e could make up ’is mind however he turned sleepy and throwing ’imself down on the bed which was meant for the two of ’em fell into a peaceful sleep  sam and ginger dick came in a little while arterward both badly marked where bill ’ad hit them and sat talking to peter in whispers as to wot was to be done ginger who ’ad plenty of pluck was for them all to set on to ’im but sam wouldn’t ’ear of it and as for peter he was so sore he could ’ardly move  they all turned in to the other bed at last ’arf afraid to move for fear of disturbing bill and when they woke up in the morning and see ’im sitting up in ’is bed they lay as still as mice  why ginger old chap ses bill with a ’earty smile wot are you all three in one bed for  we was a bit cold ses ginger  cold ses bill wot this weather we ’ad a bit of a spree last night old man didn’t we my throat’s as dry as a cinder  it ain’t my idea of a spree ses ginger sitting up and looking at ’im  good ’eavens ginger ses bill starting back wotever ’ave you been adoing to your face have you been tumbling off of a ’bus  ginger couldn’t answer and sam small and peter sat up in bed alongside of ’im and bill getting as far back on ’is bed as he could sat staring at their pore faces as if ’e was having a ’orrible dream  and there’s sam he ses where ever did you get that mouth sam  same place as ginger got ’is eye and pore peter got ’is face ses sam grinding his teeth  you don’t mean to tell me ses bill in a sad voice—you don’t mean to tell me that i did it  you know well enough ses ginger  bill looked at ’em and ’is face got as long as a yard measure  i’d ’oped i’d growed out of it mates he ses at last but drink always takes me like that i can’t keep a pal  you surprise me ses ginger sarcasticlike don’t talk like that ginger ses bill ’arf crying  it ain’t my fault it’s my weakness wot did i do it for  i don’t know ses ginger but you won’t get the chance of doing it agin i’ll tell you that much  i daresay i shall be better tonight ginger ses bill very humble it don’t always take me that way  well we don’t want you with us any more ses old sam ’olding his ’ead very high  you’ll ’ave to go and get your beer by yourself bill ses peter russet feeling ’is bruises with the tips of ’is fingers  but then i should be worse ses bill i want cheerful company when i’m like that i should very likely come ’ome and ’arf kill you all in your beds you don’t ’arf know what i’m like last night was nothing else i should ’ave remembered it  cheerful company ses old sam ’ow do you think company’s going to be cheerful when you’re carrying on like that bill why don’t you go away and leave us alone  because i’ve got a ’art ses bill i can’t chuck up pals in that freeandeasy way once i take a liking to anybody i’d do anything for ’em and i’ve never met three chaps i like better than wot i do you three nicer straightforrad free’anded mates i’ve never met afore  why not take the pledge agin bill ses peter russet  no mate ses bill with a kind smile it’s just a weakness and i must try and grow out of it i’ll tie a bit o’ string round my little finger tonight as a reminder  he got out of bed and began to wash ’is face and ginger dick who was doing a bit o’ thinking gave a whisper to sam and peter russet  all right bill old man he ses getting out of bed and beginning to put his clothes on but first of all we’ll try and find out ’ow the landlord is  landlord ses bill puffing and blowing in the basin wot landlord  why the one you bashed ses ginger with a wink at the other two he ’adn’t got ’is senses back when me and sam came away  bill gave a groan and sat on the bed while ’e dried himself and ginger told ’im ’ow he ’ad bent a quart pot on the landlord’s ’ead and ’ow the landlord ’ad been carried upstairs and the doctor sent for he began to tremble all over and when ginger said he’d go out and see ’ow the land lay ’e could ’ardly thank ’im enough  he stayed in the bedroom all day with the blinds down and wouldn’t eat anything and when ginger looked in about eight o’clock to find out whether he ’ad gone he found ’im sitting on the bed clean shaved and ’is face cut about all over where the razor ’ad slipped  ginger was gone about two hours and when ’e came back he looked so solemn that old sam asked ’im whether he ’ad seen a ghost ginger didn’t answer ’im he set down on the side o’ the bed and sat thinking  i s’pose—i s’pose it’s nice and fresh in the streets this morning ses bill at last in a trembling voice  ginger started and looked at ’im i didn’t notice mate he ses then ’e got up and patted bill on the back very gentle and sat down again  anything wrong ginger asks peter russet staring at ’im  it’s that landlord ses ginger there’s straw down in the road outside and they say that he’s dying pore old bill don’t know ’is own strength the best thing you can do old pal is to go as far away as you can at once  i shouldn’t wait a minnit if it was me ses old sam  bill groaned and hid ’is face in his ’ands and then peter russet went and spoilt things by saying that the safest place for a murderer to ’ide in was london bill gave a dreadful groan when ’e said murderer but ’e up and agreed with peter and all sam and ginger dick could do wouldn’t make ’im alter his mind he said that he would shave off ’is beard and moustache and when night came ’e would creep out and take a lodging somewhere right the other end of london  it’ll soon be dark ses ginger and your own brother wouldn’t know you now bill where d’you think of going  bill shook his ’ead nobody must know that mate he ses i must go into hiding for as long as i can—as long as my money lasts i’ve only got six pounds left  that’ll last a long time if you’re careful ses ginger  i want a lot more ses bill i want you to take this silver ring as a keepsake ginger if i ’ad another six pounds or so i should feel much safer ’ow much ’ave you got ginger  not much ses ginger shaking his ’ead  lend it to me mate ses bill stretching out his ’and you can easy get another ship ah i wish i was you i’d be as ’appy as ’appy if i hadn’t got a penny  i’m very sorry bill ses ginger trying to smile but i’ve already promised to lend it to a man wot we met this evening a promise is a promise else i’d lend it to you with pleasure  would you let me be ’ung for the sake of a few pounds ginger ses bill looking at ’im reproachfully i’m a desprit man ginger and i must ’ave that money  afore pore ginger could move he suddenly clapped ’is hand over ’is mouth and flung ’im on the bed ginger was like a child in ’is hands although he struggled like a madman and in five minutes ’e was laying there with a towel tied round his mouth and ’is arms and legs tied up with the cord off of sam’s chest  i’m very sorry ginger ses bill as ’e took a little over eight pounds out of ginger’s pocket i’ll pay you back one o’ these days if i can if you’d got a rope round your neck same as i ’ave you’d do the same as i’ve done  he lifted up the bedclothes and put ginger inside and tucked ’im up ginger’s face was red with passion and ’is eyes starting out of his ’ead  eight and six is fifteen ses bill and just then he ’eard somebody coming up the stairs ginger ’eard it too and as peter russet came into the room ’e tried all ’e could to attract ’is attention by rolling ’is ’ead from side to side  why ’as ginger gone to bed ses peter wot’s up ginger  he’s all right ses bill just a bit of a ’eadache  peter stood staring at the bed and then ’e pulled the clothes off and saw pore ginger all tied up and making awful eyes at ’im to undo him  i ’ad to do it peter ses bill i wanted some more money to escape with and ’e wouldn’t lend it to me i ’aven’t got as much as i want now you just came in in the nick of time another minute and you’d ha’ missed me ’ow much ’ave you got  ah i wish i could lend you some bill ses peter russet turning pale but i’ve ’ad my pocket picked that’s wot i came back for to get some from ginger  bill didn’t say a word  you see ’ow it is bill ses peter edging back toward the door three men laid ’old of me and took every farthing i’d got  well i can’t rob you then ses bill catching ’old of ’im whoever’s money this is he ses pulling a handful out o’ peter’s pocket it can’t be yours now if you make another sound i’ll knock your ’ead off afore i tie you up  don’t tie me up bill ses peter struggling  i can’t trust you ses bill dragging ’im over to the washstand and taking up the other towel turn round  peter was a much easier job than ginger dick and arter bill ’ad done ’im ’e put ’im in alongside o’ ginger and covered ’em up arter first tying both the gags round with some string to prevent ’em slipping  mind i’ve only borrowed it he ses standing by the side o’ the bed but i must say mates i’m disappointed in both of you if either of you ’ad ’ad the misfortune wot i’ve ’ad i’d have sold the clothes off my back to ’elp you and i wouldn’t ’ave waited to be asked neither  he stood there for a minute very sorrowful and then ’e patted both their ’eads and went downstairs ginger and peter lay listening for a bit and then they turned their pore boundup faces to each other and tried to talk with their eyes  then ginger began to wriggle and try and twist the cords off but ’e might as well ’ave tried to wriggle out of ’is skin the worst of it was they couldn’t make known their intentions to each other and when peter russet leaned over ’im and tried to work ’is gag off by rubbing it up agin ’is nose ginger pretty near went crazy with temper he banged peter with his ’ead and peter banged back and they kept it up till they’d both got splitting ’eadaches and at last they gave up in despair and lay in the darkness waiting for sam  and all this time sam was sitting in the red lion waiting for them he sat there quite patient till twelve o’clock and then walked slowly ’ome wondering wot ’ad happened and whether bill had gone  ginger was the fust to ’ear ’is foot on the stairs and as he came into the room in the darkness him an’ peter russet started shaking their bed in a way that scared old sam nearly to death he thought it was bill carrying on agin and ’e was out o’ that door and ’arfway downstairs afore he stopped to take breath he stood there trembling for about ten minutes and then as nothing ’appened he walked slowly upstairs agin on tiptoe and as soon as they heard the door creak peter and ginger made that bed do everything but speak  is that you bill ses old sam in a shaky voice and standing ready to dash downstairs agin  there was no answer except for the bed and sam didn’t know whether bill was dying or whether ’e ’ad got delirium trimmings all ’e did know was that ’e wasn’t going to sleep in that room he shut the door gently and went downstairs agin feeling in ’is pocket for a match and not finding one ’e picked out the softest stair ’e could find and leaning his ’ead agin the banisters went to sleep  it was about six o’clock when ’e woke up and broad daylight he was stiff and sore all over and feeling braver in the light ’e stepped softly upstairs and opened the door peter and ginger was waiting for ’im and as he peeped in ’e saw two things sitting up in bed with their ’air standing up all over like mops and their faces tied up with bandages he was that startled ’e nearly screamed and then ’e stepped into the room and stared at ’em as if he couldn’t believe ’is eyes  is that you ginger he ses wot d’ye mean by making sights of yourselves like that ’ave you took leave of your senses  ginger and peter shook their ’eads and rolled their eyes and then sam see wot was the matter with ’em fust thing ’e did was to pull out ’is knife and cut ginger’s gag off and the fust thing ginger did was to call ’im every name ’e could lay his tongue to  you wait a moment he screams ’arf crying with rage you wait till i get my ’ands loose and i’ll pull you to pieces the idea o’ leaving us like this all night you old crocodile i ’eard you come in i’ll pay you  sam didn’t answer ’im he cut off peter russet’s gag and peter russet called ’im ’arf a score o’ names without taking breath  and when ginger’s finished i’ll ’ave a go at you he ses cut off these lines  at once d’ye hear ses ginger oh you wait till i get my ’ands on you  sam didn’t answer ’em he shut up ’is knife with a click and then ’e sat at the foot o’ the bed on ginger’s feet and looked at ’em it wasn’t the fust time they’d been rude to ’im but as a rule he’d ’ad to put up with it he sat and listened while ginger swore ’imself faint  that’ll do he ses at last another word and i shall put the bedclothes over your ’ead afore i do anything more i want to know wot it’s all about  peter told ’im arter fust calling ’im some more names because ginger was past it and when ’e’d finished old sam said ’ow surprised he was at them for letting bill do it and told ’em how they ought to ’ave prevented it he sat there talking as though ’e enjoyed the sound of ’is own voice and he told peter and ginger all their faults and said wot sorrow it caused their friends twice he ’ad to throw the bedclothes over their ’eads because o’ the noise they was making  are you going—to undo—us ses ginger at last  no ginger ses old sam in justice to myself i couldn’t do it arter wot you’ve said—and arter wot i’ve said—my life wouldn’t be safe besides which you’d want to go shares in my money  he took up ’is chest and marched downstairs with it and about ’arf an hour arterward the landlady’s ’usband came up and set ’em free as soon as they’d got the use of their legs back they started out to look for sam but they didn’t find ’im for nearly a year and as for bill they never set eyes on ’im again     lawyer quince     lawyer quince so called by his neighbours in little haven from his readiness at all times to place at their disposal the legal lore he had acquired from a few old books while following his useful occupation of making boots sat in a kind of wooden hutch at the side of his cottage plying his trade the london coach had gone by in a cloud of dust some three hours before and since then the wide village street had slumbered almost undisturbed in the sunshine  hearing footsteps and the sound of voices raised in dispute caused him to look up from his work mr rose of holly farm hogg the miller and one or two neighbours of lesser degree appeared to be in earnest debate over some point of unusual difficulty  lawyer quince took a pinch of snuff and bent to his work again mr rose was one of the very few who openly questioned his legal knowledge and his gibes concerning it were only too frequent moreover he had a taste for practical joking which to a grave man was sometimes offensive  well here he be said mr hogg to the farmer as the group halted in front of the hutch now ask lawyer quince and see whether i ain’t told you true i’m willing to abide by what he says  mr quince put down his hammer and brushing a little snuff from his coat leaned back in his chair and eyed them with grave confidence  it’s like this said the farmer young pascoe has been hanging round after my girl celia though i told her she wasn’t to have nothing to do with him half an hour ago i was going to put my pony in its stable when i see a young man sitting there waiting  well said mr quince after a pause  he’s there yet said the farmer i locked him in and hogg here says that i’ve got the right to keep him locked up there as long as i like i say it’s agin the law but hogg he says no i say his folks would come and try to break open my stable but hogg says if they do i can have the law of ’em for damaging my property  so you can interposed mr hogg firmly you see whether lawyer quince don’t say i’m right  mr quince frowned and in order to think more deeply closed his eyes taking advantage of this three of his auditors with remarkable unanimity each closed one  it’s your stable said mr quince opening his eyes and speaking with great deliberation and you have a right to lock it up when you like  there you are said mr hogg what did i tell you  if anybody’s there that’s got no business there that’s his lookout continued mr quince you didn’t induce him to go in  certainly not replied the farmer  i told him he can keep him there as long as he likes said the jubilant mr hogg and pass him in bread and water through the winder it’s got bars to it  yes said mr quince nodding he can do that as for his folks knocking the place about if you like to tie up one or two of them nasty savage dogs of yours to the stable well it’s your stable and you can fasten your dogs to it if you like and you’ve generally got a man about the yard  mr hogg smacked his thigh in ecstasy  but— began the farmer  that’s the law said the autocratic mr quince sharply o’ course if you think you know more about it than i do i’ve nothing more to say  i don’t want to do nothing i could get into trouble for murmured mr rose  you can’t get into trouble by doing as i tell you said the shoemaker impatiently however to be quite on the safe side if i was in your place i should lose the key  lose the key said the farmer blankly  lose the key repeated the shoemaker his eyes watering with intense appreciation of his own resourcefulness you can find it any time you want to you know keep him there till he promises to give up your daughter and tell him that as soon as he does you’ll have a hunt for the key  mr rose regarded him with what the shoemaker easily understood to be speechless admiration  i—i’m glad i came to you said the farmer at last  you’re welcome said the shoemaker loftily i’m always ready to give advice to them as require it  and good advice it is said the smiling mr hogg why don’t you behave yourself joe garnham he demanded turning fiercely on a listener  mr garnham whose eyes were watering with emotion attempted to explain but becoming hysterical thrust a huge red handkerchief to his mouth and was led away by a friend mr quince regarded his departure with mild disdain  little things please little minds he remarked  so they do said mr hogg i never thought—what’s the matter with you george askew  mr askew turning his back on him threw up his hands with a helpless gesture and followed in the wake of mr garnham mr hogg appeared to be about to apologise and then suddenly altering his mind made a hasty and unceremonious exit accompanied by the farmer  mr quince raised his eyebrows and then after a long and meditative pinch of snuff resumed his work the sun went down and the light faded slowly distant voices sounded close on the still evening air snatches of hoarse laughter jarred upon his ears it was clear that the story of the imprisoned swain was giving pleasure to little haven  he rose at last from his chair and stretching his long gaunt frame removed his leather apron and after a wash at the pump went into the house supper was laid and he gazed with approval on the homemade sausage rolls the piece of cold pork and the cheese which awaited his onslaught  we won’t wait for ned said mrs quince as she brought in a jug of ale and placed it by her husband’s elbow  mr quince nodded and filled his glass  you’ve been giving more advice i hear said mrs quince  her husband who was very busy nodded again  it wouldn’t make no difference to young pascoe’s chance anyway said mrs quince thoughtfully  mr quince continued his labours why he inquired at last  his wife smiled and tossed her head  young pascoe’s no chance against our ned she said swelling with maternal pride  eh said the shoemaker laying down his knife and fork our ned  they are as fond of each other as they can be said mrs quince though i don’t suppose farmer rose’ll care for it not but what our ned’s as good as he is  is ned up there now demanded the shoemaker turning pale as the mirthful face of mr garnham suddenly occurred to him  sure to be tittered his wife and to think o’ poor young pascoe shut up in that stable while he’s courting celia  mr quince took up his knife and fork again but his appetite had gone whoever might be paying attention to miss rose at that moment he felt quite certain that it was not mr ned quince and he trembled with anger as he saw the absurd situation into which the humorous mr rose had led him for years little haven had accepted his decisions as final and boasted of his sharpness to neighbouring hamlets and many a cottager had brought his boots to be mended a whole week before their time for the sake of an interview  he moved his chair from the table and smoked a pipe then he rose and putting a couple of formidable lawbooks under his arm walked slowly down the road in the direction of holly farm  the road was very quiet and the white swan usually full at this hour was almost deserted but if any doubts as to the identity of the prisoner lingered in his mind they were speedily dissipated by the behaviour of the few customers who crowded to the door to see him pass  a hum of voices fell on his ear as he approached the farm half the male and a goodly proportion of the female population of little haven were leaning against the fence or standing in little knots in the road while a few of higher social status stood in the farmyard itself  come down to have a look at the prisoner inquired the farmer who was standing surrounded by a little group of admirers  i came down to see you about that advice i gave you this afternoon said mr quince  ah said the other  i was busy when you came continued mr quince in a voice of easy unconcern and i gave you advice from memory looking up the subject after you’d gone i found that i was wrong  you don’t say so said the farmer uneasily if i’ve done wrong i’m only doing what you told me i could do  mistakes will happen with the best of us said the shoemaker loudly for the benefit of one or two murmurers i’ve known a man to marry a woman for her money before now and find out afterward that she hadn’t got any  one unit of the group detached itself and wandered listlessly toward the gate  well i hope i ain’t done nothing wrong said mr rose anxiously you gave me the advice there’s men here as can prove it i don’t want to do nothing agin the law what had i better do  well if i was you said mr quince concealing his satisfaction with difficulty i should let him out at once and beg his pardon and say you hope he’ll do nothing about it i’ll put in a word for you if you like with old pascoe  mr rose coughed and eyed him queerly  you’re a briton he said warmly i’ll go and let him out at once  he strode off to the stable despite the protests of mr hogg and standing by the door appeared to be deep in thought then he came back slowly feeling in his pockets as he walked  william he said turning toward mr hogg i s’pose you didn’t happen to notice where i put that key  that i didn’t said mr hogg his face clearing suddenly  i had it in my hand not half an hour ago said the agitated mr rose thrusting one hand into his trouserpocket and groping it can’t be far  mr quince attempted to speak and failing blew his nose violently  my memory ain’t what it used to be said the farmer howsomever i dare say it’ll turn up in a day or two  you—you’d better force the door suggested mr quince struggling to preserve an air of judicial calm  no no said mr rose i ain’t going to damage my property like that i can lock my stabledoor and unlock it when i like if people get in there as have no business there it’s their lookout  that’s law said mr hogg i’ll eat my hat if it ain’t  do you mean to tell me you’ve really lost the key demanded mr quince eyeing the farmer sternly  seems like it said mr rose however he won’t come to no hurt i’ll put in some bread and water for him same as you advised me to  mr quince mastered his wrath by an effort and with no sign of discomposure moved away without making any reference to the identity of the unfortunate in the stable  goodnight said the farmer and thank you for coming and giving me the fresh advice it ain’t everybody that ’ud ha’ taken the trouble if i hadn’t lost that key——  the shoemaker scowled and with the two fat books under his arm passed the listening neighbours with the air of a thoughtful man out for an evening stroll once inside his house however his manner changed the attitude of mrs quince demanding at any rate a show of concern  it’s no good talking he said at last ned shouldn’t have gone there and as for going to law about it i sha’n’t do any such thing i should never hear the end of it i shall just go on as usual as if nothing had happened and when rose is tired of keeping him there he must let him out i’ll bide my time  mrs quince subsided into vague mutterings as to what she would do if she were a man coupled with sundry aspersions upon the character looks and family connections of farmer rose which somewhat consoled her for being what she was  he has always made jokes about your advice she said at length and now everybody’ll think he’s right i sha’n’t be able to look anybody in the face i should have seen through it at once if it had been me i’m going down to give him a bit o’ my mind  you stay where you are said mr quince sharply and mind you are not to talk about it to anybody farmer rose ’ud like nothing better than to see us upset about it i ain’t done with him yet you wait  mrs quince having no option waited but nothing happened the following day found ned quince still a prisoner and considering the circumstances remarkably cheerful he declined pointblank to renounce his preposterous attentions and said that living on the premises he felt half like a soninlaw already he also complimented the farmer upon the quality of his bread  the next morning found him still unsubdued and under interrogation from the farmer he admitted that he liked it and said that the feeling of being at home was growing upon him  if you’re satisfied i am said mr rose grimly i’ll keep you here till you promise mind that  it’s a nobleman’s life said ned peeping through the window and i’m beginning to like you as much as my real father  i don’t want none o’ yer impudence said the farmer reddening  you’ll like me better when you’ve had me here a little longer said ned i shall grow on you why not be reasonable and make up your mind to it celia and i have  i’m going to send celia away on saturday said mr rose make yourself happy and comfortable in here till then if you’d like another crust o’ bread or an extra half pint o’ water you’ve only got to mention it when she’s gone i’ll have a hunt for that key so as you can go back to your father and help him to understand his lawbooks better  he strode off with the air of a conqueror and having occasion to go to the village looked in at the shoemaker’s window as he passed and smiled broadly for years little haven had regarded mr quince with awe as being far too dangerous a man for the lay mind to tamper with and at one stroke the farmer had revealed the hollowness of his pretensions only that morning the wife of a labourer had called and asked him to hurry the mending of a pair of boots she was a voluble woman and having overcome her preliminary nervousness more than hinted that if he gave less time to the law and more to his trade it would be better for himself and everybody else  miss rose accepted her lot in a spirit of dutiful resignation and on saturday morning after her father’s admonition not to forget that the coach left the white swan at two sharp set off to pay a few farewell visits by halfpast twelve she had finished and lawyer quince becoming conscious of a shadow on his work looked up to see her standing before the window he replied to a bewitching smile with a short nod and became intent upon his work again  for a short time celia lingered then to his astonishment she opened the gate and walked past the side of the house into the garden with growing astonishment he observed her enter his toolshed and close the door behind her  for ten minutes he worked on and then curiosity getting the better of him he walked slowly to the toolshed and opening the door a little way peeped in it was a small shed crowded with agricultural implements the floor was occupied by an upturned wheelbarrow and sitting on the barrow with her soft cheek leaning against the wall sat miss rose fast asleep mr quince coughed several times each cough being louder than the last and then treading softly was about to return to the workshop when the girl stirred and muttered in her sleep at first she was unintelligible then he distinctly caught the words idiot and blockhead  she’s dreaming of somebody said mr quince to himself with conviction  wonder who it is  can’t see—a thing—under—his—nose murmured the fair sleeper  celia said mr quince sharply celia  he took a hoe from the wall and prodded her gently with the handle a singularly vicious expression marred the soft features but that was all  celia said the shoemaker who feared sunstroke  fancy if he—had—a moment’s common sense murmured celia drowsily and locked—the door  lawyer quince dropped the hoe with a clatter and stood regarding her openmouthed he was a careful man with his property and the stout door boasted a good lock he sped to the house on tiptoe and taking the key from its nail on the kitchen dresser returned to the shed and after another puzzled glance at the sleeping girl locked her in  for half an hour he sat in silent enjoyment of the situation—enjoyment which would have been increased if he could have seen mr rose standing at the gate of holly farm casting anxious glances up and down the road celia’s luggage had gone down to the white swan and an excellent cold luncheon was awaiting her attention in the livingroom  halfpast one came and no celia and five minutes later two farm labourers and a boy lumbered off in different directions in search of the missing girl with instructions that she was to go straight to the white swan to meet the coach the farmer himself walked down to the inn turning over in his mind a heated lecture composed for the occasion but the coach came and after a cheerful bustle and the consumption of sundry mugs of beer sped on its way again  he returned home in silent consternation seeking in vain for a satisfactory explanation of the mystery for a robust young woman to disappear in broad daylight and leave no trace behind her was extraordinary then a sudden sinking sensation in the region of the waistcoat and an idea occurred simultaneously  he walked down to the village again the idea growing steadily all the way lawyer quince was hard at work as usual as he passed he went by the window three times and gazed wistfully at the cottage coming to the conclusion at last that two heads were better than one in such a business he walked on to the mill and sought mr hogg  that’s what it is said the miller as he breathed his suspicions i thought all along lawyer quince would have the laugh of you he’s wonderful deep now let’s go to work cautious like try and look as if nothing had happened  mr rose tried  try agin said the miller with some severity get the red out o’ your face and let your eyes go back and don’t look as though you’re going to bite somebody  mr rose swallowed an angry retort and with an attempt at careless ease sauntered up the road with the miller to the shoemaker’s lawyer quince was still busy and looked up inquiringly as they passed before him  i s’pose said the diplomatic mr hogg who was well acquainted with his neighbour’s tidy and methodical habits—i s’pose you couldn’t lend me your barrow for half an hour the wheel’s off mine  mr quince hesitated and then favoured him with a glance intended to remind him of his scurvy behaviour three days before  you can have it he said at last rising  mr hogg pinched his friend in his excitement and both watched mr quince with bated breath as he took long slow strides toward the toolshed he tried the door and then went into the house and even before his reappearance both gentlemen knew only too well what was about to happen red was all too poor a word to apply to mr rose’s countenance as the shoemaker came toward them feeling in his waistcoat pocket with hooked fingers and thumb while mr hogg’s expressive features were twisted into an appearance of rosy appreciation  did you want the barrow very particular inquired the shoemaker in a regretful voice  very particular said mr hogg  mr quince went through the performance of feeling in all his pockets and then stood meditatively rubbing his chin  the door’s locked he said slowly and what i’ve done with that there key——  you open that door vociferated mr rose else i’ll break it in you’ve got my daughter in that shed and i’m going to have her out  your daughter said mr quince with an air of faint surprise what should she be doing in my shed  you let her out stormed mr rose trying to push past him  don’t trespass on my premises said lawyer quince interposing his long gaunt frame if you want that door opened you’ll have to wait till my boy ned comes home i expect he knows where to find the key  mr rose’s hands fell limply by his side and his tongue turning prudish refused its office he turned and stared at mr hogg in silent consternation  never known him to be beaten yet said that admiring weathercock  ned’s been away three days said the shoemaker but i expect him home soon  mr rose made a strange noise in his throat and then accepting his defeat set off at a rapid pace in the direction of home in a marvellously short space of time considering his age and figure he was seen returning with ned quince flushed and dishevelled walking by his side  here he is said the farmer now where’s that key  lawyer quince took his son by the arm and led him into the house from whence they almost immediately emerged with ned waving the key  i thought it wasn’t far said the sapient mr hogg  ned put the key in the lock and flinging the door open revealed celia rose blinking and confused in the sudden sunshine she drew back as she saw her father and began to cry with considerable fervour  how did you get in that shed miss demanded her parent stamping  i—i went there she sobbed i didn’t want to go away  well you’d better stay there shouted the overwrought mr rose i’ve done with you a girl that ’ud turn against her own father i—i—  he drove his right fist into his left palm and stamped out into the road lawyer quince and mr hogg after a moment’s hesitation followed  the laugh’s agin you farmer said the latter gentleman taking his arm  mr rose shook him off  better make the best of it continued the peacemaker  she’s a girl to be proud of said lawyer quince keeping pace with the farmer on the other side she’s got a head that’s worth yours and mine put together with hogg’s thrown in as a little makeweight  and here’s the white swan said mr hogg who had a hazy idea of a compliment and all of us as dry as a bone why not all go in and have a glass to shut folks’ mouths  and cry quits said the shoemaker  and let bygones be bygones said mr hogg taking the farmer’s arm again  mr rose stopped and shook his head obstinately and then under the skilful pilotage of mr hogg was steered in the direction of the hospitable doors of the white swan he made a last bid for liberty on the step and then disappeared inside lawyer quince brought up the rear     breaking a spell     witchcraft said the old man thoughtfully as he scratched his scanty whiskers no i ain’t heard o’ none in these parts for a long time there used to be a little of it about when i was a boy and there was some talk of it arter i’d growed up but claybury folk never took much count of it the last bit of it i remember was about forty years ago and that wasn’t so much witchcraft as foolishness  there was a man in this place then—joe barlcomb by name—who was a firm believer in it and ’e used to do all sorts of things to save hisself from it he was a newcomer in claybury and there was such a lot of it about in the parts he came from that the people thought o’ nothing else hardly  he was a man as got ’imself very much liked at fust especially by the old ladies owing to his being so perlite to them that they used to ’old ’im up for an example to the other men and say wot nice pretty ways he ’ad joe barlcomb was everything at fust but when they got to ’ear that his perliteness was because ’e thought ’arf of ’em was witches and didn’t know which ’arf they altered their minds  in a month or two he was the laughingstock of the place but wot was worse to ’im than that was that he’d made enemies of all the old ladies some of ’em was freespoken women and ’e couldn’t sleep for thinking of the ’arm they might do ’im  he was terrible uneasy about it at fust but as nothing ’appened and he seemed to go on very prosperouslike ’e began to forget ’is fears when all of a sudden ’e went ’ome one day and found ’is wife in bed with a broken leg  she was standing on a broken chair to reach something down from the dresser when it ’appened and it was pointed out to joe barlcomb that it was a thing anybody might ha’ done without being bewitched but he said ’e knew better and that they’d kept that broken chair for standing on for years and years to save the others and nothing ’ad ever ’appened afore  in less than a week arter that three of his young ’uns was down with the measles and ’is wife being laid up he sent for ’er mother to come and nurse ’em it’s as true as i sit ’ere but that pore old lady ’adn’t been in the house two hours afore she went to bed with the yellow jaundice  joe barlcomb went out of ’is mind a’most he’d never liked ’is wife’s mother and he wouldn’t ’ave had ’er in the house on’y ’e wanted her to nurse ’is wife and children and when she came and laid up and wanted waiting on ’e couldn’t dislike her enough  he was quite certain all along that somebody was putting a spell on ’im and when ’e went out a morning or two arterward and found ’is best pig lying dead in a corner of the sty he gave up and going into the ’ouse told ’em all that they’d ’ave to die ’cause he couldn’t do anything more for ’em his wife’s mother and ’is wife and the children all started crying together and joe barlcomb when ’e thought of ’is pig he sat down and cried too  he sat up late that night thinking it over and arter looking at it all ways he made up ’is mind to go and see mrs prince an old lady that lived all alone by ’erself in a cottage near smith’s farm he’d set ’er down for wot he called a white witch which is the best kind and on’y do useful things such as charming warts away or telling gals about their future ’usbands and the next arternoon arter telling ’is wife’s mother that fresh air and travelling was the best cure for the yellow jaundice he set off to see ’er  mrs prince was sitting at ’er front door nursing ’er three cats when ’e got there she was an ugly little old woman with piercing black eyes and a hook nose and she ’ad a quiet artful sort of a way with ’er that made ’er very much disliked one thing was she was always making fun of people and for another she seemed to be able to tell their thoughts and that don’t get anybody liked much especially when they don’t keep it to theirselves she’d been a lady’s maid all ’er young days and it was very ’ard to be taken for a witch just because she was old  fine day ma’am ses joe barlcomb  very fine ses mrs prince  being as i was passing i just thought i’d look in ses joe barlcomb eyeing the cats  take a chair ses mrs prince getting up and dusting one down with ’er apron  joe sat down i’m in a bit o’ trouble ma’am he ses and i thought p’r’aps as you could help me out of it my pore pig’s been bewitched and it’s dead  bewitched ses mrs prince who’d ’eard of ’is ideas rubbish don’t talk to me  it ain’t rubbish ma’am ses joe barlcomb three o’ my children is down with the measles my wife’s broke ’er leg ’er mother is laid up in my little place with the yellow jaundice and the pig’s dead  wot another one ses mrs prince  no the same one ses joe  well ’ow am i to help you ses mrs prince do you want me to come and nurse ’em  no no ses joe starting and turning pale unless you’d like to come and nurse my wife’s mother he ses arter thinking a bit i was hoping that you’d know who’d been overlooking me and that you’d make ’em take the spell off  mrs prince got up from ’er chair and looked round for the broom she’d been sweeping with but not finding it she set down agin and stared in a curious sort o’ way at joe barlcomb  oh i see she ses nodding fancy you guessing i was a witch  you can’t deceive me ses joe i’ve ’ad too much experience i knew it the fust time i saw you by the mole on your nose  mrs prince got up and went into her backplace trying her ’ardest to remember wot she’d done with that broom she couldn’t find it anywhere and at last she came back and sat staring at joe for so long that ’e was ’arf frightened out of his life and byandby she gave a ’orrible smile and sat rubbing the side of ’er nose with ’er finger  if i help you she ses at last will you promise to keep it a dead secret and do exactly as i tell you if you don’t dead pigs’ll be nothing to the misfortunes that you will ’ave  i will ses joe barlcomb very pale  the spell ses mrs prince holding up her ’ands and shutting ’er eyes was put upon you by a man it is one out of six men as is jealous of you because you’re so clever but which one it is i can’t tell without your assistance have you got any money  a little ses joe anxiouslike— a very little wot with the yellow jaundice and other things i——  fust thing to do ses mrs prince still with her eyes shut you go up to the cauliflower tonight the six men’ll all be there and you must buy six ha’pennies off of them one each  buy six ha’pennies ses joe staring at her  don’t repeat wot i say ses mrs prince it’s unlucky you buy six ha’pennies for a shilling each without saying wot it’s for you’ll be able to buy ’em all right if you’re civil  it seems to me it don’t need much civility for that ses joe pulling a long face  when you’ve got the ha’pennies ses mrs prince bring ’em to me and i’ll tell you wot to do with ’em don’t lose no time because i can see that something worse is going to ’appen if it ain’t prevented  is it anything to do with my wife’s mother getting worse ses joe barlcomb who was a careful man and didn’t want to waste six shillings  no something to you ses mrs prince  joe barlcomb went cold all over and then he put down a couple of eggs he’d brought round for ’er and went off ’ome agin and mrs prince stood in the doorway with a cat on each shoulder and watched ’im till ’e was out of sight  that night joe barlcomb came up to this ’ere cauliflower publichouse same as he’d been told and byandby arter he ’ad ’ad a pint he looked round and taking a shilling out of ’is pocket put it on the table and he ses who’ll give me a ha’penny for that he ses  none of ’em seemed to be in a hurry bill jones took it up and bit it and rang it on the table and squinted at it and then he bit it agin and turned round and asked joe barlcomb wot was wrong with it  wrong ses joe nothing  bill jones put it down agin you’re wide awake joe he ses but so am i  won’t nobody give me a ha’penny for it ses joe looking round  then peter lamb came up and he looked at it and rang it and at last he gave joe a ha’penny for it and took it round and everybody ’ad a look at it  it stands to reason it’s a bad ’un ses bill jones but it’s so well done i wish as i’d bought it  hsh ses peter lamb don’t let the landlord ’ear you  the landlord ’ad just that moment come in and peter walked up and ordered a pint and took his tenpence change as bold as brass arter that joe barbcomb bought five more ha’pennies afore you could wink a’most and every man wot sold one went up to the bar and ’ad a pint and got tenpence change and drank joe barlcomb’s health  there seems to be a lot o’ money knocking about tonight ses the landlord as sam martin the last of ’em was drinking ’is pint  sam martin choked and put ’is pot down on the counter with a bang and him and the other five was out o’ that door and sailing up the road with their tenpences afore the landlord could get his breath he stood to the bar scratching his ’ead and staring but he couldn’t understand it a bit till a man wot was too late to sell his ha’penny up and told ’im all about it the fuss ’e made was terrible the shillings was in a little heap on a shelf at the back o’ the bar and he did all sorts o’ things to ’em to prove that they was bad and threatened joe barlcomb with the police at last however ’e saw wot a fool he was making of himself and arter nearly breaking his teeth ’e dropped them into a drawer and stirred ’em up with the others  joe barlcomb went round the next night to see mrs prince and she asked ’im a lot o’ questions about the men as ’ad sold ’im the ha’pennies  the fust part ’as been done very well she ses nodding her ’ead at ’im if you do the second part as well you’ll soon know who your enemy is  nothing’ll bring the pig back ses joe  there’s worse misfortunes than that as i’ve told you ses mrs prince sharply now listen to wot i’m going to say to you when the clock strikes twelve tonight——  our clock don’t strike ses joe  then you must borrow one that does ses mrs prince and when it strikes twelve you must go round to each o’ them six men and sell them a ha’penny for a shilling  joe barlcomb looked at ’er ’ow he ses shortlike  same way as you sold ’em a shilling for a ha’penny ses mrs prince it don’t matter whether they buy the ha’pennies or not all you’ve got to do is to go and ask ’em and the man as makes the most fuss is the man that ’as put the trouble on you  it seems a roundabout way o’ going to work ses joe  wot screams mrs prince jumping up and waving her arms about wot go your own way i’ll have nothing more to do with you and don’t blame me for anything that happens it’s a very bad thing to come to a witch for advice and then not to do as she tells you you ought to know that  i’ll do it ma’am ses joe barlcomb trembling  you’d better ses mrs prince and mind—not a word to anybody  joe promised her agin and ’e went off and borrered a clock from albert price and at twelve o’clock that night he jumped up out of bed and began to dress ’imself and pretend not to ’ear his wife when she asked ’im where he was going  it was a dark nasty sort o’ night blowing and raining and o’ course everybody ’ad gone to bed long since the fust cottage joe came to was bill jones’s and knowing bill’s temper he stood for some time afore he could make up ’is mind to knock but at last he up with ’is stick and banged away at the door  a minute arterward he ’eard the bedroom winder pushed open and then bill jones popped his ’cad out and called to know wot was the matter and who it was  it’s me—joe barlcomb ses joe and i want to speak to you very partikler  well speak away ses bill you go into the back room he ses turning to his wife  whaffor ses mrs jones  ’cos i don’t know wot joe is going to say ses bill you go in now afore i make you  his wife went off grumbling and then bill told joe barlcomb to hurry up wot he’d got to say as ’e ’adn’t got much on and the weather wasn’t as warm as it might be  i sold you a shilling for a ha’penny last night bill ses joe  do you want to sell any more ses bill jones putting his ’and down to where ’is trouser pocket ought to be  not exactly that ses joe barlcomb this time i want you to sell me a shilling for a ha’penny  bill leaned out of the winder and stared down at joe barlcomb and then he ses in a choking voice is that wot you’ve come disturbing my sleep for at this time o’ night he ses  i must ’ave it bill ses joe  well if you’ll wait a moment ses bill trying to speak perlitely i’ll come down and give it to you  joe didn’t like ’is tone of voice but he waited and all of a sudden bill jones came out o’ that door like a gun going off and threw ’imself on joe barlcomb both of ’em was strong men and by the time they’d finished they was so tired they could ’ardly stand then bill jones went back to bed and joe barlcomb arter sitting down on the doorstep to rest ’imself went off and knocked up peter lamb  peter lamb was a little man and no good as a fighter but the things he said to joe barlcomb as he leaned out o’ the winder and shook ’is fist at him was ’arder to bear than blows he screamed away at the top of ’is voice for ten minutes and then ’e pulled the winder to with a bang and went back to bed  joe barlcomb was very tired but he walked on to jasper potts’s ’ouse trying ’ard as he walked to decide which o’ the fust two ’ad made the most fuss arter he ’ad left jasper potts ’e got more puzzled than ever jasper being just as bad as the other two and joe leaving ’im at last in the middle of loading ’is gun  by the time he’d made ’is last call—at sam martin’s—it was past three o’clock and he could no more tell mrs prince which ’ad made the most fuss than ’e could fly there didn’t seem to be a pin to choose between ’em and ’arf worried out of ’is life he went straight on to mrs prince and knocked ’er up to tell ’er she thought the ’ouse was afire at fust and came screaming out o’ the front door in ’er bedgown and when she found out who it was she was worse to deal with than the men ’ad been  she ’ad quieted down by the time joe went round to see ’er the next evening and asked ’im to describe exactly wot the six men ’ad done and said she sat listening quite quiet at fust but arter a time she scared joe by making a odd croupy sort o’ noise in ’er throat and at last she got up and walked into the backplace she was there a long time making funny noises and at last joe walked toward the door on tiptoe and peeped through the crack and saw ’er in a sort o’ fit sitting in a chair with ’er arms folded acrost her bodice and rocking ’erself up and down and moaning joe stood as if ’e’d been frozen a’most and then ’e crept back to ’is seat and waited and when she came into the room agin she said as the trouble ’ad all been caused by bill jones she sat still for nearly ’arf an hour thinking ’ard and then she turned to joe and ses  can you read she ses  no ses joe wondering wot was coming next  that’s all right then she ses because if you could i couldn’t do wot i’m going to do  that shows the ’arm of eddication ses joe i never did believe in it  mrs prince nodded and then she went and got a bottle with something in it which looked to joe like gin and arter getting out ’er pen and ink and printing some words on a piece o’ paper she stuck it on the bottle and sat looking at joe and thinking  take this up to the cauliflower she ses make friends with bill jones and give him as much beer as he’ll drink and give ’im a little o’ this gin in each mug if he drinks it the spell will be broken and you’ll be luckier than you ’ave ever been in your life afore when ’e’s drunk some and not before leave the bottle standing on the table  joe barlcomb thanked ’er and with the bottle in ’is pocket went off to the cauliflower whistling bill jones was there and peter lamb and two or three more of ’em and at fust they said some pretty ’ard things to him about being woke up in the night  don’t bear malice bill ses joe barlcomb ’ave a pint with me  he ordered two pints and then sat down alongside o’ bill and in five minutes they was like brothers  ’ave a drop o’ gin in it bill he ses taking the bottle out of ’is pocket  bill thanked ’im and had a drop and then thoughtfullike he wanted joe to ’ave some in his too but joe said no he’d got a touch o’ toothache and it was bad for it  i don’t mind ’aving a drop in my beer joe ses peter lamb  not tonight mate ses joe it’s all for bill i bought it on purpose for ’im  bill shook ’ands with him and when joe called for another pint and put some more gin in it he said that ’e was the noblest’arted man that ever lived  you wasn’t saying so ’arf an hour ago ses peter lamb  ’cos i didn’t know ’im so well then ses bill jones  you soon change your mind don’t you ses peter  bill didn’t answer ’im he was leaning back on the bench and staring at the bottle as if ’e couldn’t believe his eyesight his face was all white and shining and ’is hair as wet as if it ’ad just been dipped in a bucket o’ water  see a ghost bill ses peter looking at ’im  bill made a ’orrible noise in his throat and kept on staring at the bottle till they thought ’e’d gone crazy then jasper potts bent his ’ead down and began to read out loud wot was on the bottle poi— poison for bill jones he ses in a voice as if ’e couldn’t believe it  you might ’ave heard a pin drop everybody turned and looked at bill jones as he sat there trembling all over then those that could read took up the bottle and read it out loud all over agin  pore bill ses peter lamb i ’ad a feeling come over me that something was wrong  you’re a murderer ses sam martin catching ’old of joe barlcomb you’ll be ’ung for this look at pore bill cut off in ’is prime  run for the doctor ses someone  two of ’em ran off as ’ard as they could go and then the landlord came round the bar and asked bill to go and die outside because ’e didn’t want to be brought into it jasper potts told ’im to clear off and then he bent down and asked bill where the pain was  i don’t think he’ll ’ave much pain ses peter lamb who always pretended to know a lot more than other people it’ll soon be over bill  we’ve all got to go some day ses sam martin better to die young than live to be a trouble to yourself ses bob harris  to ’ear them talk everybody seemed to think that bill jones was in luck everybody but bill jones ’imself that is  i ain’t fit to die he ses shivering you don’t know ’ow bad i’ve been  wot ’ave you done bill ses peter lamb in a soft voice if it’ll ease your feelings afore you go to make a clean breast of it we’re all friends here  bill groaned  and it’s too late for you to be punished for anything ses peter arter a moment  bill jones groaned agin and then shaking ’is ’ead began to w’isper ’is wrongdoings when the doctor came in ’arf an hour arterward all the men was as quiet as mice and pore bill was still w’ispering as ’ard as he could w’isper  the doctor pushed ’em out of the way in a moment and then ’e bent over bill and felt ’is pulse and looked at ’is tongue then he listened to his ’art and in a puzzled way smelt at the bottle which jasper potts was aminding of and wetted ’is finger and tasted it  somebody’s been making a fool of you and me too he ses in a angry voice it’s only gin and very good gin at that get up and go home  it all came out next morning and joe barlcomb was the laughingstock of the place most people said that mrs prince ’ad done quite right and they ’oped that it ud be a lesson to him but nobody ever talked much of witchcraft in claybury agin one thing was that bill jones wouldn’t ’ave the word used in ’is hearing     establishing relations     mr richard catesby second officer of the ss wizard emerged from the dockgates in high goodhumour to spend an evening ashore the bustle of the day had departed and the inhabitants of wapping in search of coolness and fresh air were sitting at open doors and windows indulging in general conversation with anybody within earshot  mr catesby turning into bashford’s lane lost in a moment all this life and colour the hum of distant voices certainly reached there but that was all for bashford’s lane a retiring thoroughfare facing a blank dock wall capped here and there by towering spars set an example of gentility which neighbouring streets had long ago decided crossly was impossible for ordinary people to follow its neatly grained shutters fastened back by the sides of the windows gave a pleasing idea of uniformity while its white steps and polished brass knockers were suggestive of almost a dutch cleanliness  mr catesby strolling comfortably along stopped suddenly for another look at a girl who was standing in the groundfloor window of no 5 he went on a few paces and then walked back slowly trying to look as though he had forgotten something the girl was still there and met his ardent glances unmoved a fine girl with large dark eyes and a complexion which was the subject of much scandalous discussion among neighbouring matrons  it must be something wrong with the glass or else it’s the bad light said mr catesby to himself no girl is so beautiful as that  he went by again to make sure the object of his solicitude was still there and apparently unconscious of his existence he passed very slowly and sighed deeply  you’ve got it at last dick catesby he said solemnly fair and square in the most dangerous part of the heart it’s serious this time  he stood still on the narrow pavement pondering and then in excuse of his flagrant misbehaviour murmured it was meant to be and went by again this time he fancied that he detected a somewhat supercilious expression in the dark eyes—a faint raising of wellarched eyebrows  his engagement to wait at aldgate station for the secondengineer and spend an evening together was dismissed as too slow to be considered he stood for some time in uncertainty and then turning slowly into the beehive which stood at the corner went into the private bar and ordered a glass of beer  he was the only person in the bar and the landlord a stout man in his shirtsleeves was the soul of affability mr catesby after various general remarks made a few inquiries about an uncle aged five minutes whom he thought was living in bashford’s lane  i don’t know ’im said the landlord  i had an idea that he lived at no 5 said catesby  the landlord shook his head that’s mrs truefitt’s house he said slowly  mr catesby pondered truefitt truefitt he repeated what sort of a woman is she  widderwoman said the landlord she lives there with ’er daughter prudence  mr catesby said indeed and being a good listener learned that mrs truefitt was the widow of a masterlighterman and that her son fred truefitt after an absence of seven years in new zealand was now on his way home he finished his glass slowly and the landlord departing to attend to another customer made his way into the street again  he walked along slowly picturing as he went the homecorning of the longabsent son things were oddly ordered in this world and fred truefitt would probably think nothing of his brotherly privileges he wondered whether he was like prudence he wondered——  by jove i’ll do it he said recklessly as he turned now for a row  he walked back rapidly to bashford’s lane and without giving his courage time to cool plied the knocker of no 5 briskly  the door was opened by an elderly woman thin and somewhat querulous in expression mr catesby had just time to notice this and then he flung his arm round her waist and hailing her as mother saluted her warmly  the faint scream of the astounded mrs truefitt brought her daughter hastily into the passage mr catesby’s idea was ever to do a thing thoroughly and relinquishing mrs truefitt he kissed prudence with all the ardour which a sevenyears’ absence might be supposed to engender in the heart of a devoted brother in return he received a box on the ears which made his head ring  he’s been drinking gasped the dismayed mrs truefitt  don’t you know me mother inquired mr richard catesby in grievous astonishment  he’s mad said her daughter  am i so altered that you don’t know me prudence inquired mr catesby with pathos don’t you know your fred  go out said mrs truefitt recovering go out at once  mr catesby looked from one to the other in consternation  i know i’ve altered he said at last but i’d no idea—  if you don’t go out at once i’ll send for the police said the elder woman sharply prudence scream  i’m not going to scream said prudence eyeing the intruder with great composure i’m not afraid of him  despite her reluctance to have a scene—a thing which was strongly opposed to the traditions of bashford’s lane—mrs truefitt had got as far as the doorstep in search of assistance when a sudden terrible thought occurred to her fred was dead and the visitor had hit upon this extraordinary fashion of breaking the news gently  come into the parlour she said faintly  mr catesby suppressing his surprise followed her into the room prudence her fine figure erect and her large eyes meeting his steadily took up a position by the side of her mother  you have brought bad news inquired the latter  no mother said mr catesby simply only myself that’s all  mrs truefitt made a gesture of impatience and her daughter watching him closely tried to remember something she had once read about detecting insanity by the expression of the eyes those of mr catesby were blue and the only expression in them at the present moment was one of tender and respectful admiration  when did you see fred last inquired mrs truefitt making another effort  mother said mr catesby with great pathos don’t you know me  he has brought bad news of fred said mrs truefitt turning to her daughter i am sure he has  i don’t understand you said mr catesby with a bewildered glance from one to the other i am fred am i much changed you look the same as you always did and it seems only yesterday since i kissed prudence goodbye at the docks you were crying prudence  miss truefitt made no reply she gazed at him unflinchingly and then bent toward her mother  he is mad she whispered we must try and get him out quietly don’t contradict him  keep close to me said mrs truefitt who had a great horror of the insane if he turns violent open the window and scream i thought he had brought bad news of fred how did he know about him  her daughter shook her head and gazed curiously at their afflicted visitor she put his age down at twentyfive and she could not help thinking it a pity that so goodlooking a young man should have lost his wits  bade prudence goodbye at the docks continued mr catesby dreamily you drew me behind a pile of luggage prudence and put your head on my shoulder i have thought of it ever since  miss truefitt did not deny it but she bit her lips and shot a sharp glance at him she began to think that her pity was uncalledfor  i’m just going as far as the corner  tell me all that’s happened since i’ve been away said mr catesby  mrs truefitt turned to her daughter and whispered it might have been merely the effect of a guilty conscience but the visitor thought that he caught the word policeman  i’m just going as far as the corner said mrs truefitt rising and crossing hastily to the door  the young man nodded affectionately and sat in doubtful consideration as the front door closed behind her where is mother going he asked in a voice which betrayed a little pardonable anxiety  not far i hope said prudence  i really think said mr catesby rising—i really think that i had better go after her at her age——  he walked into the small passage and put his hand on the latch prudence now quite certain of his sanity felt sorely reluctant to let such impudence go unpunished  are you going she inquired  i think i’d better said mr catesby gravely dear mother—  you’re afraid said the girl calmly  mr catesby coloured and his buoyancy failed him he felt a little bit cheap  you are brave enough with two women continued the girl disdainfully but you had better go if you’re afraid  mr catesby regarded the temptress uneasily would you like me to stay he asked  i said miss truefitt tossing her head no i don’t want you besides you’re frightened  mr catesby turned and with a firm step made his way back to the room prudence with a halfsmile took a chair near the door and regarded her prisoner with unholy triumph  i shouldn’t like to be in your shoes she said agreeably mother has gone for a policeman  bless her said mr catesby fervently what had we better say to him when he comes  you’ll be locked up said prudence and it will serve you right for your bad behaviour  mr catesby sighed it’s the heart he said gravely i’m not to blame really i saw you standing in the window and i could see at once that you were beautiful and good and kind  i never heard of such impudence continued miss truefitt  i surprised myself admitted mr catesby in the usual way i am very quiet and wellbehaved not to say shy  miss truefitt looked at him scornfully i think that you had better stop your nonsense and go she remarked  don’t you want me to be punished inquired the other in a soft voice  i think that you had better go while you can said the girl and at that moment there was a heavy knock at the frontdoor mr catesby despite his assurance changed colour the girl eyed him in perplexity then she opened the small foldingdoors at the back of the room  you’re only—stupid she whispered quick go in there i’ll say you’ve gone keep quiet and i’ll let you out byandby  she pushed him in and closed the doors from his hidingplace he heard an animated conversation at the streetdoor and minute particulars as to the time which had elapsed since his departure and the direction he had taken  i never heard such impudence said mrs truefitt going into the frontroom and sinking into a chair after the constable had taken his departure i don’t believe he was mad  only a little weak in the head i think said prudence in a clear voice he was very frightened after you had gone i don’t think he will trouble us again  he’d better not said mrs truefitt sharply i never heard of such a thing—never  she continued to grumble while prudence in a low voice endeavoured to soothe her her efforts were evidently successful as the prisoner was after a time surprised to hear the older woman laugh—at first gently and then with so much enjoyment that her daughter was at some pains to restrain her he sat in patience until evening deepened into night and a line of light beneath the foldingdoors announced the lighting of the lamp in the frontroom by a pleasant clatter of crockery he became aware that they were at supper and he pricked up his ears as prudence made another reference to him  if he comes tomorrow night while you are out i sha’n’t open the door she said you’ll be back by nine i suppose  mrs truefitt assented  and you won’t be leaving before seven continued prudence i shall be all right  mr catesby’s face glowed and his eyes grew tender prudence was as clever as she was beautiful the delicacy with which she had intimated the fact of the unconscious mrs truefitt’s absence on the following evening was beyond all praise the only depressing thought was that such resourcefulness savoured of practice  he sat in the darkness for so long that even the proximity of prudence was not sufficient amends for the monotony of it and it was not until past ten o’clock that the foldingdoors were opened and he stood blinking at the girl in the glare of the lamp  quick she whispered  mr catesby stepped into the lighted room  the frontdoor is open whispered prudence make haste i’ll close it  she followed him to the door he made an ineffectual attempt to seize her hand and the next moment was pushed gently outside and the door closed behind him he stood a moment gazing at the house and then hastened back to his ship  seven tomorrow he murmured seven tomorrow after all there’s nothing pays in this world like cheek—nothing  he slept soundly that night though the things that the secondengineer said to him about wasting a hardworking man’s evening would have lain heavy on the conscience of a more scrupulous man the only thing that troubled him was the manifest intention of his friend not to let him slip through his fingers on the following evening at last in sheer despair at his inability to shake him off he had to tell him that he had an appointment with a lady  well i’ll come too said the other glowering at him it’s very like she’ll have a friend with her they generally do  i’ll run round and tell her said catesby i’d have arranged it before only i thought you didn’t care about that sort of thing  female society is softening said the secondengineer i’ll go and put on a clean collar  catesby watched him into his cabin and then though it still wanted an hour to seven hastily quitted the ship and secreted himself in the private bar of the beehive  he waited there until a quarter past seven and then adjusting his tie for about the tenth time that evening in the glass behind the bar sallied out in the direction of no 5  he knocked lightly and waited there was no response and he knocked again when the fourth knock brought no response his heart sank within him and he indulged in vain speculations as to the reasons for this unexpected hitch in the programme he knocked again and then the door opened suddenly and prudence with a little cry of surprise and dismay backed into the passage  you she said regarding him with large eyes mr catesby bowed tenderly and passing in closed the door behind him  i wanted to thank you for your kindness last night he said humbly  very well said prudence goodbye  mr catesby smiled it’ll take me a long time to thank you as i ought to thank you he murmured and then i want to apologise that’ll take time too  you had better go said prudence severely kindness is thrown away upon you i ought to have let you be punished  you are too good and kind said the other drifting by easy stages into the parlour  miss truefitt made no reply but following him into the room seated herself in an easychair and sat coldly watchful  how do you know what i am she inquired  your face tells me said the infatuated richard i hope you will forgive me for my rudeness last night it was all done on the spur of the moment  i am glad you are sorry said the girl softening  all the same if i hadn’t done it pursued mr catesby i shouldn’t be sitting here talking to you now  miss truefitt raised her eyes to his and then lowered them modestly to the ground that is true she said quietly  and i would sooner be sitting here than anywhere pursued catesby that is he added rising and taking a chair by her side except here  miss truefitt appeared to tremble and made as though to rise then she sat still and took a gentle peep at mr catesby from the corner of her eye  i hope that you are not sorry that i am here said that gentleman  miss truefitt hesitated no she said at last  are you—are you glad asked the modest richard  miss truefitt averted her eyes altogether yes she said faintly  a strange feeling of solemnity came over the triumphant richard he took the hand nearest to him and pressed it gently  i—i can hardly believe in my good luck he murmured  good luck said prudence innocently  isn’t it good luck to hear you say that you are glad i’m here said catesby  you’re the best judge of that said the girl withdrawing her hand it doesn’t seem to me much to be pleased about  mr catesby eyed her in perplexity and was about to address another tender remark to her when she was overcome by a slight fit of coughing at the same moment he started at the sound of a shuffling footstep in the passage somebody tapped at the door  yes said prudence  can’t find the knifepowder miss said a harsh voice the door was pushed open and disclosed a tall bony woman of about forty her red arms were bare to the elbow and she betrayed several evidences of a long and arduous day’s charing  it’s in the cupboard said prudence why what’s the matter mrs porter  mrs porter made no reply her mouth was wide open and she was gazing with starting eyeballs at mr catesby  joe she said in a hoarse whisper joe  mr catesby gazed at her in chilling silence miss truefitt with an air of great surprise glanced from one to the other  joe said mrs porter again ain’t you goin’ to speak to me  mr catesby continued to gaze at her in speechless astonishment she skipped clumsily round the table and stood before him with her hands clasped  where ’ave you been all this long time she demanded in a higher key  you—you’ve made a mistake said the bewildered richard  mistake wailed mrs porter mistake oh where’s your ’art  before he could get out of her way she flung her arms round the horrified young man’s neck and embraced him copiously over her bony left shoulder the frantic richard met the ecstatic gaze of miss truefitt and in a flash he realised the trap into which he had fallen  mrs porter said prudence  it’s my ’usband miss said the amazon reluctantly releasing the flushed and dishevelled richard ’e left me and my five eighteen months ago for eighteen months i ’aven’t ’ad a sight of ’is blessed face  she lifted the hem of her apron to her face and broke into discordant weeping  don’t cry said prudence softly i’m sure he isn’t worth it  mr catesby looked at her wanly he was beyond further astonishment and when mrs truefitt entered the room with a laudable attempt to twist her features into an expression of surprise he scarcely noticed her  it’s my joe said mrs porter simply  good gracious said mrs truefitt well you’ve got him now take care he doesn’t run away from you again  i’ll look after that ma’am said mrs porter with a glare at the startled richard  she’s very forgiving said prudence she kissed him just now  did she though said the admiring mrs truefitt i wish i’d been here  i can do it agin ma’am said the obliging mrs porter  if you come near me again— said the breathless richard stepping back a pace  i shouldn’t force his love said mrs truefitt it’ll come back in time i dare say  i’m sure he’s affectionate said prudence  mr catesby eyed his tormentors in silence the faces of prudence and her mother betokened much innocent enjoyment but the austerity of mrs porter’s visage was unrelaxed  better let bygones be bygones said mrs truefitt he’ll be sorry byandby for all the trouble he has caused  he’ll be ashamed of himself—if you give him time added prudence  mr catesby had heard enough he took up his hat and crossed to the door  take care he doesn’t run away from you again repeated mrs truefitt  i’ll see to that ma’am said mrs porter taking him by the arm come along joe  mr catesby attempted to shake her off but in vain and he ground his teeth as he realised the absurdity of his position a man he could have dealt with but mrs porter was invulnerable sooner than walk down the road with her he preferred the sallies of the parlour he walked back to his old position by the fireplace and stood gazing moodily at the floor  mrs truefitt tired of the sport at last she wanted her supper and with a significant glance at her daughter she beckoned the redoubtable and reluctant mrs porter from the room catesby heard the kitchendoor close behind them but he made no move prudence stood gazing at him in silence  if you want to go she said at last now is your chance  catesby followed her into the passage without a word and waited quietly while she opened the door still silent he put on his hat and passed out into the darkening street he turned after a short distance for a last look at the house and with a sudden sense of elation saw that she was standing on the step he hesitated and then walked slowly back  yes said prudence  i should like to tell your mother that i am sorry he said in a low voice  it is getting late said the girl softly but if you really wish to tell her—mrs porter will not be here tomorrow night  she stepped back into the house and the door closed behind her     the changing numbers     the tall clock in the corner of the small livingroom had just struck eight as mr samuel gunnill came stealthily down the winding staircase and opening the door at the foot stepped with an appearance of great care and humility into the room he noticed with some anxiety that his daughter selina was apparently engrossed in her task of attending to the plants in the window and that no preparations whatever had been made for breakfast  miss gunnill’s horticultural duties seemed interminable she snipped off dead leaves with painstaking precision and administered water with the jealous care of a druggist compounding a prescription then with her back still toward him she gave vent to a sigh far too intense in its nature to have reference to such trivialities as plants she repeated it twice and at the second time mr gunnill almost without his knowledge uttered a deprecatory cough  his daughter turned with alarming swiftness and holding herself very upright favoured him with a glance in which indignation and surprise were very fairly mingled  that white one—that one at the end said mr gunnill with an appearance of concentrated interest that’s my fav’rite  miss gunnill put her hands together and a look of infinite longsuffering came upon her face but she made no reply  always has been continued mr gunnill feverishly from a—from a cutting  bailed out said miss gunnill in a deep and thrilling voice bailed out at one o’clock in the morning brought home singing loud enough for halfadozen and then talking about flowers  mr gunnill coughed again  i was dreaming pursued miss gunnill plaintively sleeping peacefully when i was awoke by a horrible noise  that couldn’t ha’ been me protested her father i was only a bit cheerful it was benjamin ely’s birthday yesterday and after we left the lion they started singing and i just hummed to keep ’em company i wasn’t singing mind you only humming—when up comes that interfering cooper and takes me off  miss gunnill shivered and with her pretty cheek in her hand sat by the window the very picture of despondency why didn’t he take the others she inquired  ah said mr gunnill with great emphasis that’s what a lot more of us would like to know p’r’aps if you’d been more polite to mrs cooper instead o’ putting it about that she looked young enough to be his mother it wouldn’t have happened  his daughter shook her head impatiently and on mr gunnill making an allusion to breakfast expressed surprise that he had got the heart to eat anything mr gunnill pressing the point however she arose and began to set the table the undue care with which she smoothed out the creases of the tablecloth and the mathematical exactness with which she placed the various articles all being so many extra smarts in his wound when she finally placed on the table enough food for a dozen people he began to show signs of a little spirit  ain’t you going to have any he demanded as miss gunnill resumed her seat by the window  me said the girl with a shudder breakfast the disgrace is breakfast enough for me i couldn’t eat a morsel it would choke me  mr gunnill eyed her over the rim of his teacup i come down an hour ago he said casually as he helped himself to some bacon  miss gunnill started despite herself oh she said listlessly  and i see you making a very good breakfast all by yourself in the kitchen continued her father in a voice not free from the taint of triumph  the discomfited selina rose and stood regarding him mr gunnill after a vain attempt to meet her gaze busied himself with his meal  the idea of watching every mouthful i eat said miss gunnill tragically the idea of complaining because i have some breakfast i’d never have believed it of you never it’s shameful fancy grudging your own daughter the food she eats  mr gunnill eyed her in dismay in his confusion he had overestimated the capacity of his mouth and he now strove in vain to reply to this shameful perversion of his meaning his daughter stood watching him with grief in one eye and calculation in the other and just as he had put himself into a position to exercise his rights of free speech gave a pathetic sniff and walked out of the room  she stayed indoors all day but the necessity of establishing his innocence took mr gunnill out a great deal his neighbours in the hope of further excitement warmly pressed him to go to prison rather than pay a fine and instanced the example of an officer in the salvation army who in very different circumstances had elected to take that course mr gunnill assured them that only his known antipathy to the army and the fear of being regarded as one of its followers prevented him from doing so he paid instead a fine of ten shillings and after listening to a sermon in which his silver hairs served as the text was permitted to depart his feeling against policeconstable cooper increased with the passing of the days the constable watched him with the air of a proprietor and mrs cooper’s remark that her husband had had his eye upon him for a long time and that he had better be careful for the future was faithfully retailed to him within half an hour of its utterance convivial friends counted his cups for him teetotal friends more than hinted that cooper was in the employ of his good angel  miss gunnill’s two principal admirers had an arduous task to perform they had to attribute mr gunnill’s disaster to the vindictiveness of cooper and at the same time to agree with his daughter that it served him right between father and daughter they had a difficult time mr gunnill’s sensitiveness having been much heightened by his troubles  cooper ought not to have taken you said herbert sims for the fiftieth time  he must ha’ seen you like it dozens o’ times before said ted drill who in his determination not to be outdone by mr sims was not displaying his usual judgment why didn’t he take you then that’s what you ought to have asked the magistrate  i don’t understand you said mr gunnill with an air of cold dignity  why said mr drill what i mean is—look at that night for instance when——  he broke off suddenly even his enthusiasm not being proof against the extraordinary contortions of visage in which mr gunnill was indulging  when prompted selina and mr sims together mr gunnill after first daring him with his eye followed suit  that night at the crown said mr drill awkwardly you know when you thought that joe baggs was the landlord you tell ’em you tell it best i’ve roared over it  i don’t know what you’re driving at said the harassed mr gunnill bitterly  h’m said mr drill with a weak laugh i’ve been mixing you up with somebody else  mr gunnill obviously relieved said that he ought to be more careful and pointed out with some feeling that a lot of mischief was caused that way  cooper wants a lesson that’s what he wants said mr sims valiantly he’ll get his head broke one of these days  mr gunnill acquiesced i remember when i was on the peewit he said musingly one time when we were lying at cardiff there was a policeman there run one of our chaps in and two nights afterward another of our chaps pushed the policeman down in the mud and ran off with his staff and his helmet  miss gunnill’s eyes glistened what happened she inquired  he had to leave the force replied her father he couldn’t stand the disgrace of it the chap that pushed him over was quite a little chap too about the size of herbert here  mr sims started  very much like him in face too pursued mr gunnill daring chap he was  miss gunnill sighed i wish he lived in littlestow she said slowly i’d give anything to take that horrid mrs cooper down a bit cooper would be the laughingstock of the town  messrs sims and drill looked unhappy it was hard to have to affect an attitude of indifference in the face of miss gunnill’s lawless yearnings to stand before her as respectable and lawabiding cravens her eyes large and sorrowful dwelt on them both  if i—i only get a chance at cooper murmured mr sims vaguely  to his surprise mr gunnill started up from his chair and gripping his hand shook it fervently he looked round and selina was regarding him with a glance so tender that he lost his head completely before he had recovered he had pledged himself to lay the helmet and truncheon of the redoubtable mr cooper at the feet of miss gunnill exact date not specified  of course i shall have to wait my opportunity he said at last  you wait as long as you like my boy said the thoughtless mr gunnill  mr sims thanked him  wait till cooper’s an old man urged mr drill  miss gunnill secretly disappointed at the lack of boldness and devotion on the part of the latter gentleman eyed his stalwart frame indignantly and accused him of trying to make mr sims as timid as himself she turned to the valiant sims and made herself so agreeable to that daring blade that mr drill a prey to violent jealousy bade the company a curt goodnight and withdrew  he stayed away for nearly a week and then one evening as he approached the house carrying a carpetbag he saw the door just opening to admit the fortunate herbert he quickened his pace and arrived just in time to follow him in mr sims who bore under his arm a brownpaper parcel seemed somewhat embarrassed at seeing him and after a brief greeting walked into the room and with a triumphant glance at mr gunnill and selina placed his burden on the table  you—you ain’t got it said mr gunnill leaning forward  how foolish of you to run such a risk said selina  i brought it for miss gunnill said the young man simply he unfastened the parcel and to the astonishment of all present revealed a policeman’s helmet and a short boxwood truncheon  you—you’re a wonder said the gloating mr gunnill look at it ted  mr drill was looking at it it may be doubted whether the head of mr cooper itself could have caused him more astonishment then his eyes sought those of mr sims but that gentleman was gazing tenderly at the gratified but shocked selina  how ever did you do it inquired mr gunnill  came behind him and threw him down said mr sims nonchalantly he was that scared i believe i could have taken his boots as well if i’d wanted them  mr gunnill patted him on the back i fancy i can see him running bareheaded through the town calling for help he said smiling  mr sims shook his head like as not it’ll be kept quiet for the credit of the force he said slowly unless of course they discover who did it  a slight shade fell on the goodhumoured countenance of mr gunnill but it was chased away almost immediately by sims reminding him of the chaff of cooper’s brotherconstables  and you might take the others away said mr gunnill brightening you might keep on doing it  mr sims said doubtfully that he might but pointed out that cooper would probably be on his guard for the future  yes you’ve done your share said miss gunnill with a halfglance at mr drill who was still gazing in a bewildered fashion at the trophies you can come into the kitchen and help me draw some beer if you like  mr sims followed her joyfully and reaching down a jug for her watched her tenderly as she drew the beer all women love valour but miss gunnill gazing sadly at the slight figure of mr sims could not help wishing that mr drill possessed a little of his spirit  she had just finished her task when a tremendous bumping noise was heard in the livingroom and the plates on the dresser were nearly shaken off their shelves  what’s that she cried  they ran to the room and stood aghast in the doorway at the spectacle of mr gunnill with his clenched fists held tightly by his side bounding into the air with all the grace of a trained acrobat while mr drill encouraged him from an easychair mr gunnill smiled broadly as he met their astonished gaze and with a final bound kicked something along the floor and subsided into his seat panting  mr sims suddenly enlightened uttered a cry of dismay and darting under the table picked up what had once been a policeman’s helmet then he snatched a partially consumed truncheon from the fire and stood white and trembling before the astonished mr gunnill  what’s the matter inquired the latter you—you’ve spoilt ’em gasped mr sims what of it said mr gunnill staring  i was—going to take ’em away stammered mr sims  well they’ll be easier to carry now said mr drill simply  mr sims glanced at him sharply and then to the extreme astonishment of mr gunnill snatched up the relics and wrapping them up in the paper dashed out of the house mr gunnill turned a look of blank inquiry upon mr drill  it wasn’t cooper’s number on the helmet said that gentleman  eh shouted mr gunnill  how do you know inquired selina  i just happened to notice replied mr drill he reached down as though to take up the carpetbag which he had placed by the side of his chair and then apparently thinking better of it leaned back in his seat and eyed mr gunnill  do you mean to tell me said the latter that he’s been and upset the wrong man  mr drill shook his head that’s the puzzle he said softly  he smiled over at miss gunnill but that young lady who found him somewhat mysterious looked away and frowned her father sat and exhausted conjecture his final conclusion being that mr sims had attacked the first policeman that had come in his way and was now suffering the agonies of remorse  he raised his head sharply at the sound of hurried footsteps outside there was a smart rap at the street door then the handle was turned and the next moment to the dismay of all present the red and angry face of one of mr cooper’s brotherconstables was thrust into the room  mr gunnill gazed at it in helpless fascination the body of the constable garbed in plain clothes followed the face and standing before him in a menacing fashion held out a broken helmet and staff  have you seen these afore he inquired in a terrible voice  no said mr gunnill with an attempt at surprise what are they  i’ll tell you what they are said policeconstable jenkins ferociously they’re my helmet and truncheon you’ve been spoiling his majesty’s property and you’ll be locked up  yours said the astonished mr gunnill  i lent ’em to young sims just for a joke said the constable i felt all along i was doing a silly thing  it’s no joke said mr gunnill severely i’ll tell young herbert what i think of him trying to deceive me like that  never mind about deceiving interrupted the constable what are you going to do about it  what are you inquired mr gunnill hardily it seems to me it’s between you and him you’ll very likely be dismissed from the force and all through trying to deceive i wash my hands of it  you’d no business to lend it said drill interrupting the constable’s indignant retort especially for sims to pretend that he had stolen it from cooper it’s a roundabout sort of thing but you can’t tell of mr gunnill without getting into trouble yourself  i shall have to put up with that said the constable desperately it’s got to be explained it’s my dayhelmet too and the night one’s as shabby as can be twenty years in the force and never a mark against my name till now  if you’d only keep quiet a bit instead of talking so much said mr drill who had been doing some hard thinking i might be able to help you p’r’aps  how inquired the constable  help him if you can ted said mr gunnill eagerly we ought all to help others when we get a chance  mr drill sat bolt upright and looked very wise  he took the smashed helmet from the table and examined it carefully it was broken in at least halfadozen places and he laboured in vain to push it into shape he might as well have tried to make a silk hat out of a concertina the only thing that had escaped injury was the metal plate with the number  why don’t you mend it he inquired at last  mend it shouted the incensed mr jenkins why don’t you  i think i could said mr drill slowly give me half an hour in the kitchen and i’ll try  have as long as you like said mr gunnill  and i shall want some glue and miss gunnill and some tintacks said drill  what do you want me for inquired selina  to hold the things for me replied mr drill  miss gunnill tossed her head but after a little demur consented and drill ignoring the impatience of the constable picked up his bag and led the way into the kitchen messrs gunnill and jenkins left behind in the livingroom sought for some neutral topic of discourse but in vain conversation would revolve round hard labour and lost pensions from the kitchen came sounds of hammering then a loud ooh from miss gunnill followed by a burst of laughter and a clapping of hands mr jenkins shifted in his seat and exchanged glances with mr gunnill  he’s a clever fellow said that gentleman hopefully you should hear him imitate a canary lifelike it is  mr jenkins was about to make a hasty and obvious rejoinder when the kitchen door opened and selina emerged followed by drill the snarl which the constable had prepared died away in a murmur of astonishment as he took the helmet it looked as good as ever  he turned it over and over in amaze and looked in vain for any signs of the disastrous cracks it was stiff and upright he looked at the number it was his own his eyes round with astonishment he tried it on and then his face relaxed  it don’t fit as well as it did he said  well upon my word some people are never satisfied said the indignant drill there isn’t another man in england could have done it better  i’m not grumbling said the constable hastily it’s a wonderful piece o’ work wonderful i can’t even see where it was broke how on earth did you do it  drill shook his head it’s a secret process he said slowly i might want to go into the hat trade some day and i’m not going to give things away  quite right said mr jenkins still—well it’s a marvel that’s what it is a fair marvel if you take my advice you’ll go in the hat trade tomorrow my lad  i’m not surprised said mr gunnill whose face as he spoke was a map of astonishment not a bit i’ve seen him do more surprising things than that have a go at the staff now teddy  i’ll see about it said mr drill modestly i can’t do impossibilities you leave it here mr jenkins and we’ll talk about it later on  mr jenkins still marvelling over his helmet assented and after another reference to the possibilities in the hat trade to a man with a born gift for repairs wrapped his property in a piece of newspaper and departed whistling  ted said mr gunnill impressively as he sank into his chair with a sigh of relief how you done it i don’t know it’s a surprise even to me  he is very clever said selina with a kind smile  mr drill turned pale and then somewhat emboldened by praise from such a quarter dropped into a chair by her side and began to talk in low tones the grateful mr gunnill more relieved than he cared to confess thoughtfully closed his eyes  i didn’t think all along that you’d let herbert outdo you said selina  i want to outdo him said mr drill in a voice of much meaning  miss gunnill cast down her eyes and mr drill had just plucked up sufficient courage to take her hand when footsteps stopped at the house the handle of the door was turned and for the second time that evening the inflamed visage of mr jenkins confronted the company  don’t tell me it’s a failure said mr gunnill starting from his chair you must have been handling it roughly it was as good as new when you took it away  mr jenkins waved him away and fixed his eyes upon drill  you think you’re mighty clever i dare say he said grimly but i can put two and two together i’ve just heard of it  heard of two and two said drill looking puzzled  i don’t want any of your nonsense said mr jenkins i’m not on duty now but i warn you not to say anything that may be used against you  i never do said mr drill piously  somebody threw a handful o’ flour in poor cooper’s face a couple of hours ago said mr jenkins watching him closely and while he was getting it out of his eyes they upset him and made off with his helmet and truncheon i just met brown and he says cooper’s been going on like a madman  by jove it’s a good job i mended your helmet for you said mr drill or else they might have suspected you  mr jenkins stared at him i know who did do it he said significantly  herbert sims guessed mr drill in a stage whisper  you’ll be one o’ the first to know said mr jenkins darkly he’ll be arrested tomorrow fancy the impudence of it it’s shocking  mr drill whistled nell don’t let that little affair o’ yours with sims be known he said quietly have that kept quiet—if you can  mr jenkins started as though he had been stung in the joy of a case he had overlooked one or two things he turned and regarded the young man wistfully  don’t call on me as a witness that’s all continued mr drill i never was a mischiefmaker and i shouldn’t like to have to tell how you lent your helmet to sims so that he could pretend he had knocked cooper down and taken it from him  wouldn’t look at all well said mr gunnill nodding his head sagely  mr jenkins breathed hard and looked from one to the other it was plain that it was no good reminding them that he had not had a case for five years  when i say that i know who did it he said slowly i mean that i have my suspicions  don’t call on me as a witness that’s all’ continued mr drill  ah said mr drill that’s a very different thing  nothing like the same said mr gunnill pouring the constable a glass of ale  mr jenkins drank it and smacked his lips feebly  sims needn’t know anything about that helmet being repaired he said at last  certainly not said everybody  mr jenkins sighed and turned to drill  it’s no good spoiling the ship for a ha’porth o’ tar he said with a faint suspicion of a wink no said drill looking puzzled  anything that’s worth doing at all is worth doing well continued the constable and while i’m drinking another glass with mr gunnill here suppose you go into the kitchen with that useful bag o’ yours and finish repairing my truncheon     the persecution of bob pretty     the old man sat on his accustomed bench outside the cauliflower a generous measure of beer stood in a blue and white jug by his elbow and little wisps of smoke curled slowly upward from the bowl of his churchwarden pipe the knapsacks of two young men lay where they were flung on the table and the owners taking a noontide rest turned a polite if bored ear to the reminiscences of grateful old age  poaching said the old man who had tried topics ranging from early turnips to horseshoeing—poaching ain’t wot it used to be in these ’ere parts nothing is like it used to be poaching nor anything else but that there man you might ha’ noticed as went out about ten minutes ago and called me old truthfulness as ’e passed is the worst one i know bob pretty ’is name is and of all the sly artful deceiving men that ever lived in claybury ’e is the worst—never did a honest day’s work in ’is life and never wanted the price of a glass of ale  bob pretty’s worst time was just after old squire brown died the old squire couldn’t afford to preserve much but byandby a gentleman with plenty o’ money from london named rockett took ’is place and things began to look up pheasants was ’is favourites and ’e spent no end o’ money rearing of ’em but anything that could be shot at suited ’im too  he started by sneering at the little game that squire brown ’ad left but all ’e could do didn’t seem to make much difference things disappeared in a most eggstrordinary way and the keepers went pretty near crazy while the things the squire said about claybury and claybury men was disgraceful  everybody knew as it was bob pretty and one or two of ’is mates from other places but they couldn’t prove it they couldn’t catch ’im nohow and at last the squire ’ad two keepers set off to watch ’im by night and by day  bob pretty wouldn’t believe it he said ’e couldn’t and even when it was pointed out to ’im that keeper lewis was follering of ’im he said that it just ’appened he was going the same way that was all and sometimes ’e’d get up in the middle of the night and go for a fifteenmile walk ’cos ’e’d got the toothache and mr lewis who ’adn’t got it had to tag along arter ’im till he was fit to drop o’ course it was one keeper the less to look arter the game and byandby the squire see that and took ’im off  all the same they kept a pretty close watch on bob and at last one arternoon they sprang out on ’im as he was walking past gray’s farm and asked him wot it was he ’ad in his pockets  that’s my bisness mr lewis ses bob pretty  mr smith the other keeper passed ’is hands over bob’s coat and felt something soft and bulgy  you take your ’ands off of me ses bob you don’t know ’ow partikler i am  he jerked ’imself away but they caught ’old of ’im agin and mr lewis put ’is hand in his inside pocket and pulled out two brace o’ partridges  you’ll come along of us he ses catching ’im by the arm  we’ve been looking for you a long time ses keeper smith and it’s a pleasure for us to ’ave your company  bob pretty said ’e wouldn’t go but they forced ’im along and took ’im all the way to cudford four miles off so that policeman white could lock ’im up for the night mr white was a’most as pleased as the keepers and ’e warned bob solemn not to speak becos all ’e said would be used agin ’im  never mind about that ses bob pretty i’ve got a clear conscience and talking can’t ’urt me i’m very glad to see you mr white if these two clever experienced keepers hadn’t brought me i should ’ave looked you up myself they’ve been and stole my partridges  them as was standing round laughed and even policeman white couldn’t ’elp giving a little smile  there’s nothing to laugh at ses bob ’olding his ’ead up it’s a fine thing when a working man—a ’ardworking man—can’t take home a little game for ’is family without being stopped and robbed  i s’pose they flew into your pocket ses policeman white  no they didn’t ses bob i’m not going to tell any lies about it i put ’em there the partridges in my inside coatpocket and the bill in my waistcoatpocket  the bill ses keeper lewis staring at ’im  yes the bill ses bob pretty staring back at ’im the bill from mr keen the poulterer at wickham  he fetched it out of ’is pocket and showed it to mr white and the keepers was like madmen a’most ’cos it was plain to see that bob pretty ’ad been and bought them partridges just for to play a game on ’em  i was curious to know wot they tasted like he ses to the policeman worst of it is i don’t s’pose my pore wife’ll know ’ow to cook ’em  you get off ’ome ses policeman white staring at ’im  but ain’t i goin’ to be locked up ses bob ’ave i been brought all this way just to ’ave a little chat with a policeman i don’t like  you go ’ome ses policeman white handing the partridges back to ’im  all right ses bob and i may ’ave to call you to witness that these ’ere two men laid hold o’ me and tried to steal my partridges i shall go up and see my loryer about it  he walked off ’ome with his ’ead up as high as ’e could hold it and the airs ’e used to give ’imself arter this was terrible for to behold he got ’is eldest boy to write a long letter to the squire about it saying that ’e’d overlook it this time but ’e couldn’t promise for the future wot with bob pretty on one side and squire rockett on the other them two keepers’ lives was ’ardly worth living  then the squire got a headkeeper named cutts a man as was said to know more about the ways of poachers than they did themselves he was said to ’ave cleared out all the poachers for miles round the place ’e came from and pheasants could walk into people’s cottages and not be touched  he was a sharplooking man tall and thin with screwedup eyes and a little red beard the second day ’e came ’e was up here at this ’ere cauliflower having a pint o’ beer and looking round at the chaps as he talked to the landlord the odd thing was that men who’d never taken a hare or a pheasant in their lives could ’ardly meet ’is eye while bob pretty stared at ’im as if ’e was a waxworks  i ’ear you ’ad a little poaching in these parts afore i came ses mr cutts to the landlord  i think i ’ave ’eard something o’ the kind ses the landlord staring over his ’ead with a faraway look in ’is eyes  you won’t hear of much more ses the keeper i’ve invented a new way of catching the dirty rascals afore i came ’ere i caught all the poachers on three estates i clear ’em out just like a ferret clears out rats  sort o’ mantrap ses the landlord  ah that’s tellings ses mr cutts  well i ’ope you’ll catch ’em here ses bob pretty there’s far too many of ’em about for my liking far too many  i shall ’ave ’em afore long ses mr cutts nodding his ’ead  your good ’ealth ses bob pretty holding up ’is mug we’ve been wanting a man like you for a long time  i don’t want any of your impidence my man ses the keeper i’ve ’eard about you and nothing good either you be careful  i am careful ses bob winking at the others i ’ope you’ll catch all them low poaching chaps they give the place a bad name and i’m a’most afraid to go out arter dark for fear of meeting ’em  peter gubbins and sam jones began to laugh but bob pretty got angry with ’em and said he didn’t see there was anything to laugh at he said that poaching was a disgrace to their native place and instead o’ laughing they ought to be thankful to mr cutts for coming to do away with it all  any help i can give you shall be given cheerful he ses to the keeper  when i want your help i’ll ask you for it ses mr cutts  thankee ses bob pretty i on’y ’ope i sha’n’t get my face knocked about like yours ’as been that’s all ’cos my wife’s so partikler  wot d’ye mean ses mr cutts turning on him my face ain’t been knocked about  oh i beg your pardin ses bob i didn’t know it was natural  mr cutts went black in the face a’most and stared at bob pretty as if ’e was going to eat ’im and bob stared back looking fust at the keeper’s nose and then at ’is eyes and mouth and then at ’is nose agin  you’ll know me agin i s’pose ses mr cutts at last  yes ses bob smiling i should know you a mile off—on the darkest night  we shall see ses mr cutts taking up ’is beer and turning ’is back on him those of us as live the longest’ll see the most  i’m glad i’ve lived long enough to see ’im ses bob to bill chambers i feel more satisfied with myself now  bill chambers coughed and mr cutts arter finishing ’is beer took another look at bob pretty and went off boiling a’most  the trouble he took to catch bob pretty arter that you wouldn’t believe and all the time the game seemed to be simply melting away and squire rockett was finding fault with ’im all day long he was worn to a shadder a’most with watching and bob pretty seemed to be more prosperous than ever  sometimes mr cutts watched in the plantations and sometimes ’e hid ’imself near bob’s house and at last one night when ’e was crouching behind the fence of frederick scott’s front garden ’e saw bob pretty come out of ’is house and arter a careful look round walk up the road he held ’is breath as bob passed ’im and was just getting up to foller ’im when bob stopped and walked slowly back agin sniffing  wot a delicious smell o’ roses he ses out loud  he stood in the middle o’ the road nearly opposite where the keeper was hiding and sniffed so that you could ha’ ’eard him the other end o’ the village  it can’t be roses he ses in a puzzled voice becos there ain’t no roses hereabouts and besides it’s late for ’em it must be mr cutts the clever new keeper  he put his ’ead over the fence and bid ’im good evening and said wot a fine night for a stroll it was and asked ’im whether ’e was waiting for frederick scott’s aunt mr cutts didn’t answer ’im a word ’e was pretty near bursting with passion he got up and shook ’is fist in bob pretty’s face and then ’e went off stamping down the road as if ’e was going mad  and for a time bob pretty seemed to ’ave all the luck on ’is side keeper lewis got rheumatic fever which ’e put down to sitting about night arter night in damp places watching for bob and while ’e was in the thick of it with the doctor going every day mr cutts fell in getting over a fence and broke ’is leg then all the work fell on keeper smith and to ’ear ’im talk you’d think that rheumatic fever and broken legs was better than anything else in the world he asked the squire for ’elp but the squire wouldn’t give it to ’im and he kept telling ’im wot a feather in ’is cap it would be if ’e did wot the other two couldn’t do and caught bob pretty it was all very well but as smith said wot ’e wanted was feathers in ’is piller instead of ’aving to snatch a bit o’ sleep in ’is chair or sitting down with his ’ead agin a tree when i tell you that ’e fell asleep in this public’ouse one night while the landlord was drawing a pint o’ beer he ’ad ordered you’ll know wot ’e suffered  o’ course all this suited bob pretty as well as could be and ’e was that goodtempered ’e’d got a nice word for everybody and when bill chambers told ’im ’e was foolhardy ’e only laughed and said ’e knew wot ’e was about  but the very next night ’e had reason to remember bill chambers’s words he was walking along farmer hall’s field—the one next to the squire’s plantation—and so far from being nervous ’e was actually awhistling he’d got a sack over ’is shoulder loaded as full as it could be and ’e ’ad just stopped to light ’is pipe when three men burst out o’ the plantation and ran toward ’im as ’ard as they could run  bob pretty just gave one look and then ’e dropped ’is pipe and set off like a hare it was no good dropping the sack because smith the keeper ’ad recognised ’im and called ’im by name so ’e just put ’is teeth together and did the best he could and there’s no doubt that if it ’adn’t ha’ been for the sack ’e could ’ave got clear away  as it was ’e ran for pretty near a mile and they could ’ear ’im breathing like a pair o’ bellows but at last ’e saw that the game was up he just managed to struggle as far as farmer pinnock’s pond and then waving the sack round his ’ead ’e flung it into the middle of it and fell down gasping for breath  got—you—this time—bob pretty ses one o’ the men as they came up  wot—mr cutts ses bob with a start that’s me my man ses the keeper  why—i thought—you was is that mr lewis it can’t be  that’s me ses keeper lewis we both got well suddenlike bob pretty when we ’eard you was out you ain’t so sharp as you thought you was  bob pretty sat still getting ’is breath back and doing a bit o’ thinking at the same time  you give me a start he ses at last i thought you was both in bed and knowing ’ow hard worked mr smith ’as been i just came round to ’elp ’im keep watch like i promised to ’elp you mr cutts if you remember  wot was that you threw in the pond just now ses mr cutts  a sack ses bob pretty a sack i found in farmer hall’s field it felt to me as though it might ’ave birds in it so i picked it up and i was just on my way to your ’ouse with it mr cutts when you started arter me  ah ses the keeper and wot did you run for  bob pretty tried to laugh becos i thought it was the poachers arter me he ses it seems ridikilous don’t it  yes it does ses lewis  i thought you’d know me a mile off ses mr cutts i should ha’ thought the smell o’ roses would ha’ told you i was near  bob pretty scratched ’is ’ead and looked at ’im out of the corner of ’is eye but he ’adn’t got any answer then ’e sat biting his fingernails and thinking while the keepers stood argyfying as to who should take ’is clothes off and go into the pond arter the pheasants it was a very cold night and the pond was pretty deep in places and none of ’em seemed anxious  make ’im go in for it ses lewis looking at bob ’e chucked it in  on’y becos i thought you was poachers ses bob i’m sorry to ’ave caused so much trouble  well you go in and get it out ses lewis who pretty well guessed who’d ’ave to do it if bob didn’t it’ll look better for you too  i’ve got my defence all right ses bob pretty i ain’t set a foot on the squire’s preserves and i found this sack a ’undred yards away from it  don’t waste more time ses mr cutts to lewis  off with your clothes and in with you anybody’d think you was afraid of a little cold water  whereabouts did ’e pitch it in ses lewis  bob pretty pointed with ’is finger exactly where ’e thought it was but they wouldn’t listen to ’im and then lewis arter twice saying wot a bad cold he’d got took ’is coat off very slow and careful  i wouldn’t mind going in to oblige you ses bob pretty but the pond is so full o’ them cold slimy efts i don’t fancy them crawling up agin me and besides that there’s such a lot o’ deep holes in it and wotever you do don’t put your ’ead under you know ’ow foul that water is  keeper lewis pretended not to listen to ’im he took off ’is clothes very slowly and then ’e put one foot in and stood shivering although smith who felt the water with his ’and said it was quite warm then lewis put the other foot in and began to walk about careful ’arfway up to ’is knees  i can’t find it he ses with ’is teeth chattering  you ’aven’t looked ses mr cutts walk about more you can’t expect to find it all at once try the middle  lewis tried the middle and ’e stood there up to ’is neck feeling about with his foot and saying things out loud about bob pretty and other things under ’is breath about mr cutts  well i’m going off ’ome ses bob pretty getting up i’m too tender’arted to stop and see a man drownded  you stay ’ere ses mr cutts catching ’old of him  wot for ses bob you’ve got no right to keep me ’ere  catch ’old of ’im joe ses mr cutts quicklike  smith caught ’old of his other arm and lewis left off trying to find the sack to watch the struggle bob pretty fought ’ard and once or twice ’e nearly tumbled mr cutts into the pond but at last ’e gave in and lay down panting and talking about ’is loryer smith ’eld him down on the ground while mr cutts kept pointing out places with ’is finger for lewis to walk to the last place ’e pointed to wanted a much taller man but it wasn’t found out till too late and the fuss keeper lewis made when ’e could speak agin was terrible  you’d better come out ses mr cutts you ain’t doing no good we know where they are and we’ll watch the pond till daylight—that is unless smith ’ud like to ’ave a try  it’s pretty near daylight now i think ses smith  lewis came out and ran up and down to dry ’imself and finished off on ’is pocket’andkerchief and then with ’is teeth chattering ’e began to dress ’imself he got ’is shirt on and then ’e stood turning over ’is clothes as if ’e was looking for something  never mind about your stud now ses mr cutts hurry up and dress  stud ses lewis very snappish i’m looking for my trowsis  your trowsis ses smith ’elping ’im look  i put all my clothes together ses lewis a’most shouting where are they i’m ’arf perished with cold where are they  he ’ad ’em on this evening ses bob pretty ’cos i remember noticing ’em  they must be somewhere about ses mr cutts why don’t you use your eyes  he walked up and down peering about and as for lewis he was ’opping round ’arf crazy  i wonder ses bob pretty in a thoughtful voice to smith—i wonder whether you or mr cutts kicked ’em in the pond while you was struggling with me come to think of it i seem to remember ’earing a splash  he’s done it mr cutts ses smith never mind it’ll go all the ’arder with ’im  but i do mind ses lewis shouting i’ll be even with you for this bob pretty i’ll make you feel it you wait till i’ve done with you you’ll get a month extra for this you see if you don’t  don’t you mind about me ses bob you run off ’ome and cover up them legs of yours i found that sack so my conscience is clear  lewis put on ’is coat and waistcoat and set off and mr cutts and smith arter feeling about for a dry place set theirselves down and began to smoke  look ’ere ses bob pretty i’m not going to sit ’ere all night to please you i’m going off ’ome if you want me you’ll know where to find me  you stay where you are ses mr cutts we ain’t going to let you out of our sight  very well then you take me ’ome ses bob i’m not going to catch my death o’ cold sitting ’ere i’m not used to being out of a night like you are i was brought up respectable  i dare say ses mr cutts take you ’ome and then ’ave one o’ your mates come and get the sack while we’re away  then bob pretty lost ’is temper and the things ’e said about mr cutts wasn’t fit for smith to ’ear he threw ’imself down at last full length on the ground and sulked till the day broke  keeper lewis was there a’most as soon as it was light with some long hayrakes he’d borrowed and i should think that pretty near ’arf the folks in claybury ’ad turned up to see the fun mrs pretty was crying and wringing ’er ’ands but most folks seemed to be rather pleased that bob ’ad been caught at last  in next to no time ’arfadozen rakes was at work and the things they brought out o’ that pond you wouldn’t believe the edge of it was all littered with rusty tin pails and saucepans and suchlike and byandby lewis found the things he’d ’ad to go ’ome without a few hours afore but they didn’t seem to find that sack and bob pretty wot was talking to ’is wife began to look ’opeful  but just then the squire came riding up with two friends as was staying with ’im and he offered a reward of five shillings to the man wot found it three or four of ’em waded in up to their middle then and raked their ’ardest and at last henery walker give a cheer and brought it to the side all heavy with water  that’s the sack i found sir ses bob starting up it wasn’t on your land at all but on the field next to it i’m an honest ’ardworking man and i’ve never been in trouble afore ask anybody ’ere and they’ll tell you the same  squire rockett took no notice of ’im is that the sack he asks turning to mr cutts  that’s the one sir ses mr cutts i’d swear to it anywhere  you’d swear a man’s life away ses bob ’ow can you swear to it when it was dark  mr cutts didn’t answer ’im he went down on ’is knees and cut the string that tied up the mouth o’ the sack and then ’e started back as if ’e’d been shot and ’is eyes a’most started out of ’is ’ead  wot’s the matter ses the squire  mr cutts couldn’t speak he could only stutter and point at the sack with ’is finger and henery walker as was getting curious lifted up the other end of it and out rolled a score of as fine cabbages as you could wish to see  i never see people so astonished afore in all my born days and as for bob pretty ’e stood staring at them cabbages as if ’e couldn’t believe ’is eyesight  and that’s wot i’ve been kept ’ere all night for he ses at last shaking his ’ead that’s wot comes o’ trying to do a kindness to keepers and ’elping of ’em in their difficult work p’r’aps that ain’t the sack arter all mr cutts i could ha’ sworn they was pheasants in the one i found but i may be mistook never ’aving ’ad one in my ’ands afore or p’r’aps somebody was trying to ’ave a game with you mr cutts and deceived me instead  the keepers on’y stared at ’im  you ought to be more careful ses bob very likely while you was taking all that trouble over me and keeper lewis was catching ’is death o’ cold the poachers was up at the plantation taking all they wanted and besides it ain’t right for squire rockett to ’ave to pay henery walker five shillings for finding a lot of old cabbages i shouldn’t like it myself  he looked out of the corner of ’is eye at the squire as was pretending not to notice henery walker touching ’is cap to him and then ’e turns to ’is wife and he ses  come along old gal ’e ses i want my breakfast bad and arter that i shall ’ave to lose a honest day’s work in bed     dixon’s return     talking about eddication said the nightwatchman thoughtfully the finest eddication you can give a lad is to send ’im to sea school is all right up to a certain p’int but arter that comes the sea i’ve been there myself and i know wot i’m talking about all that i am i owe to ’aving been to sea  there’s a saying that boys will be boys that’s all right till they go to sea and then they ’ave to be men and good men too they get knocked about a bit o’ course but that’s all part o’ the eddication and when they get bigger they pass the eddication they’ve received on to other boys smaller than wot they are arter i’d been at sea a year i spent all my fust time ashore going round and looking for boys wot ’ad knocked me about afore i sailed and there was only one out o’ the whole lot that i wished i ’adn’t found  most people o’ course go to sea as boys or else not at all but i mind one chap as was pretty near thirty years old when ’e started it’s a good many years ago now and he was landlord of a public’ouse as used to stand in wapping called the blue lion  his mother wot had ’ad the pub afore ’im ’ad brought ’im up very quiet and genteel and when she died ’e went and married a fine handsome young woman who ’ad got her eye on the pub without thinking much about ’im i got to know about it through knowing the servant that lived there a nice quiet gal she was and there wasn’t much went on that she didn’t hear i’ve known ’er to cry for hours with the earache pore gal  not caring much for ’er ’usband and being spoiled by ’im into the bargain mrs dixon soon began to lead ’im a terrible life she was always throwing his meekness and mildness up into ’is face and arter they ’ad been married two or three years he was no more like the landlord o’ that public’ouse than i’m like a lord not so much she used to get into such terrible tempers there was no doing anything with ’er and for the sake o’ peace and quietness he gave way to ’er till ’e got into the habit of it and couldn’t break ’imself of it  they ’adn’t been married long afore she ’ad her cousin charlie burge come in as barman and a month or two arter that ’is brother bob who ’ad been spending a lot o’ time looking for work instead o’ doing it came too they was so comfortable there that their father—a ’ousepainter by trade—came round to see whether he couldn’t paint the blue lion up a bit and make ’em look smart so that they’d get more trade he was one o’ these ’ere fustclass ’ousepainters that can go to sleep on a ladder holding a brush in one hand and a pot o’ paint in the other and by the time he ’ad finished painting the ’ouse it was ready to be done all over agin  i dare say that george dixon—that was ’is name—wouldn’t ha’ minded so much if ’is wife ’ad only been civil but instead o’ that she used to make fun of ’im and order ’im about and byandby the others began to try the same thing as i said afore dixon was a very quiet man and if there was ever anybody to be put outside charlie or bob used to do it they tried to put me outside once the two of ’em but they on’y did it at last by telling me that somebody ’ad gone off and left a pot o’ beer standing on the pavement they was both of ’em fairly strong young chaps with a lot of bounce in ’em and she used to say to her ’usband wot fine young fellers they was and wot a pity it was he wasn’t like ’em  talk like this used to upset george dixon awful having been brought up careful by ’is mother and keeping a very quiet respectable ’ouse—i used it myself—he cert’nly was soft and i remember ’im telling me once that he didn’t believe in fighting and that instead of hitting people you ought to try and persuade them he was uncommon fond of ’is wife but at last one day arter she ’ad made a laughingstock of ’im in the bar he up and spoke sharp to her  wot ses mrs dixon ’ardly able to believe her ears  remember who you’re speaking to that’s wot i said ses dixon  ’ow dare you talk to me like that screams ’is wife turning red with rage wot d’ye mean by it  because you seem to forget who is master ’ere ses dixon in a trembling voice  master she ses firing up i’ll soon show you who’s master go out o’ my bar i won’t ’ave you in it d’ye ’ear go out of it  dixon turned away and began to serve a customer d’ye hear wot i say ses mrs dixon stamping ’er foot go out o’ my bar here charlie  hullo ses ’er cousin who ’ad been standing looking on and grinning  take the master and put ’im into the parlour ses mrs dixon and don’t let ’im come out till he’s begged my pardon  go on ses charlie brushing up ’is shirtsleeves in you go you ’ear wot she said  he caught ’old of george dixon who ’ad just turned to the back o’ the bar to give a customer change out of ’arf a crown and ran ’im kicking and struggling into the parlour george gave ’im a silly little punch in the chest and got such a bang on the ’ead back that at fust he thought it was knocked off  when ’e came to ’is senses agin the door leading to the bar was shut and ’is wife’s uncle who ’ad been asleep in the easychair was finding fault with ’im for waking ’im up  why can’t you be quiet and peaceable he ses shaking his ’ead at him i’ve been ’ard at work all the morning thinking wot colour to paint the backdoor and this is the second time i’ve been woke up since dinner you’re old enough to know better  go and sleep somewhere else then ses dixon i don’t want you ’ere at all or your boys neither go and give somebody else a treat i’ve ’ad enough of the whole pack of you  he sat down and put ’is feet in the fender and old burge as soon as he ’ad got ’is senses back went into the bar and complained to ’is niece and she came into the parlour like a thunderstorm  you’ll beg my uncle’s pardon as well as mine afore you come out o’ that room she said to her ’usband mind that  george dixon didn’t say a word the shame of it was a’most more than ’e could stand then ’e got up to go out o’ the parlour and charlie pushed ’im back agin three times he tried and then ’e stood up and looked at ’is wife  i’ve been a good ’usband to you he ses but there’s no satisfying you you ought to ha’ married somebody that would ha’ knocked you about and then you’d ha’ been happy i’m too fond of a quiet life to suit you  are you going to beg my pardon and my uncle’s pardon ses ’is wife stamping ’er foot  no ses dixon i am not i’m surprised at you asking it  well you don’t come out o’ this room till you do ses ’is wife  that won’t hurt me ses dixon i couldn’t look anybody in the face arter being pushed out o’ my own bar  they kept ’im there all the rest o’ the day and as ’e was still obstinate when bedtime came mrs dixon who wasn’t to be beat brought down some bedclothes and ’ad a bed made up for ’im on the sofa some men would ha’ ’ad the police in for less than that but george dixon ’ad got a great deal o’ pride and ’e couldn’t bear the shame of it instead o’ that ’e acted like a fourteenyearold boy and ran away to sea  they found ’im gone when they came down in the morning and the sidedoor on the latch he ’ad left a letter for ’is wife on the table telling ’er wot he ’ad done short and sweet it was and wound up with telling ’er to be careful that her uncle and cousins didn’t eat ’er out of house and ’ome  she got another letter two days arterward saying that he ’ad shipped as ordinary seaman on an american barque called the seabird bound for california and that ’e expected to be away a year or thereabouts  it’ll do ’im good ses old burge when mrs dixon read the letter to ’em it’s a ’ard life is the sea and he’ll appreciate his ’ome when ’e comes back to it agin he don’t know when ’e’s well off it’s as comfortable a ’ome as a man could wish to ’ave it was surprising wot a little difference george dixon’s being away made to the blue lion nobody seemed to miss ’im much and things went on just the same as afore he went mrs dixon was all right with most people and ’er relations ’ad a very good time of it old burge began to put on flesh at such a rate that the sight of a ladder made ’im ill a’most and charlie and bob went about as if the place belonged to ’em  they ’eard nothing for eight months and then a letter came for mrs dixon from her ’usband in which he said that ’e had left the seabird after ’aving had a time which made ’im shiver to think of he said that the men was the roughest of the rough and the officers was worse and that he ’ad hardly ’ad a day without a blow from one or the other since he’d been aboard he’d been knocked down with a handspike by the second mate and had ’ad a week in his bunk with a kick given ’im by the boatswain he said ’e was now on the rochester castle bound for sydney and he ’oped for better times  that was all they ’eard for some months and then they got another letter saying that the men on the rochester castle was if anything worse than those on the seabird and that he’d begun to think that running away to sea was diff’rent to wot he’d expected and that he supposed ’e’d done it too late in life he sent ’is love to ’is wife and asked ’er as a favour to send uncle burge and ’is boys away as ’e didn’t want to find them there when ’e came home because they was the cause of all his sufferings  he don’t know ’is best friends ses old burge ’e’s got a nasty sperrit i don’t like to see  i’ll ’ave a word with ’im when ’e does come home ses bob i s’pose he thinks ’imself safe writing letters thousands o’ miles away  the last letter they ’ad came from auckland and said that he ’ad shipped on the monarch bound for the albert docks and he ’oped soon to be at ’ome and managing the blue lion same as in the old happy days afore he was fool enough to go to sea  that was the very last letter and some time arterward the monarch was in the missing list and byandby it became known that she ’ad gone down with all hands not long arter leaving new zealand the only difference it made at the blue lion was that mrs dixon ’ad two of ’er dresses dyed black and the others wore black neckties for a fortnight and spoke of dixon as pore george and said it was a funny world but they supposed everything was for the best  it must ha’ been pretty near four years since george dixon ’ad run off to sea when charlie who was sitting in the bar one arternoon reading the paper things being dull saw a man’s head peep through the door for a minute and then disappear a’most direckly arterward it looked in at another door and then disappeared agin when it looked in at the third door charlie ’ad put down ’is paper and was ready for it  who are you looking for he ses rather sharp wot d’ye want are you ’aving a game of peepbo or wot  the man coughed and smiled and then ’e pushed the door open gently and came in and stood there fingering ’is beard as though ’e didn’t know wot to say  i’ve come back charlie he ses at last  wot george ses charlie starting why i didn’t know you in that beard we all thought you was dead years ago  i was pretty nearly charlie ses dixon shaking his ’ead ah i’ve ’ad a terrible time since i left ’once  ’you don’t seem to ha’ made your fortune ses charlie looking down at ’is clothes i’d ha’ been ashamed to come ’ome like that if it ’ad been me  i’m wore out ses dixon leaning agin the bar i’ve got no pride left it’s all been knocked out of me how’s julia  she’s all right ses charlie here ju—  h’sh ses dixon reaching over the bar and laying his ’and on his arm don’t let ’er know too sudden break it to ’er gently  fiddlesticks ses charlie throwing his ’and off and calling here julia he’s come back  mrs dixon came running downstairs and into the bar good gracious she ses staring at her ’usband whoever’d ha’ thought o’ seeing you agin where ’ave you sprung from  ain’t you glad to see me julia ses george dixon  yes i s’pose so if you’ve come back to behave yourself ses mrs dixon what ’ave you got to say for yourself for running away and then writing them letters telling me to get rid of my relations  that’s a long time ago julia ses dixon raising the flap in the counter and going into the bar i’ve gone through a great deal o’ suffering since then i’ve been knocked about till i ’adn’t got any feeling left in me i’ve been shipwrecked and i’ve ’ad to fight for my life with savages  nobody asked you to run away ses his wife edging away as he went to put his arm round ’er waist you’d better go upstairs and put on some decent clothes  dixon looked at ’er for a moment and then he ’ung his ’ead  i’ve been thinking o’ you and of seeing you agin every day since i went away julia he ses you’d be the same to me if you was dressed in rags  he went upstairs without another word and old burge who was coming down came down five of ’em at once owing to dixon speaking to ’im afore he knew who ’e was the old man was still grumbling when dixon came down agin and said he believed he’d done it apurpose  you run away from a good ’ome he ses and the best wife in wapping and you come back and frighten people ’arf out o’ their lives i never see such a feller in all my born days  i was so glad to get ’ome agin i didn’t think ses dixon i hope you’re not ’urt  he started telling them all about his ’ardships while they were at tea but none of ’em seemed to care much about hearing ’em bob said that the sea was all right for men and that other people were sure not to like it  and you brought it all on yourself ses charlie you’ve only got yourself to thank for it i ’ad thought o’ picking a bone with you over those letters you wrote  let’s ’ope ’e’s come back more sensible than wot ’e was when ’e went away ses old burge with ’is mouth full o’ toast  by the time he’d been back a couple o’ days george dixon could see that ’is going away ’adn’t done any good at all nobody seemed to take any notice of ’im or wot he said and at last arter a word or two with charlie about the rough way he spoke to some o’ the customers charlie came in to mrs dixon and said that he was at ’is old tricks of interfering and he would not ’ave it  well he’d better keep out o’ the bar altogether ses mrs dixon there’s no need for ’im to go there we managed all right while ’e was away  do you mean i’m not to go into my own bar ses dixon stammering  yes i do ses mrs dixon you kept out of it for four years to please yourself and now you can keep out of it to please me  i’ve put you out o’ the bar before ses charlie and if you come messing about with me any more i’ll do it agin so now you know  he walked back into the bar whistling and george dixon arter sitting still for a long time thinking got up and went into the bar and he’d ’ardly got his foot inside afore charlie caught ’old of ’im by the shoulder and shoved ’im back into the parlour agin  i told you wot it would be ses mrs dixon looking up from ’er sewing you’ve only got your interfering ways to thank for it  this is a fine state of affairs in my own ’ouse ses dixon ’ardly able to speak you’ve got no proper feeling for your husband julia else you wouldn’t allow it why i was happier at sea than wot i am ’ere  well you’d better go back to it if you’re so fond of it ses ’is wife  i think i ’ad ses dixon if i can’t be master in my own ’ouse i’m better at sea hard as it is you must choose between us julia—me or your relations i won’t sleep under the same roof as them for another night am i to go  please yourself ses ’is wife i don’t mind your staying ’ere so long as you behave yourself but the others won’t go you can make your mind easy on that  i’ll go and look for another ship then ses dixon taking up ’is cap i’m not wanted here p’r’aps you wouldn’t mind ’aving some clothes packed into a chest for me so as i can go away decent  he looked round at ’is wife as though ’e expected she’d ask ’im not to go but she took no notice and he opened the door softly and went out while old burge who ’ad come into the room and ’eard what he was saying trotted off upstairs to pack ’is chest for ’im  in two hours ’e was back agin and more cheerful than he ’ad been since he ’ad come ’ome bob was in the bar and the others were just sitting down to tea and a big chest nicely corded stood on the floor in the corner of the room  that’s right he ses looking at it that’s just wot i wanted  it’s as full as it can be ses old burge i done it for you myself ’ave you got a ship  i ’ave ses dixon a jolly good ship no more hardships for me this time i’ve got a berth as captain  wot ses ’is wife captain you  yes ses dixon smiling at her you can sail with me if you like  thankee ses mrs dixon i’m quite comfortable where i am  do you mean to say you’ve got a master’s berth ses charlie staring at ’im  i do ses dixon master and owner  charlie coughed wot’s the name of the ship he asks winking at the others  the blue lion ses dixon in a voice that made ’em all start i’m shipping a new crew and i pay off the old one tonight you first my lad  pay off ses charlie leaning back in ’is chair and staring at ’im in a puzzled way blue lion  yes ses dixon in the same loud voice when i came ’ome the other day i thought p’r’aps i’d let bygones be bygones and i laid low for a bit to see whether any of you deserved it i went to sea to get hardened—and i got hard i’ve fought men that would eat you at a meal i’ve ’ad more blows in a week than you’ve ’ad in a lifetime you fatfaced landlubber  he walked to the door leading to the bar where bob was doing ’is best to serve customers and listen at the same time and arter locking it put the key in ’is pocket then ’e put his ’and in ’is pocket and slapped some money down on the table in front o’ charlie  there’s a month’s pay instead o’ notice he ses now git  george screams ’is wife ’ow dare you ’ave you gone crazy  i’m surprised at you ses old burge who’d been looking on with ’is mouth wide open and pinching ’imself to see whether ’e wasn’t dreaming  i don’t go for your orders ses charlie getting up wot d’ye mean by locking that door  wot roars dixon hang it i mustn’t lock a door without asking my barman now pack up and be off you swab afore i start on you  charlie gave a growl and rushed at ’im and the next moment ’e was down on the floor with the ’ardest bang in the face that he’d ever ’ad in ’is life mrs dixon screamed and ran into the kitchen follered by old burge who went in to tell ’er not to be frightened charlie got up and went for dixon agin but he ’ad come back as ’ard as nails and ’ad a rushing style o’ fighting that took charlie’s breath away by the time bob ’ad left the bar to take care of itself and run round and got in the back way charlie had ’ad as much as ’e wanted and was lying on the seachest in the corner trying to get ’is breath  yes wot d’ye want ses dixon with a growl as bob came in at the door  he was such a ’orrible figure with the blood on ’is face and ’is beard sticking out all ways that bob instead of doing wot he ’ad come round for stood in the doorway staring at ’im without a word  i’m paying off ses dixon ’ave you got anything to say agin it  no ses bob drawing back  you and charlie’ll go now ses dixon taking out some money the old man can stay on for a month to give ’im time to look round don’t look at me that way else i’ll knock your ’ead off  he started counting out bob’s money just as old burge and mrs dixon hearing all quiet came in out of the kitchen  don’t you be alarmed on my account my dear he ses turning to ’is wife it’s child’s play to wot i’ve been used to i’ll just see these two mistaken young fellers off the premises and then we’ll ’ave a cup o’ tea while the old man minds the bar  mrs dixon tried to speak but ’er temper was too much for ’er she looked from her ’usband to charlie and bob and then back at ’im agin and caught ’er breath  that’s right ses dixon nodding his ’ead at her i’m master and owner of the blue lion and you’re first mate when i’m speaking you keep quiet that’s dissipline  i was in that bar about three months arterward and i never saw such a change in any woman as there was in mrs dixon of all the nicemannered softspoken landladies i’ve ever seen she was the best and on’y to ’ear the way she answered her ’usband when he spoke to ’er was a pleasure to every married man in the bar     a spirit of avarice     mr john blows stood listening to the foreman with an air of lofty disdain he was a freeborn englishman and yet he had been summarily paid off at eleven o’clock in the morning and told that his valuable services would no longer be required more than that the foreman had passed certain strictures upon his features which however true they might be were quite irrelevant to the fact that mr blows had been discovered slumbering in a shed when he should have been laying bricks  take your ugly face off these ’ere works said the foreman take it ’ome and bury it in the backyard anybody’ll be glad to lend you a spade  mr blows in a somewhat fluent reply reflected severely on the foreman’s immediate ancestors and the strange lack of goodfeeling and public spirit they had exhibited by allowing him to grow up  take it ’ome and bury it said the foreman again not under any plants you’ve got a liking for  i suppose said mr blows still referring to his foe’s parents and now endeavouring to make excuses for them—i s’pose they was so pleased and so surprised when they found that you was a ’uman being that they didn’t mind anything else  he walked off with his head in the air and the other men who had partially suspended work to listen resumed their labours a modest pint at the rising sun revived his drooping spirits and he walked home thinking of several things which he might have said to the foreman if he had only thought of them in time  he paused at the open door of his house and looking in sniffed at the smell of mottled soap and dirty water which pervaded it the stairs were wet and a pail stood in the narrow passage from the kitchen came the sounds of crying children and a scolding mother master joseph henry blows aged three was holding his breath and the family were all aghast at the length of his performance he recovered it as his father entered the room and drowned without distressing himself the impotent efforts of the others mrs blows turned upon her husband a look of hot inquiry  i’ve got the chuck he said surlily  what again said the unfortunate woman yes again repeated her husband  mrs blows turned away and dropping into a chair threw her apron over her head and burst into discordant weeping two little blows who had ceased their outcries resumed them again from sheer sympathy  stop it yelled the indignant mr blows stop it at once d’ye hear  i wish i’d never seen you sobbed his wife from behind her apron of all the lazy idle drunken goodfornothing——  go on said mr blows grimly  you’re more trouble than you’re worth declared mrs blows look at your father my dears she continued taking the apron away from her face take a good look at him and mind you don’t grow up like it  mr blows met the combined gaze of his innocent offspring with a dark scowl and then fell to moodily walking up and down the passage until he fell over the pail at that his mood changed and turning fiercely he kicked that useful article up and down the passage until he was tired  i’ve ’ad enough of it he muttered he stopped at the kitchendoor and putting his hand in his pocket threw a handful of change on to the floor and swung out of the house  another pint of beer confirmed him in his resolution he would go far away and make a fresh start in the world the morning was bright and the air fresh and a pleasant sense of freedom and adventure possessed his soul as he walked at a swinging pace he soon left gravelton behind him and coming to the river sat down to smoke a final pipe before turning his back forever on a town which had treated him so badly  the river murmured agreeably and the rushes stirred softly in the breeze mr blows who could fall asleep on an upturned pail succumbed to the influence at once the pipe dropped from his mouth and he snored peacefully  he was awakened by a choking scream and starting up hastily looked about for the cause then in the water he saw the little white face of billy clements and wading in up to his middle he reached out and catching the child by the hair drew him to the bank and set him on his feet still screaming with terror billy threw up some of the water he had swallowed and without turning his head made off in the direction of home calling piteously upon his mother  mr blows shivering on the bank watched him out of sight and missing his cap was just in time to see that friend of several seasons slowly sinking in the middle of the river he squeezed the water from his trousers and crossing the bridge set off across the meadows  his selfimposed term of bachelorhood lasted just three months at the end of which time he made up his mind to enact the part of the generous husband and forgive his wife everything he would not go into details but issue one big magnanimous pardon  full of these lofty ideas he set off in the direction of home again it was a threedays’ tramp and the evening of the third day saw him but a bare two miles from home he clambered up the bank at the side of the road and sprawling at his ease smoked quietly in the moonlight  a waggon piled up with straw came jolting and creaking toward him the driver sat dozing on the shafts and mr blows smiled pleasantly as he recognised the first face of a friend he had seen for three months he thrust his pipe in his pocket and rising to his feet clambered on to the back of the waggon and lying face downward on the straw peered down at the unconscious driver below  i’ll give old joe a surprise he said to himself he’ll be the first to welcome me back  joe he said softly ’ow goes it old pal  mr joe carter still dozing opened his eyes at the sound of his name and looked round then coming to the conclusion that he had been dreaming closed them again  i’m alooking at you joe said mr blows waggishly i can see you  mr carter looked up sharply and catching sight of the grinning features of mr blows protruding over the edge of the straw threw up his arms with a piercing shriek and fell off the shafts on to the road the astounded mr blows raising himself on his hands saw him pick himself up and giving vent to a series of fearsome yelps run clumsily back along the road  joe shouted mr blows joooe  mr carter put his hands to his ears and ran on blindly while his friend sitting on the top of the straw regarded his proceedings with mixed feelings of surprise and indignation  it can’t be that tanner ’e owes me he mused and yet i don’t know what else it can be i never see a man so jumpy  he continued to speculate while the old horse undisturbed by the driver’s absence placidly continued its journey a mile farther however he got down to take the short cut by the fields  if joe can’t look after his ’orse and cart he said primly as he watched it along the road it’s not my business  the footpath was not much used at that time of night and he only met one man they were in the shadow of the trees which fringed the new cemetery as they passed and both peered the stranger was satisfied first and to mr blows’s growing indignation first gave a leap backward which would not have disgraced an acrobat and then made off across the field with hideous outcries  if i get ’old of some of you said the offended mr blows i’ll give you something to holler for  he pursued his way grumbling and insensibly slackened his pace as he drew near home a remnant of conscience which had stuck to him without encouragement for thirtyfive years persisted in suggesting that he had behaved badly it also made a few illbred inquiries as to how his wife and children had subsisted for the last three months he stood outside the house for a short space and then opening the door softly walked in  the kitchendoor stood open and his wife in a black dress sat sewing by the light of a smoky lamp she looked up as she heard his footsteps and then without a word slid from the chair full length to the floor  go on said mr blows bitterly keep it up don’t mind me  mrs blows paid no heed her face was white and her eyes were closed her husband with a dawning perception of the state of affairs drew a mug of water from the tap and flung it over her she opened her eyes and gave a faint scream and then scrambling to her feet tottered toward him and sobbed on his breast  there there said mr blows don’t take on i forgive you  oh john said his wife sobbing convulsively i thought you was dead i thought you was dead it’s only a fortnight ago since we buried you  buried me said the startled mr blows buried me  i shall wake up and find i’m dreaming wailed mrs blows i know i shall i’m always dreaming that you’re not dead night before last i dreamt that you was alive and i woke up sobbing as if my ’art would break  sobbing said mr blows with a scowl for joy john explained his wife  mr blows was about to ask for a further explanation of the mystery when he stopped and regarded with much interest a fairsized cask which stood in one corner  a cask o’ beer he said staring as he took a glass from the dresser and crossed over to it you don’t seem to ’ave taken much ’arm during my—my going after work  we ’ad it for the funeral john said his wife leastways we ’ad two this is the second  mr blows who had filled the glass set it down on the table untasted things seemed a trifle uncanny  go on said mrs blows you’ve got more right to it than anybody else fancy ’aving you here drinking up the beer for your own funeral  i don’t understand what you’re adriving at retorted mr blows drinking somewhat gingerly from the glass ’ow could there be a funeral without me  it’s all a mistake said the overjoyed mrs blows we must have buried somebody else but such a funeral john you would ha’ been proud if you could ha’ seen it all gravelton followed nearly there was the boys’ drum and fife band and the ancient order of camels what you used to belong to turned out with their brass band and banners—all the people marching four abreast and sometimes five  mr blows’s face softened he had no idea that he had established himself so firmly in the affections of his fellowtownsmen  four mourning carriages continued his wife and the—the hearse all covered in flowers so that you couldn’t see it ’ardly one wreath cost two pounds  mr blows endeavoured to conceal his gratification beneath a mask of surliness waste o’ money he growled and stooping to the cask drew himself another glass of beer  some o’ the gentry sent their carriages to follow said mrs blows sitting down and clasping her hands in her lap  i know one or two that ’ad a liking for me said mr blows almost blushing  and to think that it’s all a mistake continued his wife but i thought it was you it was dressed like you and your cap was found near it  h’m said mr blows a pretty mess you’ve been and made of it here’s people been giving two pounds for wreaths and turning up with brass bands and banners because they thought it was me and it’s all been wasted  it wasn’t my fault said his wife little billy clements came running ’ome the day you went away and said ’e’d fallen in the water and you’d gone in and pulled ’im out he said ’e thought you was drownded and when you didn’t come ’ome i naturally thought so too what else could i think  mr blows coughed and holding his glass up to the light regarded it with a preoccupied air  they dragged the river resumed his wife and found the cap but they didn’t find the body till nine weeks afterward there was a inquest at the peal o’ bells and i identified you and all that grand funeral was because they thought you’d lost your life saving little billy they said you was a hero  you’ve made a nice mess of it repeated mr blows  the rector preached the sermon continued his wife a beautiful sermon it was too i wish you’d been there to hear it i should ’ave enjoyed it ever so much better he said that nobody was more surprised than what ’e was at your doing such a thing and that it only showed ’ow little we knowed our fellowcreatures he said that it proved there was good in all of us if we only gave it a chance to come out  mr blows eyed her suspiciously but she sat thinking and staring at the floor  i s’pose we shall have to give the money back now she said at last  money said the other what money  money that was collected for us replied his wife one ’undered and eightythree pounds seven shillings and fourpence  mr blows took a long breath ow much he said faintly say it agin  his wife obeyed  show it to me said the other in trembling tones let’s ’ave a look at it let’s ’old some of it  i can’t was the reply there’s a committee of the camels took charge of it and they pay my rent and allow me ten shillings a week now i s’pose it’ll have to be given back  don’t you talk nonsense said mr blows violently you go to them interfering camels and say you want your money—all of it say you’re going to australia say it was my last dying wish  mrs blows puckered her brow  i’ll keep quiet upstairs till you’ve got it continued her husband rapidly there was only two men saw me and i can see now that they thought i was my own ghost send the kids off to your mother for a few days  his wife sent them off next morning and a little later was able to tell him that his surmise as to his friends’ mistake was correct all gravelton was thrilled by the news that the spiritual part of mr john blows was walking the earth and much exercised as to his reasons for so doing  seemed such a monkey trick for ’im to do complained mr carter to the listening circle at the peal o’ bells ’i’m alooking at you joe’ he ses and he waggled his ’ead as if it was made of indiarubber  he’d got something on ’is mind what he wanted to tell you said a listener severely you ought to ’ave stopped joe and asked ’im what it was  i think i see myself said the shivering mr carter i think i see myself  then he wouldn’t ’ave troubled you any more said the other  mr carter turned pale and eyed him fixedly p’r’aps it was only a deathwarning said another man  what d’ye mean ’only a deathwarning’ demanded the unfortunate mr carter you don’t know what you’re talking about  i ’ad an uncle o’ mine see a ghost once said a third man anxious to relieve the tension  and what ’appened inquired the first speaker i’ll tell you after joe’s gone said the other with rare consideration  mr carter called for some more beer and told the barmaid to put a little gin in it in a pitiable state of nerves he sat at the extreme end of a bench and felt that he was an object of unwholesome interest to his acquaintances the finishing touch was put to his discomfiture when a wellmeaning friend in a vague and disjointed way advised him to give up drink swearing and any other bad habits which he might have contracted  the committee of the ancient order of camels took the news calmly and classed it with pink rats and other abnormalities in reply to mrs blows’s request for the capital sum they expressed astonishment that she could be willing to tear herself away from the hero’s grave and spoke of the pain which such an act on her part would cause him in the event of his being conscious of it in order to show that they were reasonable men they allowed her an extra shilling that week  the hero threw the dole on the bedroom floor and in a speech bristling with personalities consigned the committee to perdition the confinement was beginning to tell upon him and two nights afterward just before midnight he slipped out for a breath of fresh air  it was a clear night and all gravelton with one exception appeared to have gone to bed the exception was policeconstable collins and he after tracking the skulking figure of mr blows and finally bringing it to bay in a doorway kept his for a fortnight as a sensible man mr blows took no credit to himself for the circumstance but a natural feeling of satisfaction at the discomfiture of a member of a force for which he had long entertained a strong objection could not be denied  gravelton debated this new appearance with bated breath and even the purblind committee of the camels had to alter their views they no longer denied the supernatural nature of the manifestations but with a strange misunderstanding of mr blows’s desires attributed his restlessness to dissatisfaction with the projected tombstone and having plenty of funds amended their order for a plain stone at ten guineas to one in pink marble at twentyfive  that there committee said mr blows to his wife in a trembling voice as he heard of the alteration—that there committee seem to think that they can play about with my money as they like you go and tell ’em you won’t ’ave it and say you’ve given up the idea of going to australia and you want the money to open a shop with we’ll take a little pub somewhere  mrs blows went and returned in tears and for two entire days her husband a prey to gloom sat trying to evolve fresh and original ideas for the possession of the money on the evening of the second day he became lowspirited and going down to the kitchen took a glass from the dresser and sat down by the beercask  almost insensibly he began to take a brighter view of things it was saturday night and his wife was out he shook his head indulgently as he thought of her and began to realise how foolish he had been to entrust such a delicate mission to a woman the ancient order of camels wanted a man to talk to them—a man who knew the world and could assail them with unanswerable arguments having applied every known test to make sure that the cask was empty he took his cap from a nail and sallied out into the street  old mrs martin a neighbour saw him first and announced the fact with a scream that brought a dozen people round her bereft of speech she mouthed dumbly at mr blows  i ain’t touch—touched her said that gentleman earnestly i ain’t— been near ’er  the crowd regarded him wildeyed fresh members came running up and pushing for a front place fell back hastily on the main body and watched breathlessly mr blows disquieted by their silence renewed his protestations  i was coming ’long——  he broke off suddenly and turning round gazed with some heat at a gentleman who was endeavouring to ascertain whether an umbrella would pass through him the investigator backed hastily into the crowd again and a faint murmur of surprise arose as the indignant mr blows rubbed the place  he’s alive i tell you said a voice what cheer jack  ullo bill said mr blows genially  bill came forward cautiously and first shaking hands satisfied himself by various little taps and prods that his friend was really alive  it’s all right he shouted come and feel  at least fifty hands accepted the invitation and ignoring the threats and entreaties of mr blows who was a highly ticklish subject wandered briskly over his anatomy he broke free at last and supported by bill and a friend set off for the peal o’ bells  by the time he arrived there his following had swollen to immense proportions windows were thrown up and people standing on their doorsteps shouted inquiries congratulations met him on all sides and the joy of mr joseph carter was so great that mr blows was quite affected  in high feather at the attention he was receiving mr blows pushed his way through the idlers at the door and ascended the short flight of stairs which led to the room where the members of the ancient order of camels were holding their lodge the crowd swarmed up after him  the door was locked but in response to his knocking it opened a couple of inches and a gruff voice demanded his business then before he could give it the doorkeeper reeled back into the room and mr blows with a large following pushed his way in  the president and his officers who were sitting in state behind a long table at the end of the room started to their feet with mingled cries of indignation and dismay at the intrusion mr blows conscious of the strength of his position walked up to them  mr blows gasped the president  ah you didn’t expec’ see me said mr blows with a scornful laugh they’re trying do me do me out o’ my lill bit o’ money bill  but you ain’t got no money said his bewildered friend  mr blows turned and eyed him haughtily then he confronted the staring president again  i’ve come for—my money he said impressively—one ’undereighty pounds  but look ’ere said the scandalised bill tugging at his sleeve you ain’t dead jack  you don’t understan’ said mr blows impatiently they know wharri mean one ’undereighty pounds they want to buy me a tombstone an’ i don’t want it i want the money here stop it dye hear the words were wrung from him by the action of the president who after eyeing him doubtfully during his remarks suddenly prodded him with the buttend of one of the property spears which leaned against his chair the solidity of mr blows was unmistakable and with a sudden resumption of dignity the official seated himself and called for silence  i’m sorry to say there’s been a bit of a mistake made he said slowly but i’m glad to say that mr blows has come back to support his wife and family with the sweat of his own brow only a pound or two of the money so kindly subscribed has been spent and the remainder will be handed back to the subscribers  here said the incensed mr blows listen me  take him away said the president with great dignity clear the room strangers outside  two of the members approached mr blows and placing their hands on his shoulders requested him to withdraw he went at last the centre of a dozen panting men and becoming wedged on the narrow staircase spoke fluently on such widely differing subjects as the rights of man and the shape of the president’s nose  he finished his remarks in the street but becoming aware at last of a strange lack of sympathy on the part of his audience he shook off the arm of the faithful mr carter and stalked moodily home     the third string     love said the nightwatchman as he watched in an abstracted fashion the efforts of a skipper to reach a brother skipper on a passing barge with a boathook don’t talk to me about love because i’ve suffered enough through it there ought to be teetotalers for love the same as wot there is for drink and they ought to wear a piece o’ ribbon to show it the same as the teetotalers do but not an attractive piece o’ ribbon mind you i’ve seen as much mischief caused by love as by drink and the funny thing is one often leads to the other love arter it is over often leads to drink and drink often leads to love and to a man committing himself for life afore it is over  sailormen give way to it most they see so little o’ wimmen that they naturally ’ave a high opinion of ’em wait till they become nightwatchmen and having to be at ’ome all day see the other side of ’em if people on’y started life as nightwatchmen there wouldn’t be one ’arf the falling in love that there is now  i remember one chap as nice a fellow as you could wish to meet too he always carried his sweetheart’s photograph about with ’im and it was the on’y thing that cheered ’im up during the fourteen years he was cast away on a deserted island he was picked up at last and taken ’ome and there she was still single and waiting for ’im and arter spending fourteen years on a deserted island he got another ten in quod for shooting ’er because she ’ad altered so much in ’er looks  then there was ginger dick a red’aired man i’ve spoken about before he went and fell in love one time when he was lodging in wapping ’ere with old sam small and peter russet and a nice mess ’e made of it  they was just back from a v’y’ge and they ’adn’t been ashore a week afore both of ’em noticed a change for the worse in ginger he turned quiet and peaceful and lost ’is taste for beer he used to play with ’is food instead of eating it and in place of going out of an evening with sam and peter took to going off by ’imself  it’s love ses peter russet shaking his ’ead and he’ll be worse afore he’s better  who’s the gal ses old sam  peter didn’t know but when they came ’ome that night ’e asked ginger who was sitting up in bed with a faroff look in ’is eyes cuddling ’is knees went on staring but didn’t answer  who is it making a fool of you this time ginger ses old sam  you mind your bisness and i’ll mind mine ses ginger suddenly waking up and looking very fierce  no offence mate ses sam winking at peter i on’y asked in case i might be able to do you a good turn  well you can do that by not letting her know you’re a pal o’ mine ses ginger very nasty  old sam didn’t understand at fust and when peter explained to ’im he wanted to hit ’im for trying to twist ginger’s words about  she don’t like fat old men ses ginger  ho ses old sam who couldn’t think of anything else to say ho don’t she ho ho indeed  he undressed ’imself and got into the bed he shared with peter and kept ’im awake for hours by telling ’im in a loud voice about all the gals he’d made love to in his life and partikler about one gal that always fainted dead away whenever she saw either a red’aired man or a monkey  peter russet found out all about it next day and told sam that it was a barmaid with black ’air and eyes at the jolly pilots and that she wouldn’t ’ave anything to say to ginger  he spoke to ginger about it agin when they were going to bed that night and to ’is surprise found that he was quite civil when ’e said that he would do anything he could for ’im ginger was quite affected  i can’t eat or drink he ses in a miserable voice i lay awake all last night thinking of her she’s so diff’rent to other gals she’s got—if i start on you sam small you’ll know it you go and make that choking noise to them as likes it  it’s a bit o’ eggshell i got in my throat at breakfast this morning ginger ses sam i wonder whether she lays awake all night thinking of you  i dare say she does ses peter russet giving ’im a little push  keep your ’art up ginger ses sam i’ve known gals to ’ave the most ext’ordinary likings afore now  don’t take no notice of ’im ses peter holding ginger back ’ow are you getting on with her  ginger groaned and sat down on ’is bed and looked at the floor and sam went and sat on his till it shook so that ginger offered to step over and break ’is neck for ’im  i can’t ’elp the bed shaking ses sam it ain’t my fault i didn’t make it if being in love is going to make you so disagreeable to your best friends ginger you’d better go and live by yourself  i ’eard something about her today ginger ses peter russet i met a chap i used to know at bull’s wharf and he told me that she used to keep company with a chap named bill lumm a bit of a prizefighter and since she gave ’im up she won’t look at anybody else  was she very fond of ’im then asks ginger  i don’t know ses peter but this chap told me that she won’t walk out with anybody agin unless it’s another prizefighter her pride won’t let her i s’pose  well that’s all right ginger ses sam all you’ve got to do is to go and be a prizefighter  if i ’ave any more o’ your nonsense— ses ginger starting up  that’s right ses sam jump down anybody’s throat when they’re trying to do you a kindness that’s you all over ginger that is wot’s to prevent you telling ’er that you’re a prizefighter from australia or somewhere she won’t know no better  he got up off the bed and put his ’ands up as ginger walked across the room to ’im but ginger on’y wanted to shake ’ands and arter he ’ad done that ’e patted ’im on the back and smiled at ’im  i’ll try it he ses i’d tell any lies for ’er sake ah you don’t know wot love is sam  i used to ses sam and then he sat down agin and began to tell ’em all the loveaffairs he could remember until at last peter russet got tired and said it was ’ard to believe looking at ’im now wot a perfick terror he’d been with gals and said that the face he’d got now was a judgment on ’im sam shut up arter that and got into trouble with peter in the middle o’ the night by waking ’im up to tell ’im something that he ’ad just thought of about his face  the more ginger thought o’ sam’s idea the more he liked it and the very next evening ’e took peter russet into the private bar o’ the jolly pilots he ordered port wine which he thought seemed more ’ighclass than beer and then peter russet started talking to miss tucker and told her that ginger was a prizefighter from sydney where he’d beat everybody that stood up to ’im  the gal seemed to change toward ginger all in a flash and ’er beautiful black eyes looked at ’im so admiring that he felt quite faint she started talking to ’im about his fights at once and when at last ’e plucked up courage to ask ’er to go for a walk with ’im on sunday arternoon she seemed quite delighted  it’ll be a nice change for me she ses smiling i used to walk out with a prizefighter once before and since i gave ’im up i began to think i was never going to ’ave a young man agin you can’t think ’ow dull it’s been  must ha’ been ses ginger  i s’pose you’ve got a taste for prizefighters miss ses peter russet  no ses miss tucker i don’t think that it’s that exactly but you see i couldn’t ’ave anybody else not for their own sakes  why not ses ginger looking puzzled  why not ses miss tucker why because o’ bill he’s such a ’orrid jealous disposition after i gave ’im up i walked out with a young fellow named smith fine big strapping chap ’e was too and i never saw such a change in any man as there was in ’im after bill ’ad done with ’im i couldn’t believe it was ’im i told bill he ought to be ashamed of ’imself  wot did ’e say asks ginger  don’t ask me wot ’e said ses miss tucker tossing her ’ead not liking to be beat i ’ad one more try with a young fellow named charlie webb  wot ’appened to ’im ses peter russet arter waiting a bit for ’er to finish  i can’t bear to talk of it ses miss tucker holding up ginger’s glass and giving the counter a wipe down he met bill and i saw ’im six weeks afterward just as ’e was being sent away from the ’ospital to a seaside home bill disappeared after that  has he gone far away ses ginger trying to speak in a off’and way  oh he’s back now ses miss tucker you’ll see ’im fast enough and wotever you do don’t let ’im know you’re a prizefighter  why not ses pore ginger  because o’ the surprise it’ll be to ’im ses miss tucker let ’im rush on to ’is doom he’ll get a lesson ’e don’t expect the bully don’t be afraid of ’urting ’im think o’ pore smith and charlie webb  i am thinkin’ of ’em ses ginger slowlike is—is bill—very quick —with his ’ands  rather ses miss tucker but o’ course he ain’t up to your mark he’s on’y known in these parts  she went off to serve a customer and ginger dick tried to catch peter’s eye but couldn’t and when miss tucker came back he said ’e must be going  sunday afternoon at a quarter past three sharp outside ’ere she ses never mind about putting on your best clothes because bill is sure to be hanging about i’ll take care o’ that  she reached over the bar and shook ’ands with ’im and ginger felt a thrill go up ’is arm which lasted ’im all the way ’ome  he didn’t know whether to turn up on sunday or not and if it ’adn’t ha’ been for sam and peter russet he’d ha’ most likely stayed at home not that ’e was a coward being always ready for a scrap and gin’rally speaking doing well at it but he made a few inquiries about bill lumm and ’e saw that ’e had about as much chance with ’im as a kitten would ’ave with a bulldog  sam and peter was delighted and they talked about it as if it was a pantermime and old sam said that when he was a young man he’d ha’ fought six bill lumms afore he’d ha’ given a gal up he brushed ginger’s clothes for ’im with ’is own hands on sunday afternoon and when ginger started ’im and peter follered some distance behind to see fair play  the on’y person outside the jolly pilots when ginger got there was a man a strongbuilt chap with a thick neck very large ’ands and a nose which ’ad seen its best days some time afore he looked ’ard at ginger as ’e came up and then stuck his ’ands in ’is trouser pockets and spat on the pavement ginger walked a little way past and then back agin and just as he was thinking that ’e might venture to go off as miss tucker ’adn’t come the door opened and out she came  i couldn’t find my ’atpins she ses taking ginger’s arm and smiling up into ’is face  before ginger could say anything the man he ’ad noticed took his ’ands out of ’is pockets and stepped up to ’im  let go o’ that young lady’s arm he ses sha’n’t ses ginger holding it so tight that miss tucker nearly screamed  let go ’er arm and put your ’ands up ses the chap agin  not ’ere ses ginger who ’ad laid awake the night afore thinking wot to do if he met bill lumm if you wish to ’ave a spar with me my lad you must ’ave it where we can’t be interrupted when i start on a man i like to make a good job of it  good job of it ses the other starting do you know who i am  no i don’t ses ginger and wot’s more i don’t care  my name ses the chap speaking in a slow careful voice is bill lumm  wot a ’orrid name ses ginger  otherwise known as the wapping basher ses bill shoving ’is face into ginger’s and glaring at ’im  ho ses ginger sniffing a amatoor  amatoor ses bill shouting  that’s wot we should call you over in australia ses ginger my name is dick duster likewise known as the sydney puncher i’ve killed three men in the ring and ’ave never ’ad a defeat  well put ’em up ses bill doubling up ’is fists and shaping at ’im  not in the street i tell you ses ginger still clinging tight to miss tucker’s arm i was fined five pounds the other day for punching a man in the street and the magistrate said it would be ’ard labour for me next time you find a nice quiet spot for some arternoon and i’ll knock your ’ead off with pleasure  i’d sooner ’ave it knocked off now ses bill i don’t like waiting for things  thursday arternoon ses ginger very firm there’s one or two gentlemen want to see a bit o’ my work afore backing me and we can combine bisness with pleasure  he walked off with miss tucker leaving bill lumm standing on the pavement scratching his ’ead and staring arter ’im as though ’e didn’t quite know wot to make of it bill stood there for pretty near five minutes and then arter asking sam and peter who ’ad been standing by listening whether they wanted anything for themselves walked off to ask ’is pals wot they knew about the sydney puncher  ginger dick was so quiet and satisfied about the fight that old sam and peter couldn’t make ’im out at all he wouldn’t even practise punching at a bolster that peter rigged up for ’im and when ’e got a message from bill lumm naming a quiet place on the lea marshes he agreed to it as comfortable as possible  well i must say ginger that i like your pluck ses peter russet  i always ’ave said that for ginger ’e’s got pluck ses sam  ginger coughed and tried to smile at ’em in a superior sort o’ way i thought you’d got more sense he ses at last you don’t think i’m going do you  wot ses old sam in a shocked voice  you’re never going to back out of it ginger ses peter  i am ses ginger if you think i’m going to be smashed up by a prizefighter just to show my pluck you’re mistook  you must go ginger ses old sam very severe it’s too late to back out of it now think of the gal think of ’er feelings  for the sake of your good name ses peter  i should never speak to you agin ginger ses old sam pursing up ’is lips  nor me neither ses peter russet  to think of our ginger being called a coward ses old sam with a shudder and afore a gal too  the loveliest gal in wapping ses peter  look ’ere ses ginger you can shut up both of you i’m not going and that’s the long and short of it i don’t mind an ordinary man but i draw the line at prizefighters  old sam sat down on the edge of ’is bed and looked the picture of despair you must go ginger he ses for my sake  your sake ses ginger staring  i’ve got money on it ses sam so’s peter if you don’t turn up all bets’ll be off  good job for you too ses ginger if i did turn up you’d lose it to a dead certainty  old sam coughed and looked at peter and peter ’e coughed and looked at sam  you don’t understand ginger said sam in a soft voice it ain’t often a chap gets the chance o’ making a bit o’ money these ’ard times  so we’ve put all our money on bill lumm ses peter it’s the safest and easiest way o’ making money i ever ’eard of you see we know you’re not a prizefighter and the others don’t  pore ginger looked at ’em and then ’e called ’em all the names he could lay ’is tongue to but with the idea o’ the money they was going make they didn’t mind a bit they let him ’ave ’is say and that night they brought ’ome two other sailormen wot ’ad bet agin ginger to share their room and though they ’ad bet agin ’im they was so fond of ’im that it was evident that they wasn’t going to leave ’im till the fight was over  ginger gave up then and at twelve o’clock next day they started off to find the place mr webson the landlord of the jolly pilots a short fat man o’ fifty wot ’ad spoke to ginger once or twice went with ’em and all the way to the station he kept saying wot a jolly spot it was for that sort o’ thing perfickly private nice soft green grass to be knocked down on and larks up in the air singing away as if they’d never leave off  they took the train to homerton and being a slack time o’ the day the porters was surprised to see wot a lot o’ people was travelling by it so was ginger there was the landlords of ’arf the public’ouses in wapping all smoking big cigars two dock policemen in plain clothes wot ’ad got the arternoon off—one with a raging toothache and the other with a baby wot wasn’t expected to last the day out they was as full o’ fun as kittens and the landlord o’ the jolly pilots pointed out to ginger wot reasonable ’uman beings policemen was at ’art besides them there was quite a lot o’ sailormen even skippers and mates nearly all of ’em smoking big cigars too and looking at ginger out of the corner of one eye and at the wapping basher out of the corner of the other  hit ’ard and hit straight ses the landlord to ginger in a low voice as they got out of the train and walked up the road ’ow are you feeling  i’ve got a cold coming on ses pore ginger looking at the basher who was on in front and a splitting ’eadache and a sharp pain all down my left leg i don’t think——  well it’s a good job it’s no worse ses the landlord all you’ve got to do is to hit ’ard if you win it’s a ’undered pounds in my pocket and i’ll stand you a fiver of it d’ye understand  they turned down some little streets several of ’em going diff’rent ways and arter crossing the river lea got on to the marshes and as the landlord said the place might ha’ been made for it  a little chap from mile end was the referee and bill lumm ’aving peeled stood looking on while ginger took ’is things off and slowly and carefully folded ’em up then they stepped toward each other bill taking longer steps than ginger and shook ’ands immediately arter which bill knocked ginger head over ’eels  time was called and the landlord o’ the jolly pilots who was nursing ginger on ’is knee said that it was nothing at all and that bleeding at the nose was a sign of ’ealth but as it happened ginger was that mad ’e didn’t want any encouragement he on’y wanted to kill bill lumm  he got two or three taps in the next round which made his ’ead ring and then he got ’ome on the mark and follered it up by a left’anded punch on bill’s jaw that surprised ’em both—bill because he didn’t think ginger could hit so ’ard and ginger because ’e didn’t think that prizefighters ’ad any feelings  they clinched and fell that round and the landlord patted ginger on the back and said that if he ever ’ad a son he ’oped he’d grow up like ’im  ginger was surprised at the way ’e was getting on and so was old sam and peter russet and when ginger knocked bill down in the sixth round sam went as pale as death ginger was getting marked all over but he stuck to ’is man and the two dock policemen wot ’ad put their money on bill lumm began to talk of their dooty and say as ’ow the fight ought to be stopped  at the tenth round bill couldn’t see out of ’is eyes and kept wasting ’is strength on the empty air and once on the referee ginger watched ’is opportunity and at last with a terrific smash on the point o’ bill’s jaw knocked ’im down and then looked round for the landlord’s knee  bill made a game try to get up when time was called but couldn’t and the referee who was ’olding a ’andkerchief to ’is nose gave the fight to ginger  it was the proudest moment o’ ginger dick’s life he sat there like a king smiling ’orribly and sam’s voice as he paid ’is losings sounded to ’im like music in spite o’ the words the old man see fit to use it was so ’ard to get peter russet’s money that it a’most looked as though there was going to be another prizefight but ’e paid up at last and went off arter fust telling ginger part of wot he thought of ’im  there was a lot o’ quarrelling but the bets was all settled at last and the landlord o’ the jolly pilots who was in ’igh feather with the money he’d won gave ginger the five pounds he’d promised and took him ’ome in a cab  you done well my lad he ses no don’t smile it looks as though your ’ead’s coming off  i ’ope you’ll tell miss tucker ’ow i fought ses ginger  i will my lad ses the landlord but you’d better not see ’er for some time for both your sakes  i was thinking of ’aving a day or two in bed ses ginger  best thing you can do ses the landlord and mind don’t you ever fight bill lumm agin keep out of ’is way  why i beat ’im once an’ i can beat ’im agin ses ginger offended  beat ’im ses the landlord he took ’is cigar out of ’is mouth as though ’e was going to speak and then put it back agin and looked out of the window  yes beat ’im ses ginger’ you was there and saw it  he lost the fight apurpose ses the landlord whispering miss tucker found out that you wasn’t a prizefighter—leastways i did for ’er—and she told bill that if ’e loved ’er so much that he’d ’ave ’is sinful pride took down by letting you beat ’im she’d think diff’rent of ’im why ’e could ’ave settled you in a minute if he’d liked he was on’y playing with you  ginger stared at ’im as if ’e couldn’t believe ’is eyes playing he ses feeling ’is face very gently with the tips of his fingers  yes ses the landlord and if he ever hits you agin you’ll know i’m speaking the truth  ginger sat back all of a heap and tried to think is miss tucker going to keep company with ’im agin then he ses in a faint voice  no ses the landlord you can make your mind easy on that point  well then if i walk out with ’er i shall ’ave to fight bill all over agin ses ginger  the landlord turned to ’im and patted ’im on the shoulder don’t you take up your troubles afore they come my lad he ses kindly and mind and keep wot i’ve told you dark for all our sakes  he put ’im down at the door of ’is lodgings and arter shaking ’ands with ’im gave the landlady a shilling and told ’er to get some beefsteak and put on ’is face and went home ginger went straight off to bed and the way he carried on when the landlady fried the steak afore bringing it up showed ’ow upset he was  it was over a week afore he felt ’e could risk letting miss tucker see ’im and then at seven o’clock one evening he felt ’e couldn’t wait any longer and arter spending an hour cleaning ’imself he started out for the jolly pilots  he felt so ’appy at the idea o’ seeing her agin that ’e forgot all about bill lumm and it gave ’im quite a shock when ’e saw ’im standing outside the pilots bill took his ’ands out of ’is pockets when he saw ’im and came toward ’im  it’s no good tonight mate he ses and to ginger’s great surprise shook ’ands with ’im  no good ses ginger staring  no ses bill he’s in the little backparlour like a whelk in ’is shell but we’ll ’ave ’im sooner or later  him who ses ginger more puzzled than ever  who ses bill why webson the landlord you don’t mean to tell me you ain’t heard about it  heard wot ses ginger i haven’t ’card anything i’ve been indoors with a bad cold all the week  webson and julia tucker was married at eleven o’clock yesterday morning ses bill lumm in a hoarse voice when i think of the way i’ve been done and wot i’ve suffered i feel ’arf crazy he won a ’undered pounds through me and then got the gal i let myself be disgraced for i ’ad an idea some time ago that he’d got ’is eye on her  ginger dick didn’t answer ’im a word he staggered back and braced ’imself up agin the wall for a bit and arter staring at bill lumm in a wild way for pretty near three minutes he crawled back to ’is lodgings and went straight to bed agin     odd charges     seated at his ease in the warm taproom of the cauliflower the stranger had been eating and drinking for some time apparently unconscious of the presence of the withered ancient who huddled up in that corner of the settle which was nearer to the fire fidgeted restlessly with an empty mug and blew with pathetic insistence through a churchwarden pipe which had long been cold the stranger finished his meal with a sigh of content and then rising from his chair crossed over to the settle and placing his mug on the timeworn table before him began to fill his pipe  the old man took a spill from the table and holding it with trembling fingers to the blaze gave him a light the other thanked him and then leaning back in his corner of the settle watched the smoke of his pipe through halfclosed eyes and assented drowsily to the old man’s remarks upon the weather  bad time o’ the year for going about said the latter though i s’pose if you can eat and drink as much as you want it don’t matter i s’pose you mightn’t be a conjurer from london sir  the traveller shook his head  i was ’oping you might be said the old man the other manifested no curiosity  if you ’ad been said the old man with a sigh i should ha’ asked you to ha’ done something useful gin’rally speaking conjurers do things that are no use to anyone wot i should like to see a conjurer do would be to make this ’ere empty mug full o’ beer and this empty pipe full o’ shag tobacco that’s wot i should ha’ made bold to ask you to do if you’d been one  the traveller sighed and taking his short briar pipe from his mouth by the bowl rapped three times upon the table with it in a very short time a mug of ale and a paper cylinder of shag appeared on the table before the old man  wot put me in mind o’ your being a conjurer said the latter filling his pipe after a satisfying draught from the mug is that you’re uncommon like one that come to claybury some time back and give a performance in this very room where we’re now asitting so far as looks go you might be his brother  the traveller said that he never had a brother  we didn’t know ’e was a conjurer at fust said the old man he ’ad come down for wickham fair and being a day or two before ’and ’e was going to different villages round about to give performances he came into the bar ’ere and ordered a mug o’ beer and while ’e was adrinking of it stood talking about the weather then ’e asked bill chambers to excuse ’im for taking the liberty and putting his ’and to bill’s mug took out a live frog bill was a very partikler man about wot ’e drunk and i thought he’d ha’ had a fit he went on at smith the landlord something shocking and at last for the sake o’ peace and quietness smith gave ’im another pint to make up for it  it must ha’ been asleep in the mug he ses  bill said that ’e thought ’e knew who must ha’ been asleep and was just going to take a drink when the conjurer asked ’im to excuse ’im agin bill put down the mug in a ’urry and the conjurer put his ’and to the mug and took out a dead mouse it would ha’ been a ’ard thing to say which was the most upset bill chambers or smith the landlord and bill who was in a terrible state asked why it was everything seemed to get into his mug  p’r’aps you’re fond o’ dumb animals sir ses the conjurer do you ’appen to notice your coatpocket is all of a wriggle  he put his ’and to bill’s pocket and took out a little green snake then he put his ’and to bill’s trouserpocket and took out a frog while pore bill’s eyes looked as if they was corning out o’ their sockets  keep still ses the conjurer there’s a lot more to come yet  bill chambers gave a ’owl that was dreadful to listen to and then ’e pushed the conjurer away and started undressing ’imself as fast as he could move ’is fingers i believe he’d ha’ taken off ’is shirt if it ’ad ’ad pockets in it and then ’e stuck ’is feet close together and ’e kept jumping into the air and coming down on to ’is own clothes in his hobnailed boots  he ain’t fond o’ dumb animals then ses the conjurer then he put his ’and on his ’art and bowed  gentlemen all he ses ’aving given you this specimen of wot i can do i beg to give notice that with the landlord’s kind permission i shall give my celebrated conjuring entertainment in the taproom this evening at seven o’clock ad—mission threepence each  they didn’t understand ’im at fust but at last they see wot ’e meant and arter explaining to bill who was still giving little jumps they led ’im up into a corner and coaxed ’im into dressing ’imself agin he wanted to fight the conjurer but ’e was that tired ’e could scarcely stand and byandby smith who ’ad said ’e wouldn’t ’ave anything to do with it gave way and said he’d risk it  the taproom was crowded that night but we all ’ad to pay threepence each—coining money i call it some o’ the things wot he done was very clever but a’most from the fust startoff there was unpleasantness when he asked somebody to lend ’im a pocket’andkercher to turn into a white rabbit henery walker rushed up and lent ’im ’is but instead of a white rabbit it turned into a black one with two white spots on it and arter henery walker ’ad sat for some time puzzling over it ’e got up and went off ’ome without saying goodnight to a soul  then the conjurer borrowed sam jones’s hat and arter looking into it for some time ’e was that surprised and astonished that sam jones lost ’is temper and asked ’im whether he ’adn’t seen a hat afore  not like this ses the conjurer and ’e pulled out a woman’s dress and jacket and a pair o’ boots then ’e took out a pound or two o’ taters and some crusts o’ bread and other things and at last ’e gave it back to sam jones and shook ’is head at ’im and told ’im if he wasn’t very careful he’d spoil the shape of it  then ’e asked somebody to lend ’im a watch and arter he ’ad promised to take the greatest care of it dicky weed the tailor lent ’im a gold watch wot ’ad been left ’im by ’is greataunt when she died dicky weed thought a great deal o’ that watch and when the conjurer took a flatiron and began to smash it up into little bits it took three men to hold ’im down in ’is seat  this is the most difficult trick o’ the lot ses the conjurer picking off a wheel wot ’ad stuck to the flatiron sometimes i can do it and sometimes i can’t last time i tried it it was a failure and it cost me eighteenpence and a pint o’ beer afore the gentleman the watch ’ad belonged to was satisfied i gave ’im the bits too  if you don’t give me my watch back safe and sound ses dicky weed in a trembling voice it’ll cost you twenty pounds  ’ow much ses the conjurer with a start well i wish you’d told me that afore you lent it to me eighteenpence is my price  he stirred the broken bits up with ’is finger and shook his ’ead  i’ve never tried one o’ these oldfashioned watches afore he ses ’owever if i fail gentlemen it’ll be the fust and only trick i’ve failed in tonight you can’t expect everything to turn out right but if i do fail this time gentlemen i’ll try it agin if anybody else’ll lend me another watch  dicky weed tried to speak but couldn’t and ’e sat there with ’is face pale staring at the pieces of ’is watch on the conjurer’s table then the conjurer took a big pistol with a trumpetshaped barrel out of ’is box and arter putting in a charge o’ powder picked up the pieces o’ watch and rammed them in arter it we could hear the broken bits grating agin the ramrod and arter he ’ad loaded it ’e walked round and handed it to us to look at  it’s all right he ses to dicky weed it’s going to be a success i could tell in the loading  he walked back to the other end of the room and held up the pistol  i shall now fire this pistol ’e ses and in so doing mend the watch the explosion of the powder makes the bits o’ glass join together agin in flying through the air the wheels go round and round collecting all the other parts and the watch as good as new and ticking away its ’ardest will be found in the coatpocket o’ the gentleman i shoot at  he pointed the pistol fust at one and then at another as if ’e couldn’t make up ’is mind and none of ’em seemed to ’ave much liking for it peter gubbins told ’im not to shoot at ’im because he ’ad a ’ole in his pocket and bill chambers when it pointed at ’im up and told ’im to let somebody else ’ave a turn the only one that didn’t flinch was bob pretty the biggest poacher and the greatest rascal in claybury he’d been making fun o’ the tricks all along saying out loud that he’d seen ’em all afore—and done better  go on he ses i ain’t afraid of you you can’t shoot straight  the conjurer pointed the pistol at ’im then ’e pulled the trigger and the pistol went off bang and the same moment o’ time bob pretty jumped up with a ’orrible scream and holding his ’ands over ’is eyes danced about as though he’d gone mad  everybody started up at once and got round ’im and asked ’im wot was the matter but bob didn’t answer ’em he kept on making a dreadful noise and at last ’e broke out of the room and holding ’is ’andkercher to ’is face ran off ’ome as ’ard as he could run  you’ve done it now mate ses bill chambers to the conjurer i thought you wouldn’t be satisfied till you’d done some ’arm you’ve been and blinded pore bob pretty  nonsense ses the conjurer he’s frightened that’s all  frightened ses peter gubbins why you fired dicky weed’s watch straight into ’is face  rubbish ses the conjurer it dropped into ’is pocket and he’ll find it there when ’e comes to ’is senses  do you mean to tell me that bob pretty ’as gone off with my watch in ’is pocket screams dicky weed  i do ses the other  you’d better get ’old of bob afore ’e finds it out dicky ses bill chambers  dicky weed didn’t answer ’im he was already running along to bob pretty’s as fast as ’is legs would take ’im with most of us follering behind to see wot ’appened  the door was fastened when we got to it but dicky weed banged away at it as ’ard as he could bang and at last the bedroom winder went up and mrs pretty stuck her ’ead out  h’sh she ses in a whisper go away  i want to see bob ses dicky weed  you can’t see ’im ses mrs pretty i’m getting ’im to bed he’s been shot pore dear can’t you ’ear ’im groaning  we ’adn’t up to then but a’most direckly arter she ’ad spoke you could ha’ heard bob’s groans a mile away dreadful they was  there there pore dear ses mrs pretty  shall i come in and ’elp you get ’im to bed ses dicky weed ’arf crying  no thank you mr weed ses mrs pretty it’s very kind of you to offer but ’e wouldn’t like any hands but mine to touch ’im i’ll send in and let you know ’ow he is fust thing in the morning  try and get ’old of the coat dicky ses bill chambers in a whisper offer to mend it for ’im it’s sure to want it  well i’m sorry i can’t be no ’elp to you ses dicky weed but i noticed a rent in bob’s coat and as ’e’s likely to be laid up a bit it ud be a good opportunity for me to mend it for ’im i won’t charge ’im nothing if you drop it down i’ll do it now  thankee ses mrs pretty if you just wait a moment i’ll clear the pockets out and drop it down to you  she turned back into the bedroom and dicky weed ground ’is teeth together and told bill chambers that the next time he took ’is advice he’d remember it he stood there trembling all over with temper and when mrs pretty came to the winder agin and dropped the coat on his ’ead and said that bob felt his kindness very much and he ’oped dicky ud make a good job of it because it was ’is favrite coat he couldn’t speak he stood there shaking all over till mrs pretty ’ad shut the winder down agin and then ’e turned to the conjurer as ’ad come up with the rest of us and asked ’im wot he was going to do about it now  i tell you he’s got the watch ses the conjurer pointing up at the winder it went into ’is pocket i saw it go he was no more shot than you were if ’e was why doesn’t he send for the doctor  i can’t ’elp that ses dicky weed i want my watch or else twenty pounds  we’ll talk it over in a day or two ses the conjurer i’m giving my celebrated entertainment at wickham fair on monday but i’ll come back ’ere to the cauliflower the saturday before and give another entertainment and then we’ll see wot’s to be done i can’t run away because in any case i can’t afford to miss the fair  dicky weed gave way at last and went off ’ome to bed and told ’is wife about it and listening to ’er advice he got up at six o’clock in the morning and went round to see ’ow bob pretty was  mrs pretty was up when ’e got there and arter calling up the stairs to bob told dicky weed to go upstairs bob pretty was sitting up in bed with ’is face covered in bandages and he seemed quite pleased to see ’im  it ain’t everybody that ud get up at six o’clock to see ’ow i’m getting on he ses you’ve got a feeling ’art dicky  dicky weed coughed and looked round wondering whether the watch was in the room and if so where it was hidden  now i’m ’ere i may as well tidy up the room for you a bit he ses getting up i don’t like sitting idle  thankee mate ses bob and ’e lay still and watched dicky weed out of the corner of the eye that wasn’t covered with the bandages  i don’t suppose that room ’ad ever been tidied up so thoroughly since the prettys ’ad lived there but dicky weed couldn’t see anything o’ the watch and wot made ’im more angry than anything else was mrs pretty setting down in a chair with ’er ’ands folded in her lap and pointing out places that he ’adn’t done  you leave ’im alone ses bob he knows wot ’e’s arter wot did you do with those little bits o’ watch you found when you was bandaging me up missis  don’t ask me ses mrs pretty i was in such a state i don’t know wot i was doing ’ardly  well they must be about somewhere ses bob you ’ave a look for ’em dicky and if you find ’em keep ’em they belong to you  dicky weed tried to be civil and thank ’im and then he went off ’ome and talked it over with ’is wife agin people couldn’t make up their minds whether bob pretty ’ad found the watch in ’is pocket and was shamming or whether ’e was really shot but they was all quite certain that whichever way it was dicky weed would never see ’is watch agin  on the saturday evening this ’ere cauliflower public’ouse was crowded everybody being anxious to see the watch trick done over agin we had ’eard that it ’ad been done all right at cudford and monksham but bob pretty said as ’ow he’d believe it when ’e saw it and not afore  he was one o’ the fust to turn up that night because ’e said ’e wanted to know wot the conjurer was going to pay him for all ’is pain and suffering and having things said about ’is character he came in leaning on a stick with ’is face still bandaged and sat right up close to the conjurer’s table and watched him as ’ard as he could as ’e went through ’is tricks  and now ses the conjurer at last i come to my celebrated watch trick some of you as wos ’ere last tuesday when i did it will remember that the man i fired the pistol at pretended that ’e’d been shot and run off ’ome with it in ’is pocket  you’re a liar ses bob pretty standing up very good ses the conjurer you take that bandage off and show us all where you’re hurt  i shall do nothing o’ the kind ses bob i don’t take my orders from you  take the bandage off ses the conjurer and if there’s any shot marks i’ll give you a couple o’ sovereigns  i’m afraid of the air getting to it ses bob pretty  you don’t want to be afraid o’ that bob ses john biggs the blacksmith coming up behind and putting ’is great arms round ’im take off that rag somebody i’ve got hold of ’im  bob pretty started to struggle at fust but then seeing it was no good kept quite quiet while they took off the bandages  there look at ’im ses the conjurer pointing not a mark on ’is face not one  wet ses bob pretty do you mean to say there’s no marks  i do ses the conjurer  thank goodness ses bob pretty clasping his ’ands thank goodness i was afraid i was disfigured for life lend me a bit o’ lookingglass somebody i can ’ardly believe it  you stole dicky weed’s watch ses john biggs i ’ad my suspicions of you all along you’re a thief bob pretty that’s wot you are  prove it ses bob pretty you ’eard wot the conjurer said the other night that the last time he tried ’e failed and ’ad to give eighteenpence to the man wot the watch ’ad belonged to  that was by way of a joke like ses the conjurer to john biggs i can always do it i’m going to do it now will somebody ’ave the kindness to lend me a watch  he looked all round the room but nobody offered—except other men’s watches wot wouldn’t lend ’em  come come he ses ain’t none of you got any trust in me it’ll be as safe as if it was in your pocket i want to prove to you that this man is a thief  he asked ’em agin and at last john biggs took out ’is silver watch and offered it to ’im on the understanding that ’e was on no account to fire it into bob pretty’s pocket  not likely ses the conjurer now everybody take a good look at this watch so as to make sure there’s no deceiving  he ’anded it round and arter everybody ’ad taken a look at it ’e took it up to the table and laid it down  let me ’ave a look at it ses bob pretty going up to the table i’m not going to ’ave my good name took away for nothing if i can ’elp it  he took it up and looked at it and arter ’olding it to ’is ear put it down agin  is that the flatiron it’s going to be smashed with he ses  it is ses the conjurer looking at ’im nasty like p’r’aps you’d like to examine it  bob pretty took it and looked at it yes mates he ses it’s a ordinary flatiron you couldn’t ’ave anything better for smashing a watch with  he ’eld it up in the air and afore anybody could move brought it down bang on the face o’ the watch the conjurer sprang at ’im and caught at ’is arm but it was too late and in a terrible state o’ mind ’e turned round to john biggs  he’s smashed your watch he ses he’s smashed your watch  well ses john biggs it ’ad got to be smashed ’adn’t it  yes but not by ’im ses the conjurer dancing about i wash my ’ands of it now  look ’ere ses john biggs don’t you talk to me about washing your ’ands of it you finish your trick and give me my watch back agin same as it was afore  not now he’s been interfering with it ses the conjurer he’d better do the trick now as he’s so clever  i’d sooner ’ave you do it ses john biggs wot did you let ’im interfere for  ’ow was i to know wot ’e was going to do ses the conjurer you must settle it between you now i’ll ’ave nothing more to do with it  all right john biggs ses bob pretty if ’e won’t do it i will if it can be done i don’t s’pose it matters who does it i don’t think anybody could smash up a watch better than that  john biggs looked at it and then ’e asked the conjurer once more to do the trick but ’e wouldn’t  it can’t be done now he ses and i warn you that if that pistol is fired i won’t be responsible for what’ll ’appen  george kettle shall load the pistol and fire it if ’e won’t ses bob pretty ’aving been in the militia there couldn’t be a better man for the job  george kettle walked up to the table as red as fire at being praised like that afore people and started loading the pistol he seemed to be more awkward about it than the conjurer ’ad been the last time and he ’ad to roll the watchcases up with the flatiron afore ’e could get ’em in but ’e loaded it at last and stood waiting  don’t shoot at me george kettle ses bob i’ve been called a thief once and i don’t want to be agin  put that pistol down you fool afore you do mischief ses the conjurer  who shall i shoot at ses george kettle raising the pistol  better fire at the conjurer i think ses bob pretty and if things ’appen as he says they will ’appen the watch ought to be found in ’is coatpocket  where is he ses george looking round  bill chambers laid ’old of ’im just as he was going through the door to fetch the landlord and the scream ’e gave as he came back and george kettle pointed the pistol at ’im was awful  it’s no worse for you than it was for me ses bob  put it down screams the conjurer put it down you’ll kill ’arf the men in the room if it goes off  be careful where you aim george ses sam jones p’r’aps he’d better ’ave a chair all by hisself in the middle of the room  it was all very well for sam jones to talk but the conjurer wouldn’t sit on a chair by ’imself he wouldn’t sit on it at all he seemed to be all legs and arms and the way ’e struggled it took four or five men to ’old ’im  why don’t you keep still ses john biggs george kettle’ll shoot it in your pocket all right he’s the best shot in claybury  help murder says the conjurer struggling he’ll kill me nobody can do the trick but me  but you say you won’t do it ses john biggs not now ses the conjurer i can’t  well i’m not going to ’ave my watch lost through want of trying ses john biggs tie ’im to the chair mates  all right then ses the conjurer very pale don’t tie me i’ll sit still all right if you like but you’d better bring the chair outside in case of accidents bring it in the front  george kettle said it was all nonsense but the conjurer said the trick was always better done in the open air and at last they gave way and took ’im and the chair outside  now ses the conjurer as ’e sat down all of you go and stand near the man woe’s going to shoot when i say ’three’ fire why there’s the watch on the ground there  he pointed with ’is finger and as they all looked down he jumped up out o’ that chair and set off on the road to wickham as ’ard as ’e could run it was so sudden that nobody knew wot ’ad ’appened for a moment and then george kettle wot ’ad been looking with the rest turned round and pulled the trigger  there was a bang that pretty nigh deafened us and the back o’ the chair was blown nearly out by the time we’d got our senses agin the conjurer was a’most out o’ sight and bob pretty was explaining to john biggs wot a good job it was ’is watch ’adn’t been a gold one  that’s wot comes o’ trusting a foreigner afore a man wot you’ve known all your life he ses shaking his ’ead i ’ope the next man wot tries to take my good name away won’t get off so easy i felt all along the trick couldn’t be done it stands to reason it couldn’t i done my best too     admiral peters     mr george burton naval pensioner sat at the door of his lodgings gazing in placid content at the sea it was early summer and the air was heavy with the scent of flowers mr burton’s pipe was cold and empty and his pouch upstairs he shook his head gently as he realised this and yielding to the drowsy quiet of his surroundings laid aside the useless pipe and fell into a doze  he was awakened half an hour later by the sound of footsteps a tall strongly built man was approaching from the direction of the town and mr burton as he gazed at him sleepily began to wonder where he had seen him before even when the stranger stopped and stood smiling down at him his memory proved unequal to the occasion and he sat staring at the handsome shaven face with its little fringe of grey whisker waiting for enlightenment  george my buck said the stranger giving him a hearty slap on the shoulder how goes it  d— bless my eyes i mean said mr burton correcting himself if it ain’t joe stiles i didn’t know you without your beard  that’s me said the other it’s quite by accident i heard where you were living george i offered to go and sling my hammock with old dingle for a week or two and he told me nice quiet little place seacombe ah you were lucky to get your pension george  i deserved it said mr burton sharply as he fancied he detected something ambiguous in his friend’s remark  of course you did said mr stiles so did i but i didn’t get it well it’s a poor heart that never rejoices what about that drink you were speaking of george  i hardly ever touch anything now replied his friend  i was thinking about myself said mr stiles i can’t bear the stuff but the doctor says i must have it you know what doctors are george  mr burton did not deign to reply but led the way indoors  very comfortable quarters george remarked mr stiles gazing round the room approvingly shipshape and tidy i’m glad i met old dingle why i might never ha’ seen you again and us such pals too  his host grunted and from the back of a small cupboard produced a bottle of whisky and a glass and set them on the table after a momentary hesitation he found another glass  our noble selves said mr stiles with a tinge of reproach in his tones and may we never forget old friendships  mr burton drank the toast i hardly know what it’s like now joe he said slowly you wouldn’t believe how soon you can lose the taste for it  mr stiles said he would take his word for it you’ve got some nice little publichouses about here too he remarked there’s one i passed called the cock and flowerpot nice cosy little place it would be to spend the evening in  i never go there said mr burton hastily i—a friend o’ mine here doesn’t approve o’ public’ouses  what’s the matter with him inquired his friend anxiously  it’s—it’s a ’er said mr burton in some confusion  mr stiles threw himself back in his chair and eyed him with amazement then recovering his presence of mind he reached out his hand for the bottle  we’ll drink her health he said in a deep voice what’s her name  mrs dutton was the reply  mr stiles with one hand on his heart toasted her feelingly then filling up again he drank to the happy couple  she’s very strict about drink said mr burton eyeing these proceedings with some severity  any—dibs inquired mr stiles slapping a pocket which failed to ring in response  she’s comfortable replied the other awkwardly got a little stationer’s shop in the town steady oldfashioned business she’s chapel and very strict  just what you want remarked mr stiles placing his glass on the table what d’ye say to a stroll  mr burton assented and having replaced the black bottle in the cupboard led the way along the cliffs toward the town some halfmile distant mr stiles beguiling the way by narrating his adventures since they had last met a certain swagger and richness of deportment were explained by his statement that he had been on the stage  only walking on he said with a shake of his head the only speaking part i ever had was a cough you ought to ha’ heard that cough george  mr burton politely voiced his regrets and watched him anxiously mr stiles shaking his head over a somewhat unsuccessful career was making a beeline for the cock and flowerpot  just for a small soda he explained and once inside changed his mind and had whisky instead mr burton sacrificing principle to friendship had one with him the bar more than fulfilled mr stiles’s ideas as to its cosiness and within the space of ten minutes he was on excellent terms with the regular clients into the little oldworld bar with its loudticking clock its windsorchairs and its cracked jug full of roses he brought a breath of the bustle of the great city and tales of the great cities beyond the seas refreshment was forced upon him and mr burton pleased at his friend’s success shared mildly in his reception it was nine o’clock before they departed and then they only left to please the landlord  nice lot o’ chaps said mr stiles as he stumbled out into the sweet cool air catch hold—o’ my—arm george brace me—up a bit  mr burton complied and his friend reassured as to his footing burst into song in a stentorian voice he sang the latest song from comic opera and then with an adjuration to mr burton to see what he was about and not to let him trip he began in a lumbering fashion to dance  mr burton still propping him up trod a measure with fewer steps and cast uneasy glances up the lonely road on their left the sea broke quietly on the beach below on their right were one or two scattered cottages at the doors of which an occasional figure appeared to gaze in mute astonishment at the proceedings  dance george said mr stiles who found his friend rather an encumbrance  hs’h stop cried the frantic mr burton as he caught sight of a woman’s figure bidding farewell in a lighted doorway  mr stiles replied with a stentorian roar and mr burton clinging despairingly to his jigging friend lest a worse thing should happen cast an imploring glance at mrs dutton as they danced by the evening was still light enough for him to see her face and he piloted the corybantic mr stiles the rest of the way home in a mood which accorded but ill with his steps  his manner at breakfast next morning was so offensive that mr stiles who had risen fresh as a daisy and been out to inhale the air on the cliffs was somewhat offended  you go down and see her he said anxiously don’t lose a moment and explain to her that it was the seaair acting on an old sunstroke  she ain’t a fool said mr burton gloomily  he finished his breakfast in silence and leaving the repentant mr stiles sitting in the doorway with a pipe went down to the widow’s to make the best explanation he could think of on the way mrs dutton’s freshcoloured face changed as he entered the shop and her still good eyes regarded him with scornful interrogation  i—saw you last night began mr burton timidly  i saw you too said mrs dutton i couldn’t believe my eyesight at first  it was an old shipmate of mine said mr burton he hadn’t seen me for years and i suppose the sight of me upset ’im  i dare say replied the widow that and the cock and flowerpot too i heard about it  he would go said the unfortunate  you needn’t have gone was the reply  i ’ad to said mr burton with a gulp he—he’s an old officer o’ mine and it wouldn’t ha’ been discipline for me to refuse  officer repeated mrs dutton  my old admiral said mr burton with a gulp that nearly choked him you’ve heard me speak of admiral peters  admiral gasped the astonished widow  what acarrying on like that  he’s a reg’lar old seadog said mr burton he’s staying with me but of course ’e don’t want it known who he is i couldn’t refuse to ’ave a drink with ’im i was under orders so to speak  no i suppose not said mrs dutton softening fancy him staying with you  he just run down for the night but i expect he’ll be going ’ome in an hour or two said mr burton who saw an excellent reason now for hastening his guest’s departure  mrs dutton’s face fell dear me she murmured i should have liked to have seen him you have told me so much about him if he doesn’t go quite so soon and you would like to bring him here when you come tonight i’m sure i should be very pleased  i’ll mention it to ’im said mr burton marvelling at the change in her manner  didn’t you say once that he was uncle to lord buckfast inquired mrs dutton casually  yes said mr burton with unnecessary doggedness i did  the idea of an admiral staying with you said mrs dutton  reg’lar old seadog said mr burton again and besides he don’t want it known it’s a secret between us three mrs dutton  to be sure said the widow you can tell the admiral that i shall not mention it to a soul she added mincingly  mr burton thanked her and withdrew lest mr stiles should follow him up before apprised of his sudden promotion he found that gentleman however still sitting at the front door smoking serenely  i’ll stay with you for a week or two said mr stiles briskly as soon as the other had told his story it’ll do you a world o’ good to be seen on friendly terms with an admiral and i’ll put in a good word for you  mr burton shook his head no she might find out he said slowly i think that the best thing is for you to go home after dinner joe and just give ’er a look in on the way p’r’aps you could say a lot o’ things about me in ’arf an hour  no george said mr stiles beaming on him kindly when i put my hand to the plough i don’t draw back it’s a good speaking part too an admiral’s i wonder whether i might use old peters’s language  certainly not said mr burton in alarm  you don’t know how particular she is  mr stiles sighed and said that he would do the best he could without it he spent most of the day on the beach smoking and when evening came shaved himself with extreme care and brushed his serge suit with great perseverance in preparation for his visit  mr burton performed the ceremony of introduction with some awkwardness mr stiles was affecting a stateliness of manner which was not without distinction and mrs dutton in a black silk dress and the cameo brooch which had belonged to her mother was no less important mr burton had an odd feeling of inferiority  it’s a very small place to ask you to admiral peters said the widow offering him a chair  it’s comfortable ma’am said mr stiles looking round approvingly ah you should see some of the palaces i’ve been in abroad all show and no comfort not a decent chair in the place and as for the antimacassars——  are you making a long stay admiral peters inquired the delighted widow  it depends was the reply my intention was just to pay a flying visit to my honest old friend burton here—best man in my squadron—but he is so hospitable he’s been pressing me to stay for a few weeks  but the admiral says he must get back tomorrow morning interposed mr burton firmly  unless i have a letter at breakfasttime burton said mr stiles serenely  mr burton favoured him with a mutinous scowl  oh i do hope you will said mrs dutton  i have a feeling that i shall said mr stiles crossing glances with his friend the only thing is my people they want me to join them at lord tufton’s place  mrs dutton trembled with delight at being in the company of a man with such friends what a change shorelife must be to you after the perils of the sea she murmured  ah said mr stiles true true  the dreadful fighting said mrs dutton closing her eyes and shuddering  you get used to it said the hero simply hottest time i had i think was at the bombardment of alexandria i stood alone all the men who hadn’t been shot down had fled and the shells were bursting round me like—like fireworks  the widow clasped her hands and shuddered again  i was standing just behind ’im waiting any orders he might give said mr burton  were you said mr stiles sharply—were you i don’t remember it burton  why said mr burton with a faint laugh i was just behind you sir if you remember sir i said to you that it was pretty hot work  mr stiles affected to consider no burton he said bluffly—no so far as my memory goes i was the only man there  a bit of a shell knocked my cap off sir persisted mr burton making laudable efforts to keep his temper  that’ll do my man said the other sharply not another word you forget yourself  he turned to the widow and began to chat about his people again to divert her attention from mr burton who seemed likely to cause unpleasantness by either bursting a bloodvessel or falling into a fit  my people have heard of burton he said with a slight glance to see how that injured gentleman was progressing he has often shared my dangers we have been in many tight places together do you remember those two nights when we were hidden in the chimney at the palace of the sultan of zanzibar burton  i should think i do said mr burton recovering somewhat  stuck so tight we could hardly breathe continued the other  i shall never forget it as long as i live said mr burton who thought that the other was trying to make amends for his recent indiscretion  oh do tell me about it admiral peters cried mrs dutton  surely burton has told you that said mr stiles  never breathed a word of it said the widow gazing somewhat reproachfully at the discomfited mr burton  well tell it now burton said mr stiles  you tell it better than i do sir said the other  no no said mr stiles whose powers of invention were not always to be relied upon you tell it it’s your story  the widow looked from one to the other it’s your story sir said mr burton  no i won’t tell it said mr stiles it wouldn’t be fair to you burton i’d forgotten that when i spoke of course you were young at the time still——  i done nothing that i’m ashamed of sir said mr burton trembling with passion  i think it’s very hard if i’m not to hear it said mrs dutton with her most fascinating air  mr stiles gave her a significant glance and screwing up his lips nodded in the direction of mr burton  at any rate you were in the chimney with me sir said that unfortunate  ah said the other severely but what was i there for my man  mr burton could not tell him he could only stare at him in a frenzy of passion and dismay  what were you there for admiral peters inquired mrs dutton  i was there ma’am said the unspeakable mr stiles slowly—i was there to save the life of burton i never deserted my men—never whatever scrapes they got into i always did my best to get them out news was brought to me that burton was suffocating in the chimney of the sultan’s favourite wife and i——  sultan’s favourite wife gasped mrs dutton staring hard at mr burton who had collapsed in his chair and was regarding the ingenious mr stiles with openmouthed stupefaction good gracious i—i never heard of such a thing i am surprised  so am i said mr burton thickly i—i—  how did you escape admiral peters inquired the widow turning from the flighty burton in indignation  mr stiles shook his head to tell you that would be to bring the french consul into it he said gently i oughtn’t to have mentioned the subject at all burton had the good sense not to  the widow murmured acquiescence and stole a look at the prosaic figure of the latter gentleman which was full of scornful curiosity with some diffidence she invited the admiral to stay to supper and was obviously delighted when he accepted  in the character of admiral mr stiles enjoyed himself amazingly his one regret being that no discriminating theatrical manager was present to witness his performance his dignity increased as the evening wore on and from goodnatured patronage of the unfortunate burton he progressed gradually until he was shouting at him once when he had occasion to ask mr burton if he intended to contradict him his appearance was so terrible that his hostess turned pale and trembled with excitement  mr burton adopted the air for his own use as soon as they were clear of mrs dutton’s doorstep and in good round terms demanded of mr stiles what he meant by it  it was a difficult part to play george responded his friend we ought to have rehearsed it a bit i did the best i could  best you could stormed mr burton telling lies and ordering me about  i had to play the part without any preparation george said the other firmly you got yourself into the difficulty by saying that i was the admiral in the first place i’ll do better next time we go  mr burton with a nasty scowl said that there was not going to be any next time but mr stiles smiled as one having superior information deaf first to hints and then to requests to seek his pleasure elsewhere he stayed on and mr burton was soon brought to realise the difficulties which beset the path of the untruthful  the very next visit introduced a fresh complication it being evident to the most indifferent spectator that mr stiles and the widow were getting on very friendly terms glances of unmistakable tenderness passed between them and on the occasion of the third visit mr burton sat an amazed and scandalised spectator of a flirtation of the most pronounced description a despairing attempt on his part to lead the conversation into safer and to his mind more becoming channels only increased his discomfiture neither of them took any notice of it and a minute later mr stiles called the widow a saucy little baggage and said that she reminded him of the duchess of marford  i used to think she was the most charming woman in england he said meaningly  mrs dutton simpered and looked down mr stiles moved his chair a little closer to her and then glanced thoughtfully at his friend  burton he said  sir snapped the other  run back and fetch my pipe for me said mr stiles i left it on the mantelpiece  mr burton hesitated and the widow happening to look away shook his fist at his superior officer  look sharp said mr stiles in a peremptory voice  i’m very sorry sir said mr burton whose wits were being sharpened by misfortune but i broke it  broke it repeated the other  yes sir said mr burton i knocked it on the floor and trod on it by accident smashed it to powder  mr stiles rated him roundly for his carelessness and asked him whether he knew that it was a present from the italian ambassador  burton was always a clumsy man he said turning to the widow he had the name for it when he was on the destruction with me ’bungling burton’ they called him  he divided the rest of the evening between flirting and recounting various anecdotes of mr burton none of which were at all flattering either to his intelligence or to his sobriety and the victim after one or two futile attempts at contradiction sat in helpless wrath as he saw the infatuation of the widow they were barely clear of the house before his pentup emotions fell in an avalanche of words on the faithless mr stiles  i can’t help being goodlooking said the latter with a smirk  your good looks wouldn’t hurt anybody said mr burton in a grating voice it’s the admiral business that fetches her it’s turned ’er head  mr stiles smiled she’ll say ’snap’ to my ’snip’ any time he remarked and remember george there’ll always be a knife and fork laid for you when you like to come  i dessay retorted mr burton with a dreadful sneer only as it happens i’m going to tell ’er the truth about you first thing tomorrow morning if i can’t have ’er you sha’n’t  that’ll spoil your chance too said mr stiles she’d never forgive you for fooling her like that it seems a pity neither of us should get her  you’re a sarpent exclaimed mr burton savagely—a sarpent that i’ve warmed in my bosom and——  there’s no call to be indelicate george said mr stiles reprovingly as he paused at the door of the house let’s sit down and talk it over quietly  mr burton followed him into the room and taking a chair waited  it’s evident she’s struck with me said mr stiles slowly it’s also evident that if you tell her the truth it might spoil my chances i don’t say it would but it might that being so i’m agreeable to going back without seeing her again by the sixforty train tomorrow morning if it’s made worth my while  made worth your while repeated the other  certainly said the unblushing mr stiles she’s not a badlooking woman—for her age—and it’s a snug little business  mr burton suppressing his choler affected to ponder if ’arf a sovereign— he said at last  half a fiddlestick said the other impatiently i want ten pounds you’ve just drawn your pension and besides you’ve been a saving man all your life  ten pounds gasped the other d’ye think i’ve got a goldmine in the back garden  mr stiles leaned back in his chair and crossed his feet i don’t go for a penny less he said firmly ten pounds and my ticket back if you call me any more o’ those names i’ll make it twelve  and what am i to explain to mrs dutton demanded mr burton after a quarter of an hour’s altercation  anything you like said his generous friend tell her i’m engaged to my cousin and our marriage keeps being put off and off on account of my eccentric behaviour and you can say that that was caused by a splinter of a shell striking my head tell any lies you like i shall never turn up again to contradict them if she tries to find out things about the admiral remind her that she promised to keep his visit here secret  for over an hour mr burton sat weighing the advantages and disadvantages of this proposal and then—mr stiles refusing to seal the bargain without—shook hands upon it and went off to bed in a state of mind hovering between homicide and lunacy  he was up in good time next morning and returning the shortest possible answers to the remarks of mr stiles who was in excellent feather went with him to the railway station to be certain of his departure  it was a delightful morning cool and bright and despite his misfortunes mr burton’s spirits began to rise as he thought of his approaching deliverance gloom again overtook him at the bookingoffice where the unconscionable mr stiles insisted firmly upon a firstclass ticket  who ever heard of an admiral riding third he demanded indignantly  but they don’t know you’re an admiral urged mr burton trying to humour him  no but i feel like one said mr stiles slapping his pocket i’ve always felt curious to see what it feels like travelling firstclass besides you can tell mrs dutton  i could tell ’er that in any case returned mr burton  mr stiles looked shocked and time pressing mr burton breathing so hard that it impeded his utterance purchased a firstclass ticket and conducted him to the carriage mr stiles took a seat by the window and lolling back put his foot up on the cushions opposite a large bell rang and the carriagedoors were slammed  goodbye george said the traveller putting his head to the window i’ve enjoyed my visit very much  good riddance said mr burton savagely  mr stiles shook his head i’m letting you off easy he said slowly if it hadn’t ha’ been for one little thing i’d have had the widow myself  what little thing demanded the other as the train began to glide slowly out  my wife said mr stiles as a huge smile spread slowly over his face goodbye george and don’t forget to give my love when you go round                                    ————
