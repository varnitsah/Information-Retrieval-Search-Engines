above the city of quebec and thirlwell sitting at one of the tables abstractedly glanced about the spacious room was filled with skilfully tempered light that glimmered on colored glasses and sparkled on silver pillars and cornices were decorated with artistic taste a murmur of careless talk rose from the groups of fashionably dressed women and prosperous men and he heard a girls soft laugh  all this struck a note of refined luxury that was strange to thirlwell who had spent some years in the wilds where the small frostbitten pines roll across the rocks and muskegs of north ontario one lived hard up there enduring arctic cold and the heat of the short summer when bloodthirsty mosquitoes swarm and ran daunting risks on the lonely prospecting trail now it looked as if chance had offered him an easier lot he could apparently choose between the privations of the wilderness and civilized comfort but while he grappled with a certain longing he knew this was not so he had adopted the pioneers spartan code one must stand by ones bargain and do the thing one had undertaken  for a few moments he was silent lost in rather gloomy thought with a frown on his brown face and mrs allott his english relative studied him across the table on the whole jim thirlwell had improved in canada and she thought he would be welcomed if he returned to england she had been his mothers friend and during the week or two they had now spent together had decided that if he proved amenable she would help him to make a career indeed it was largely on thirlwells account she had accompanied her husband on his american tour  jim had certain advantages he was not clever but his remarks were sometimes smarter than he knew then he had a quiet voice and manner that impressed one even when one differed from him as one often did he was not handsome and his face was rather thin but his features were welldefined and she liked his firm mouth and steady look his figure was good and marked by a touch of athletic grace then she was on the whole satisfied with the way he chose and wore his clothes his mother had held a leading place in the exclusive society of a quiet cathedral town until her husband lost his small fortune mrs allott understood that something might have been saved had tom thirlwell been less scrupulous but tom had unconventional views about money and jim was like his father in many ways mrs allott having done her best to enlighten him hoped he would now see where his advantage lay  you are not very talkative jim she said  thirlwell looked up with an apologetic smile but his eyes rested on the girl by mrs allotts side evelyn grant was young and attractive but there was something tame about her beauty that harmonized with her character thirlwell had not always recognized this indeed when they were younger he had indulged a romantic tenderness for the girl this however was long since and the renewal of their friendship in canada left him cold evelyn was gracious and he sometimes thought she had not forgotten his youthful admiration but she did not feel things much and he suspected that she had acquiesced in mrs allotts rather obvious plot because she was too indolent to object for all that he imagined that if he took a bold line she would not repulse him and by comparison with his poverty evelyn was rich then he banished the thought with an unconscious frown  oh well i suppose its our last evening together and one feels melancholy about that he said  but i thought you were coming to new york with us mrs allott objected  evelyn was talking animatedly to a young american but looked round with languid carelessness  are you really not coming jim she asked  then without waiting for thirlwells answer she resumed her talk and mrs allott wondered whether the girl had not overdone her part after all she must have known why she had been brought  i think not said thirlwell very sorry of course but theres only a week of my holiday left and i have some business in south ontario then i must go back to the bush  thats ridiculous jim mrs allott rejoined you know you neednt go back to the bush at all besides we hoped you had decided to come to england she paused and touched evelyn do you hear what he says cant you persuade him to be sensible  evelyn turned and looked at thirlwell with a careless smile she was very composed but mrs allott thought she noted a trace of heightened color  oh no it would be useless for me to try nobody could persuade jim to do what he does not want  arent you taking something for granted asked allott who sat with the others but had been silent jim hasnt admitted that he doesnt want to come  the girl gave thirlwell a tranquil glance in which there was a hint of mockery  he has only a week left and i imagine knows better than we do what will please him best she replied and turned to her companion  what have you to say to that allott asked thirlwell with a twinkle  it looks as if evelyn knew my characteri suppose i am obstinate but i dont think she has stated the case correctly it isnt that i dont want to come unfortunately i cant  the other guests were leaving the tables and mrs allott getting up gave her husband a meaning glance  then i must let stephen talk to you you may listen to his arguments i have exhausted mine  you could not expect me to succeed where you have failed allott remarked and touched thirlwell as mrs allott and evelyn went away shall we go upstairs for a smoke  a lift took them up and allott lighted a cigarette when they entered an unoccupied room the evening was hot and thirlwell sat on the ledge of the open window and looked out upon the river across the climbing town church spires the steep roofs of old houses and the flat tops of modern blocks rose in the moonlight through a thin gray haze of smoke lower down a track of glittering silver ran across to the shadowy levis ridge along the crest of which were scattered twinkling lights presently allott who was well preserved and rather fat turned to thirlwell  i hope you wont be rash jim and throw away the best chance you may ever get  you mean sir jamess offer of the post with the big engineering firm  i mean that and other things said allott dryly perhaps i have spoken plainly enough you are not a fool  thanks i dont claim much wisdom and i am sometimes rash but perhaps we had better stick to sir jamess offer why does he make it now after standing off when i needed help some years since  well take the offer first allott agreed sir james had not been knighted and pulled off the big business combine then he hadnt as much influence and perhaps wanted to see what you could do i expect he was surprised when you got and kept the mining job in canada anyhow youre his namesake and nearest relative my wife you know comes next  he left my father alone in his trouble said thirlwell grimly i wonder why they gave him his title there were things done when the combine was made the shareholders didnt know besides injustices to the staffs you see i had friends  what has that to do with you he offers you a good post with a hint about favors to come  the post is good thirlwell agreed with a thoughtful look in a way id have been glad to take it but i cant very well  your engagement at the little wildcat mine is an obstacle after all there are other engineers in canada i dont suppose your employers would suffer much inconvenience if you gave up the job  theres a year yet to go besides an understanding that id stay until we got down to the deep vein  for very small pay much less than youre now offered and with no prospects  my employers are straight people and pay me as much as they can afford they treat me well though theyre a small firm and the mine is not prospering in fact i expect theyll have some trouble to hold out until we reach good ore  the risk of their not holding out is rather a curious argument for your staying  thirlwell was silent for a few moments and his face was hard when he resumed i know something about the combines methodsmasters whos still with one of the companies sir james bought up writes to me i suppose one mustnt be too fastidious but there are things the man who takes the post im offered will be expected to do things i havent done yet and mean to leave alone you have often to throw your scruples overboard when you pay big dividends  allott chuckled the combine does not pay big dividends its a grievance of the shareholders  oh well sir james was knighted and i hear about another director building a hospital one doesnt get honors for nothing theyre expensive  jim said allott reproachfully youre talking like your father and while airing ones views may be harmless trying to live up to them doesnt always pay taking that line cost him much i thought you wiser  thirlwell colored my father was an honest man if i can live as he did i shall be satisfied  well for some reason sir james is keen about bringing you back and if you state the terms on which youll come i imagine hell agree this should make things easier and i believe hell be responsible if you pay your employers a fine to let you off  thirlwell was silent and looked out of the window the hum of traffic came up from the dark gaps between the buildings and he heard a locomotive bell and the clash of freightcars by the wharf then the hoot of a deep whistle rang across the town and red and white flashes pierced the darkness down the river a big liner signaling her tug was coming up stream and presently her long hull was marked by lights that rose in tiers above the water he watched her as she swung in to the wharf with her load of cheering immigrants  it reminded him of his landing in canada and he looked back upon the disappointments and hardships he had borne in the country he had soon found there was no easy road to wealth and life had so far been an arduous struggle he had known poverty hunger and stinging cold and now his pay left little over when he had satisfied his frugal needs all would be different if he went back to england and he pondered over allotts specious arguments there was no reason he should not take the offered post if he could do so on his terms and it was possible that his employers would release him he was thirty years of age had long practised selfdenial and would soon get old why should he not enjoy some prosperity before it was too late allott had said enough but did not know this and had not finished yet  theres another matter jim he resumed you cant think about marrying while you stay in the bush  i dont know that i want to marry i couldnt support a wife  why not if you chose a wife with money  then shed have to support me besides i expect it would be hard to find a rich girl willing to marry a poor engineer  allott made a sign of impatience lets be frank the matters delicate and perhaps requires a lighter touch than mine but i understand that helen has given you a hint  she has said thirlwell with some grimness i hoped youd both let the thing go when she saw my attitude  well let it go after the next few minutes if you like but there is something to be said evelyn is an attractive girl and has some money besides which sir james would approve her marrying you he has hinted that hell give you a chance of making your mark in england if he is satisfied evelyns relations know this and it was significant that they agreed when helen invited her to join us as the girl consented i might perhaps go farther  thirlwell stopped him why is sir james anxious to help me  we can only guess perhaps he feels you have a claim and he has neglected you then he may think you will do him credit and realize the ambitions hes getting too old to carry out he has noted that you have inherited your fathers character and ive heard him remark that while tom thirlwell had extravagant notions he certainly had brains however we were talking about evelyn  thirlwell exercising some selfcontrol lighted a cigarette and gave allott a steady look  then well finish the talk evelyn is a charming girl amiable pretty tranquil but theres no ground for believing she has contemplated marrying me  suppose we admit thats possible said allott with a meaning smile i imagine because i know you both that if you were firm enough you could so to speak carry her away since you own that shes charming why dont you try  if you are curious you can take it that sir jamess gratuitous approval is an obstacle i shall not marry to please him or let him plan my career i mean to stand on my own feet and not be ruled by a greedy old mans caprices now you understand this well say no more about the thing  allott shrugged very well ive done my best and since you mean to take your own line wish you success perhaps we had better go downstairs  evelyn was talking to the young american when they crossed the big hall and she smiled as they passed but an hour later thirlwell saw her alone she beckoned him carelessly and indicated a place near her in a corner seat  so allott has not persuaded you to come with us she remarked  no said thirlwell very sorry but there are matters i cant neglect  we shall miss you she said with a side glance i suppose you are not coming to england afterwards  im afraid not thirlwell answered  then to his surprise she gave him a rather curious smile from the beginning i didnt think you would come  ah said thirlwell still i dont see why  that doesnt matter she answered calmly after all i dare say its better in many ways that you should stay in canada and i wish you luck she paused a moment and resumed i want you to feel that i do wish it but mrs allott is waiting for me we shall no doubt see you before we start  she left him puzzled but relieved next morning he stood on the platform of the grand trunk station and evelyn leaning on the rails of a vestibule smiled and waved her hand as the train rolled away     chapter ii  stranges story   after allotts departure thirlwell went to montreal and spent two depressing days transacting some business for his employers quebec was quiet and picturesque and a cool refreshing breeze blew up the river from the laurentian wilds but montreal shut in by the wooded mountain sweltered in humid heat then the streets were being torn up to lay electric mains and sand and cement blew about from halffinished concrete buildings thirlwell did not like large cities and after the silence of the bush the bustle of the traffic jarred  he had however better grounds for feeling depressed his employers trusted him and actuated by loyalty as well as professional pride he had resolved to make their rather daring venture a success now this looked difficult money was scarce and he found credit strangely hard to get the mining speculators he called upon received him coldly and although he had a warmer welcome from the manufacturers of giantpowder and rockboring machines they demanded prompt payment for their goods when thirlwell stated that this was impossible they told him to come again  it was known that there was silver in the rocks that run back into the northwest territories but nobody had found ore that would pay for refining the rich strike in ontario had not been made yet and the prospectors who pushed into the forests with drill and dynamite were regarded as rash enthusiasts bankers were cautious and declined to accept rusty mining plant and a shaft in the wilderness as good security  on the evening before he left montreal thirlwell sat in the hall of his hotel listening to the clanging streetcars and the rattle of the grand trunk trains poisoned flies dropped upon the tables and an electric fan made an unpleasant whirring as it churned the humid air had his mood been normal the heat and noise would not have disturbed thirlwell but now they jarred  his visit had been a failure and his employers must develop the mine without the help of the latest machines he doubted if they could finance the undertaking until they struck the vein then it looked as if he had been rash to reject sir jamess offer he had thrown away a chance of winning prosperity and perhaps fame in england for he knew he had some talent and he was ambitious instead he had chosen exhausting labor and stern selfdenial in the wilds the life had some compensations but they were not very obvious then it was however too late for regrets he had chosen and must be content and putting down the newspaper he was trying to read he went to bed  two days later he sat in the garden of a new summer hotel on the shore of lake huron a pine forest rolled down to the water past the pretty wooden building and the air in the shade was cool and sweet with resinous smells the lake glittered smooth as glass in the hot sun but here and there a wandering breeze traced a darkblue line across the placid surface along the beach the shadows of the pines floated motionless  thirlwell smoked and meditated on the errand that had brought him to the hotel the clerk had told him that miss strange was on the beach but he had not seen her yet and felt some curiosity about the girl whom he had arranged to meet they had corresponded and he had brought a photograph he thought she would like to see but on the whole he would sooner she had not asked for the interview she might find it painful to hear the story he had to tell and the thing would require some tact more perhaps than he had  in the meantime he wondered what she was like her letters indicated a cultivated mind and he knew she had a post at a toronto school but one could not expect much from the daughter of the brokendown prospector he had met in the north strange had worked spasmodically at the mine where he was employed because labor was scarce he was not a good workman and when he had earned a small sum generally bought provisions and went off into the bush to relocate a silver lode he claimed to have found when he was young he came back ragged and disappointed and when liquor could be got indulged freely before he resumed his work  nobody believed his tale stranges lode was something of a joke the miners called him a crank and thirlwell had doubted if he was quite sane but he persisted in his search and sometimes black steve driscoll went north with him it was suspected that driscoll made an unlawful profit by selling the indians liquor which perhaps accounted for his journeys with strange as they returned from the last expedition their canoe capsized in a rapid near the mining camp and although driscoll reached land exhausted stranges body was never found thirlwell knew his daughters address and sent her news of the accident which led to an exchange of letters now he would shortly see her give her the particulars she wanted and then their acquaintance would end although he liked the hotel and might stay for a few days fishing  his pipe went out and he was half asleep when a girl crossed the lawn she came nearer as if to avoid the glistening showers the nickeled sprinklers threw upon the thirsty grass and thirlwell watched her drowsily noting her light wellbalanced movements and the grace of her tall figure she wore a big white hat and a thin summer dress that he thought was very artistically made there was something aristocratic about her and he imagined she belonged to a party that had landed from a fine steam yacht then he noted with some surprise that she was coming to him  she stopped and thirlwell got up imagining that she had made a mistake her face like her figure hinted at strength tempered by proud selfcontrol she had brown hair with a ruddy tint that caught the light gray eyes that met his with a calm inquiring glance and firm red lips thirlwell was not a critic of female beauty but he saw that she had dignity and charm in the meantime he wondered what she wanted  mr thirlwell i suppose she said  he bowed and she resumed then i must thank you for coming here to meet me i am agatha strange  it cost thirlwell an effort to hide his surprise indeed he wondered with some embarrassment whether he had succeeded for this was not the kind of girl he had expected to meet  it was not much out of my way and i wanted to see the lake he replied as he brought a chair  she thanked him and sitting down was silent for a few moments while she gazed across the lawn some of the guests were sitting in the shadow by the waters edge their summer clothes making blotches of bright color among the gray rocks out on the lake a young man knelt in the stern of a canoe swinging a paddle that flashed in the sun while a girl trailed her hand in the sparkling water as the craft passed the landing she began to sing no breath of wind ruffled the surface now and the dark pinesprays were still a drowsy quietness brooded over the tranquil scene  it is very beautiful she said slowly different one imagines from the rugged north  very different thirlwell agreed and took out a photograph you will see that by the picture i promised to bring  agatha took the photograph it showed a broad stretch of sullen water with a strip of forest on the other side the pines were ragged and stunted and some leaned across each other while the gloomy sky was smeared by the smoke of a forestfire in the foreground angry waves broke in foaming turmoil among halfcovered rocks no soft beauty marked the river of the north and the land it flowed through looked forbidding and desolate  the shadow river said thirlwell you can see the grand rapid i have marked a cross where the canoe upset  agatha said nothing for a few moments and thirlwell was relieved he saw she felt keenly but she was calm in the meantime he waited one learns to wait in the north  thank you i would like to keep the picture she said by and by and gave him a level glance i suppose you knew my father well  i knew him in a way thirlwell answered cautiously because he did not want to talk about stranges habits perhaps the girl knew her fathers weakness and if not it was better that she should think well of him yet thirlwell imagined she understood something of his reserve  ah she said you knew him in the bush but not when he lived at home with us i should like to tell you his story  not if it is painful  it is painful but i would sooner you heard it she replied for one thing you have been kind she paused and when she resumed there was a faint sparkle in her eyes i want you to understand my father he was my hero  thirlwell made a vague gesture he had seen strange half drunk reeling along the trail to the mine but this did not lessen his sympathy for the girl he hoped she had taken his sign to imply that he was willing to listen  to begin with do you believe in the silver lode she asked  one disbelieves in nothing up yonder thirlwell tactfully replied its a country of surprises you dont know what you may find besides there is some silverim now sinking a shaft  agatha smiled and he saw she had the gift of humor the smile softened her firm lips and lighted her eyes  i imagine you are cautious in fact you are rather like the picture i made of you after reading your letters  thirlwell felt embarrassed and said nothing as was his prudent rule when his thoughts were not clear  my father found the ore many years since when he was employed by the hudsons bay company she resumed the factory was in the territories three or four hundred miles north of your mine and the agent sent him out with a dogtrain and two indians to collect some furs they had to make a long journey and were coming back short of food when they camped one evening beside a frozen creek the water had worn away the face of a small cliff and the frost had recently split off a large slab that left the strata cleanly exposed and my father noticed that near the foot of the rock there was a differentcolored band they were making camp in the snow then but he went back afterwards when the moon rose and the indians were asleep and broke off a number of bits the stones were unusually heavy doesnt that mean something  silver has a high specific gravity so has lead sometimes one finds them combined  i have a piece here said agatha taking out a small packet my father gave it me when i was a child and i brought it thinking i might perhaps show it to you  thirlwell examining the specimen missed something of her meaning and did not see that her decision to show him the ore was a compliment he looked honest and strangers often trusted him his friends had never known him abuse their confidence  yes he said at length i think its silver traces of lead and perhaps copper too you seldom find silver pure but wont you go on with the tale  the partys food was getting short that meant they would starve if they did not reach the factory soon and they set off again at dawn there was no time to prospect and deep snow covered the ground but my father made what he called a mental photograph of the spot it was a little hollow among the rocks with a willow grove by the creek and in the middle there were two or three burned pines if you drew a line through them it pointed nearly north and where it touched the cliff you turned east about twenty yards  arent you rash to tell me this thirlwell asked  agatha smiled on the whole i think not but nothing i could tell would be of much use to you my father although he had been there could not find the spot again  she paused a moment and then went on when they reached the factory he showed the specimens to the agent who said they were worthless and laughed at him but it was perhaps significant that he was not sent that way again one understands that the hudsons bay directors were jealous of their game preserves  furs paid better than silver thirlwell agreed they didnt want miners with dynamite and noisy machines to invade the solitudes and frighten the wild animals away  my father going south on a holiday met my mother and gave up his post when they were married she had a little money enough to open a small store and for her sake he started business in a new wooden town he did not like the towns and i know when i got older that he often longed for the wild north but although the place grew and the business prospered he could not spare the time and money to look for the lode he wanted to give my brother a good education and start him well and after a time i was sent to a university  that explains something thirlwell remarked and then pulling himself up added if you take proper appliances a prospecting expedition costs much but did your father often talk about the lode  no not unless it was to me  but why did he tell you and not your brother  george was very practical i was romantic and my father something of a dreamer we lived happily at home but i felt that he needed sympathy that he did not get i think now my mother knew he longed for the north and was afraid the longing might grow too strong and draw him back when he did speak of the silver she smiled i suppose when you have known the wilderness its charm is strong  she stopped and her face was gravely thoughtful as she looked across the shining water towards the faint blur of a pine forest on a distant point and thirlwell felt as if they had been suddenly united by a bond of understanding  yes he said its a stern country and one has much to bear but it calls one fears the hardships cold and dangerbut one goes  agatha looked up quietly but he noted the gleam in her eyes  you know well you can imagine what it cost my father to resist the call but he did resist for many years he loved my mother but i think he hated the growing town then there was the dream of riches that might be his he was not greedy and my brother did not need money george had a talent for business and his employers soon promoted him but i was fond of science and it was my fathers ambition that i should make independent researches and not be forced to work for pay  she hesitated and then went on perhaps i am boring you but i wanted you to understand what his duty must have cost you see you only knew him in the bush and after he went back i noted a difference in his letters they were sometimes strange he seemed to be hiding things i think he felt the disappointment keenly and lost heart  thirlwell saw she suspected something and replied disappointment is often numbing but your father never lost his faith in the lode  nor have i lost mine said agatha but we will not talk about that yet he brought us up and started us well then my mother died and nobody had any further claim on him his duty was done and though he was getting old he went back to the north well i have told you part of his story and you know the rest  it is a moving tale said thirlwell with quiet sympathy  he thought she felt it was necessary to defend her father and she had done so indeed he admitted that one must respect the man who had with uncomplaining patience for years carried on his disliked task for his wife and childrens sake longing for the woods and the silent trail strange must have found it irksome to count dollar bills and weigh groceries in the store but he had done his duty and borne hardship and failure when at last freedom came still the girl must not know what he had become  agatha asked him a number of questions and then got up thank you she said i will take the photograph and would like you to keep the specimen of ore  i will keep it but i wonder why you wish to give it me  she smiled i believe in the lode and would like you to believe in it too you are a mining engineer and can find out if there is much silver in the stone  then she crossed the lawn to the hotel veranda and left thirlwell thoughtful     chapter iii  agatha makes a promise   next morning thirlwell wrote to his employers stating that he meant to take another weeks holiday and smiled as he reflected that the letter would arrive too late for them to refuse the hotel was comfortable he had met one or two interesting people and was told the fishing was good besides he thought he would not be badly needed at the mine just then for all that he was not quite persuaded that these were sufficient reasons for neglecting his work and when he went through the hall with the letter in his hand he put it into his pocket instead of the box he would think over the matter again before the mail went out then as he crossed the veranda agatha came up from the beach and gave him a smile  you are out early thirlwell remarked  i like the morning freshness and have been on the lake  it looks as if you had hurt yourself said thirlwell noting a small wet handkerchief twisted round her hand  agatha laughed not seriously i blistered my fingers trying to paddle i have been practising since i came but it is difficult to keep the canoe straight when you are alone  thats so thirlwell agreed the backfeathering stroke is hard to learn  for all that i mean to learn it before i go  perhaps i could teach it you how long have you got  a fortnight she said moving on and when she left him thirlwell went to the mailbox and dropped in his letter  afterwards he felt annoyed that he had done so and wondered whether he had weakly given way to a romantic impulse but next morning he went down to the beach and found the girl launching a canoe making her sit near the middle he knelt in the stern and drove the canoe across the shining water with vigorous strokes agatha wore a white jersey and had left her hat and he noted the color the cool wind brought to her face and how the light sparkled on her hair  by and by they skirted a rocky island where resinous smells drifted across the water and the reflections of tall pines wavered round the canoe until he ran the craft on a shingle point and they changed places agatha took the singlebladed paddle and although her hands were sore made some progress while he instructed her after a time she stopped and let the canoe drift in the hot sunshine  i think youd soon make a good voyageur thirlwell remarked for one thing youre determined i saw you wince once or twice and imagine the paddlehaft hurt  i must learn to use the pole yet and mean to try it in the river by and by you must pole i think when you go up a fast stream  that is so when you cant use the tracking line but i dont see why you are anxious to learn  i have an object agatha answered with a smile  then why dont you practise canoeing at toronto  the trouble is that i havent time you see i teach all day  but you have holidays and the evenings  my evenings are occupied by study  i dont know if its wise to overwork yourself for the advantage of your pupils thirlwell remarked at one time i was very keen about my profession but soon found it a mistake to tire my brain for my employers benefit but what do you study  science chemistry and geology but not in order to teach the girls  well i suppose knowledge is worth getting for its own sake anyhow i thought so but you learn when you undertake rude mining that the main thing is to be able to make a practical use of what you know in fact thats often better than knowing much  perhaps so agatha agreed some day i hope to make a good use of what i have learned  about canoeing or geology  about both said agatha now however i think well make for the landing breakfast will be ready soon  thirlwell saw no more of her during the day but she came down to the beach in the evening and he gave her another lesson as they paddled home he thought she looked tired and asked where have you been since morning  agatha indicated a ridge of high ground with a few pines on its summit that rose indistinctly at some distance across the shadowy forest  i took my lunch with me and went up there  but it must be a two or three hours walk is there a trail  a loggers trail its partly grown up and broke off altogether when i got near the rocks after that i had a rough scramble but i like the woods and try to walk as much as possible in my holidays  well no doubt walking is good for one but dont the girls in toronto prefer the street cars  i dont go long walks for healths sake agatha answered with a smile but i think some people i know are waiting can you paddle faster  the canoes bows lifted out of a wisp of foam as thirlwell swung the paddle and in a few minutes he helped the girl to land after this their acquaintance ripened fast and agatha went fishing with him on the lake and by disused logging trails long distances into the shadowy bush thirlwell imagined she knew this excited some remark but he saw there was an imperious vein in the girl who did what she thought fit without heeding conventions besides no touch of sentiment marked their friendship she accepted him as a comrade who could teach her something about lake and forest and he was satisfied with this  yet he was puzzled it was strange that an attractive girl should wish to learn something of the bushmans skill but she obviously meant to do so although it often cost her an effort to follow him she would not let him turn back when they came to an angry rapid or a belt of tangled woods she certainly had charm besides having pluck because when she did not go fishing young women as well as young men gathered round her on the shady lawn it was hard to imagine why a girl like this should practise walking long distances and combine the study of canoeing with geology  the fortnight slipped by and on the last evening thirlwell took agatha out upon the lake they were later than usual and as they stole across the glassy water the pines on a western headland cut black and sharp against an orange glow to the east a faint track of silver ran back into the blue distance under the moon it was very quiet except for the splash of the paddle and ripple at the bows but somewhere in the shadows a loon was calling by and by the lights of the hotel faded and they were alone in the dusk  thirlwell put down the paddle and lighted a cigarette he had drawn nearer the girl in the last week a curious feeling of confidence and liking united them but he was not her lover and knew that if he drifted into philandering she would be repelled perhaps this was unusual but she was different from other girls thirlwell could not tell how she differed but he was satisfied that she did and let the matter go  you start for the mine tomorrow dont you she asked presently  yes he said its my last evening on the lake theres something melancholy about the end of a holiday but i dont think i have felt it as much before  agatha gave him a calm glance and saw he had not meant her to read a sentimental meaning in his admission it was unconscious flattery and she was pleased  i can understand one values the days of liberty when they are gone but do you feel daunted by the thought of the work and hardship that waits you in the north  not in a way now and then you shrink from the arctic winter but in summer in spite of the mosquitoes the bush gets hold of you sometimes you hate the solitude but when you leave it you long to return  ah said agatha i have not seen the wilderness but next summer i hope to make an exploring trip  but where  to the shadow river and on into the territories she answered quietly thirlwell looked hard at her and she smiled yes if things go well with me i mean to look for the silver ore  now i begin to understand this is why you wanted to learn to manage a canoe and train yourself to walking through the bush but its a ridiculous undertaking your father who found it could not locate the ore again  i may be luckier luck counts for something when you go prospecting doesnt it  success in prospecting is often due to luck thirlwell admitted but its a very rough country where no food can be got you will need canoes tools and tents and two or three good packers to carry the outfit across the divides this would be expensive then i doubt if you are strong enough to bear the strain i imagine very few women could do so without breaking down  you have seen how i have tried to harden myself but i have made other preparations its some time since i resolved to go and every month i put by a little money by next summer i ought to have enough  i wonder whether you found it easy to save  i did not said agatha smiling sometimes it was very hard i should not have taken this holiday only that i wanted to get used to the lakes and woods i am grateful for all you have taught me  a thought that pleased him took shape in thirlwells brain but he used some restraint he must not encourage the girl in what he imagined was folly  the chance of your finding the vein is very small and theres another thing you have told me your fathers story and i have met men like him in the woods who had wasted their money and lost their health following an illusion the lode so to speak haunted him and made him restless when he might have been content at home and then drove him into the wilds when he was old its dangerous to give oneself up to a fixed idea and you mustnt let the infatuation get hold of you it will bring you disappointment and trouble  the warnings too late said agatha in a curious quiet voice the infatuation has got hold of me but one must follow ones bent and life is tame if one does nothing that is not prudent and safe besides romantic dreams sometimes come true  not often said thirlwell dryly but why do you really want to go  the silver is mine my father gave it me it looked as if my brother would prosper without his help and i think he loved me best perhaps this was because i believed in the vein  thirlwell shook his head i cannot think you greedy  then said agatha with a flush of color if you must have the truth i feel i must finish my fathers work his son and his best friends thought him the victim of his imagination and the lode a joke but if i succeed his dreams will be justified  thirlwell said nothing for a minute or two he saw that she was resolute and was moved by her staunch loyalty after all stranges story was not uncommon thirlwell had known men leave work and home to follow an elusive clue to mineral treasure in the barren solitudes some had come back broken in fortune and courage and some had not come back at all then while he mused the harsh cry of the loon rang through the dark it fired his blood and unconsciously he fixed his eyes on the north for in summer the birds of the lakes and rivers push on towards the pole he had done his duty and tried to persuade the girl but after all she was stronger and finer than strange it was possible that she might succeed and he could help  when you go i hope you will let me come he said we have the tools and outfit one needs for prospecting at the mine and i could get the packers and canoes  but you dont believe i shall find the lode why do you want to come  i know the bush thirlwell answered with a smile so far ive been prudent and stuck to my job but ive felt the pull of the lone trail like other men in fact id rather like to do something rash for a change  have you never done anything rash  only once i think it needed all my pluck but the curious thing is that its now turning out better than i hoped  agatha pondered and then looked up it would be an advantage to have somebody i could trust to look after the packers and canoes but the journey must be made at my cost i couldnt let another undertake my duty  then i may come its a promise  yes said agatha quietly when i am ready i will let you know now however we must get back to the hotel  thirlwell dipped the paddle the canoe lurched and her bow rose at his next vigorous stroke the ripples she threw off widened into a fanshaped wake that trailed away and was lost in a glitter of moonlight the black pines on the point rose higher resinous smells came out of the dark and presently a row of lights twinkled ahead thirlwell ran the canoe alongside the landing and when they reached the veranda agatha gave him her hand  you start early i think she said i have much to thank you for and am glad we have met  he let her go and afterwards leaned against the rails she had made him a promise and when they next met it would be beside a river of the north but this was twelve months ahead he felt it was a long time to wait     chapter iv  stranges partner   the days work was over and thirlwell and his employer sat smoking and talking in their shack at the clermont mine scott was young and had once been fastidious but like thirlwell he wore workstained overalls for a time when they first came up both had clung to a few of the refinements of civilization but their grasp on these had slackened and now they frankly admitted that it was too much of an effort to change their clothes when they were tired  the shack was built of pine logs notched where they crossed at the corners and the seams were caulked with clay and moss a big stove now empty stood at one end its pipe running obliquely across the room before it pierced the iron roof so as to radiate as much heat as possible plans drawing instruments and some books on mining occupied a shelf on the wall guns fishing rods and surveying tools a corner and a plain uncovered table the middle of the room besides this there were two or three cheap folding chairs  the door and window were open although the mosquitoes were numerous and the roar of the shadow river and a smell of wood smoke came in when he looked out thirlwell could see the ragged tops of the stunted pines cut against a palegreen glow by and by scott knocked out his pipe and stretched his legs there was another partner but he only visited the mine at intervals and had left it while thirlwell was away  brinsmead has gone to nevada and probably wont come back scott remarked he has a plausible manner but seems to have done no better in new york than you did in montreal it looks as if machinery agents are very shy about giving credit to the owners of halfdeveloped mines anyhow when he heard of a field for his talents in a western town he didnt hesitate now he tells me that he finds the prospect of earning some money instead of spending it a refreshing change  its lucky he didnt take his capital out of the clermont thirlwell replied  scott laughed he couldnt take it out nobody would buy his share and my fortunes represented by a shaft in danger of flooding and some cheap and antiquated boring plant in fact if we dont strike paydirt soon the clermont will go broke and i imagine thats why brinsmead skipped after floating one or two small mines successfully he has some reputation to lose while im of course not an engineer or a business man he paused and looked hard at thirlwell id like you to stay and see me through but wouldnt blame you if you quit  my reputation is not worth much and can be risked besides i imagine well get down to the deep vein before the funds run out  i hope so youre not a quitter and well hold on while we can but i think well talk about something else well ive examined the specimen of ore you brought back it looks like highgrade stuff and certainly carries enough metal to pay for smelting  what do you think about stranges tale  scott knitted his brows i did think the man a drunken crank and the lode an illusion that had grown on him by degrees until he really believed in the ore when you get the tanking habit such things happen one specimen certainly doesnt prove very much but since strange gave it to his daughter a long time before we knew him im willing to revise my judgment  miss strange is persuaded that he did find the lode she tells me he led a very industrious and sober life at home  its rather curious you met the girl scott observed  i dont think so when we found her address among the truck strange had left with the foreman it was the proper thing for me to tell her he was drowned this led to another letter or two and when i said i was going to montreal she asked me to meet her  is she like strange  not at all thirlwell declared in fact although her letters ought to have prepared me i got something of a surprise she was not the kind of girl i had expected to meet i understand she teaches at a toronto school  she must have some talent to get a post there scott remarked when he had asked the name of the school then he paused and vaguely indicated the north well its a romantic story nobody knows yet what there is in the rocks up yonder but we have heard of other prospectors striking paydirt and making nothing of their discovery rumors about mysterious lodes are common in a mineral belt and while theyre often imaginative my notion is that now and then theres some fact behind the fiction furtraders in alaska heard such tales long before the klondyke strike  he stopped for there were steps outside and thirlwell leaning forward saw a man come up the trail the fellow had a dark sullen face and wore an old gray shirt and ragged overalls he walked with a slight limp in consequence of getting his foot frostbitten on a winter journey but he was an expert trapper and had penetrated far into the wilds when skins were scarce he worked at the mine but generally left his employment after a drunken bout  i wonder whether driscoll believes in stranges lode scott resumed as the man went by he knew him better than anybody else they went north together once or twice and had been away some time when strange was drowned coming back  strange wouldnt tell black steve where he thought the lode was thirlwell objected i understand they only kept together until they had portaged their outfit across the divide  strange would leave a trail a trapper could follow then i dont see why steve stops here instead of locating on better hunting ground it looks as if he didnt want to leave the shadow  i dont see how stopping here would help him to find the lode said thirlwell who went to the door  it was getting dark and except for the turmoil of the river the bush was very still the green behind the pines had faded and they rose against the sky indistinctly in smears of shadowy blue they had neither height nor beauty but straggled back battered and stunted by the winds among the rocks until they faded from sight there was not much to attract a white man in the desolation of tangled bush but as he glanced across it looking to the north a hint of mystery in its silence appealed to thirlwell he felt that the wilderness challenged him to find a clue to the treasure it hid then he reflected with a smile that it was taking much for granted to admit that there was treasure there and he went back into the shack and lighted the lamp  a week later he went up the river bank one evening with a fishing rod and stopped at dusk at the tail of the grand rapid he had gone farther than he meant and was tired after scrambling across slippery rocks and among the driftwood that lay about the bank there was however a shorter way back and lighting his pipe he sat down upon the gravel and looked about  the sun had set some time since but the light would not quite die out until just before the dawn and the pines across the river rose against the green sky in a dark brokentopped wall near his feet the bleached skeletons of trees ground by floods and ice glimmered a livid white and beyond them the rapid frothed and roared in angry turmoil the river had shrunk now the melted snow had flowed away and rocks one seldom saw lifted their black tops above the racing foam inshore of the main rush smoothworn ledges ran in and out among shallow pools a short distance ahead the bush rolled down to the waters edge in a dark mass that threw back in confused echoes the din the river made  by and by the mosquitoes that had followed thirlwell got more numerous and when in spite of the smoke they settled upon his face and neck he reeled up his line ready to start as he did so he thought he saw something move where the forest ran down to the river the object was indistinct but it looked like a man walking cautiously upon a ledge between the pools and thirlwell wondered what the fellow was doing there the big gray trout had stopped rising there were no indians about and the miners had not left the camp  thirlwell waited until the man moved out from the gloom of the trees his figure was now distinct against the foam of the rapid and he stooped as if he were looking down into a pool then he moved on and thirlwell noting that he would soon pass in front of a dark rock resolved to change his place in order to watch him better getting up he went down to the waters edge but came to a tangle of white branches that the river had thrown up as he stopped he saw the man plainly but when he looked up after scrambling over the driftwood there was nobody about  this was strange and excited his curiosity the others figure would probably be invisible against the rock but he must have moved rapidly to get in front of it then thirlwell saw that where he stood the bush was no longer behind him he had the inshore eddies for a background and the water reflected a faint light there was no obvious reason why the other should be alarmed and try to steal away but it looked as if he had done so  thirlwell sat down among the driftwood and waited but saw no more of the man and then going back quietly turned into a trail that led to the mine the trail was rough and narrow in places short brush had sprung up and there were patches of outcropping rock it would be difficult for anybody to follow it without making some noise but although he stopped and listened no sound came out of the gloom  he went on pondering the matter with some curiosity since the miners were in camp he imagined the man he had seen was driscoll who lived alone in a log shack near the bank but if this were so what was driscolls object for wading among the reefs and why had he stolen away when he thought he was watched thirlwell could not solve the puzzle but he could find out if the fellow were driscoll or not because the trail passed his shack  he walked faster making as little noise as possible and by and by reached a belt of thinner forest he passed a fallen pine from which he knew the shack was visible in daylight and resolved to see if driscoll was at home if not thirlwell thought it would be safe to conclude that he had seen him among the reefs a few moments later a light flashed among the trees flickered once or twice and then burned steadily thirlwell knew it came from the window of the shack but it was curious that driscoll had lighted his lamp in summer miners and prospectors went to bed at sunset and driscoll read no books or newspapers besides if he wanted a light why had he not got it before it however looked as if the man had not been at the rapid and when thirlwell passed the shack he saw his dark figure at the door  whos that he asked and when thirlwell answered added watch out as you go down the gulch theres a rampike across the trail  when thirlwell came to the burned pine he stopped abruptly as a thought struck him driscolls voice had sounded breathless perhaps the fellow had overdone his part it might have been wiser for him to be silent driscoll often went fishing and knew the river well now the water was low he could have saved some distance by crossing the uncovered reefs instead of scrambling along the curved bank besides he had had a few minutes start after all he might have been at the rapid and have hurried back in order to deceive the man who had disturbed him moreover he had learned who the man was  this however did not take thirlwell far and he resumed his walk wondering what driscoll had been doing and why he feared to be disturbed it was plain that he had taken some trouble to put thirlwell off the track and might have succeeded had not the hoarseness of his voice given the latter a hint thirlwell felt puzzled but could find no clue and deciding that the matter was not important presently dismissed it for all that he resolved to watch driscoll but saw nothing to excite his suspicions for the next week or two then the man bought all the provisions scott would let him have and loading his canoe started for the north     chapter v  a nights watch   winter began unusually soon and a blizzard raged about the shack one evening when scott and thirlwell sat near the stove the small room smelt of hotiron and the front of the stove glowed a dull red but the men shivered as the bitter draughts swept in thirlwell watched the skin curtain he had nailed across the window bulge while the snow beat savagely against the glass and then picked up a book presently scott hung a bearskin on the back of his chair  its a pretty good hide although the forequarters cut away he said still i dont know that i wanted the thing and reckon the halfbreed who sold it me got its value in cartridges and food now transports difficult i hope he and his indian friends wont bring us any more of the damaged stock they cant sell to the hudsons bay  thirlwell nodded the rivers were frozen and canoeing was stopped while the bush was deep in fresh loose snow it would be a long and strenuous business to break a trail to the south and in winter the mine was often cut off from the settlements provisions sometimes ran short but scott found it hard to refuse the starving indians a share of his supplies  you bought a fine skin he resumed i havent seen the thing since what have you done with it  i sent it away said thirlwell old musquash said hed try to make the settlements and took it out for me  hell probably get through though i dont think a white man could but i didnt know you had friends in canada  thirlwell did not reply he had bought the skin for agatha and now wondered what she would think about his present or whether she might feel he ought not to have sent it still he doubted if the skin would arrive because the old halfbreed would meet with many dangers on the way thirlwell pictured him hauling his sledge up thinly frozen rivers crossing wide lakes swept by icy gales and plunging into tangled forests smothered in snow the thought of it emphasized the sense of isolation one often felt at the mine but while he mused there was a knock at the door  i expect its an indian come to beg for food scott remarked and the door swung open  the flame of the lamp leaped up and then nearly flickered out as a shower of snow blew in the stove roared and the room got horribly cold and for a moment or two a shaggy white figure indistinct in the semidarkness struggled to close the door then there was a sudden calm and when the light got steady an indian in ragged furs leaned against the table breathing hard and holding out a note  from father lucien said scott who took the folded paper hes had a sick man on his hands for three or four days and wants one of us to relieve him i allow id sooner stop here its pretty fierce tonight  whos sick thirlwell asked  black steve i dont know that he has much claim on us but father luciens a good sort i guess weve got to help him out  thirlwell nodded father lucien was a frenchcanadian missionary who had studied medicine and for the most part lived with his wandering flock in summer he went north with canoe and tent but generally returned in winter to a shack near the mine scott and thirlwell had found his society pleasant when they sat round the stove on long cold nights for the priest had been trained in europe and knew the great world as he knew the canadian wilds a scholar and something of a mystic he was marked by a wide toleration and liberality of thought  whos going shall we draw cuts for it scott resumed  thirlwell hesitated he felt tired the shack was warm and he heard the blizzard rage among the tossing pines but he was curious about driscoll and something urged him to go to the priests help  ill take first turn you can come along tomorrow if youre wanted he said and putting on his fur coat and cap went out with the indian  when the door shut he let his companion take the lead for his eyes were filled with water and snow he knew the bush but imagined that nobody but an indian could find the trail that night and to lose it would mean death for some moments the icy gale stopped his breathing and he stumbled forward seeing nothing until he struck a pine which he seized and leaned against looking round with his back to the wind he noted that the shack had vanished although he thought it was only a few yards off there was nothing visible but when the indian touched him he pulled himself together and struggled on again  it was a little warmer when they plunged into the bush but the snow was soft and deep and they stumbled over fallen branches and fell into thickets tornoff twigs rained upon their lowered heads shadowy trunks loomed up and vanished and thirlwell could not tell where he was going but the indian plodded on his white figure showing faintly through the snow at length when thirlwell was nearly exhausted another sound mingled with the scream of the gale and he knew it was the turmoil of the grand rapid where the furious current did not freeze they were getting near the end of the journey and he braced himself for an effort to reach driscolls shack by and by a ray of light pierced the snow surprisingly close and a few moments later he reached the shelter of a wall  a door opened somebody seized his arm and he stumbled into a lighted room throwing off his snowclogged coat he sat down in a rude chair and blinked stupidly as he looked about his head swam the warmth made him dizzy and the tingling of his frozen skin was horribly painful then he began to recover and saw that the indian had gone and father lucien sat by a bunk fixed to the wall the priest wore an old buckskin jacket with a tasseled fringe and long soft moccasins and looked like an indian until one studied his thin face his forehead was lined as if by thought or suffering and his skin was darkened by wind and frost but the indians glance is inscrutable and his was calm and frank one got a hint of patience and dignity  thank you for coming he said i would not have sent for you on such a night only that i cannot trust myself to keep awake and neglect just now might cost driscolls life one sleeps soundly after watching for three nights  thirlwell glanced at the figure rudely outlined by the dirty blue blanket on the bunk driscolls face was turned to the wall but thirlwell saw that his black hair was damp  whats the matter with steve he asked  pneumonia two of my people who passed the shack in the daytime saw a light burning they went in and found him unconscious an empty whisky bottle on the floor and the stove burned out they made a fire and then came for me  thats something of a compliment thirlwell remarked if it had happened before you came theyd probably have cleaned out the shack and left steve to freeze i dont know that hed have been regretted and if the rumors about his selling the indians liquor are true imagine hes your worst enemy  hes a sick man besides have you often seen my people drunk  no said thirlwell thoughtfully i believe only once but steve didnt deny the thing when one of the boys at the mine called him a whisky runner and i thought it curious because theres a heavy penalty i suppose he cant hear what we say  hes unconscious but has fits of weak delirium three or four oclock may mark the turning and if he lives until daybreak ill feel hopeful but do you imagine he didnt deny your workmans charge because it was true  id have expected him to deny it whether it was true or not thats what puzzled me it looked as if he was willing to be suspected  driscoll said father lucien is a strange dark man but he needs our help and one of us must watch  im fresh and will take the first turn thirlwell offered and pulled his chair to the stove when father lucien wrapping himself in a blanket lay down on the floor  he found watching dreary and got very cold the pines roared about the shack and the lamp flickered in the draughts but the wind was falling and between the gusts one could hear the river driftice churned in the rapid and broke with jarring crashes upon the rocks once or twice thirlwell thought the sound disturbed driscoll because he moved and muttered brokenly thirlwell however could not hear what he said and getting drowsy with the dry warmth of the stove struggled to keep awake he was not sure that he altogether succeeded for now and then his head fell forward and he roused himself with a jerk but did not think he really went to sleep for all that some hours had passed when he moved his chair and looked at his watch it was quieter outside and the roar of the river had got distinct then thirlwell heard a blanket thrown back and glanced at the bunk  driscoll had turned his head and the light touched his face which glistened with sweat his eyes were wide open his lips moved as if he tried to speak and thirlwell thought his brain was clear but saw next moment that driscoll was not watching him he had a curious strained look and gazed at the door as if somebody had come in the strange thing was that he looked afraid  i couldnt stop her with the backstroke he said hoarsely she rolled over as she swung across the stream  thirlwell shivered because it was obvious that the sick man was going over what had happened the night strange was drowned his manner hinted that he was trying to excuse himself for something he had done shrinking back in the bunk he resumed in a stronger voice i couldnt stop her the stream was running fast  then he was silent for a time and thirlwell heard the river rolling through its icebound channel and the dreary wailing of the pines he felt disturbed something in driscolls voice and look had jarred his nerves and it cost him an effort not to waken father lucien it was not time yet and the priest needed sleep driscoll lay quiet with his eyes shut but presently moved and began to mutter thirlwell leaning forward caught the words i never had the thing he took it with him  the strained voice broke driscoll drew a hard breath and feebly turned his face from the light after this thirlwell whose curiosity was excited had less trouble to keep awake and at length roused father lucien as he had been told it was nearly three oclock in the morning the fire had sunk and the shack was very cold the wind had fallen and the bush was silent one could hear the loose snow dropping from the boughs  father lucien crossed the floor and after standing for a time beside the bunk came back and sat down by the stove  you can put in fresh wood it wont disturb him now he said hes sleeping well i think the dangers over  the cord wood snapped and crackled the front of the stove got red and sitting in a corner out of the draughts they began to talk in low voices  driscoll was delirious he talked strangely thirlwell remarked is a sick mans raving all such stuff as dreams  ah said father lucien we know little yet about the working of the disordered brain but the imagination sometimes centers on and distorts things that have happened did you get a hint of intelligence in what driscoll said  i did he said he never had the thing somebodystrange perhapstook it with him  why do you think he meant strange  because his mind was obviously dwelling on the night stranges canoe capsized he said it was an accidenthe could not stop her swinging across the streamas if he were answering somebody who accused him the disturbing thing was that although delirious he looked horribly afraid  father lucien was silent and thirlwell went on you have been with him for three nights has he talked like this before  yes said father lucien quietly you can be trusted i think he is afraid  ah said thirlwell looking hard at him then i wonder why the canoe capsized were they drunk or was there a quarrel but perhaps you know and cannot tell  i do not know driscoll is not of my flock he is ill and it is my business to cure his sickness but i can go no farther if he has other troubles he would refuse my help  that is so thirlwell agreed theres a mystery about the capsize and im curious you see i met stranges daughter and she believes in the lode  father lucien hesitated and then went to a shelf  i will show you something he said and gave thirlwell a small russian leather wallet it was well made but worn and stained as if it had been soaked in water i found this when i undressed driscoll he went on it is not a thing you would expect a rude prospector to carry but i found something else  he held out a piece of broken stone and thirlwell as he took it moved abruptly he knew something about ore and saw that the stone had come from the same vein as the specimen agatha had given him  i think strange found the silver father lucien said quietly  thirlwell knitted his brows he had dark suspicions but after all they had no solid foundation and he thought it best to copy the missionarys reserve  we know driscolls character and may have been mistaken about one thing is it logical to imagine that such a man would feel afraid  fear sometimes comes without remorse said father lucien  superstitious fear working on a brain disordered by liquor and illness  we will not argue about the proper name it may be superstition or something greater i believe that retribution follows the offense  thirlwell looked hard at the other well i doubt if we will ever know the truth about stranges death  it is possible father lucien agreed perhaps it is not important whether we know or not one thing is certain if wrong has been done it will be made right if not by the way we would choose by another i think we may leave it there  we must said thirlwell dryly there is nothing else to do in the meantime if i cant be useful im going to sleep  day was breaking when he wakened and father lucien told him that driscoll was better but would need careful nursing for a time  then scott must come tonight thirlwell replied ive had enough of watching steve and dont mind admitting that your charity is greater than mine  when he reached the shack he told scott nothing about what he had heard because he thought father lucien would sooner he did not the latter knew when to be silent and it would do no good to talk about the matter unless something happened to throw a light upon the mystery on the whole he was relieved when driscoll who soon recovered set off up river with a halfbreed and a loaded handsledge     chapter vi  father luciens adventure   the snow was firm and the rivers were frozen hard when thirlwell left the mine with two metis trappers to examine an outcropping reef that one of the halfbreeds had told him about he was not very hopeful but agreed with scott who thought it might be worth while to look at the reef since the specimens the metis had brought showed traces of silver and lead then father lucien had gone to visit some of his people who had camped for their winter trapping far up in the bush the shack was lonely and the frost hindered the work at the mine  winter is not a good time for prospecting but travel is often easier then for the handsledges run smoothly on the snow that covers fallen trunks and underbrush and levels the hollows the muskegs are frozen and one can make fast marches along the rivers and across the lakes thirlwell had no tent but it is not a great hardship for a wellfed man wrapped in furs to sleep beside a big fire behind a bank of snow and he had no misadventures as he pushed into the wilds the ore proved to be worthless and soon after he started back he met an indian who said he had seen father lucien going south with a dogteam two days before and had found the trail of another white man near the spot where he and his friends had camped  the clear cold weather broke when thirlwell began his homeward march the sky was low and leaden and a biting wind blew from the south it drove the snowdust into the mens smarting faces and froze their breath on their furs their hands stiffened on the sledgetraces and their feet got numb the cold got worse when snow began to fall and when they camped one night thirlwell noted that they had used more food than he thought the transport of provisions is perhaps the main difficulty of a winter journey in the bush for men who brave the arctic cold must be generously fed thirlwell however expected to reach the mine before their stores ran out and set off at daybreak next morning in heavy driving snow  at dusk he camped in a clump of dry willows by a river the snow had stopped but a bitter wind blew down the valley and the cold was intense when he had eaten a meal thirlwell sat with his back to a snow bank and a big fire in front holding up a moccasin to the blaze this was necessary because moccasins absorb moisture during a long days march and the man who puts them on while damp risks getting frozen feet  he was lighting his pipe when the metis he had sent out for wood came back with an armful of branches and said he had seen a light up the river thirlwell put on his halfdried moccasins and reluctantly left the camp he had met nobody but an indian on the trail and was curious to know who was camping in those solitudes besides it was possible that he might be able to get some supplies  as he pushed through the willows the savage wind pierced him to the bone the dry branches rattled and the pines upon the ridge above wailed drearily the sky was clear and the frozen river running back white and level through the dusky forest glittered in the light of a half moon this was all that thirlwell saw for a few minutes and then a twinkling light in the distance fixed his attention it flickered got brighter and faded and he knew it was a fire  after a time he and the metis left the river and climbed the steep bank the fire had vanished but the pungent smell of burning wood came down the biting wind and by and by trails of smoke drifted past the scattered pines then as they struggled through a brake of wildfruit canes a blaze leaped up among the the rocks and he saw an indistinct figure crouching beside a fire the figure got up awkwardly and a few moments later father lucien gave thirlwell his hand the light touched his thin frostbrowned face which was marked by lines that pain had drawn  its lucky you came but if you dont mind well sit down he said  if youre alone you had better come back to our camp thirlwell replied wheres your truck and the dogs  father lucien indicated the torn blue blanket that hung from his shoulder all gone except this but its a long story and i cant walk  then you have nothing to eat said thirlwell sharply  half a small bannock i ate the rest this morning the worst was i had only melted snow to drink  thirlwell made a sympathetic gesture for men who camp in the frozen woods consume large quantities of nearly boiling tea then he turned to the halfbreed and sent him back for his companion and the sledge  well haul you down the river as soon as they come he said by good luck we camped in perhaps the only place from which we could have seen your fire  ah said father lucien with a quiet smile i do not know if it was luck alone that made you choose the spot  they sat down in the hollow among the rocks and the missionary shivered although the fire snapped and threw out clouds of smoke close by thirlwell gave him his tobacco pouch  in the meantime you can eat your bannock and then take a smoke im curious to learn how you lost your outfit and the dogs  father lucien ate the morsel of hard cake and afterwards looked up perhaps i had better tell you before your men arrive well i traveled about with my people as they moved their traps and one night when very tired i slept in damp moccasins the fire got low and next morning my foot was slightly frozen we were forced to make long marches for some days and i found the frostbite had gone deeper than i thought you can no doubt guess what happened  thirlwell nodded a frozen foot sometimes galls into a sore that will not heal while the temperature is low  well said father lucien some time after we pitched camp a man came in with a dogteam that belonged to the hudsons bay he was not going farther but offered to lend me the dogs if i would leave them with some friends of his who were trapping to the south  but can you drive dogs thirlwell asked knowing that skill is required to manage the snarling fighting teams  not well but i have driven dogs and was anxious to reach the mine before my foot got worse i thought i might find somebody at the indians camp who would go on with me for a day or two we made good progress though i had trouble to harness the leader in the morning he was a stubborn bad tempered animal and missed his masters firm control then one evening we came to a creek the stream had kept the channel open here and there and i thought the ice thin but it was open rocky country round about and i saw a clump of pines in the distance where we could camp it got dark as we followed the creek and clouds drifted over the moon but i wanted to find shelter and pushed on once or twice the ice cracked ominously but it held until we came to a spot where the stream got narrower between high rocky banks  the leader stopped and growled at the edge of an open crack his instinct warned him of danger but i knew i could not get up the rough bank with my lame foot and drove him past as i limped by his side with the whip i thought i heard the current gurgle under the ice but we went on the dogs snuffing and treading cautiously then there was a soft thud and a splash the team was jerked back and i saw that the sledge had vanished i suppose it had broken through a snowbridge that our weight had shaken  i scrambled back a yard or two and looked down into the dark gapi could not run because of my galled foot part of the sledge was covered by fallen snow but the fore end rested on something and i leaned down and seized my blanket there was a bag of food beneath it that i tried to reach but perhaps i shook the sledge which began to slip down and i saw the dogs roll among the traces as they were dragged towards the hole the leader clawed desperately at the snow howling as if he begged my help and i felt that i must save him you have heard a dog howl in fear or pain  yes said thirlwell it makes a strong appeal but i suppose you remembered what you risked by leaving the food  i cut the trace father lucien went on another mass of snow fell and the sledge sank out of sight i imagine the stream swept it under the ice for i could only see the dark water foam all the food i had except a bannock in my pocket was lost i forgot the team for a few moments and when i looked up they had gone  he paused and thirlwell made a sign of sympathy a nerveshaking jar but what became of the dogs  i think they were afraid of the ice if my camp had been made and a fire lighted they might have come in for warmth but i was not their master and perhaps they took the back trail to the spot we started from well as i could not follow i limped on until i reached the pine clump where i slept and then dragged myself across the divide to this corner among the rocks i knew i could go no farther and sat down to wait  father luciens voice was calm and thirlwell knew his courage had not failed the man had often risked death when duty sent him out across the snowy wilds  anyhow said thirlwell im glad i found you before it was too late its something i and others will long be thankful for  father lucien smiled deprecatingly if i had starved another would have filled my place men fall on the trail but the work goes forward perhaps i have said too much about my danger but i did so because of a curious thing that happened last night i slept as well as usual for some hours and then opened my eyes i think however i was not quite awake or else my brain was dull because i felt no surprise although a man was in my camp the fire had burned low and he stood back in the gloom where i could not see his face but a dry branch broke into flame and the light fell on me the way the man turned his head indicated that he was looking about the camp and he must have seen that i had nothing but my blanket but he was silent and did not come forward  an indian thirlwell asked  no said father lucien he was white  thirlwell started a white man it looks impossible but why didnt you  i did not speak you see i had not heard him come and imagine now that i thought i was dreaming and was afraid to wake and find my hope of help had gone after a few moments he stepped back very quietly into the shadow and i called out there was no answer and i got up it took a little timethe blanket was round my legs and my foot hurtand when i stumbled away from the fire he had vanished and there was no sound in the bush soon afterwards i fell down in the snow and lay until the cold roused me to an effort and i crawled back to the fire by and by i went to sleep again and did not waken until daybreak  then said thirlwell meaningly you could find no tracks  i could not father lucien agreed that was not strange because light snow was falling when i got up and the wind was fresh still i found this it shows i was not dreaming  he gave thirlwell a wooden pipe with a nickel band round the stem  ah said thirlwell who examined the frozen pipe and scraped out a little halfburned tobacco with his knife fiftycents at a settlement store not the kind of things the indians buy and this is not the stuff they generally smoke besides you would know an indian whether he spoke or not by his figure and his pose  father lucien said nothing but looked at him with a quiet smile and thirlwell resumed well there was a man a white man but the things not to be understood he knew you were starving and stole away then where did he come from theres no white man except driscoll between the hudsons bay post and the mine and you saved driscolls life  when i last heard of him driscoll was trapping about stony creek a long way to the east  thirlwell knitted his brows and lighted his pipe which he had put near the fire to thaw and there was silence until the metis arrived with the sledge when they took the missionary to their camp and gave him food after he had eaten they lay down with their feet to the fire and thirlwell said if the man had seen your fire and come to borrow something or find out who you were he would have spoken theres nobody i can think of who has not some grounds for wishing you well but it looks as if the fellow thought you were asleep and meant to let you starve  it looks like that father lucien agreed with a curious calm perhaps we shall find out who he was some day and if not it does not matter  then he drew the blanket across his face and went to sleep     chapter vii  agathas resolve   agatha looked pale and tired as she sat rather languidly in an easy chair in mrs farnams pretty room there was bitter frost outside but the new wooden house standing among the orchards of south ontario was warm and furnished with a regard for comfort and artistic taste mrs farnam was proud of her house and goodhumored husband who gave way to her except about the growing of fruit on this subject she had told agatha he was extraordinarily obstinate she had some tact and much kindly feeling but had been a teacher and believed she had a talent for managing other peoples business in fact she had tried to manage agathas but was forced to admit without much success agatha she said was difficult  for all that it had given her keen satisfaction to bring the girl there when she was threatened by a nervous breakdown in consequence of overwork agatha had been her confidential friend when they were at school but since mabel married she had sometimes felt that the confidence had been rather onesided she had told agatha much but the latter had said little about her future plans  i dont think youre very much better yet mrs farnam said after a pause in the talk for she was seldom silent long  agatha languidly looked about the room noting the warm color of the polished floor on which the light of the shaded lamp lay in a glistening pool the fine skin rugs and thick curtains she had not an exaggerated love of comfort and her toronto rooms were bare but she owned that mabel had a pretty house besides she had a husband who indulged her and was always kind  its very nice to be here and i shall soon get strong she said i suppose i rather overdid things but the examination was coming and i was anxious my girls should pass well  from the school managers point of view that was a laudable aim but i dont know that it was worth injuring your health for you used to agree that managers often expected too much from a teacher  im afraid i had a selfish object said agatha smiling i wanted a better post that will soon be vacant  ambition sometimes deceives one i know the post you mean and the girl whos going it carries duties that wore her out  and better pay said agatha  mrs farnam gave her a thoughtful look well thats plausible but i never thought you greedy why do you want the extra pay  i have a use for it agatha replied with a twinkle i dont suppose i shall carry out my plans and after all they are too ridiculous to talk about anyhow you would think so youre very practical  people are curious mrs farnam remarked im willing to admit im practical but i married and love my husband while you look romantic and in many ways are not you risk your health for money and i dont think any man ever roused a tender thought in you theres jake for example  she stopped and agatha was silent for a few moments although she was moved she was tired and felt lonely and that life was hard instinctive longings that she had fought against awoke she wanted somebody to shelter her and brush her troubles away mabel had her husband whom she loved but she had chosen a rocky path that she must walk alone  i hope jake is getting on well in british columbia she said i suppose you hear from him  he writes to us regularly and is getting on very well finds his work absorbing and sees a chance of promotion but its obvious that hes not satisfied i dont know if you feel flattered but he cant forget you  agatha stopped her jake was mrs farnams cousin and had been a teacher of science until he got a post at a mine he had helped agatha in her studies and she blamed herself for imagining that common interests and ambitions accounted for their friendship in fact it was something of a shock when on getting his new post jake had asked her to marry him  im not flattered but sorry she replied i liked jake very muchone was forced to like himbut after all that doesnt go far enough and you see i didnt know  i believe you really didnt know it would be ridiculous to admit this about any other girl but in a way youre not quite normal youre too absorbed in your occupation and havent a womans natural feelings you took all jake had to give and were surprised and half indignant when he asked something from you  agatha wondered rather drearily whether mrs farnams reproaches were not justified but the latter went on perhaps however your coldness is encouraging i dont suppose you have met anybody you liked or felt you could like better than jake  no said agatha and then hesitated since mabel was capable of giving her cousin a hint she saw that frankness was needed and remembered the fortnight she had spent with thirlwell by the lake she had thought about him since indeed she had done so oftener than she knew  i shall never marry jake she said just now it seems unlikely that i shall marry anybody else  mrs farnam made a sign of disappointed acquiescence very well thats done with if theres anything more to be said about your plans for the next few months your brother will say it im glad george is coming because hes sensible and will deal with you firmly now ill go and get supper  she left agatha thoughtful george whose business occasionally brought him into the neighborhood had written to say that he was coming and would stop the night and agatha wondered what he wanted to talk about he would certainly give her good advice but they seldom saw alike and she braced herself for a struggle although she was fond of her brother  supper in the bright cedarpaneled room was a cheerful function and as she looked about and joined in the talk agatha was conscious of a feeling that was hardly strong enough for envy or actual discontent but had a touch of both mabel looked happy and modestly proud she was obviously satisfied and in a way enjoyed all that a woman could wish for the house was pretty farnam was indulgent and showed his wife a deference that agatha liked he owned a large orchard and had sufficient capital to cultivate it properly george strange was marked by a complacent selfconfident manner that his urbanity somewhat toned down he dealt in artificial fertilizers and farming implements and it was said that he never lost a customer and seldom made a bad debt  in character george was unlike his sister because while unimaginative he generally saw where his advantage lay for all that he was just and often generous he was married and talked to mrs farnam about his wife and child when he was not eating with frank enjoyment and telling humorous stories while the others laughed and joked agatha mused they had commonplace aims and duties that brought them happiness but she had been given a harder task still it was a task that could not be shirked she had accepted it and must carry it out  some time after supper mrs farnam went away and farnam presently made an excuse for following his wife when they had gone george remarked i must pull out tomorrow but florence sends a message she wants you to stop with us for two or three months  florence is kind said agatha i would like to go but you know its impossible  i dont know george rejoined in an authoritative voice im your elder brother and its my duty to see you do what you ought to begin with i looked up your doctor and he told me you needed a long rest  it cant be got i must go back to school when the holidays are over  wait a bit none of us is as indispensable as we sometimes think  agatha felt half amused and half annoyed george often made remarks like this and imagined that they clinched his arguments she saw that he had been meddling  what did you do after seeing the doctor she asked suspiciously  i went to your principal at the school she said she would talk to the managers and had no doubt that if it was needful they would let you off for a time now as i can fix the thing with the doctor theres no reason you shouldnt quit work and stop with us  agatha colored angrily george meant well but he had gone too far she felt this worse because she was tempted to give way she liked her brothers wife and needed a rest  well she said i suppose i ought to have expected something of the kind but its comforting to feel that your efforts are wasted i shall be quite well in a week or two and am going back to school for one thing i shall need some money before very long  george looked hard at her you dont say why still if its money that prevents you taking the proper line i might lend you some he stopped and resumed with suspicion but i wont give you a dollar to waste in searching for fathers silver lode  i am going to look for the lode said agatha quietly  i hoped you had got over that foolishness george rejoined throwing his cigarette on the floor although he was generally careful about such things now listen to me for a few minutes and try to be sensible  one misses much by always being sensible agatha remarked with a resigned smile  it often saves ones relations trouble anyhow the blamed lode has thrown its shadow on all our lives and i dont mean to stand off saying nothing and see you spoil yours  you escaped the shadow because you never believed in the lode  i certainly didnt and dont believe in it now for all that i saw fathers restlessness and mothers fears  ah said agatha i didnt think  i allow i havent your imagination but i can see a thing thats obvious father thought he hid his feelings but mother knew and grieved she was afraid he would give us up and go back to the north  no said agatha with firmness she was not afraid he would give us up father never failed in his duty  then she was certainly afraid hed die in the bush as he did she knew what the prospectors were up against and though she smiled when he talked about the ore i knew she had an anxious heart i dont claim that the anxiety broke her down but it made a heavy load and helped  yet when she was very ill she did not ask him to promise he wouldnt go  she did not mind then said george in a quiet voice she was dying and we had grown up but there was nothing selfish about her acquiescence i think she was glad to set him free because she loved him and knew what he had borne he was a dreamer and not a business man she had run the store and taken care of him and knew he would be lonely after she had gone besides i sometimes feel she thought he would follow and rejoin her soon it did not matter by what road he came  agatha was silent for some moments because she was surprised and moved george had a keener imagination and saw farther than she thought it looked as if he had known her mother best  you loved her well and so you understood she said but the troubles she bore are done with and now i stand alone i have no responsibilities my life is mine  georges face got red well perhaps i dont count for much but we didnt cut loose when i married i have a sister as well as a wife  im sorry george said agatha putting her hand on his arm i didnt mean to hurt  very well im not a sentimental fellow lets be practical you cant locate the ore because it isnt there but you may spoil your health and get soured by disappointment then if you stop long youll lose your post and ruin your career the blamed silver may become a fixed illusion thats what im really afraid of most in some ways youre very like father  youre persuaded the silver was an illusion  i am persuaded george declared men who live in the frozen woods get credulous and believe extraordinary things and tales of wonderful lodes are common in the mining belts father heard something of the kind and brooded over it until he came to believe he had located the ore he had too much imagination and wasnt practical  but he gave me some specimens he found and they carry rich metal  i allow he thought he found them but thats a different thing  agatha smiled perhaps your theorys plausible but it has some weak points  anyhow if father couldnt locate the vein he claimed to have struck i reckon theres not much chance of your doing so  i mean to try said agatha with ominous quietness  george saw that she was resolute and although he was obstinate knew he was beaten agatha could not be moved when she looked like that  i cant allow that you know best but guess i may as well quit arguing he remarked with a resigned shrug youll come along and stop with florence before you go back to toronto  i will come for a week agatha agreed and george went away to look for farnam     chapter viii  the burglar   george went away next morning and a few days afterwards farnam walked home with his wife and agatha from a visit to a neighbors homestead when they reached the edge of farnams orchard they stopped and looked about an extensive clearing had been cut out of the forest the evening was clear and cold and the pines threw long blue shadows on the snow the young fruit trees ran back in orderly rows and a frozen creek that crossed the orchard was picked out in delicate shades of gray farnam told agatha that he found the creek useful for irrigation because he had known the apples to shrivel on the trees in a dry summer  at the edge of the bush a group of men were at work the thud of their axes jarred on the quietness and the rattle of a chain rang musically through the shadows as a teamster threw the links across a log his horses stood close by with a thin cloud of steam rising from their bodies  lumber worth sawing is getting scarce and well float the best logs down to the mill when the thaw comes farnam said to agatha in the meantime we want them off the ground before we clean up the pieces the boys have slashed one gets at this kind of work in winter when nothing much can be done and i must be ready to break new soil for planting in the spring  you are spending a good deal of money mrs farnam interrupted you havent been paid for the last shipments to england yet  mabels cautious farnam remarked to agatha shes a pretty good business woman but doesnt understand that the more you spend on your job the more you get anyhow you ought to get more but i admit youre sometimes badly stung then he turned to his wife i must go up and see the shippers in montreal in fact now you have agatha with you i think ill start tomorrow  very well said mrs farnam i hate to be left alone particularly when the nights are long she indicated the teamster i see you have hired another man thats a fresh extravagance how long have you had him  a week or two thought i told you when he came hes a pretty good worker  you didnt tell me i imagine you didnt want me to know hes certainly not what the boys call a looker and his face doesnt inspire me with much confidence besides hes lame  agatha glanced at the man who came towards them walking with a slight limp beside his horses as they hauled the log across the snow he had a sullen air and did not look up as he passed  he is not handsome she agreed and asked where do the men live  we have fixed up this lot in the packing shed my regular hands leave me in winter farnam replied indicating a wooden building at some distance from the house however well go home there are some accounts i must examine before i start for montreal  they went on and when after supper mrs farnam grumbled at being left without a man in the house farnam took out an automatic pistol and explained how it was used  i dont know why i bought the thing unless it was to satisfy mabel he said to agatha its curious but while she could handle mutinous pupils and bluff the managers she quakes if a door rattles on a windy night ones rather safer in our homestead than a montreal hotel but mabel has lived in the cities and the wild west tradition dies hard as a matter of fact there never was a wild west in canada he opened the pistol you put the cartridge shells in like this  you can show agatha how it works i wont touch the thing mrs farnam declared shes something of a sport but im a womanly woman except when i teach school  farnam laughed on the whole it might be better to leave the cartridges out if somebody did break in all you need do would be to pretend you were asleep everybody in the neighborhood knows where my office is and an intelligent burglar begins at the safe theres no money in mine now  after a little goodhumored banter agatha took the pistol and farnam went to his office at the other end of the house next day he started for montreal and at night mrs farnam made agatha come with her while she examined the fastenings of the doors and windows the house was low and the roof of the veranda in front reached nearly to the second floor nothing disturbing happened and on the next night agatha sat up after mrs farnam had gone to bed reading the letters strange had written her from the north  there were not many and some were marked by a careless style that obscured the meaning this puzzled agatha who remembered that her father had generally talked with lucid clearness still they helped her to picture the life he had led in the wilds and she read them often trying to follow on a map his wanderings in search of the lode they told her more about the country than the books she read and she had read a number because the subject had a fascination all she could learn would be of use when she came to carry out her plans  when she tied up the letters and looked at the clock it was later than she thought the room felt cold and she shivered but sat still for a few moments musing the house was quiet and she imagined mrs farnam was asleep but it was snowing for she heard the flakes beat upon the window looking round the comfortable room she thought of the men who braved the rigors of winter in the frozen wilds thirlwell for example was bearing such cold as was never felt in south ontario  she started for there was a noise overhead as if a door had been gently opened but next moment pulled herself together mabel had not gone to sleep as she had thought and picking up an electric torch she put out the lamp when she was half way up the stairs she heard somebody moving about but it was not like mabels step the movements seemed cautious and there was something awkward about them agatha who wore feltsoled slippers stopped and listened while her heart beat fast she heard nothing now but felt alarmed and wondered what she ought to do a call would probably bring an answer that would banish her fears but suppose it was not mabel she had heard there was however another way of finding out and with something of an effort she went upstairs  mrs farnams room was on the landing and agatha turned the handle cautiously the door would not open and it was obvious that mabel had locked herself in then the latch slipped back with a jar that sounded horribly loud and she waited trembling and trying to keep calm since mabel had not heard the noise it was plain that she was asleep and somebody else was in the house still mabel if awakened would not be of much help and remembering that the pistol was in her room agatha went down the passage  the passage was very cold a curtain swayed in an icy draught and she found the door of her room open stopping for a moment she thought there was somebody inside this however might be a trick of her imagination and although she wanted to steal away she knew that if she did so she would lose her selfrespect and the confidence she would need for her journey to the north she must brave real dangers in the wilds and live among rude men besides the pistol was on a table near the door  somebody moved as she went in for there was a rustle and a board cracked but her hand touched the pistol and she turned on the powerful electric torch as the beam of light swept across the room she saw that the drawer of a small writingtable had been pulled out then the beam passed on and touched a man kneeling beside her open trunk the clothes she had not unpacked were scattered on the floor as if the man had been looking for something and a lantern stood near his hand she thought he had just put it out since she noted a smell of oil  now she had found the intruder she was less afraid than angry that he had pulled about her clothes with his coarse dirty hands she knew him for he was the teamster she had seen in the orchard the beam that picked him out however left the rest of the room in gloom and it was hard to hold the torch steady  light your lantern but dont move from where you are she said i have a pistol  he did as he was told using an oldfashioned sulphur match that smelt disagreeably but made no noise the light spread and showed her standing with the pistol in her hand but when she risked a glance about nothing seemed to have been disturbed except the writingtable and her trunk  now you may get up but dont be rash she said quietly and was glad to feel she could control her voice  he got up and waited watching her sullenly  what have you taken she asked  nothing there was nothing worth taking  agatha forced a mocking smile worn clothes wont sell for much and i have no jewelry then she raised the pistol dont move i mean you to keep still  he stood motionless with a kind of dull resignation although she thought she had noted a curious shrinking when she spoke as if something in her voice had disturbed him  i dont know what to do with you she resumed no doubt you knew mr farnam is away but the pistol magazine is full to begin with you had better empty your pockets pull them inside out  he obeyed and dropped a pipe a tobacco tin and two or three silver coins  those are mine ive corralled nothing of yours  so it seems agatha rejoined for all that you can leave the things there how did you get in  over the veranda roof you hadnt fixed the shutter in the middle  agatha pondered for a few moments the fellow did not look afraid but seemed to recognize that the advantage was with her this was lucky because she could not keep it up long and wanted to get rid of him  well she said i think you had better go out by the window you opened walk down the passage in front of me and dont try to turn round  he did so until he reached the window which opened to the side the hinges were in good order and made no noise when he pushed back the frame  get out said agatha ill shoot if you stop  he climbed quietly over the ledge his lantern flickered and went out and next moment agatha saw nothing but the driving snow then she closed the window and fastened the shutter in frantic haste and afterwards leaned against the wall trembling and breathing hard still the man had gone and she thought he would not come back pulling herself together she returned to her room  although she had driven the man away she locked the door and when she had lighted the lamp sat down to recover her calm there was no use in wakening mrs farnam and by and by she began to look about the papers in the writingtable had been thrown upon the floor her trunk was empty and the clothes it had held were scattered the man had obviously been searching for something and this was curious because one would not expect to find jewelry in a writingtable and a bureau with three or four drawers had not been opened then she noticed her fathers letters lying in a bundle on the table and put them back in the trunk from which she had recently taken them after this she repacked her clothes and sitting down again tried to remember all that had happened  there was something puzzling about the adventure to begin with she could not see why the man had come to her room and what he expected to get a clever thief would have gone to farnams office then she thought he was not a coward he had given way because he was cool enough to see that he was in her power and resistance would lead to his getting shot yet he had seemed to shrink when he heard her voice she reflected with faint amusement that her voice was not harsh and she had studied its control as part of her training when she began to teach the little tricks of tone and gesture one used to overawe young girls would not frighten a man for all that when she first spoke there was a hint of fear in his furtive eyes  agatha let this go and pondered her own feelings and the part she had played she had of course been frightened but had preserved her judgment and seen that she could control the situation so long as she kept cool the man had not a pistol and she could have fired three or four shots before he could seize her but he might have tried to seize her had she not shown that she was ready to shoot it looked as if she had the nerve and confidence to face a crisis which was satisfactory since she would need these qualities when she traveled through the wilds she had however long trained herself for this object in fact as far as possible she made her life a preparation for the adventurous journey then she remembered her brothers warning and wondered whether it was justified there was perhaps a danger of her dwelling too much upon the lode she must not let it possess her mind and make her deaf to other claims one ought to keep a proper balance in the meantime she was tired and feeling limp with the reaction from the strain she got up and shortly afterwards went to bed     chapter ix  agatha asks advice   agatha said nothing next morning about her adventure although she heard that the lame man had left the packing shed when his companions were asleep and had not come back next day farnam returned and in the evening when mrs farnam was busy she found an opportunity of talking to him alone he looked thoughtful when he heard her story  you did right not to tell mabel but i certainly cant understand the thing he said i reckon you have your imagination under pretty good control  i didnt imagine i saw the man agatha rejoined with a smile  farnam nodded well take that for granted i wanted a teamster and hired the fellow when he asked for the job he worked well but i dont know where he came from or where hes gone and it would scare mabel if we put the police on his trail besides i guess he lit out by the train in the morning that catches the westbound express  since he knew you were away why did he wait instead of coming as soon as you left  he probably reckoned there was a risk of his being heard on a calm frosty night i understand it was blowing fresh and snowing when he came the snow would cover his tracks but im puzzled its strange that he took nothing and left my safe alone  do you think he knew where the safe is  sure said farnam the boys come to my office for their pay he paused and added thoughtfully looks as if the fellow had an object for searching your room  i wonder whether he knew i was a school teacher agatha remarked if he did know it complicates the thing because teachers are not often rich besides how did he learn which was my room  that wouldnt be hard farnam replied the boys get talking evenings with mabels kitchen help and i guess she tells them all about the house and our habits the girls a powerful talker  he lighted his pipe and then resumed well my notion is he expected to find something in your room something that he thought worth more than money  but i have nothing valuable agatha objected with a laugh now i remember i made him empty his pockets and he left two halfdollars it wasnt a very big fine and i can send the dollar to some charity  i cant see an explanation and well have to let it go but the man will find trouble waiting if he comes back let me know right away if anybody gets after you like that again  agatha said she would do so and hearing mrs farnams step in the passage they began to talk about something else  a week later agatha went to visit george and then feeling braced by the holiday resumed her duties in toronto soon afterwards she sat in her room one evening in a thoughtful mood the house was on the outskirts of the city and she heard cheerful voices and the jingle of sleighbells on the road the moon was nearly full and riding parties were going out for a drive across the glittering snow while where the wind had swept it clear ice yachts were no doubt skimming about the lake agatha envied the happy people who could enjoy such sports and it had cost her something to admit that they were not for her a ticket for a concert to which she had thought of going was stuck in a picture frame but she was not in the humor for music and putting down the book she held leaned back languidly in her chair  the room was small plainly furnished and shadowy for the lamp had a deep shade that confined the light to a narrow circle three or four books lay upon the table and a map of the northwest territories occupied the end in front of agatha it was not a very good map and the natural features of the country were sketchily indicated for belts of the northern wilderness had not been thoroughly surveyed but she had opened it for half an hours relaxation after that she must get to work  she was not very strong yet but had undertaken extra duties that necessitated private study now she felt tired after lecturing a class of absentminded girls and closing her eyes abandoned herself to moody thought georges warning was bearing fruit agatha was young but knew one soon got jaded and youth slipped away there was a risk of her spending in unrewarded efforts the years that ought to be happiest and then finding herself old and soured still when she came to think of it she had recognized this and felt a vague dissatisfaction with her lot before george had talked to her in fact the dissatisfaction had begun soon after she wandered through the bush and paddled about the lake with thirlwell  for all that she was not going to give up the resolve she had made long ago she owed her father much and must carry out the task he had unconsciously left her she meant to search the country he had traveled for the silver vein and then if she was persuaded it could not be found she would have paid her debt and be free to lead the life that others led in the meantime she was so to speak set apart like a nun from common joys and sorrows by a vow that must be kept perhaps this was an exaggeration but it was partly true  banishing her thoughts she put away the map and opened her book but soon afterwards a servant brought in a card and stated that a man wished to see her on the card was printed john stormont and the number of a postoffice box at winnipeg  i dont know mr stormont agatha remarked but if he wants to see me you may show him in  a few moments later a man entered the room he was young and neatly dressed and smiled urbanely as he bowed  miss strange i suppose if you are not much occupied i hope you can give me a few minutes  agatha feeling curious indicated a chair and studied him when he sat down his voice was rather harsh his glance was quick and his alert manner implied selfconfidence there was however nothing else to be remarked about him and she thought him a common type of young business man  i am not engaged just now she replied  thank you said stormont perhaps id better state that im pretty well known in winnipeg where i do business in real estate and sometimes undertake the development of mineral claims ive recently put over two or three big transactions in that line  but manitoba is a farming country  certainly the prairie belt the eastern strip running along the edge of the territories from lake of the woods is different there the rocks break out among the pine forests and in the last few years prospectors have found valuable minerals some are being worked and i expect we will soon hear of fresh discoveries i understand you are the daughter of gordon strange who found a silver lode in north ontario  i am his daughter but i believe the lode was not in ontario  then it was in the neighboring territories i expect your father often talked to you about his find  he did said agatha still i dont see  stormont smiled you wonder where i am leading you well its part of my occupation to investigate mining propositions and where the owners want to sell to find a buyer sometimes i lend them money to improve the claim in fact i imagine you would find me useful in many ways  i cannot sell the lode before i know where it is  thats obvious stormont agreed the difficulty however might be overcome and thats where i could help but to begin with am i to understand your father altogether failed to relocate the claim although he filed no record he may have found a clue  agatha gave him a keen glance he had said nothing to excite much suspicion but she felt that he was going too fast and asking too many questions  i did not see him after he went back to the north i suppose you know he lost his life on his last journey  stormont made a sympathetic gesture i heard so but no doubt he wrote to you and told you about his prospecting  yes said agatha with some reserve he sent me letters  then i expect he told you where he went its possible that a study of the letters would give an experienced prospector a useful hint  agatha pondered she had with the help of her map followed stranges journeys and his letters showed where the silver was not to be found which eliminated large belts of country then if stormont knew much about mining and was accustomed to negotiate the sale of claims his curiosity implied that her fathers belief in the lode was well grounded this was encouraging but the man was a stranger and she felt a vague distrust  the person who finds a vein of ore and files his record is registered as its owner when he has complied with the legal formalities she said  that is so stormont agreed with a smile you feel that if you parted with the letters you would run some risk of losing the claim well one must trust ones agent to some extent and ill make you two propositions you can give me all the information you have about the ore and if i think it worth while i will bear the cost of prospecting and development and give you a large share of the profits when the mine is worked or ill pay you a fixed sum for the letters and any clues you can supply  after you have read the letters  certainly you cant expect me to make a plunge of this kind in the dark anyhow if you decide on the first plan you will be a partner and have some control its plain that you will benefit by my experience  for a few moments agatha was tempted to agree she needed help and could not begin the search for some time while a man who knew all about mining could undertake it with a better chance of success still she saw that much depended on the mans honesty and she had no grounds for trusting stormont  can you give me two or three weeks she asked i want to consult my friends  the delay might upset my plans for one thing it would be necessary to get as much work as possible done before the thaw comes prospecting is difficult in winter but its considerably easier traveling when the rivers are frozen and first of all we want to find the spot i daresay you could give me some landmarks that would help us  agatha hesitated strange had often described the neighborhood where he had found the ore and she saw that what she knew about it might be important stormonts explanation of his anxiety to begin the search was plausible but it was possible he wanted to prevent her asking advice  i must wait until i know what my friends think she insisted  although the loss of time may spoil our chance of locating the ore  yes said agatha firmly i must run the risk  stormont got up very well i dont know if well be able to do anything when you make your decision but you can write to me in the meantime i think you ought to promise that you wont negotiate with anybody else  i will promise this said agatha and knitted her brows when he went out  she was half afraid she had been too prudent and let a good offer go by but although it might bring her trouble and disappointment she would sooner look for the ore herself she had sometimes shrunk from the task but after all it was her duty then she could not ask george for advice he had never believed in the lode and would no doubt tell her she was lucky to get an offer and had better make the best bargain she could farnam knew nothing about mining he was absorbed in his orchard and mabel now and then declared that his judgment was only worth trusting about fruit trees  agatha paused and admitted that she had from the beginning meant to ask thirlwell she could trust him he was honest but this was not all when he talked about important things he had a quiet decided manner that she liked he would not be daunted by obstacles and if her resolution wavered he would not let her shirk she did not think him clever but he would somehow carry out what he undertook it was curious that after a fortnight of his society she knew him so well but she did know he was trustworthy and there was nothing more to be said  since a letter might not reach him for some time she had better write at once and she got some paper and began it was easy to write to thirlwell and she told him about the lame man who had broken into the house before she came to stormonts offer indeed when she stopped she was surprised to see how much she had said after fastening the envelope she got up and went to the window where she drew the thick curtain behind her and looked out  the moon was higher up the sky and the roofs glittered in the silver light half the street lay in shadow a belt of grayish blue but the rest sparkled where the sleighshoes had run a sleigh came up with a load of girls and young men in blanketcoats and furs they seemed to be talking and laughing but agatha no longer envied them the depression she had felt had gone then as the sleigh went past with a chime of bells she tried to follow her letter on its journey to the north  after it left the railroad it would lie in a pack on a halfbreeds shoulders or perhaps in a skin bag on a handsledge in front of which men with snowshoes marched it would travel up winding rivers between dark walls of ragged pines across frozen lakes and among the rocks on high divides then the tired men would stop at a cluster of shacks beside a shaft and an oredump in the wilds and she wondered what thirlwell would think when he opened the envelope whether he would be pleased or not  but this was indulging idle sentiment that she had meant to avoid and she went back to the table and opened her books thirlwells answer would not arrive for some weeks and if she went north summer would come before she could start in the meantime she had her pupils to teach the subject for the next mornings lesson was difficult and needed careful study     chapter x  thirlwell gets a letter   a dreary wind wailed about the shack and now and then the iron roof cracked as it shrank and wrenched its fastenings in the bitter cold the room was not warm although the front of the stove glowed a bright red and after supper thirlwell pulled his chair between it and the wall he had been out for some hours with snowshoe and rifle but had seen nothing to shoot the white desolation was empty of life and silent except for the wind among the pinetops  id meant to look into the snake creek muskegs but the cold drove me back he said in summer ones bitten by sandflies and mosquitoes in winter one runs some risk of freezing to death i wonder now and then whether minings worth the hardship and why we stop here  unprofitable mining isnt logically worth much hardship scott remarked but dont you mean you wonder why you came back  no said thirlwell with a touch of embarrassment that was pretty obvious i was offered a good post in england but it meant id be dependent on a man i dont like a rough life with liberty is better than luxurious servitude  the latter has some advantages scott rejoined tonight for example you could enjoy a good dinner instead of moldy beans and rancid pork put on clean clothes and go to a concert or theater then youd get up next morning in a warm room with a bath and hot water at hand instead of freezing by a stove that had burned low anyhow admitting that youre obstinate and hate to go where others want ive a notion that you felt you had to see me out when you refused that post  oh well said thirlwell awkwardly in a sense i was bound  by your scruples but well let it go scott rejoined i expect were all to some extent the slaves of an idea id pull out tomorrow if i didnt feel i had to make my mining venture good before i quit all the same it looks as if id save my money by stopping now  he looked up for there was a knock at the door and a man who had gone down to the settlements came in his skin cap was pulled down to meet the collar of his coat leaving only his eyes and nose exposed and fine frostdried snow stuck to the shaggy furs  its surely fierce tonight he said thought we couldnt make it when we met the wind on loon lake but there was no shelter on the beach and our tea had run out i brought a letter for mr thirlwell along  nothing else scott asked  the man said there was nothing and when he went away scott smiled  well thats a relief i had expected a reminder that we hadnt paid our last bill for tools but i guess you want to read your letter  thirlwell felt a thrill of satisfaction as he recognized the hand for it was some time since agatha had written to him he got thoughtful as he read the letter and when he had finished put it down and lighted his pipe  id like you to listen to this and tell me what you think he said  scott make a sign of agreement and when thirlwell had read agathas account of her meeting with the burglar and stormont he remarked its a nice frank letter and miss strange has some talent for dramatic narrative  thats not what i meant said thirlwell with an impatient frown what dyou think about stormonts visit  on the whole i imagine miss strange ran less risk of being robbed when she met the burglar  so i think but why did the fellow go  scott looked thoughtful though stormonts said to be a rogue hes certainly not a fool you seem to take it for granted that strange never found the lode but im not sure anyhow it looks as if stormont didnt agree with you  but how did he hear about the lode  its not very plain but i have a suspicion theres a curious thing i dont see much difference between stormonts object and the burglars both seemed to want the letters strange wrote to the girl  now i come to think of it perhaps there wasnt much difference the fellow stole nothing although he broke open the writingtable and miss stranges trunk she says he disturbed nothing else but the matter gets no clearer  scott smiled my explanation is that stormont tried to buy the letters after he found they couldnt be stolen  but hed have to trust the man he hired to break into the house and this would put him in the fellows power  i reckon the man told him about the lode miss strange states that he was lame scott remarked in a meaning tone where has black steve been since he left this neighborhood  thirlwell started its possible you have got near the truth nobody knows as much as driscoll about stranges prospecting but i must answer the letter what am i to say  if you tell her to have nothing to do with stormont it ought to be enough in the meantime scott replied you could send down your answer when the next hudsons bay breeds come along  they were silent for a few minutes and then scott resumed i understand miss strange means to look for the vein next summer and you are going why is that since you dont believe her fathers tale  shes resolved to go and i can help when shes persuaded the ore cant be found shell be content to give the notion up i dont want the thing to occupy her thoughts until it becomes a kind of mania as it did with strange  i imagine shes an attractive girl  she is attractive but that has nothing to do with it thirlwell replied with a frown im not in love with miss strange to begin with i cant support a wife and marriage hasnt much charm for me then i think shes clever enough to make her mark and will stick to her occupation until she does if she gets rid of this foolish notion of looking for the ore  i see said scott with some dryness you feel sorry for the girl and want to save her from getting like strange well its a chivalrous object but theres a thing you dont seem to have thought of yet prospecting a big belt of country is a long job and if youre away much of the summer how are you going to keep your engagement with me  i have thought of it thirlwell replied its awkward  scott smiled at his embarrassment well ill let you go in fact i dont mind taking a stake in the expedition in the way of food and tools  miss strange wouldnt agree  very well suppose you locate the ore shell need advice and further help now i know something about mining ive paid pretty high for what ive learned i understand miss strange hasnt much money and we might save her some expensive mistakes you see i havent much hope of getting down to paydirt here  thirlwell pondered he liked and trusted scott and the thought of being able to offer agatha the help she might need was attractive but he meant to be honest and exercised some selfcontrol  it would pay you better to leave the thing alone i feel pretty sure the ores a freak of stranges imagination  its possible scott agreed go and see  thirlwell knocked out and filled his pipe and then remarked with some diffidence you stated that you didnt think you had enough capital to keep the clermont going long  i havent enough scott said smiling but i have some rich relations who might finance me if i could show them a sure snap id like to do so anyhow because after spending most all my money i feel ive got to make good  i can understand this why did you come up here in the beginning  its rather a long story and i reckon it starts with a canoe trip i made in the north one fall i had then begun a business in which family influence could give me a lift well it was indian summer mosquitoes dying off lakes and rivers all asleep in the pale sunshine as we paddled and portaged through the woods i felt id got into another world wanted to stop forever and began to hate the cities the feeling wasnt new but i hadnt got it really strong till then sometimes at night when the loons were calling on the lake and my packers were asleep id lie by the fire and speculate what civilization was worth and if a man might not do better to cut loose and live by his gun and traps well of course it was a crank notion and i wasnt all a fool i stopped longer than i meant but i pulled out and got to work again  scott paused and smoked meditatively before he resumed it was of no use the city palled dont know that im a cynic or much of a philosopher but the folks i knew seemed to have a wrong idea of values spent their best efforts grubbing for money and trying to take the lead in smart society they made me tired with their hustling about things that didnt matter i wanted the woods and the quiet the river hardly breaks  you went back  i did said scott felt i had to go it was winter and the cold was fierce but we made four hundred miles with the handsledge across the snow and when i came out with some fingers frozen i was nine pounds heavier used to sit in my office afterwards and dream about the glittering lakes and the stiff white pines saw them crowding round the lonely camps when i ought to have been studying the market reports well i couldnt concentrate on buying and selling things betting on the market and getting after other peoples money seemed a pretty mean business he paused and added with a twinkle thats how i felt then and i dont know that ive changed my opinions much  all the same youre anxious to make your mining pay  it isnt logical but i was born a white man and had got civilized you cant altogether get rid of what youre taught when young and its harder when the notions you inherit are backed by your training well i saw there was a danger of my turning out a hobo if i went back north without a job i must get some work and when brinsmead came with a proposition about the clermont vein i took down my shingle and located here with him  but what about your relations did they object  not much on the whole i reckon they were satisfied to see me go they had long decided i was a crank and since i was bound to do something foolish id better do it where i wouldnt disgrace them thats about all were here and i dont know that id go back if the road was open would you  thirlwell pondered it was a hard life he led working for the most part in the dark underground for when money was scarce and wages high he could not be satisfied to superintend scott indeed worked like a paid hand and they had fought a long and it seemed a losing battle against forces whose strength science cannot yet properly measure the fishoil lamps sometimes went out in poisonous air while they examined an unsafe working face props broke under a load they ought to have borne and now and then the roof came down rock pillars crushed massive stones fell out where one least expected and there was always the icy water that the pump could not keep under and the frost could not stop  yet there was something that thrilled one in the stubborn fight and a strange ascetic satisfaction in proving how much flesh and blood could stand one felt stronger for bracing ones tired body against fresh fatigue and watchfulness in the face of constant danger toned up the brain then after all the vast silent wilderness had a seductive charm  this country draws and holds what it gets he said im satisfied to stop here as long as im young  for a time they smoked in silence and presently went to bed tired with exhausting labor and glad to rest in dreamless sleep until they began again in the bitter dawn     chapter xi  stormont finds a clue   the dufferin house was the best hotel in the small ontario town and about ten oclock one evening stormont read a newspaper in his comfortable room his clerk had been some days in the town looking into a proposed transaction in real estate and stormont left winnipeg when a letter from him arrived this was not because the business required his supervision but because watson the clerk had found out something that might prove to be important although it might lead to his employers wasting his time stormont seldom let what he called a fighting change go by  he had eaten a good supper at about six oclock and after a talk with watson and a young man whose acquaintance the clerk had made had sent them off to see the town at his expense this was not rash because stormont could trust his clerk now he waited their return but it was not for watsons benefit he had put a cigarbox and a bottle of strong liquor on the table much depended on watsons tact and judgment and stormont felt relieved when he came in  ive got drummond downstairs the clerk said  very good said stormont had you much trouble  i certainly had some he wanted me to hire a sleigh and take a girl at a sweetstuff store for a joyride suggested it when she was there and i think she meant to go then he broke a lamp in the poolroom that cost us two dollars  well i hope you havent overdone the thing  on the whole i guess not watson replied its hard to hit the proper mark but i reckon hes just drunk enough  then bring him up said stormont and in a few minutes watson came back with a young man  the latters skin was somewhat dark and his coarse black hair and athletic figure hinted at a strain of indian blood as a matter of fact his mother was a frenchcanadian metis and he was born in a skin tent in the north his clothes were cut in the latest fashion and he looked selfconfident but he moved unsteadily and his face was flushed  had a gay time mr drummond stormont asked  you bet said the other giving the clerk a patronizing smile this young fellow is surely a sport promised half the girls uptown hed take them a sleighride and broke a big lamp in the poolroom  you broke the lamp watson interrupted with a glance at his employer  oh well said drummond perhaps i did i certainly put the marker out he allowed i couldnt hold my cue and was going to cut the cloth why id play any man in this old town for fifty dollars  and beat him said stormont watson told me how you play but wont you sit down and take a smoke  i surely will drummond replied and pulling up an easy chair put his wet snowboots on stormonts bed after which he lighted a cigar now he resumed if you have anything to say to me you can go ahead  youre a store clerk i think its a poor job making a profit for another man and watson tells me you are enterprising howd you like to run a store of your own if you could put up the stock to start with i reckon youd soon make good  ive figured on that drummond replied with a cunning look though stormont saw he was flattered you want some money to begin but ive a notion how im going to raise my pile  stormont nodded he had appealed to the young mans raw vanity but meant to work upon another emotion watson tells me you came from hamilton nice town and business was pretty good when i was there he paused and asked sharply why did you quit  drummond hesitated and got confused nothing much doing in my line didnt see many chances and hamilton made me tired  oh well said stormont who had given the other a hint that he knew something about his past history i reckon you didnt leave your employer your new address anyhow storeclerkings a tame job and youre a sport you want to get out and give yourself a chance wasnt hector drummond hudsons bay agent at the old longue sault factory your father  he was dont know how you know but youve got it right  stormont smiled the young man had told watson much about himself one night when he was drunk i dont think it matters youd like to get rich and hinted that you knew how to make your pile  i know where theres a silver lode  ah said stormont thats interesting but its an expensive business to prove and develop a mineral claim and you couldnt do much alone i expect you know this since you stop here clerking for a few dollars a week you want help  the man who looks for that ore will want my help drummond rejoined  well its my business to speculate in mines and im generally willing to pay for a useful tip but its got to be useful i dont like to be stung and the woods are full of deadbeat prospectors ready to put you wise about rich paydirt for a dollar or two  my tips all right drummond declared in a defiant tone ill show you when the old man was at longue sault he had a clerk called strange and sent him off somewhere one day with a sledge and dogs strange came back with a bagful of mineral specimens and said hed struck it rich but the old man knew nothing about mining and didnt want any prospectors mussing up things round there by and by strange left the factory and the old man pulled out and brought me south located at owen sound and told me about stranges specimens one day when he was very sick said hed reckoned the fellow was a crank but hed kept two or three specimens and a mining man told him they carried good silver  did strange tell your father where he found the specimens stormont asked carelessly  drummond grinned since the old man sent him i guess he knew where he went but ive got to know what my tip is worth before i tell you  certainly said stormont suppose we take a drink he filled a glass and gave it drummond but was silent for some minutes afterwards  the young man was not as drunk as he thought and had obviously some caution left the heady liquor however might make a difference  well he resumed when drummond put down his glass youre ambitious and enterprising i expect youd like to own a share in a paying mine  you bet i would im surely going to  then you had better let me help it will cost you something to locate the vein and you wont find people ready to believe your tale and put up the money stormont replied  he saw by drummonds look that he had tried to sell his secret but the lad answered cut it out whats your offer  fifty dollars now and five hundred when we find the lode if its worth working then a share that will depend on the cost of development and the profit  shucks said drummond i want five hundred dollars before i start  then you had better try somebody else said stormont smiling its possible that all you can tell me isnt worth five dollars  ill show you gimme a hundred now and nother drink  take fifty or i quit said stormont who passed him the bottle  drummond drained his glass youre mean but i gotter make a start wheres the bills  stormont gave him some paper money and then turned to the clerk see about mailing the letters watson  the clerk went out knowing why he had been sent his employer trusted him where he was forced but did not want him to hear what drummond had to say  when watson had gone drummond knitted his brows as if trying to remember something the vein runs out on the face of a cliff bout forty paces from the first rampike pine theres three or four rampikes but the fire hadnt gone far into the bush  not much of a clue there are patches of burned forest all over the country stormont remarked  dont interrupt said drummond with a frown its pretty hard to remember give me nother drink i wanter get it right  stormont filled his glass and he resumed in an unsteady voice cliff rises from the creek in a little round hollow theres a big rock near the top of the divide opposite  go on how does the creek run  youre hustling me drummond grumbled i wanter think its important knowing how the creek runs fixes where she is he paused and a vague distrust of stormont entered his bemused brain he had got the fifty dollars and saw with drunken cunning that it might be prudent to keep something back she runs south  south exclaimed stormont who knew that the natural drainage of the region is northeast to james bay  sure said drummond with a sullen look strange told the old man and the old man told me  stormont pondered if the creek flowed south it drained a subsidiary basin and probably filled a lake from which a river ran north or east the clue was worth fifty dollars because it would simplify the search for the lode  how does the creek lie from the factory  bout southwest said drummond in a thick drowsy voice there isnt a factory at longue sault now company moved the post after the old man left  how far is the creek from where the post was  lemme think drummond muttered and his eyes half closed old man reckoned strange made it in a fortnights march  from the creek or from the place where he was sent or do you mean the double journey  dont know drummond answered dully old man said fortnight told you all i remember  then he slipped down in the big chair his head drooped forward and he fell into a drunken sleep stormont got up and leaned against the table he had borne some strain in the last few minutes because it had been obvious that drummond was overcome by liquor and would soon be unable to talk while when he woke up sober he might repent his rashness now stormont imagined he had told him all he knew and it ought to be worth fifty dollars lighting a cigar he waited until his clerk came back when he indicated drummond who lay snoring heavily with his dirty boots on stormonts bed  wake the drunken fool and see him home  watson had some trouble to get drummond on his feet and after stormont shut the door there was a heavy thud it looked as if drummond had fallen down the stairs but stormont smiled he had done with the fellow and if watson could get him out of the hotel it did not matter if he reached home or not ringing for the bellboy he gave orders about being called in the morning as he meant to leave by an early westbound train     chapter xii  on the trail   thirlwell had been to the railroad settlement and returning with father lucien camped on the trail not far from the mine the day had been unusually warm and at noon the pines dripped in the sun and the snow got damp at dusk it began to freeze and a haze hung about the woods and obscured the moon but by contrast with the rigors of winter thirlwell sitting by the campfire felt almost uncomfortably warm father lucien had taken off his furs and sat with a blanket over his shoulders on a bundle of dry twigs both had hung their moccasins up to dry near the heap of snapping branches wreaths of aromatic smoke slowly drifted past and faded in the mist  one feels spring coming said father lucien we have had a foretaste to cheer us while winter lasts the sun is moving north and up here it always thrills me to watch the light drive back the dark one could make a homily on that  the dark soon returns thirlwell remarked i hate the long nights  there are men who like the dark in spite of the terrors it has for some  i wonder whether you are thinking of a particular example thirlwell suggested remembering a night watch he had kept while the blizzard raged about driscolls shack  one does think of examples perhaps we generalize too much it is easy to let an individual stand for a type  if the individual is black steve driscoll i hope hes an uncommon type  father lucien made a sign of agreement driscoll was in my thoughts a strange man dogged and sullen with a heart that kindness cannot touch yet one feels he is afraid  he was afraid when he was ill i wonder why the fellow has no religious or moral code but he drinks hard and perhaps hes superstitious  what is superstition the missionary asked with a smile the old atavistic fear of the dark and the mysterious dangers that threatened our savage ancestors or is it an instinctive knowledge that there are supernatural powers able to punish and reward  i dont know said thirlwell who mused and watched the smoke drift past  the bush was very quiet he could hear nothing but the crackle of the fire now and then a blaze leaped up and pierced the shadows among the pine trunks a few yards away the trees got blurred and melted into the encircling gloom in one place however there was an opening and when he turned his back to the light he saw a faint glimmer in the mist that indicated the frozen lake although he was used to the wilds he felt the silence and desolation  its easy to be superstitious here he resumed one feels that human power is limited and loses ones confidence i expect something of the kind accounts for driscolls nervous fears in the city he would have no time to brood hed spend his days in a noisy workshop and his evenings in a crowded tenement or saloon but if hes scared of the dark and loneliness why doesnt he pull out  human natures stubborn a man with a compelling object may be afraid and fight his fears  id like to know what driscolls object is since the night in his shack when the fellow was sick ive wondered why stranges canoe capsized strange was a clever voyageur sos black steve  father lucien looked at him curiously and there was a hint of shrinking in his eyes i cannot tell perhaps we shall never know but if there was foul play what would driscoll gain  its hard to see thirlwell agreed i could understand it if steve had afterwards staked a claim but nobody has found the ore yet theres another curious thing i dont see what hed gain by leaving you to starve as i think he meant to do  no said father lucien sharply that is impossible besides driscoll was trapping some distance off  a white man stood looking down at you and then stole away although he saw you had no camp outfit thirlwell insisted  he may have been short of food and came to borrow seeing i had none he was perhaps afraid to share any he had left with me  thirlwell shook his head i havent met a prospector who would let a white man starve theyre a rough but generous lot in fact the only man i know whos capable of the thing is driscoll  father lucien did not answer and presently lay down but thirlwell sat for a time thinking while he dried his moccasins the missionary was something of an idealist although he knew the weaknesses of human nature but thirlwell was practical somehow he had got entangled in the complications that sprang from stranges supposititious discovery of the ore but he did not want to break loose agatha strange needed him she had admitted that there was nobody else to whom she could look for help and advice so far he could find no clue to the web of mystery that surrounded the matter and had caught them both but he meant to search  when the moccasins were dry he began to wonder why he was anxious to help the girl since he was not in love with her in a sense it was perhaps his duty but this did not account for his keenness he gave it up and after throwing some branches on the fire lay down and went to sleep  the fire was low and gave out no light when he wakened he felt cold and remembered with some annoyance that he had not gathered enough wood to last until morning he had not brought his watch partly because he had fastened a small compass on the chain but he knew that day would not break for some hours yet the mist was thinner although it had not gone and looking up he guessed the moons height by the elusive glimmer in the haze it was about four oclock and he imagined he had wakened when the heat of his body had sunk to its lowest but was not altogether satisfied since he had slept undisturbed by much keener frost  for all that it was a nuisance to get up and look for dead branches in the dark and he waited reluctant to throw off his blanket for some minutes and then roused himself with a jerk he imagined he heard voices out on the lake he glanced at father lucien but the latter was fast asleep thirlwell wondered whether he himself had gone to sleep again and dreamed but halfconsciously fixed his eyes on the opening that commanded a view of the lake he could see it indistinctly a smooth white plain running back into the dark the snow caught a faint reflection although the moon was hidden but nothing broke the even surface  then thirlwell got up abruptly for he heard a shout it sounded as if somebody had given an order and he felt disturbed there was he knew no ground for this the few white trappers and prospectors who now and then entered the wilds were for the most part goodhumored sociable men the metis and indians were friendly indeed the proper line was for him to invite the strangers to share his camp but he hesitated he had got suspicious since he promised to help in the search for stranges silver and trappers and indians did not travel at night  as he pondered the matter a dark object came out of the misty background on the lake it was indistinct but by its height and slow movements he knew it was a man it vanished presently where the pines cut off his view but three others followed after an interval two apparently hauling a loaded sledge they crossed the stretch of ice that thirlwell could see and when the trees shut them out he forgot to gather wood and lighted his pipe  the hazy figures had an unsubstantial ghostly look he might have imagined he had not really seen them had he not heard the leaders shout then it was hard to see why they were traveling in the dark since they must leave the ice soon and the trail was rough he thought their leader knew the country because their coming down the lake indicated that they had taken a short but difficult line from the settlements but one would expect a man who knew the country to make for and stop at the mine which was not far off thirlwell hoped to reach it next day and wondered whether the others meant to pass it at night if so it would indicate that they did not want to be seen  when he had smoked out his pipe he gathered some wood and then as father lucien had not wakened thought he would look for the others trail and see which way they had gone they were traveling north but two routes the indians used started from the head of the lake he found the marks of the sledgerunners and then noted with a thrill of excitement that there was something curious about one of the mens tracks the steps were uneven one impression was sharper than the other  imagining that the party would camp soon thirlwell determined to follow and presently came to a rough slope where the trail left the ice caution was now needed because he could not see far and might be heard if he made much noise in pushing through the bush the silence that brooded over the woods indicated that the others had stopped the pines were small and tangled but he could see where the sledge had gone and when he reached the summit a gleam of light sprang up in the valley below thirlwell thought the man who made the fire had chosen the spot well if he meant its light to be hidden  the wood was thin on the slope he went down and it was difficult to keep in the gloom the glimmering moonlight was brighter and his figure would be visible against the snow as he crossed the openings when he was some distance from the fire he stopped and studied his line of approach  the men were moving about on his side of the fire their figures were distinct but he could not see their faces and if he crossed the belt of rather open ground the light would fall on him if he could creep up on the other side the fire would be between them and shining in the mens faces prevent their seeing far the trouble was that the wood behind the camp looked tangled and thick and he doubted if he could get through without making a noise something however must be risked and stealing across the opening to the next tree he presently reached a belt of thicker wood  he could not be seen now but he made a circuit round the fire before he began to approach it from the other side his progress was slow and he felt anxious because it was possible that the men had moved round the fire while he struggled through the bush still he thought they had not done so because he had seen one throwing up a snowbank behind which they meant to sleep they would probably cook their meal and sit down on that side in the shelter of the bank when he left the thick bush he saw that his reasoning was good but he had yet to get near enough and the fire was burning well there was not much wind but the red blaze leaped up and sank throwing out clouds of sparks while a trail of smoke drifted about the camp the resinous wood however crackled fiercely and he hoped this would drown the noise he made  there was nothing to hide him for some distance and then a patch of juniper scrub and some willows ran towards the camp if he could reach them he would be safe and he crawled across the open space and lay behind the first juniper while he got his breath there was nothing to indicate that the others had heard him and a few minutes later he stopped again at the edge of a gap where a fire had run through the scrub he could see the men though he could not distinguish their faces one seemed to be looking in his direction and thirlwell felt his heart beat but did not move he had a background of dark bushes and it was wiser to keep still than drop into the snow  presently the man stooped as if to pick up something and thirlwell stealing forward sank down among the willows they rustled as he crept between their stems but the fire was snapping furiously and after he had gone a few yards he thought he was near enough rising nearly upright he pushed the dry branches aside since they broke his outline it would be hard to see him by the unsteady light  the flames tossed and wavered throwing a fierce red glow about the camp pinetrunks and snowbank stood out sharply from the shadow and faded again the light played on the mens faces for a few moments and then left them blurred and dim thirlwell waited until one threw on some branches and a blaze and cloud of sparks sprang up the glare touched the fellows face and thirlwell thrilled with excitement as he saw it was driscoll  he did not know the others but one had a rather pale color as if he had come from the cities and his furcoat looked new and good the sledge carried an unusually heavy load and among the provision bags he noted some iron drills and a small wooden box such as giantpowder is packed in it was a prospecting party and he had seen enough  creeping back into the scrub he set off for camp when he got there father lucien was asleep and when they resumed the march next morning thirlwell told him nothing about the other party he thought the missionary had difficulties enough of his own without being involved in the trouble that seemed to follow all who had anything to do with stranges silver lode     chapter xiii  the prospectors return   it was snowing but there was no wind and the shack was warm when on the evening after his return thirlwell sat smoking by the stove now and then a mass of snow rumbled down the iron roof near the spot where the hot pipe went through and the draughts had lost their former sting the air in the room felt different it was not humid yet but one no longer noticed the harsh dryness that is caused by intense frost the long arctic winter was coming to an end  by and by scott sitting opposite thirlwell said thoughtfully driscolls outfit will have to hustle if they mean to do much prospecting and get back while the ice is good ill give them a month and if theyre not out then theyll have trouble  thirlwell made a sign of agreement rivers and lakes are numerous in the north and in winter one can travel smoothly on the ice when the latter rots and cracks voyageurs and prospectors wait until the melting snow sweeps the grinding floes away and canoes can be launched to push through tangled bush and across soft muskegs costs heavy labor  they were taking up a big load and couldnt march fast he said  i understand you dont know stormont  i know his characterand unless hes badly slandered thats enough i havent met him but im nearly sure it was a city man i saw in driscolls camp  stormonts indicated scott replied i reckon driscoll went to him because he needed capital but he wouldnt put another fellow on the track if we take it for granted that he did go the mystery about stranges letters is cleared up its characteristic that stormont tried to steal them before he made miss strange his offer  in a way its curious that he did make an offer  scott smiled he didnt run much risk it would be hard to frame an agreement out of which stormont couldnt wriggle ive met the fellow and brinsmead has grounds for knowing his methods anyhow its plain that he thinks it worth while to spend some money in trying to find the lode and on such matters his judgment is said to be pretty good then i imagine black steve knows more about stranges prospecting trips than you suspect  my notion is that nobody knows much about the lode  well said scott it looks like that strange is dead and i dont imagine he took black steve very far into his confidence though he may have given him a hint when he was drunk but theres another man whom nobody seems to have thought of yet  whos that  the hudsons bay agent at the factory where strange was employed strange was young then and was probably frank and enthusiastic about his find i daresay he gave the agent all the particulars he could recollect when he saw the fellow doubted his tale his memory was no doubt pretty good since hed seen the lode a week or two before  they have pulled down the factory and i expect the agents dead thirlwell replied if not he must be an old man and i dont know where he is im not persuaded yet that strange did find the ore but if it hadnt snowed id have followed stormonts trail it would be interesting to know where he means to look  he frowned as he lighted his pipe because it was too late to satisfy his curiosity the prospectors had vanished into the trackless desolation and now deep snow had fallen the wilds would hide them well scott pondered for a few minutes and then resumed you mean to help miss strange put this matter over although you dont believe in the lode  yes said thirlwell ive promised her  then youre up against two hard men who have got a start and one of them is dangerous  black steve well i believe he meant to leave father lucien to starve but i dont see why  you need help yourself scott rejoined dryly when driscoll was ill and delirious he talked in a curious way and when he got better may have had some recollection of being badly scared if so i expect he imagined he said more than he did and had so to speak given himself away as a matter of fact he said enough to be suspicious since he was delirious he probably didnt know you were there and it might be prudent not to let him know its possible he thought father lucien knew too much and saw his opportunity of getting rid of him  thirlwell started it is possible im glad i told you about my watch at the shack i didnt at first the things i suspected looked ridiculous  in future you had better tell me all you can my opinion is that you have undertaken a very tough job for all that im getting curious about the lode and would rather like to have a stake in the venture if miss strange agrees when she comes up  she wont agree unless she finds the ore then of course shed need help and money  very well said scott and they talked about something else  for some weeks they said nothing more about the silver vein part of the roof of the main heading in the mine came down and they had afterwards to contend with a dangerous flow of water extra timbering was needed and the men risked their lives as they wedged the props under the cracking beams while now and then they worked for a shift with buckets to help the clanging pump their clothes were always wet and they were generally smeared with mud when they came up to eat and sleep the miners grumbled and scott and thirlwell felt the mental and physical strain they were highly strung and often irritable while when they sat by the stove when work was over they only talked about the difficulties they had struggled with all day and others that must be met in the morning  in the meantime the thaw began the snow softened and got honeycombed by the drops from the trees one sank to the knees in trampled slush among the sawnoff stumps about the shafthead the ice rotted and in places where the current ran fast large floes broke off and drove down stream until they were stopped by the thick ice in the slacks above the shadow rapids however there was for a time no break in the frozen surface and one evening scott and thirlwell sat listening to the growl of the rising flood in the open channel it had made near the mine the sound swelled and sank and at intervals they heard rain patter on the roof  in a week or two the canoes will be out scott remarked theres a big head of water coming down and i guess the jamb thats backing up the stream wont stand till morning  some of its going now thats an extra large floe said thirlwell as a detonating crash rang across the woods then there was a roar that was pierced by a high strident note and he knew the floe was tearing open upon a rock  the shrill scream died away but the turmoil of the current swelled and knowing what would happen soon they waited with strained attention and let their pipes go out the mine buildings stood back from the bank and they ran no risk but nobody can listen unmoved when the ice breaks up on a river of the north  presently there was a deafening concussion like the shock when a giant gun is fired the shack trembled as if struck by a battering ram and thirlwell felt his nerves tingle after the concussion came a roar that grew into an overwhelming din and they braced themselves against the strain one could not bear that appalling noise very long it subsided a little into a confusion of jarring sounds that were sometimes distinguishable and sometimes drowned each other massy floes shocked and smashed and tore apart upon the ledges with a noise like the ripping of woven fabric others lifted out of the water ground across those that stuck fast and some crashed against the rocky bank throwing huge blocks among the pines  this lasted for a time and then the uproar got bearable and gradually sank there were intervals when one could hear the turmoil of the liberated flood as it rolled by in swollen fury the intervals lengthened and by and by thirlwell got on his feet with a sigh of relief  you never get used to hearing the ice break up its tremendous he said this is a very stern country sometimes it frightens one  he stopped abruptly and listened the uproar was sinking fast and in a lull he heard footsteps outside then the door was pushed open and a man staggered in his furcoat was torn and muddy his feet came through his pulp moccasins and the water that drained from him made a pool on the floor three others followed and stood dripping in the light while scott and thirlwell gazed at them then the first dropped into a chair and leaned his arms on the table as if overcome by fatigue his face was gaunt and his eyes were half shut  the boss is pretty well used up said one of the others and scott crossed the floor  stormont he said you look as if you had been up against it hard  stormont lifted his head and thirlwell thought his eyes got like a wolfs  im starving no food the last two days  not much before one of the rest remarked  been on mighty short rations since we hit the backtrail had a tough job to make it had to leave our blankets and truck  we can give you a meal and a place to sleep but where have you been  up north another answered vaguely and scott recognizing his caution smiled as he turned to the last of the party who stood near the door  you look fresher than the others steve however youre used to the country and i expect you brought your partners down  thats so driscoll growled didnt think theyd make it theyre a tenderfooted crowd  in the meantime thirlwell studied the fellow driscoll was wet and ragged his face was thin but inscrutably sullen unlike the rest he did not look overcome by fatigue when scott spoke he gave him a dull glance and then fixed his eyes on the floor thirlwell had noted something unusual in his comrades manner scotts voice had an ironical note and his look did not indicate much sympathy in the north a demand for food is seldom refused but scott obviously meant to be satisfied with supplying the partys urgent needs with this thirlwell agreed  then scott said to driscoll you had better take your friends to the bunkhouse and tell the cook to make you supper you know where to get blankets  stormont got up with an effort and when he went out with the others scott smiled  im not going back on my duty but i dont want that outfit in my shack he said  next morning after breakfast stormont came in he had to some extent recovered from his fatigue but looked worn and dispirited  i guess i owe you some thanks he said  i dont know if you do or not scott answered coolly in the bush a starving man is so to speak entitled to ask for food and shelter i couldnt refuse  stormont gave him a keen glance well theres another thing its a long trail to the railroad and i want to buy stores enough to see us out  then i suppose i must let you have supplies but you cant expect to get them as cheap as at the settlements in fact youll have to pay my price  that neednt break the deal stormont replied i know when theres no use in kicking  an unsuccessful prospecting trip is an expensive undertaking scott said meaningly then theres the disappointment you would have got a big lift if youd been lucky enough to find miss stranges silver  the silver is not miss stranges the law gives a mineral vein to the person who stakes it off and records it first  that is so scott agreed well you dont look as if you had staked a valuable claim i suppose you stopped too long trying to find the vein and the ice was unsafe when you left however you want supplies to carry you down to the settlement and if youll come along to the store well see what ive got  they went out and in the afternoon stormonts party took the trail to the south     chapter xiv  stormont disowns a debt   the general store was empty and drummond leaning on the counter frowned as he glanced at the clock it was a few minutes after the time for closing and he had been busily occupied all day besides he had an engagement at the poolroom and thought he would be late if so a man whom he knew he could beat would probably begin a game with somebody else and he would miss an opportunity of winning two or three dollars this was annoying because drummond needed the money but he had other grounds for feeling dissatisfied  keeping store was monotonous and rather humiliating work that left one very little time for amusement he could drive a fast horse as well as other young men he met up town play a clever card game and beat his friends at pool his talents were obviously wasted in measuring drygoods and weighing flour moreover since meeting stormont he had been extravagant and got into debt there was no need to be economical when he had been promised a share in a rich mining claim  then he wondered with misgivings what the farmer who had gone into the back office was talking about and hearing angry voices felt sorry he had made some alterations in the mans order certain stale goods carried a commission if the salesman could work them off but the thing needed tact and a knowledge of the customers temper drummond feared he had been imprudent  in the meantime he looked about the store with a feeling of disgust the long room with its cracked board walls and dusty floor was uncomfortably warm and smelt of hot iron drygoods and old cheese drummond had neglected to regulate the draught when he filled the rusty stove and now felt that one could not expect a spirited young man to spend his days in such a place anyhow it was after closing time and sitting on the counter he lighted a cigarette letting it stick to his under lip this was the latest fashion and gave one a sporting look soon after he began to smoke the farmer came out of the office  you can send for the truck when you like ive no use for goods like that he said next time you pack me a dud lot ill cut out your account if you and the sporting guy whos sitting on your counter thought me a sucker i guess ive put you wise  he went down the steps into the street and the lean hardfaced storekeeper turned to drummond with an ominous frown  get off that counter you make me tired to look at you with your dude clothes and a cigarroot hanging out of your mouth throw the blamed thing away and put up the canned stuff you left about  drummond felt tempted to refuse but his employers eye was on him and he obeyed sullenly  when youve finished you can clean up that row of shelves the other resumed then stack the flour and sugar bags where theyre kept guess you reckoned to leave the truck all night where the transfer man dumped it if you cant serve a customer ill see you keep the store straight  drummond imagined the work would occupy him for an hour and might spoil his clothes besides if he gave way his employer might make fresh encroachments on his evenings and he thought the fellow wanted to goad him to revolt  no sir he said its closing time im going to quit  if you quit now you quit for good dont know why ive kept you anyway  i know said drummond who resolved to be firm if his employer really meant to get rid of him he risked nothing but if not he might win some advantage you couldnt get another clerk to take my job for the wages you pay  well said the other grimly im willing to try its a sure thing i couldnt get a man whod muss up the store like you come to me for your money and light out when you like  he went out banging the door and drummond sat down rather limply on a drygoods bale after all it was something of a shock to find himself dismissed but in a few minutes he gathered confidence stormont had given him fifty dollars and promised him a share in the silver mine and although he had soon spent the money he would go to winnipeg ask for another payment and see what progress the fellow was making if the vein had not yet been located stormont would no doubt find him a job in fact the only trouble was that when he had bought his ticket he would not have enough money left to pay his bill at the boardinghouse  four days later he left the town and reaching winnipeg one afternoon began to inquire about stormont in the great domed marblepaved waitingroom to his surprise the officials he questioned knew nothing about the man and when one sent him to the inquiry office the fashionably dressed lady clerk was ignorant she however threw a directory on the counter and told him haughtily that he could look for the address  drummond found it and walking along main street turned up portage avenue there was a block of traffic at the corner where the broad roads cross and close by a crowd had gathered to read the bulletins on the front of a newspaper office stopping for a few minutes drummond studied the row of tall buildings but saw that the number he wanted was farther on there was however an imposing block some distance ahead but this turned out to be a huge department store and afterwards the buildings got smaller and plainer it began to look as if stormont was not as important a man as he had thought and he was conscious of some disappointment as he went on until he stopped where private houses workshops and shabby stores ran out towards deer park then he found the number and entered a narrow dingy building  it was obvious that stormont had studied economy when he chose his office and drummond stopped and hesitated on a landing opposite a door that badly needed painting he began to think he had been rash in leaving his post in the ontario town but nerving himself with the reflection that he had a share in a silver vein knocked at the door somebody told him to come in and he walked into a small room  the dirty walls were hung with plans of building lots and surveys of the forest belt in eastern manitoba a glass partition ran up the middle and on one side watson sat in front of a typewriter he looked at drummond with surprise but did not get up  well he said why have you come to town have you got a week off or have you got fired  you ought to know what ive come about but i want to see the boss drummond rejoined  thats easy anyhow said watson with a grin drummond did not like and indicated a door in the partition  drummond opened the door and saw stormont sitting at a table covered with papers he looked up and nodded coolly  hallo he said mr drummond isnt it sit down for a few minutes  then picking up a letter he knitted his brows he did not think drummond could give him much trouble but he might become something of a nuisance unless he was dealt with firmly stormont had not long since come back from the north feeling disappointed and savage for he had spent a good deal of money on the expedition besides things had gone wrong at the office while he was away and he had lost some profitable business  what can i do for you he asked by and by  ive left the store said drummond thought id locate in winnipeg one has better chances in the big cities and i reckoned you could find me a job anyhow ill need some money  thats a sure thing but why did you come to me for it  you gave me fifty dollars  when did i give you fifty dollars stormont interrupted with a look of surprise  the evening watson took me to your room at the dufferin house besides you promised me a share in the mine  stormont smiled that accounts for the thing im afraid you were drunker than i thought  you did give me the money drummond insisted are you trying to go back on your promise  oh well said stormont with an indulgent smile in order to satisfy you well ask watson he knocked on the partition and turned to the clerk as the latter came in mr drummond states that i gave him fifty dollars on the evening you brought him to the dufferin house do you remember anything about it  certainly not said watson you gave him a cigar and some liquor though i thought hed had enough he fell down the stairs afterwards and made trouble for me when i saw him home watson paused and resumed with a meaning smile its pretty hard to remember what happens when youve got on a big jag  drummond colored angrily but pulled himself together i remember i got the money and told mr stormont about the ore  now i come to think of it you did tell me a curious story about a mysterious silver lode stormont agreed somewhere in the north wasnt it anyhow i didnt give the thing much attention you can hear tales of that kind in any miners saloon  thats so watson supported him sometimes we hear them in this office when a crank prospector comes along all the same theyre not business propositions  you promised me a share in the mine drummond declared and added with dark suspicion i guess you found the ore  stormont laughed ironically cut it out mr drummond its a sure thing i havent found a silver lode  if youre going to turn me down ill try somebody else  i cant object in fact i dare say watson will give you the addresses of some people who speculate on mining claims but you mustnt be disappointed if they fire you out  drummonds face got red and he clenched his fist for he had already told his tale to people who heard it with amused incredulity  you promised you would make me rich and ive thrown up my job ive got about five dollars and dont know what to do  well said stormont coolly theres an employment agent a few blocks up the street and as trades pretty good its possible he can find you a post thats about the only thing i can think of and im occupied just now  drummond stopped him with a savage gesture and walked out of the room  we have fixed him i guess he wont bother us again stormont remarked  after leaving the office drummond wandered moodily along the avenue and presently came to a square past which rows of pretty wooden houses surrounded by poplars ran towards the river bank the snow had gone the afternoon was warm and finding a bench in the sun he sat down to think his character was complex and his thoughts involved for he had inherited something from ancestors of different type a touch of indian vanity and french expansiveness was balanced by his fathers scottish caution and the indians stolid calm sometimes he was rash and impulsive and sometimes strangely patient but he seldom forgot an injury  it was obvious that he had been cheated and in the meantime could get no satisfaction for the wrong he had been done what he knew about the silver ore was worth something while he alone had the secret but now he had told somebody else its value had disappeared it was however a comfort to reflect that he had not been altogether frank with stormont he had kept something back that would be a useful guide when one looked for the creek his recollection of this was hazy but he would think about it later  on the whole drummond thought stormont had not found the ore a hint of anger in his ironical amusement implied that he had come back disappointed and if he imagined he had got on the right track he would no doubt have been willing to pay another fifty dollars for all that watson and stormont had plotted to win his confidence make him drunk and find out all he knew and this indicated that the fellow thought the vein worth looking for when stormont got over his disappointment he would try again  drummond saw that he could embarrass stormont by selling the secret he had been cheated of to somebody else it was amusing to think of two parties looking for the vein the difficulty was that he did not know anybody likely to be a buyer but he could wait since it looked as if he had put stormont off the track and by and by he might find a speculator willing to believe his tale sooner than let stormont locate the vein he would give for nothing any antagonist of the latters all the help he could  then he remembered that he had only a few dollars and must find some work soon supper would not be served at the cheap hotels for an hour yet and he set off to look for an employment agent the man charged a dollar and gave him a card with an address remarking that drummond ought to get a job as business was good drummond went back up the avenue and presenting the card at a big store was engaged for a week and promised a post afterwards if the department boss was satisfied     chapter xv  the grand rapid   bright moonlight touched the river streaking the angry water with a silver track when scott and thirlwell poled against the stream in the gloom of the wooded bank the shadow swollen by melted snow rolled by in flood swirling along the stony beach in lines of foam and tossing about battered trunks brought down by winter storms farther down stream a shimmering haze of spray indicated the grand rapid and thirlwell meant to stem the current until they were far enough from the foaming turmoil to paddle across the gray trout were shy that evening and they had let the canoe drift farther than they thought presently somebody hailed them from the bank and as they let the canoe swing round in an eddy a dark figure moved out from the gloom of the pines  driscolls voice i think said scott head her inshore well see what he wants  it transpired that driscoll wanted them to take him across he had left his small canoe some distance down stream because he thought he might be drawn into the rapid before he could reach the other bank scotts canoe was larger and with three men on board they could easily make head against the current  i guess weve got to take him scott remarked give her a push and run her in behind the rock  when the canoe grounded driscoll got on board and picked up a pole as there was not another thirlwell paddled in the stern while they pushed the craft through the slack it was hard work and he noted how slowly the pines rolled past by and by they reached an angrywhite rush of current between an island and the bank and as they could scarcely make progress scott suggested putting down the poles and paddling across driscoll however grumbled that they were not far enough up stream and getting out when they ran the canoe close to the driftwood that washed about the shingle tracked her for some distance through the shallow water while the fellow stumbled among the dead branches scott gave thirlwell a meaning look that the latter thought he understood  it was obvious that driscoll was anxious to avoid being swept into the rapid and thirlwell admitted the prudence of this but did not think the danger great enough to account for his rather excessive caution the indians generally shot the rapid when the water was low and although the river was now rolling down in flood it was not impossible for men with steady nerves to take the canoe safely through to the tailpool he wondered whether black steve had been drinking but on the whole did not think he had and admitting that the fellow knew the streams and eddies best let him have his way at length however scott threw down his pole  were far enough and i want my supper he said get hold of the paddles and let her shoot across  driscoll grumbled half aloud but made no determined protest and paddling hard they headed obliquely for the opposite bank as they forged through the glittering water the current swept them down and thirlwell noted that it was running faster than he had thought the river was wide and the ragged pines got indistinct as they rolled back up stream it looked as if the canoe were standing still and the banks moving on only that the gleaming spraycloud got rapidly nearer it stretched across from bank to bank and a dull roar that rose and fell came out of the wavering mist for the most part the current was smooth but here and there broken lines of foam streaked its surface and sometimes the canoe swung round in revolving eddies  still the dark rocks ahead got nearer and at length driscoll made a sign that they could stop paddling he occupied the stern where he could steer the craft thirlwell feeling breathless after his efforts was glad to stop and looked about as he knelt in the middle he had often thought it was from the river one best marked the savage austerity of the wilderness in the bush ones view was broken by rocks and trunks but from the wide expanse of water one could look across the belt of forest that ran back desolate and silent to hudson bay here and there the hazy outline of a rocky height caught the eye but for the most part the landscape had no charm of varied beauty it was monotonous somber and forbidding  the canoe was now thirty or forty yards from the rough bank and drifting fast driscoll obviously meant to land on a patch of shingle lower down which was the only safe spot for some distance at lowwater one could run a canoe aground among the ledges that bordered the slack inner edge of the rapid but when the shadow rose in flood the current broke and boiled furiously among the rocks one faces forward when paddling and while thirlwell watched the dark gaps in the pines open up and close he heard driscoll shout next moment scott leaned over the bow and plunged his arm into the water it looked as if he had dropped his paddle and thirlwell backed his in order to stop the craft  the paddle floated past too far off for driscoll to reach and signing to thirlwell he swung the canoe round but the water was getting broken and they missed the paddle by a yard then they drove her ahead in a semicircle and a minute or two had gone when scott leaning over cautiously seized the paddlehaft in the meantime they had drifted fast and thirlwell saw that that patch of shingle was now up stream  thats awkward scott remarked and the canoe rocked as driscoll dipped his paddle  drive her you have got to make the beach he shouted in a hoarse voice  there was something contagious in the mans alarm and knowing his physical courage thirlwell made his best effort the sweat ran down his face he felt his muscles strain and his sinews crack and the canoes bow lifted as the paddleblades beat the water driscoll leaned far forward to get a longer stroke and urged the others with breathless shouts but the shingle they were heading for slowly slipped away  try along the bank driscoll ordered and thirlwell turning to pick up a pole saw his face in the moonlight it was strangely set and he was not looking at the bank but at the rapid his gaze was fixed and horrified  for some minutes they scarcely held the craft against the stream indeed thirlwell afterwards wondered why they kept it up since it was obvious that they could not reach the landing but imagined that driscoll urged them the fellow seemed resolved not to be drawn into the rapid  we cant make it ive got to let up scott gasped at length and thirlwell breathing hard wiped his wet face as the canoe drove away  it was galling to be beaten and there was some danger unless the craft was handled well steadiness and skill were needed but after all the risk was not greater than he had often run in the mine and on the frozen trail the daunting thing was that driscoll whom they had expected to steer the canoe looked afraid he crouched astern paddling in a slack nerveless manner there was no chance of landing now they must run through the mad turmoil into the eddies of the tailpool  the roar of the flood rolled in confused echoes along the wall of pines angry waves broke upon the reefs near the bank and a cloud of spray wavered and glittered above a tossing line of foam they were drifting towards the line extraordinarily fast and thirlwell felt his nerves tingle as he tried to brace himself there was ground for being daunted but he thought he would not have felt much disturbed had driscoll not looked afraid  then scott kneeling in the bow turned and after a quick glance at driscoll said keep as cool as you can partner steves badly rattled and cant be trusted  a minute or two afterwards they plunged over the edge of the rapid the air got cold and the light got dim for a wind blew against the rush of water and the spray hid the moon still they could see for a distance and thirlwell frankly shrank as he glanced ahead the river was broken by ridges of leaping foam that ran one behind the other with narrow gaps between whiteringed eddies span along the bank and the tops of dark rocks rose out of the turmoil moreover there were rocks in the channels and one must strain ones eyes for the upheavals that marked sunken shoals driscoll knew the reefs and eddies and while they plunged down like a toboggan thirlwell risked a glance astern the mans eyes were fixed on the river but his pose was slack it was plain that he had not recovered and they could expect no help from him thirlwell drew a deep breath and gripped his paddle hard  he could never remember much about the next few minutes sometimes he shouted to scott and thought scott called to him as a wedge of stone suddenly split the rushing foam and sometimes when the current boiled in fierce rebound from a hidden obstacle the canoe plunged until the water stood up above her bows and now and then leaped out half her length when they dared they checked her with a backstroke as some danger loomed ahead but oftener drove her faster than the current to steer her round a reef or dark revolving pool yet for the most part she must be kept straight down stream for if she swerved across a breaking wave its crest would curl on board and bear her down  thirlwell was vaguely conscious that his hand had galled and bled but this did not matter the trouble was that the sweat ran into his eyes and he could not see distinctly he felt his heart thump and his breath come hard but braced himself against the lurching and tried not to miss a stroke if he did so scott paddling in the bow would swing her round and next moment they would be in the water  in the meantime he was conscious of a curious fierce excitement but had braved danger too often to indulge the feeling it led to hot rashness and judgment and quick but calm decision were needed now he must concentrate all the power of his mind as well as the strength of his body on taking the canoe down to the tailpool  she shipped some water on the way and they could not bail it washed about their knees as the frail craft plunged and thirlwell wondered anxiously how much she would carry without capsizing the rocks and pines ashore now streamed past blurred and indistinct but he had seldom an opportunity for glancing at the bank he must look ahead and every now and then his view was shortened by a ridge of tumbling foam  somehow she came through halfswamped and swung down the savage fanshaped rush that spread in white turmoil across the tailpool paddling hard they drove her out of the eddies that circled along the bank and finding a slack ran her on to a shingle beach then they sat down wet and exhausted to recover breath driscoll helped to pull the canoe up but when thirlwell presently looked about he could not see him  hes gone scott remarked dryly lit out while you were taking off your boots  thirlwell imagined that the roar of the river had drowned the fellows steps but he did not want to talk about driscoll yet and when he put on his boots which had been full of water they started for the shack after they had changed their clothes scott sat down and lighted his pipe  what do you think was the matter with black steve he asked  it looked as if hed taken some liquor but i dont know thirlwell answered he was obviously scared  sure said scott but he wasnt scared of getting drowned steves a better canoe hand than either of us and has physical pluck  then why was he afraid  scott looked thoughtful i imagine he was afraid of the rapid and the dark when he hailed us to take him over i thought it an excuse he could have got across in his own canoe if he had braced up my notion is he didnt want to make the trip by himself he paused and gave thirlwell a keen glance curious isnt it  hes a curious man said thirlwell who had dark suspicions that he did not want to talk about when we were drifting into the rapid i got a glimpse of his face and didnt look again thought id better not the fellows nerve had gone anyhow if he hates the rapid why does he stop here and live near the bank  steve is primitive i guess you dont understand him yet hes an old trapper and one gets superstitious in the bush for all that hes stubborn and if he has an object hell persist until he carries it out  but what object has he got  scott made a vague gesture i cant tell you that hadnt you better get out the plates i want some food  thirlwell put a fryingpan on the stove and they talked about something else     chapter xvi  the pitprop   driscoll was sorting pitprops throwing them on to piles at the bottom of the shaft when thirlwell stopped to hook a small flat lamp to his hat the man sometimes worked in the mine for a few weeks when the trapping season was over and scott was generally willing to engage him because he was skilful with the axe and labor was scarce he made no friends among the men and gave thirlwell a sour look without speaking when the latter picked up his lamp  thirlwell went on down the inclined gallery water splashed upon his slickers and trickled about his feet the tunnel was narrow and the air was foul here and there a smoky light burned among the props lining the walls and the dim illumination touched the beams that crossed the roof but the gaps between the spots were dark the timbers were numerous and where one could see a short distance ran on into the gloom in rows so closely spaced that they seemed continuous  by and by thirlwell found scott looking up at a massive beam a few inches overhead the beam was not quite level and the prop beneath one end had bent while a threatening crack extended across the roof  we may have a bad fall here scott remarked the props getting shaky and the pressures pretty fierce i reckon wed better shore her up as quick as we can its lucky our lumber doesnt cost us much  thirlwell examined the crack and thought it dangerous there were one or two transverse splits which indicated a heavy mass of rock was ready to come down none of the men were near the spot and he knew they were occupied but driscoll had left a few props between the timbers ready for use where the roof was weak thirlwell found one and dragged it to the spot  well put this up and then i think ill get a fresh beam across  scott helped him to raise the timber it was a few inches too long and crossed the space between floor and roof with a small slant but it was meant to do so in order that when its lower end was driven forward until it stood upright it would wedge fast the beam above then thirlwell brought an ax and struck the prop some heavy blows with its back while scott steadied the top it was almost in place and the bent timber was getting loose when the top slipped and shook the beam there was an ominous crack and a few small stones broke away and fell on scotts head  ive got her butted solid now he shouted after a short breathless struggle with the timber be quick the roofs coming down  thirlwell saw the danger so long as the prop slanted it would not support the beam and if the beam gave way the roof would fall and crush them before they could get from underneath he thought he had a few moments to hammer the prop straight and swung the ax savagely while the sweat ran down his face he dared not look up again but the ominous cracking went on and while he wondered what was happening driscoll ran past a big stone fell beside the man as he seized another prop and with a tense effort jambed it under the beam  ill take some weight off her while you shore her up driscoll gasped  he had brought a heavy mallet but before he used this he dragged the foot of the timber round bending his body forward while his arms got stiff and hard as if carved from wood his sullen face was darkly flushed and the swollen veins stood out from his forehead thirlwell saw him for a moment as he lifted his ax and remembering the scene afterwards thought the fellow had looked a model of savage strength it was obvious that he had no fear  in the meantime he was vaguely conscious that driscoll had saved his life he and scott had stayed too long and could not have fixed their prop before the beam gave way had not the other come to help for that matter they were not out of danger yet unless they could wedge the timber in the next few moments the roof would come down there was not room to swing the ax properly his body was cramped from bending and he could not lift his head stooping in the low tunnel he nerved himself for a tense effort and struck several furious blows the prop quivered groaned as it felt the pressure from above moved an inch or two and stood upright then thirlwell dropped his ax and staggered back he felt limp and exhausted and wanted to get away the beam would hold the roof for some minutes and might do so for a time  you can let up now driscoll scott called out when they stopped a few yards off well see if the prop will stand before we do anything else  guess ill fix the other driscoll replied  come out scott insisted you dont know if its safe  driscoll glanced round for a moment his hat had fallen off and the miners lamp flared and smoked in the water at his feet his hair was wet with the drops from the roof and a thin streak of blood ran down his face from a cut a falling stone had made but his heavy eyes had a fixed obstinate look  you hired me to mind the timbers its my job  scott acquiesced with a gesture and he and thirlwell watched there was a risk that in wedging the extra prop the man might loosen the first and then if neither was able to bear the load the rock above would fall and bury him for all that driscoll looked undisturbed and did not stop until he had carefully driven the timber into its proper place then he turned to scott and his glance was slow and dull  i want you to send two of the boys along  why do you want them  ive got to have some help she wont hold up long unless we run another beam across  it would be prudent thirlwell agreed and went down the gallery with scott to the working face  what do you think of black steve scott asked when they had sent the men and stood near a lamp he wasnt scared just now  im puzzled said thirlwell thoughtfully the fellow was quite cool if he hadnt come with the prop i expect the roof would have buried us but thats another thing why did he come  scott smiled we were plainly in some danger but i dont imagine black steve was moved by a generous impulse to save our lives in fact if it had promised him some advantage i rather think hed have seen us buried  you dont claim it was a sense of duty  not in a way steves too primitive on the whole i think he explained the thing best when he said it was his job a fellow of his kind doesnt reason like you perhaps he did once but lost the habit in the bush hes so to speak atavistic moved by instincts like the indians and animals  but i dont see  perhaps it isnt very obvious scott admitted for all that the indians instinctive obstinacy carries him far steve had undertaken to look after our timbering hes used to danger and the risk didnt count i expect he was moved by the feeling the bushman gets when hes up against nature he knows hell be crushed if he cant make good anyhow ive moralized long enough will you see what theyre doing with that rockborer  thirlwell left him and went to the machine which made a jarring noise he spent some time adjusting the cutters and afterwards stood for a few minutes thinking about what his comrade had said scotts argument was involved but thirlwell thought he saw what he meant driscolls bemused mind could not grasp the thought of duty that demanded selfsacrifice but he had animal courage and stubbornness he would carry out what he had undertaken moreover he might have animal cunning without having cultivated intelligence and his strength and resolution made him dangerous thirlwell did not like driscoll better than before but it looked as if the fellow had saved his life and although he might not have meant to do so this counted for something going back to the shaft presently he climbed up and sat down in the sun  a warm wind blew across the pine woods the sun was getting hot and the wet grounds about the shafthead was drying fast the river had risen as the lakes in the wilds it came from overflowed with melted snow and raged level with its banks in angry flood rolling broken trees down stream and strewing ledges and shingle with battered branches its hoarse roar echoed across the bush and thirlwell felt that there was something daunting in the deeptoned sound one could understand that a man like driscoll whose brain was dulled by liquor might let it fill him with vague terrors when the woods were still at night  but listening to the river presently led thirlwell to think about strange there was something pathetic about the story of his life for agatha had made thirlwell understand her fathers long patience gentleness and selfsacrifice his duty to his family had cost him much but he had cheerfully paid it looked as if he had done best at the task he most dislikedmanaging the humble store in the small wooden town one could not think of him as having failed there his wife and children loved him though all but one had smiled when he talked about the lode  his daughter who knew him best had inherited his confidence and thirlwell owned that this had some weight she was perhaps influenced by tender sentiment but there was nothing romantic about driscoll and stormont and it looked as if they shared her belief that the lode could be found scott too thought it possible and his judgment was often sound thirlwell had imagined the lode an illusion of stranges but his disbelief was giving way  then he forgot the others and thought about agatha in some ways she was like strange but she was made of finer and stronger stuff she had his patience but her brain was keener and her resolution was backed by moral force moreover she was a very charming girl and thirlwell admitted that he looked forward with eagerness to their journey she would come in summer when the rivers and lakes were open and the woods were filled with resinous smells the sun was hot in the north then the days were often calm and there was a wonderful bracing freshness when the lingering twilight glimmered behind the pines  it would be strangely pleasant to listen to the girls soft voice while the canoes glided smoothly across sparkling lakes and perhaps to tell her stories of the wilds when the smoke of the campfire drifted by and the cry of the loon came out of the shadows for all that there was not much risk of his falling in love with her he was not a sentimentalist and she had told him that her vocation was science her journey was a duty and when the duty was carried out she would concentrate on her studies and as she had talent presently make her mark he did not think she would find the lode but when she was persuaded it could not be found he would no longer be useful and they would go their different ways well he supposed he must acquiesce he was a poor engineer and such happiness as marriage could offer was not for him  then he glanced at his watch and got up with an impatient shrug he had forgotten his work while he thought about the girl and there was much to be done for one thing he had come up to see if the smith had tempered some boring tools and then he must send the metis riverjacks to float a raft of props down to the mine pulling himself together he set about the work with characteristic energy but as he walked through the murmuring woods he unconsciously began to sing a romantic ballad he had learned when a boy presently however he stopped and smiled it looked as if he were getting sentimental and one must guard against that kind of thing     chapter xvii  drummond offers help   it was a calm evening and thirlwell and scott sat outside the shack watching the river while the sunset faded across the woods a few metis freighters had gone to the settlements for supplies and mining tools and although much depended on the condition of the portages scott expected them that night  antoine will bring up our mail he said its some time since miss strange has written to you about her plans  thirlwell said it was nearly three months and scott resumed well i think if id had a part in the business id have tried to find if the hudsons bay agent was alive its possible that he could tell you something about the location of the ore  i dont know that i have any part in the business thirlwell replied i promised to go with miss strange but thats all  if she finds the lode shell need a mining engineer  shell have no trouble in engaging one if the pay is good  but you wouldnt think you had first claim to the post in fact if you helped the girl to find the ore youd be satisfied to drop out and leave her alone  thirlwell frowned he had made no plans for the future and certainly did not mean to trade upon agathas gratitude but he knew it would hurt him so to speak to drop out and let her look for other help  the lode isnt found yet he rejoined  anyhow i feel that the girl or you ought to have got on the agents track scott insisted he knew where strange went and saw him when he returned its possible that strange confused his memory by his subsequent trips but the agent heard his story when the matter was fresh  thirlwell did not answer and scott cut some tobacco when he had finished he looked up the river  the bateaux antoine has made good time  two craft drew out of the shadow of the pines slid down the swift current and presently grounded on a gravel beach they were of the canoe type but larger and their bottoms were flat since they were rather built for carrying goods than paddling fast there was a good water route to the rocky height of land across which the cargo was brought on the freighters backs from a river that joined the wagon trail to the settlements as soon as they landed the crews began to carry up boxes and packages but a young man left the group and came towards the shack he wore neat storeclothes that were not much the worse for the journey and although his skin was somewhat dark looked like a young business man from the cities  which of you is mr thirlwell he asked  i am said thirlwell who are you  ian drummond the boys call me jake a son of hector drummonds of longue sault factory  ah said scott this gets interesting did hector drummond send you  no he died nine years since  scott gave thirlwell a meaning look and turned to the young man  then what do you want  to begin with i want a job  a job said scott with some surprise what can you do  i know nothing about mining but im pretty strong drummond answered giving scott a deerskin bag anyhow mr thirlwell had better read his letter before you hire me antoine the patron brought up your mail  very well said scott the cook will give the boys supper soon and you had better go along come back afterwards  when the lad had gone thirlwell felt pleasantly excited as he opened a letter scott took out of the bag for he saw it was from agatha she told him that drummond had met her in toronto and related how stormont had victimized him the young man stated that he wanted to see the north and would like to get work where he could watch for the prospecting party he thought stormont would send up  i warned him that you may not be able to give him employment but he is keen about going and willing to take the risk she said we can i think trust him to some extent and perhaps he knows enough about my fathers journey to be useful but i cannot tell if it would be prudent to offer him a reward i am glad to feel i can leave this to you and will of course agree to the line you think it proper to take  thirlwell read part of the letter to scott who said miss strange seems to have a flattering confidence in your judgment do you want me to hire the fellow  i dont know yet i wouldnt ask you to engage him unless he could be of use  you neednt hesitate on that ground since were two men short scott answered smiling well suppose we wait until we have talked to him i guess you know this silverlode is getting hold of me  i wonder why  scott laughed you understand machines and rocks to some extent i understand men anyhow i find them interesting and perhaps other peoples firm belief in the lode influences me  by and by drummond came back and scott studied him as he advanced he saw the lad had a strain of indian blood and he knew something about the halfbreeds character they were marked by certain weaknesses but as a rule inherited a slow tenacity from their indian ancestors he had known a man shot through the body walk four hundred miles to reach a doctor and they made the revenging of serious injuries a duty a metis would wait the greater part of a lifetime for a chance of repaying in kind a man who had wronged him drummond looked somewhat dissipated and had a superficial smartness that young men without much education acquire in canadian towns but scott thought him intelligent  sit down he said indicating a short pinestump you want a job is that all  yes said drummond coolly its all i want now if you and mr thirlwell mean to look for the ore and take me along you can give me what you think my help is worth but ive already put miss strange wise  you seem to be pretty trustful how did you find her  my father knew where strange located after he left the factory and i tried to get on the track of his folks when stormont turned me down talked to packinghouse drummers at a department store in winnipeg where i was employed and found a man who sold strange canned goods when he ran a grocery business the drummer had known him pretty well and told me miss strange was in toronto by and by when trade was slack in winnipeg the firm sent some of the clerks to their toronto store and i bothered the department boss until he let me go then i was most a month locating miss strange couldnt find her in the directory and torontos a big town  scott noted the determination that had helped him in his search you knew about the lode for some time he said why did you wait so long  i allowed there wasnt much use in my butting in until i read in a newspaper that strange was drowned besides the drummer reckoned his own folks thought him a crank and there was nothing to his tale all the same when i got tired of keeping store i thought id see what i could do about the lode  i suppose it was because the drummer put you wise that you went to miss strange and not her brother no doubt you tried to interest other people first still as she promised you nothing i dont see why you came here  stormont played me for a sucker found out all i knew and turned me down drummond answered with a savage sparkle in his eyes  scott was silent for a few moments and then looked up you can begin work tomorrow and mr thirlwell will pay you what youre worth well make no further promise but if you like you can tell us anything you think important  miss strange knows said drummond with a curious smile you want to remember that i told stormont the creek runs south she does run south for a piece but she turns and goes down a valley to the east  then its hard to see your object for playing the crook with stormont though i dont suppose hed have done the square thing if you had put him on the right track scott remarked however thats not our business youll find room and some blankets in the bunkhouse  drummond left them and thirlwell said thoughtfully its plain that he deceived stormont by telling him the creek flowed south this would make the fellow think the ore was on our side of the last height of land but if the water goes east it must run into the james bay basin on the other slope thats something of a clue but i see a risk in keeping drummond here suppose he makes friends with driscoll  driscoll doesnt make friends scott rejoined and added with a twinkle then as you dont admit there is a lode its not worth while to wonder whether the lad could tell black steve anything useful  well let that go thirlwell replied and when scott strolled away read agathas letter again with keen satisfaction it was a charming frank letter and he thrilled as he noted her trust in him  drummond went to work next morning and thirlwell allowing for some awkwardness at first thought he would earn his pay while a doubt he had felt about the prudence of engaging him was presently removed going to the smiths shop one afternoon he heard angry voices and stopped to see what was going on the smithy which stood at the edge of the clearing round the mine was a rude log shack without a door it was generally rather dark but just then a ray of sunshine struck in and the charcoal fire on the hearth glowed a dull red the smith leaned on his hammer watching driscoll and drummond who confronted each other close by  driscoll was heavy and muscular drummond wiry and thin but as they stood highly strung thirlwell noted the athletic symmetry of both figures driscoll had no doubt acquired it by travel in the woods and drummond by inheritance from indian forefathers the older mans limbs and body had the fine proportions of a greek statue and since he did not move one could not see that he was lame their faces although different in modeling were somehow alike for both had a curious quiet watchful look they disputed in low voices but thirlwell saw their mood was dangerous he knew that noisy fury seldom marks a struggle in the north where hunting animals and men strike in silence there was something strangely like the stealthy alertness of the animals in their attitudes  waiting in the gloom among the pinetrunks he gathered that the quarrel was about the sharpening of tools drummond had brought some cutters from the boring machine and driscoll wanted his ax ground  i came along first drummond declared toms going to fix my cutters your ax has got to wait he glanced at the smith sharply as if reluctant to move his eyes from driscoll give the wheel a spin and lets get busy  he certainly wont said driscoll ive unshipped the handle youll get your cutters quickest if you quit talking and wait until im through  thats not playing it like a white man dont know why they hired you at the mine your jobs smuggling the indians liquor  your folks sneered driscoll youre not white  stop there said drummond with stern quietness and thirlwell saw him balance a cutter he held it was a short but heavy piece of steel curved at the point  driscolls eyes glittered your father was a squawman your mother  he bent his body with the swift suppleness of an acrobat and the cutter flying past rang upon the wall of the shack then he swung forward and the end of a pickhandle missed drummond by an inch  another cutter shot from drummonds hand and struck driscolls side he stooped and thirlwell thought he was falling but saw that he had bent down to pick up his ax next moment the blade flashed in a long sweep and drummond sprang behind the anvil which occupied the middle of the floor he had another cutter and held it back with his arm bent ready to launch it at driscolls head but thirlwell imagined he was pressed too hard to feel sure of his aim and wanted to get out of his antagonists reach it was plain that the situation was dangerous but thirlwell knew he could not stop the men by shouting and the fight would probably be over before he reached the shack he had however forgotten the smith who pulled a glowing iron from the fire  you can quit now i butt in here he said holding the iron close to driscolls chest then he turned to drummond put that cutter down i dont want to see you killed in my smithy  all were quite still for a moment and then driscoll moved as if he meant to get round the anvil but the smith held him back  try it again and ill surely singe your hide he shouted and swung round as he heard drummonds cautious step if you sling that cutter at him ill put you on the fire get out now im coming to see you go  drummond backed to the door with the red iron a few inches from his face and when he had gone the smith signed to driscoll  youre not going yet sit down right there and take a smoke  a few moments later thirlwell joined drummond who was waiting near the smithy if you mean to make trouble ill pay you off he said youre hired to work not to fight  if i quit now steve will get after me again drummond grumbled  i think not in fact ill see about that but if you provoke the man youll be fired as soon as i know its worth while to remember that youre a long way from the settlements  i got him with the cutter anyhow drummond rejoined and when he went off thirlwell entered the smithy  he imagined what he said to driscoll would prevent the quarrel beginning again and presently went back to the mine feeling satisfied there was now not much risk of drummond and driscoll making friends and finding that both knew something about the lode thirlwell was persuaded that driscoll did know something more in fact than anybody else he knew where strange had expected to find the ore thirlwell had not admitted this to scott because he shrank from stating his suspicions which were dark but vague now however he thought he would try to formulate them and see how they looked since he might after all take scott into his confidence  to begin with nobody knew why stranges canoe capsized strange was clever with the paddle and driscolls narrative while plausible left something to be accounted for it was improbable that he had quarreled with his partner while they shot the rapid because their minds would be occupied by the dangerous navigation then supposing that driscoll had intentionally let the canoe swerve when they were threatened by a breaking wave it was hard to see what he would gain if he thought strange had found the ore it would obviously be impossible to learn anything about it after the man was drowned the theory that strange had already told him where the lode was and driscoll meant to get rid of a partner who would demand the largest share must be rejected since if strange had told him driscoll would have gone away to register the claim but he had not done so  the thing was mysterious and thirlwell could see no light he must wait and watch for a hint and in the meantime resolved to talk to scott about it so far he had rather avoided the subject of stranges death but it might be better to abandon his reserve he did not think he could expect much help from scott but he was clever and thirlwell had known him to solve some awkward puzzles     chapter xviii  the hand in the water   scott lying among the pineneedles after work had stopped lighted his pipe and glanced at thirlwell who had been talking for some minutes  on the whole it was lucky the smith had an iron hot he said black steves a dangerous man and we know something about the metis temper drummond of course is hardly a metis but he has a drop of indian blood that must be reckoned on its a remarkably virile strain  i was rather glad they quarreled id been afraid driscoll might learn he knew something about the lode and persuade him to join the gang i wouldnt trust him far  you can trust his indian instincts scott replied no doubt hes greedy but he hates stormont and i imagine hed sooner punish the fellow than find the silver he paused and looked thoughtful when he went on the other matters difficult but like father lucien i dont see what we can do its possible that steve drowned his partner or anyhow took advantage of an accident to let him drown but were not detectives and you cant move against a man without something besides suspicion to go upon then we were under the cracking beam when he fixed the prop that stopped the roof coming down  i suppose if hes guilty that oughtnt to count  its an awkward question scott replied however we dont know if he is guilty and i dont see much chance of our finding out but theres something else miss strange had the shock of hearing about her fathers sudden death and it would not be kind to harrow her again  certainly not said thirlwell who felt annoyed because his comrade had guessed his thoughts  a week later thirlwell was walking down the tunnel when he saw one or two of the men and driscoll shoring up the roof drummond was helping but a stone fell on him and he sat down there was no light except the flicker of the lamps in the mens hats and they did not see thirlwell  are you hurt kid one asked drummond  hes scared driscoll growled let him get out this is a mans job  drummond sprang to his feet although thirlwell noted an ugly bruise on his forehead  talk about being scared he cried why youre most scared to death of the rapid what dyou reckon lives there thats going to get you in the dark  driscoll stepped forward his face looked gray but his mouth was hard and his eyes shone with savage rage thirlwell thought the mans passion was dangerous and running up got in front of him and sent drummond to the shaft  load up that broken rock he said if you leave the job and come back here ill fire you out  he was disturbed by the quarrel because he understood something of driscolls feelings when stung by the taunt then he was curious about drummonds object for making it and wondered how much he knew he kept them apart and when they stopped at noon driscoll came up to him  i want to quit when the weeks up he said  why thirlwell asked looking hard at him  for one thing ive put up most of the new timbers and guess shell hold for a while then i sure dont like that metis kid reckon ill kill him if i stop  do what you think best said thirlwell who saw he must get rid of one and would sooner keep drummond if you come back later we may find you a job  at the end of the week driscoll went off into the bush and after supper thirlwell sent for drummond scott was sitting near him outside the shack when the young man came up  if you make any fresh trouble here you know whats coming to you scott remarked steve is a good miner and it wont pay us to keep you and let him go  i guess you wont find the boys are sorry he lit out theres something wrong about the man  if thats so its not your business thirlwell rejoined but why did you tell him he was scared of the rapid  drummond sat down on a firstump and grinned with frank amusement he had finished his duty until the next shift went under ground and in the meantime his employers had no authority over him indeed he felt that he had conceded something by coming when he was sent for and he might not have done so had he not liked thirlwell  because steve certainly was scared he replied  how do you know this  well i spose ive got to put you wise i go fishing evenings when the trout are on the feed just before its dusk and id seen steve prospecting round the pools among the reefs struck me as kind of curious because if he was looking for something hed do better in daylight  scott glanced at thirlwell who remembered having come upon driscoll when he was apparently engaged in searching the pools it was obvious to him and he thought to scott that the fellow had chosen the twilight in order to avoid being seen  did driscoll see you thirlwell asked  i dont know the boys tell me hes a trapper drummond answered with a smile  i suppose that means you kept out of sight and watched but go on with your tale  one evening i was sitting among the rocks it was very calm and getting dark when i heard a rattle and a splash i reckoned steve was looking hard for something if he trod on a loose stone  thirlwell nodded driscoll was a skilful trapper and a trapper does not disturb loose stones since he had made a noise it was obvious that he was very much occupied and thought himself alone in a way it was curious that he imagined there was nobody about but although driscoll had studied woodcraft drummond had no doubt inherited the ability to lurk unseen in the bush thirlwell could picture the lad crouching in the gloom of the dark pines  after a piece drummond resumed i got his figure against the sky and reckoned because he looked short he was wading in a pool felt i had to see what he was looking for but knew i couldnt get near him along the bank there are patches of gravel among the rocks and the brush grows pretty thick where it gets the light at the edge of a wood  willows for the most part theyre green and soft just now scott remarked  you cant crawl through green brush without making some noise if you watch your arms and shoulders you cant watch your feet  howd you know that gone hunting often  never owned a gun said drummond still i did know  it doesnt matter go on said scott who looked at thirlwell meaningly  for a while i couldnt see what id better do and then i looked at the water it was glimmering a few yards out but there was a dark piece where the stream runs slack beside the rocks and i took off my jacket and my boots  why didnt you take off all your clothes scott asked  drummond looked at him with surprise i knew my skin would shine in the water  yes of course said scott well it was a risky swim if you had been washed into the main stream youd have gone much farther than you meant did you get near driscoll  sure i did an eddy swung me out and i reckoned i was going down the main rush but i caught the backswirl and after that kept very close along the bank got a knock from a boulder but just paddling enough to keep on top i drifted down to where steve stood he was on a ledge now and i could hardly see him against the pines but his head was bent as if he was looking into the water then i allowed id been a fool i couldnt stop unless i crawled out almost at his feet you cant swim against that stream steve doesnt like me and there were some hefty rocks around  drummond paused and thirlwell imagined the lad had run some risk a blow from a heavy stone would have stopped his swimming without leaving a telltale mark since his body would bear many bruises when the rapid threw it out among the eddies in the tailpool thirlwell could picture the scenethe dark pines standing against the pale sky and the dim reflection from the river the unsuspecting man bending over the ledge and the lad drifting noiselessly down stream with only his head above water and his rather long hair streaking his dark face  well continued drummond you see how i was fixed i couldnt pull out from the bank because the slack was narrow and if i kept on i must pass steve very close i surely didnt like it but saw what id better do he was facing down stream turned half away from me and i reckoned the water was about four feet deep id grab his foot and pull him in then id get away while he was floundering about while if he was too quick and gripped me wed be equal in the water and hed have no rocks to throw  i drifted on until i could reach him and seized his foot but the rest didnt work out as i thought steve didnt slip into the water he kept on his feet and screamed  i suppose you mean he shouted thirlwell suggested  no siri mean screamed like a jackrabbit in a trap the ledge slanted awkwardly he couldnt turn to see what had got hold of him and had hard work to keep his balance when an eddy swung me off the bank i saw him stiffen as he braced himself and guess he felt my grip get tighter through his boot because he gave another scream as if he was mad afraid then he got his other foot against something that steadied him and i saw i couldnt pull him off i let go and swam under water as long as i could when i came up steve wasnt there but i heard him push through the willows up the bank he was running as if he thought he had to go for his life well i got out at the next slack and went for my boots and jacket steve wasnt watching i guess hed had enough  its possible scott agreed dryly do you think he saw you just before you dived  he might have seen my hand it would look whiter than my gray shirt he certainly didnt see my face i didnt mean him to  well said scott its an amusing tale but you had better not tell it to anybody else now you can go along but see you keep out of trouble in future if i find you talking about driscoll or quarreling with the boys ill butt in  drummond went away and when he vanished into the shadow of the pines thirlwell remarked i dont imagine driscoll found the thing amusing  do you think he afterwards guessed it was drummond who got hold of him the young idiot gave him a hint when he taunted him with being scared  its likely said thirlwell if he did guess it would account for his anger the man was carried away by a rage he looked as if hed have killed the lad if there had been nobody about and perhaps he had some excuse hes afraid of the river and we have seen his imagination get the better of his pluck im not surprised he got a nasty jar try to picture it the growing dark the roar of the rapid that we know he hates and the wet hand that rose from the eddy and seized his foot  scott nodded just so whose hand do you imagine he thought it was  i think we both suspect but we agreed that suspicion was not enough  it is not enough said scott who took his fishing rod from the pegs in the wall of the shack well shall we go down to the river the trout ought to rise tonight     chapter xix  a lost opportunity   the classroom was very hot and a ray of dazzling sunshine quivered upon the diagrams on the yellow wall an electric fan hummed monotonously and buzzing flies hovered about agathas head her face and hands were damp as she stood with knitted brows beside a tall blackboard looking at the drowsy girls whom she was teaching inorganic chemistry one or two fixed their eyes on the symbols she had written the rest had obviously given up the effort to understand the complicated formula in fact they did not seem to notice that she had stopped her lecture  for a few moments she looked about and mused with one or two exceptions she liked her pupils and had led them patiently along the uphill road to knowledge they had made some progress but she had lost her delight in leading for one thing few would go far and when they left her the rest would turn aside from the laborious pursuit of science into pleasant human paths and forget all that she had taught while they occupied themselves with the care of husband and children moreover she herself could not follow the climbing road to the heights where the light of knowledge burns brightest as she once had hoped when the school term was finished she must turn back and begin again at the bottom to direct the faltering steps of another band but she sometimes wondered whether the beckoning light was not austere and cold  she glanced at her dress it was a neutral color and like a uniform after all she had physical charm and it was sometimes irksome to wear unbecoming clothes then the lofty room with its varnished desks and benches looked bleak her life was passed in bare classrooms and echoing stone corridors this would not have mattered had she been able to follow her bent and take the line she had once marked out but she could not she must give up the thought of independent research and teach for a living cramping her talents to meet her pupils intelligence until in time she sank to their level  she roused herself with an effort and mechanically resumed her lecture for her wandering thoughts now dwelt upon the foaming rivers and cool forests of the north the classrooms smelt of varnish and throbbed with the monotonous rattle of the fan in the wilds one breathed the resinous fragrance of the pines and heard the splash of running water for all that she must not shirk her duty and she tried to make the meaning of the symbols on the board plainer to the languid girls  by and by she remarked that they were more alert some were making notes and one or two looked past her with frank curiosity the door was behind the board and agatha had heard nobody come in but when she looked round she saw a grayhaired gentleman standing near the lady principal he seemed to be listening to what she said and she thought his eyes twinkled as if he understood the difficulty of rousing her pupils interest this was somewhat embarrassing but the school was famous and visitors were now and then shown round  she paused and the stranger turned to the principal if you will allow me  the principal smiled and he came up to agatha holding out his hand for the chalk  suppose we alter the formula this way he said and wiped out the letters and figures  agatha studied him as he wrote fresh symbols he was plainly dressed and about sixty years of age there was nothing else worth noting but he obviously knew his subject and she liked his face she saw that the girls could follow his explanation but while suited to their understanding it was in one respect not quite accurate  i dont know if ive made it much plainer he said deprecatingly when he stopped  agatha indicated a group of letters it is plainer thank you but does the combination of the two elements take place exactly as you have shown at a normal temperature the metals affinity for oxygen  ah he said you know that it looks as if you had studied the new austrian theory but perhaps one may make a small concession for the sake of clearness  science is exact agatha replied  its a bold claim for us to make he rejoined smiling our symbols are guess measures our elements split up into two or three but i gather that you refuse to compromise about what in the meantime we think is the truth  i think one must adhere to it as far as one knows  well no doubt that is the proper line but ive stopped your lecture and perhaps bored your pupils  no said agatha you have helped me over awkward ground and i expect they would sooner listen to a stranger  he went away with the principal and agatha wondered about him as she resumed her task it was plain that he knew something about science but this was not strange since geologists and chemists sometimes visited the school after she dismissed her class the principal sent for her  i suppose you dont know who that man is she asked  agatha admitted that she did not know and colored when the other told her the man was a famous scientist who had recently simplified the smelting of some refractory british columbian ores and was now understood to be occupied with the problem of utilizing certain barren alkali belts in the west  oh she said i talked to him as if he were one of the girls in fact i believe i was gently patronizing  i dont think he was much hurt  then he must have been amused and that is nearly as bad after he had gone i imagined id seen his portrait somewhere  he hasnt gone yet the principal answered with a twinkle hes waiting to see you in the managers room and i must confess to something of a plot when i brought him in quietly to hear your lecture  but what does he want agatha asked with excited curiosity  i imagine he wants to offer you a post but he will tell you about this you have half an hour before the next class  agatha went out trying to preserve her calm the man had made his mark by the application of science to industry and the thought that she might help him gave her a thrill this was different work from teaching beginners taking them so far and then going over the ground again if she got the post she could go on farther perhaps than she had hoped and when she had learned enough embark on a career of independent research she thought she had the necessary tenacity and brains there was an obstacle but she would not hurry to meet it and it might be removed  when she entered the room the man got up and indicated a chair he asked a few questions rather carelessly and afterwards remarked miss southern had already told me what i most wanted to know you may have heard about the work in which i am engaged  yes said agatha with a touch of color i know what it is now  he smiled perhaps it would have been better had i asked miss southern to present me but im not very formal well i was asked by the provincial government and the railroad to find the best way of developing the alkali wastes and the subject is extraordinarily interesting if i can solve the problem it will make important changes in our irrigation system and enable us to cultivate wide belts of barren soil however i must have help and want a lady who can take the charge of my correspondence with scientific people and assist in my experiments after talking to miss southern i feel i can offer you the post  agatha thrilled but used some selfcontrol  but you might not need me long and i must give up the school  he smiled if you wished to resume teaching i daresay your having helped in my investigations would be an advantage  then do you expect me to help much in that way agatha asked with growing excitement  yes as far as you are able i am told that you are used to laboratory work would this suit you  agathas eyes sparkled it would realize my pet ambition  very well we had better talk about the salary my notion is  agatha thought the offer generous she would be richer than she had been yet and there was an object for which she needed money she felt flattered and almost overjoyed the work she was asked to do might start her well on the road she had long wished to take  there is another matter the man resumed when she declared that she was satisfied it will be necessary for you to come to europe my wife will take care of you  then you are going to europe agatha said with a curious sinking of her heart  yes i must consult an eminent frenchman and two or three austrians they have studied some of the problems i am up against  when do you start agatha asked with forced quietness  in about three weeks if i can get ready  agatha tried to brace herself the disappointment was hard to bear and for a few moments she engaged in a bitter struggle if she took the post and went to europe she could not go north for a year and thirlwell might not be able to help her then she knew that she had counted on his help and that without it she could not penetrate far into the wilds indeed it was possible that she could not start at all  yet if she went north she must refuse an alluring offer and throw away an opportunity for making her mark her ambition must be abandoned and if she failed to find the silver she would have to resume her monotonous duties at the school she was beginning to find them strangely dreary then george had warned her against sacrificing her youth and perhaps all her life to the pursuit of a shadow her friends did not believe in the silver and she doubted if she could find the vein failure might leave her sour and the hardships break her health she would come back with her savings exhausted to toil and deny herself again yet the lode was waiting to be found somewhere in the north and the duty she had accepted long since must come first  then im sorry i cannot go she said with an effort  the man looked surprised the voyage is short and comfortable if one travels by a big fast boat i expect to work hard but you would have some leisure and opportunities for seeing famous pictures statues and laboratories then you would meet eminent chemists and learn something from their talk in fact the visit ought to be of help in many ways and if you afterwards left my employment make it easy for you to get another post  agatha struggled for calm he had rather understated than exaggerated the reasons why she ought to go then toronto and montreal were the only cities she knew and she was offered a chance of seeing some of the capitals of europe with their treasures of art and meeting men who had made famous scientific discoveries it would help her more than many certificates if later on she resumed her work of teaching  ah she said in a strained voice please dont try to show me all that i shall miss i want to go so very much but its impossible if i went i should neglect a duty that has a stronger claim  he bowed then although im sorry theres nothing to be said would it be an impertinence if i asked about the duty  agatha was silent for a moment or two her refusal had cost her much indeed she was afraid to think what she had lost and felt she must do something to banish the crushing sense of disappointment  no she said impulsively i cannot resent anything you ask i must start north soon to look for a vein of ore my father told me about im forced to make the search but it would be a long story if i told you why she hesitated and then went on i wonder whether you would look at this analysis and tell me what you thinki mean if you think there is ore of that kind on the northern slope of the ontario watershed  he took the paper she had long carried about and studied it for a time then he said it is not the ore a practical miner would expect to strike but practical miners are sometimes deceived as a rule they know more about shafts and adits than scientific geology  would you expect to find the ore where i have told you  well he said thoughtfully the laurentian rocks are very old and our miners have so far dealt with newer formations on the whole i think it possible that ore like this has been forced up from unusual depths  but would the silver be easily refined  he smiled there would be no trouble about its reduction if you can locate the vein you will be rich  agatha thanked him and went out feeling somewhat comforted she had given up much but she saw a ray of light in the gloom ahead the way she had chosen was difficult but after all it was the right way and if she were resolute might lead to success then she remembered with a strange satisfaction that for a time she need not walk alone thirlwell would be her guide when she plunged into the trackless wilds and she knew that one could trust him     chapter xx  the plunge   supper was over at the farnam homestead and agatha enjoyed the cool of the evening on the veranda with her hosts and george the school had closed for the holidays and george had arrived as the meal from which they had just got up was served although he had not stated his object yet agatha knew why he had come and shrank from the vigorous protest she expected him to make in the meantime she had something else to think about and listened for the noise of wheels  farnams hired man had driven across to the settlement in the afternoon and she wondered rather anxiously whether he would bring her a telegram she had written to thirlwell telling him when she would be ready to begin her search for the ore and now waited his reply her letter might take some time to reach him and she must allow for his messengers journey to the railroad from the mine but she knew she would feel restless until the answer came  the evening was calm the air was fresher than in the city and she found the quiet soothing a field of timothy grass near the house rippled languidly the dark heads rising stiffly upright when the faint breeze dropped sometimes there was a movement among the tall blades and feathery plumes of the indian corn and then the rustle stopped and everything was still beyond the zigzag fence the fruit trees ran back in rows that converged and melted into a blurred mass at the edge of the bush the narrow landscape had no prominent feature it was smooth and calm and agatha found it rested her eyes and brain she wanted to be tranquil but must shortly rouse herself when mrs farnam and george began their joint attack george had an ominously determined look and she knew mabel would give him her support  why didnt you come and stop with us florence expected you he said by and by  agatha saw he was feeling for an opening and since it was hard to put him off answered with a smile you are a persistent fellow and im not fond of argument i wanted to be quiet  you mean you were afraid id get after you about your crank notion of finding the old mans lode as you havent talked about it for some time id begun to hope you had given that folly up are you going  some time i may go very soon perhaps i shall know tonight  then ill wait george said grimly if you get a message from the miner fellow i may have some remarks to make  farnam began to talk about the fruit crop and it was half an hour later when agatha heard a rattle of wheels then a rig lurched along the uneven road in a cloud of dust and soon after it vanished among the trees farnams hired man walked up to the veranda  a wire for miss strange there was no mail he said  agathas nerve tingled as she opened the envelope and then the restless feeling left her and she felt very calm the telegram was from thirlwell who stated where he would meet her and that the sum she named would be enough this was a relief because she had insisted that the journey should be made at her cost and traveling is expensive in the wilds  one needed tents clothes and prospecting tools canoes must be bought and experienced voyageurs engaged since the craft and stores would have to be carried across rugged divides agatha had for a long time practised stern economy doubting if her savings would cover the expense and now when she had met all demands she would have very few dollars left this did not matter the money would go round and she felt recklessly satisfied after a moment or two she gave the telegram to george  i start in three days  george said nothing although his face got red and agatha studied him with sympathetic amusement it was obvious that he was using some selfcontrol while he mustered his forces for an attack he had begun to get fat and looked rather aggressively prosperous in fact george was a typical business man and it was ridiculous to think he could understand  but what about your clothes mrs farnam asked you must have a special outfit for the bush  theyre all bought before i left toronto i ordered what i would need to be got ready and properly packed the things will be sent as soon as the people get my telegram you see ive been thinking about my outfit one cant take much when it must be carried across the portages  george frowned savagely you ought to know my sister mrs farnam when she undertakes a job she leaves nothing to chance and i guess shes had it all fixed some time since he turned to agatha ive got to relieve my feelings if i do nothing else well i suppose you understand what this adventure means unless you get back before the new term begins youll lose your post and you take steep chances of ruining your health youre not used to sleeping on wet ground and going without food then youll have to live with halftamed voyageurs and perhaps help them track the canoes theyll upset you in the rapids and the bush will tear your clothes i hate to think of my sister going about draggled and ragged with a bunch of strange men but that while bad enough is certainly not the worst  he stopped to get his breath and then resumed you wont find the lode and youll come back feeling sick and sore if they keep you on at the school you wont want to teach youll think of nothing but saving all you can and pulling out again youre like father and when he took the lone trail the blamed foolishness got such a grip of him that he never broke loose well youll lose your job and the next you get in fact youll come to hate any work that keeps you from the north but a girl cant let herself down until she turns into a hobo its frankly unthinkable pull up and cut out the crazy program before it ruins you  its too late said agatha i knew what i might have to pay when i resolved to go  i wonder whether you do know theres something george hasnt mentioned mrs farnam remarked i dont think im prudish but you cant keep your adventure secret and school managers are censorious people have you thought what it may mean if they hear about your traveling through the woods with a man whos not a relative and a band of wild halfbreeds  yes said agatha coloring i have thought of that  but it didnt count  it counted for much said agatha in a rather strained voice  george clenched his fist if youre turned out people will talk ill engage to stop the men but the women are dangerous and i cant get after them for my sake drop your fool plan  i cant i know the risks but i must go on  well said george with a gesture of helpless indignation i allow im beaten and theres not much comfort in feeling ive done my duty i didnt expect youd bother about my views when i began looks as if we gave young women a dangerous freedom  women have won their freedom you didnt give it mrs farnam rejoined and then turned to agatha after all something depends on the mans character you havent told us much about mr thirlwell  agatha did not reply and george said grudgingly in a sense the fellows all right i made some inquiries and must admit that i was satisfied with what i learned  you both take it for granted that agatha will not locate the vein farnam interposed since thirlwell manages a mine he must know something about prospecting and if he reckons the chances are pretty good  mr thirlwell does not really believe i will find the ore agatha said with incautious frankness  george laughed ironically and farnam looked surprised while his wife asked then why is he going  agatha felt embarrassed i dont knowhe made me promise i would let him come i think prospecting has a charm for miners  she stopped as she saw mrs farnams smile but it was some relief to note that george did not seem to remark her hesitation  well he said your statements so to speak the climax the only person who knows anything about the matter thinks you wont find the vein the blamed propositions ridiculous from the beginning he got up and filled his pipe with an unsteady hand im too mad to sit still guess ill walk round the orchard and take a smoke  farnam presently went after him and mrs farnam put her hand on agathas arm  my dear you have pluck but you have chosen a hard road and given your friends a jar but we are your friends dont forget that  agatha smiled gratefully though she found it difficult i didnt really choose sometimes i was afraid but i knew i had to go  very well said mrs farnam we wont talk about it tell me about your clothes  next day george left the homestead and agatha walked across the orchard with him while farnam harnessed his team when a rattle of wheels warned them that the rig was coming george stopped and said this trip will cost you something and your pays not high how much do you reckon to have left when you get back  about ten dollars agatha answered with a twinkle  i knew you had grit but i want you to understand i wouldnt give you five cents to help you find the lode but youll go broke on ten dollars long before your next pays due better take this it may help you out  agatha took the envelope but as she began to open it the rig stopped at the gate and george put his hand on her shoulder  we mustnt keep farnam wait until ive gone he said and kissed her im not going to wish you good luck but if you have trouble with the school people when you get back come along and stop with florence ill interview the managers and if needful find you another job  he hurried off and when the rattle of wheels died away agatha opened the envelope and found a check for a hundred dollars she felt moved but smiled the gift was generous but the way he had made it was very like george  three days afterwards farnam and his wife drove her to the railroad and she felt a pang at leaving them when the cars rolled in the excitement of starting however helped her over an awkward few minutes and she found a girl on the train who wanted to talk besides it was evening and after an hour or two the colored porter lighted the lamps and told her her berth was ready she slept well for it was too late to give way to misgivings now and soon after she rose next morning the train stopped at the station where she must get down  the conductor threw her baggage out upon the line the locomotive bell tolled the cars went on and agathas heart sank as she glanced about it was early morning and thin mist drifted among the pines there was no platform but a small wooden shack with an iron roof stood beside the rails which ran into the forest a hundred yards off the agent after gruffly asking for her checks vanished into his office and banged the door there was nobody else about and the place was very quiet except for the murmur of running water  a narrow clearing strewn with ashes and dotted by blackened stumps ran along the track and at its end were three or four shabby frame houses a rudely painted board on one stated that the building was the strathcona hotel agatha felt very forlorn except for a week or two with thirlwell and once with a band of merry companions at a summer camp she had not seen the rugged bush and now it daunted her she was not going on a pleasure excursion from which she could return when she liked but to push far into the lonely wilds she had done with civilization until she came back it could not help her when she left the railroad she must live and struggle with savage nature as the prospectors and halfbreeds did but this was not all she had perhaps cut herself off from other things than the comfort and security that civilization offered  mabel farnams warning was no doubt justified it was possible that the school managers would dismiss her and she would be unable to get another scholastic post she might have to give up her occupation and although she disliked business earn a frugal living as a clerk her face got hot as she remembered mabels statement that her rashness had given her friends a jar but in one sense mabel was wrong she had not been rash she knew she could trust thirlwell and the men he hired there was nothing to fear from them still she had made a bold plunge that might cost her much and now the reaction had begun she felt slack and dispirited the plunge however was made she must carry out what she had undertaken and it was foolish to indulge her doubts she tried to pull herself together and in a few minutes a man led a team out of the hotel stable  he leisurely harnessed the lean horses to a very dirty wagon and then drove them across the clearing to the track where he stopped in front of agathas baggage she noted that his skin was very brown and he had coarse black hair the overalls he wore were very ragged  mees strange he said dat your truck  agatha said it was and jumping down he threw her bag and some rough wooden boxes into the wagon then he climbed back up the wheel and held out his hand  montez allons en route  agatha got up with some trouble and when she sat down on a board that crossed the vehicle he cracked his whip and the wagon rocking wildly rolled away among the stumps and plunged into a narrow trail chopped out of the bush  eet is long way we mak breakfast by and by he said thirlwell wait at portage we arrive tonight si tout va bien  agatha said nothing but felt somewhat comforted as they jolted along the uneven trail     chapter xxi  the wilderness   dusk was falling and the tired horses plodded slowly past the rows of shadowy trunks when the sound of running water came out of the gloom agatha ached from the jolting and felt cramped and sleepy but she roused herself when a light began to flicker among the trees the driver urged his team the light got brighter as the rig lurched down a rough incline and agatha saw a man standing in the trail his figure was indistinct and she could not see his face but she no longer felt jaded and lonely for she knew who he was  tired he said in a sympathetic voice as he gave her his hand to get down when the rig stopped in an opening its a long ride from the railroad but after all it was better for you to make it in the day besides we must pull out tomorrow  agatha said she was not excessively tired she liked his matteroffact manner and thought he had struck the right note  have you got the tent i recommended he asked  yes she said its in the small box  then as the poles are cut the boys will soon put it up in the meantime suppers ready  he took her across the narrow open space and when near the fire she stopped and looked about it was after ten oclock but a palegreen glow shone above the pines whose ragged tops cut against it in a black sawedge below a river brawled among dark rocks catching a reflection here and there and then plunging into shadow it was not dark she could see the brush and the wildberry vines that crawled between the trunks then she turned towards the fire that burned at the foot of a ledge two or three figures moved about the rocks behind it sometimes picked out with hard distinctness so that she could see their brown faces and travelstained overalls and sometimes fading into gloom  the smoke went nearly straight up and then spread slowly across the river the flames leaped among the snapping branches and sank strong lights and puzzling shadows played about the camp there was an aromatic smell and the air was keen and bracing the turmoil of the river rather emphasized than disturbed the quietness it was different from the noisy city where the big arclights burned above the hurrying crowds but agatha did not find it strange she felt as if she were revisiting a scene she had known before and thought this was an inheritance from her father who had loved the wilds but perhaps she might go further back it was relatively not long since all ontario was a wilderness and she sprang from pioneering stock  then thirlwell indicated a folding chair and she sat down beside two logs rolled close together to make a cooking hearth a kettle and two fryingpans stood on the logs supported by both and the space between was filled with glowing embers about which flickered little blue and orange flames thirlwell gave her a plate and a tin mug and she found the fresh trout and hot bannocks appetizing then she liked the acid wildberries he brought on a bark tray and the strong smokeflavored tea she smiled as she remembered that in toronto she had been fastidious about her meals and sometimes could not eat food that was roughlyserved  when supper was over thirlwell sat on one of the hearthlogs and lighted his pipe agatha was pleased that he did so while they were in the bush their relations must be marked by an informal friendliness as if she were a comrade and partner and not a girl anything that hinted at the difference in their sex must be avoided  youll get used to camplife in a few days he remarked by and by at first i expect youll find it a change from the cities things are rudimentary in the bush  nothing jars except the mosquitoes agatha replied i have no sense of strangeness in fact i feel as if i had been here before and belonged to the woods  after all you do know something about them i think you said you had camped in the timber  that was different it was a summer camp organized by the railroad and supplied with modern comforts you bought a ticket and a gasolene launch took you up the lake then the men wore smart flannels and the girls new summer clothes in the evenings one sang and played a banjo another a mandolin  thirlwell laughed you dont like music  i love it but not ragtime and modern coon songs in the bush no doubt the people who went there had earned a holiday but it would have been different had they gone to fish or hunt they went to loaf play noisy games and flirt indeed i used to think we jarred as much as the horrible dump of old fruit and meat cans among the willows  i think i know what you mean man makes ugly marks on the wilderness unless he goes to farm a mine for example is remarkably unpicturesque  but it stands for endeavor for something useful done  not all mines a number stand for wasted money  and vanished hopes said agatha do you think i shall find the lode i want you to be frank  thirlwell hesitated on the whole i dont think so but my judgment maynt be sound and my employer scott does not agree anyway ill help you all i can  for a moment or two agatha studied him his face was brown and rather thin and had a hint of quiet force his easy pose was graceful but virile somehow he did not clash with the austerity of the woods nor did the other men who now sat smoking round the larger fire agatha liked their quietness their slow drawling speech and tranquil movements she knew she could trust thirlwell but remembering a remark of mabel farnams she asked herself why he had offered his help she could find no satisfactory answer and thought it better to leave the puzzle alone  but you are doubtful she said confidence is a strong driving force  in a way thats true he agreed still it sometimes drives you into mistakes and when you get to work in the right way it doesnt matter much if youre confident or not your feelings cant alter natures laws if you know how the vein dips you can strike the ore if you sink the shothole right and use enough powder you split the rock  its obvious that you are a materialist  im a mining engineer thirlwell rejoined with a smile  agatha gave him a quiet friendly look its lucky i have you to help because i could not have gone far alone ive studied natures laws in the laboratory but in the bush she works on another scale theres a difference between a blowpipe flame and the subterranean fires now if i dont find the ore it will be some comfort to know that i have properly tried she glanced at her wristwatch and got up it is later than i thought  your tent is ready thirlwell replied  she turned and saw a light shining through the vshaped canvas on the edge of the trees but although she was tired felt reluctant to leave the fire it had burned low between the logs but it gave the lonely spot a comfortable homelike look and the bush was dark thirlwell sitting where the faint light touched him somehow added to the charm by a hint of human fellowship he looked as if he were resting by his hearth and she had spent a happy hour with him in quiet halfconfidential talk  thank you goodnight she said and went away  when she reached the tent she looked about with surprise the earth floor was beaten smooth and sprinkled with pinesprays that gave out an aromatic smell a bed had been cleverly made of thin branches and packed twigs her blankets were neatly folded and the small canvas bucket was filled all she was likely to need was ready and the boxes that had held her outfit were arranged to make a seat and washstand she felt grateful for this thought for her comfort and putting out the miners lamp sat down on the twigbed and hooked the canvas door back  although there was no moon she could distinguish the black pinetrunks across the river the lines of foam where the current broke upon the reefs and the canoes drawn up on the bank thirlwell and his metis packers had gone and as hers was the only tent she wondered where they slept the fires were nearly out and except for the noise of the river a solemn quietness brooded over the camp  she began to muse she had liked thirlwell when she met him at the summer hotel but she liked him better in the bush he harmonized with his surroundings he was so to speak natural but not at all uncouth the woods had made him quiet thoughtful and vigilant she had noted his quick searching glance and although there was nothing aggressive about him he had force yet she did not think him clever she had met men whose mental powers were much more obvious but when she tried to contrast them with him he came out best after all character took one further than intellectual subtlety  agatha blushed as she admitted that had she wanted a lover she might have been satisfied with a man of thirlwells type but she did not want a lover she had inherited a duty and must concentrate on finding the silver vein the task in a manner set her apart from other women who could follow their bent sometimes she envied them their freedom and gave way to bitterness but her austere sense of duty returned it was strong just now but the picture of thirlwell sitting opposite by the fire had a happy domestic touch that made her dissatisfied  then she remembered that if she found the vein she would be rich so far she had not dwelt much on this because it was not a longing for money that animated her all the same she saw that success in the search would give her power and freedom to choose the life she would lead not long since she had thought to find happiness in the pursuit of science and with wealth at her command she could make costly experiments and build laboratories the thought still pleased her but it had lost something of its charm besides it was too soon for such speculations and she must be practical  suppose she did find the ore the claim must be recorded and developed as the mining laws required and she would need a man who understood such matters to help her but it must be a man she could trust she could trust thirlwell and admitted that she had halfconsciously allotted him the supposititious post for one thing if he were manager they would not be separated by her success but this was going too far and she resolutely pulled herself up she had not found the vein and was perhaps thinking about thirlwell oftener than she ought feeling for the hooks she fastened the tent door and soon afterwards went to sleep  they launched the canoes in the cool of the morning while the mist drifted among the pines and the sun came up behind the forest the stream ran fast and as they toiled up river a brawny halfbreed waded through the shallows with the tracking line thirlwell stood in the stern using the pole and agatha noted the smooth precision of his movements he wasted no effort and did not seem to be working hard but he did what he meant and the hint of force was plainer than when he talked two metis were occupied with the canoe behind and as they poled and tracked they sang old songs made by the early french voyageurs although the river had shrunk far down the bank there was water enough for the canoes and agatha remarked how skilfully the men avoided the rocks in the channel and drove the craft up angry rapids  when they nooned upon a gravel bank near the end of a wide lake it was fiercely hot the calm water flashed like polished steel and agatha could hardly see the flames of the snapping fire the smoke went up in thin gray wreaths that were almost invisible a clump of juniper grew among the stones and she sat down in the shade and looked about with dazzled eyes a line of driftwood hammered by the ice and bleached white by the sun marked the subsidence of the water from its high spring level small islands broke the shining surface some covered with stunted trees and some quite bare the rocks about the beach were curiously worn but agatha knew they had been ground smooth by drifting floes behind the beach the forest rolled back in waves of somber green to a bold ridge that faded into leaden thunderclouds  the landscape was wild and although it had nothing of the savage grandeur agatha expected she thought it forbidding its influence was insidious one was not daunted by a glance but realized by degrees its grimness and desolation the north was not dramatic except perhaps when the ice broke up the forces that molded the rugged land worked with a stern quietness it looked as if they also molded the character of the men who braved the rigors of the frozen waste the metis were not vivacious like the french habitants they were marked by a certain grave melancholy and their paddling songs had a plaintive undertone yet their vigor and stubbornness were obvious and agatha thought thirlwell was like his packers in a way he was not melancholy and indeed often laughed but one got a hint of reserve and unobtrusive strength he did not display his qualities as some of the professors and business men she knew had done but she imagined they would be seen if there was need  in a sense the north is disappointing she remarked i expected to feel rather overwhelmed but im not  wait said thirlwell smiling after a few hundred miles of lonely trail youll know the country better i dont want you to get to love it but in the wilderness love often goes with fear  once i thought that impossible agatha replied now i dont know im beginning to recognize that im not as modern as i thought but have you ever been frankly afraid of the wilds  often when you meet the snow on the frozen trail a hundred miles from shelter mind and body shrink perhaps its worse when all that stands for warmth and life is loaded on the handsledge you haul across the rotten ice then its significant that the metis are sometimes more afraid than white men they know the country better  they havent the civilized mans intellect ignorance breeds superstition that makes men cowards  thats so to some extent thirlwell agreed i suppose superstition is mans fear of dangers he cant understand and his wish to propitiate the unknown powers that rule such things you and i call these powers natural forces for which we have our weights and measures but i must own that the measures are often found defective when applied to mining ive met rockborers who would sooner trust a mascot than a scientific rule  we are a curious people agatha remarked with a laugh but you passed a smooth beach with good shade where the river runs out why did you come on here  the others the regular camping spot i remembered that you dont like old provision cans  agatha was pleased he had thought about her and remembered her dislikes while she wondered how she could tactfully thank him he went on  besides i wanted to make another mile or two a good days journey is important  would a mile or two make much difference  you would have to take the distance off at the other end the economy of travel in the north is sternly simple and transports the main difficulty you can travel a fixed distance on a fixed quantity of food and how much you take depends on the skill and number of your packers good men get good wages and money does not go far i want to save up as many miles as possible for our prospecting  i see said agatha yet you stated that you didnt think we would find the lode then she gave him a shrewd glance arent you a little impatient to get on now  i am he admitted turning to the south theres a threat of thunder and id like to cross the lake before the storm comes  agatha got up and in a few minutes they launched the canoes the heat was overwhelming and agatha felt no movement of the air but the metis sweated and panted as they labored at the paddles the thud of the blades came back in measured echoes from the motionless pines and a fanshaped wake trailed far across the glassy lake in the meantime the cloud bank rolled up the sky like a ragged arch and covered the sun the glare faded and a thick blue haze crept out upon the water until it looked as if the horizon advanced to meet them but the heat did not get less at the edge of the haze an island loomed indistinctly and by and by thirlwell turned to agatha  theres a good beach behind the point and shelter among the rocks he said in a breathless voice would you like to stop  how long should we have to stop  he looked up at the moving cloud which was fringed with ragged streamers  i imagine we wouldnt get off again today  then well go on said agatha  thirlwell signed to the metis who had slackened their efforts and the foam swirled up at the bows as they drove the paddles through the water     chapter xxii  before the wind   soon after the island melted into the gloom a flash of lightning leaped from the cloud and spread like a sheet of blue flame across the water for a second agatha saw black rocks and trees stand out against an overwhelming glare and then they vanished and she saw nothing at all lightning is common in canada but this had a terrifying brilliance unlike any that she had known while her dazzled eyes recovered from the shock she was deafened by a crash that rolled among the cloudbanks in tremendous echoes and before it died away another blaze leaped down it was rather a continuous stream of light than a flash because it did not break off but beginning overhead ran far across the lake the next enveloped the canoes in an awful light and she felt her hair crackle before the thunder came  she was too entranced to feel afraid and glanced at thirlwell with halfclosed eyes his face was set and his mouth shut tight but he was paddling hard and she heard the others labored breath as they kept time with him the reason for their haste however was not plain the storm was terribly violent but they would be no safer in the woods than on the lake yet it was obvious that they wanted to reach land  after a stunning crash the thunder began to roll away the lightning glimmered fitfully farther off and a torrent of rain broke upon the canoes agatha was wet before she could put on her slicker and when she sat huddled together with head bent to shield her face from the deluge she could not see fifty yards in front the water was pitted by the rain which rebounded from its surface with angry splashes it ran down the halfbreeds faces and soaked their gray shirts but they did not stop paddling to put on their coats agatha wondered with some uneasiness what they thought was going to happen  the rain got lighter suddenly and a cold draught touched her forehead she saw thirlwell glance astern although he did not miss a stroke his soaked hat drooped about his head and his thin overalls were dripping she thought he saw she was looking at him but he did not speak then the haze that had shut them in rolled back and a dark line advanced across the lake it had a white edge and there was a curious humming rippling noise that got louder thirlwell signed to one of the metis who stepped a mast in the hole through a beam and loosed a small sail the sail blew out like a flag snapping violently and the man struggled hard to push up the pole that extended its peak then he hauled the sheet and the canoe swayed down until her curving gunwale was in the water the halfbreed moved to the other side and thirlwell beckoned agatha  come aft by me  she obeyed although it was difficult to crawl over the cargo in the bottom of the sharply slanted craft the humming noise had changed to a shriek but it did not drown the turmoil of the water short waves with black furrows between them rolled up astern and although they were not high they looked angry agatha saw that thirlwell wanted to trim the canoe he held a long paddle with the handle jambed against the pointed stern and the canoes side rose out of the water as she paid off before the wind  we could do nothing with the paddles he said a sails no use in a rivercanoe but these heavy freighters run pretty well luckily its a fair wind to the river mouth  agatha could scarcely hear him but when she asked how far it was he nodded as if he understood  three or four miles not much sweep for the wind but it will raise a nasty sea before we get there  gazing at the driving clouds that blotted out the forest she tried to ask if he could find the river but just then the canoe rolled and the little spritsail swelled like a balloon there was a hiss and a splash and the top of a wave that split at the stern and rolled forward poured in at the waist thirlwell bent over the paddle and slackened the sheet the canoe swung her bows out and leaped ahead spray blew about in showers the foam stood in a ridge amidships and boiled high about the stern it seemed to agatha that they were traveling like a toboggan and she had an exhilarating sense of speed that banished the thought of danger  how fast are we going she shouted  i dont know five miles an hour perhaps  it sounded ridiculous agatha had felt as if they were flying then she saw that skill was needed to keep the canoe before the wind and thirlwell ran two risks if he let the craft fall off too far the sail would swing across and she might be capsized by the shock if he let her swerve to windward the following wave would break on board and she would be swamped thirlwell looked highly strung but very cool a mistake would have disastrous consequences if he gave way to the strain for a moment the canoe would sink but she knew he would not give way and it was comforting to see that the halfbreed shared her confidence he was no doubt a voyageur from his boyhood but it was plain that he did not want to take the steering paddle  sometimes when a savage gust screamed about them and whipped up the spray in clouds thirlwell let the sheet run round a pin sometimes he sank the paddle deep and she saw its handle bend and the blood flush his face drops of sweat ran down his forehead but his glance was fixed and calm the strain on brain and muscle braced without exciting him he seemed to accept it as something to which he was used he could be trusted in an emergency and for some obscure reason she was glad to feel he was the man she had thought  then she watched the other canoe which had dropped astern the metis had set their sail but she was not running well she swerved when she lifted with the waves and rolled until it looked as if she would capsize now and then a sea broke over the gunwale and a crouching halfbreed desperately threw out the water another sat on a beam in the high stern and his pose was strangely tense but for all agathas trust in thirlwell it was daunting to watch the laboring craft and the seas that threatened to swamp her they looked worse when one saw their hollow fronts and raging crests and agatha fixed her eyes ahead  the haze was thinning and now and then the blurred outline of trees broke through but one belt of forest looked like another and she speculated with some uneasiness about the chance of thirlwells finding the river if he did not find it they would run some risk because the men could not paddle to windward and the canoes might be smashed on a steep rocky beach they ran on and sometimes the trees got plainer and sometimes vanished but at length when a savage gust rolled the haze away agatha saw an unbroken line of rocks and foam it looked very forbidding and she wondered what thirlwell would do  sit as far as you can to windward he shouted and while she awkwardly obeyed the halfbreed got up on the side of the canoe  agatha understood what this meant thirlwell had missed the river mouth and meant to skirt the coast but when he tried to do so the wind would be abeam and its power to heel the canoe largely increased so far they had run before the gale but to bring the crafts side to it was a different thing  she set her lips as she watched thirlwell haul the spritsail sheet he was cautious and for a few moments brought the crafts head up with the paddle and kept the small sail fluttering then he let her go and she lurched down until her side amidships was in the water to agathas surprise not much came on board it looked as if they were going too fast and the lee bow was the dangerous spot in the plunges the waves boiled up there and one could feel the canoe tremble as she lurched over the tumbling foam then agatha noted that thirlwell was not steering with the gale quite abeam he was edging the craft to windward as far as he could but the beach got nearer and it was plain that they were drifting sideways while they forged ahead agatha began to doubt if he could keep them off the rocks  he did not look disturbed his glance was fixed to windward and his movements were strangely quick agatha saw that he kept the canoe from capsizing by the skilful use of paddle and sheet when the craft could not stand the pressure he let the sail blow slack and then hauled the sheet again dipping his paddle to help her over a breaking wave sound judgment was plainly needed and the man must instantly carry out the decision he made handling a canoe in a breaking sea demanded higher qualities than agatha had thought she was getting anxious for the rocks were nearer and one could see the angry surges sweep in tongues of foam far up their sides it was surprising that such a sea could rise on a small lake she could swim but not much and shrank from crawling out halfdrowned and draggled from the surf for one thing thirlwell would see her she admitted that this was illogical and she ran worse risks but it troubled her a few moments afterwards thirlwell changed his course with a thrust of the paddle and slacked the sheet  all right now he shouted well find smooth water in a hundred yards  a steep rock washed by spouting foam detached itself from the others and a narrow channel opened up between it and the beach agatha thought it looked horribly dangerous but thirlwell headed for the gap they lurched through on the top of a curling wave and she saw the mouth of the river behind the rock the current rose in crested ridges where it met the wind but the ridges were smaller than the waves on the lake and gradually sank to splashing ripples as the canoe ran up stream between dark walls of forest the trees did not cut off the wind which followed the channel and by and by thirlwell looked at agatha  we have made a good run but it isnt often one gets a fair wind like this and poling against the stream is slow work still well stop and pitch camp when you like  shall we save a day for our prospecting if we go on until dark  yes said thirlwell well certainly gain a day  agatha was cold and wet and cramped she longed to stop but it was important to save time and she wanted thirlwell to see that she had pluck  then go on as far as you can she replied  she had half expected the metis to grumble but they did not it looked as if thirlwell had carefully chosen his men and she found out later that no fatigue she could bear troubled them after a time the wind dropped as they ran round a bend and getting close to the high bank they began to pole at dusk they ran the canoe aground on a sheltered beach and agatha landed feeling very tired and cold when supper was over and they sat by the fire she did not want to talk and going to her tent soon fell asleep  next day they poled against the current and paddled in bright sunshine across a lake at noon they camped among short junipers and the next morning carried the empty canoes upside down across a rocky point it cost twelve hours labor relaying the loads to make the portage and then they launched upon another lake after two more days they left the canoes covered with firbranches on a beach and pushed inland a narrow trail led them across a high divide seamed by deep gullies where stunted pines and juniper grew among the rocks and they portaged the loads by stages carrying part for an hour or two and then going back agatha was surprised to see how much a man could carry with the help of properly adjusted straps  when the divide was crossed they found two canoes by the bank of a small creek down which they drifted with the swift current then there was a chain of lakes veiled in mist and rain and after making a portage they reached a wider stream they followed it down through tangled woods and when they camped late one evening agatha sat silent by the fire trying to retrace their journey and speculating about what lay ahead for the most part her memory was blurred and hazy pictures floated through her mind of lonely camps among the boulders and small pinetrunks of breathless men dragging the canoes up angry rapids and carrying heavy loads across slippery rocks their track across the wilderness was marked by little heaps of ashes and white chips scattered about fallen trees  but some of the memories were sharp there was the evening she found thirlwell carrying her belongings a double stage in order that she might have all she needed when they camped he panted as he leaned against a tree and his face and hair were wet she felt moved but angry that he had exhausted himself for her she did not want him to think she knew what her comfort cost and was willing to let him buy it at such a price she remembered that she had begun to speculate rather often about what he thought  then there was the morning they saw a halfcovered rock a few yards off in the foam of a furious rapid she had tried to brace herself for the shock expecting next moment to be thrown into the water but thirlwell with a sweep of the paddle ran the canoe past so far he had never failed in an emergency and she felt that she could not have chosen a better guide and companion he was resourceful and overcame difficulties he seemed to know when she would sooner be quiet and when she liked to talk they had talked much beside the campfires and although he was not clever she remembered what he said  but she had something else to think about that gave her a sense of loss and a poignant melancholy indeed she had forced her mind to dwell upon the other matters in order to find relief and she was glad when thirlwell broke the silence  we ought to make the shadow by tomorrow noon and the mine in the evening  i think we go down the grand rapid before we reach the mine  thirlwell made a sign of agreement and after a moments hesitation she gave him a quick glance  i wonder if you know what day tomorrow is i mean the associations it has for me  yes he said in a sympathetic voice i thought you would sooner not talk about it but i remember in a way its curious you should be here now  ah she said i wanted to be in the north when the day came round but i did not imagine i should go down the rapid in the evening it was in the evening the canoe capsized  dusk was falling the smoke of a bush fire blew across the river and there was a moon  the moon will be out tomorrow agatha said quietly it is strange i couldnt have arranged that things should happen like this  she paused for some moments and then resumed perhaps it is ridiculous but i imagine now i am going to find the lode the doubts i started with have gone i feel calmly confident  thirlwell noted the emotional tremble in her voice and thought he had better use some tact  i must see the load that got wet is properly put up he said and moved back into the shadow but agatha sat still watching the smoke curl among the dark trunks  she had not exaggerated for a feeling of quiet confidence had been getting stronger all day there was no obvious reason for it and the difficulties she must overcome were greater than she had thought but she felt that she would succeed after all her father had loved her best she was making the search for his sake and when she reached the scene of his efforts she would find some help the hope was of course illogical and she was a teacher of science but it was unshakable and comforted her then she mused about her fathers life in the wilds something had happened to him for she had noted thirlwells reserve perhaps bitter disappointment had broken him down she did not know and would not ask it was enough that he had loved her she was satisfied with this     chapter xxiii  stranges legacy   it was afternoon when the canoes slid out from the forest on to the broad expanse of the shadow river the day was calm and hot although the sky was covered with soft gray clouds that subdued the light the river had shrunk for the driftwood on the bank stood high above the water level and thirlwell had only known it sink so low during the summer when strange was drowned for all that the current ran fast and the long rows of pines rolled swiftly back to meet the canoes as they floated down the trees had lost their rigid outline and melted gently into the blue distance while the savage landscape was softened by the play of tender light and shadow  agatha was glad that thirlwell did not talk and thought he knew she wanted to be quiet this was a day she set apart from other days when it came round for it was in the evening her fathers canoe capsized since they drifted out on the shadow she had followed the track of his last voyage and wondered with poignant tenderness what he had thought and felt somehow she did not believe he had come back embittered by disappointment and it was perhaps strange that she did not feel sad indeed she felt nothing of the shrinking she had feared although her eyes filled now and then her mood was calm and sorrow had yielded to a gentle melancholy  in the meantime the current swept them on past rippling eddies and rings of foam about halfcovered rocks and presently a gray trail of smoke stretched far along the bank thirlwell said the woods were burning they often burned in summer though nobody knew how the fires were lighted by degrees the trees got dimmer but the water shone with a pale gleam and presently the moon came out between drifting clouds then as they swept round a bend a throbbing agatha had heard for some time got suddenly loud and she glanced at thirlwell  the grand rapid he said the waters very low its quite safe  agatha knew he did not think she was afraid he had tactfully pretended to misunderstand her glance and she fixed her eyes ahead the shadows were deeper and the forest was indistinct but it was not dark besides the moon was getting bright and threw a glittering beam across the river she could see for some distance and not far in front the water was furrowed and marked by lines of foam the stream ran very fast and the throbbing swelled into a deep sullen roar there was a smell of burning and now and then a trail of smoke drifted out from the bank beyond which a red glow glimmered against the sky it was like this she thought on that other evening when her father returned from his last journey but the melancholy she had felt had given way to a strange emotional excitement somehow she knew the pilgrimage she had made for his sake would end as she had hoped  for all that she set her lips and grasped the side of the canoe when they came to the top of the rapid spray that looked like steam rolled across the water blurring the tops of the crested waves that ran back as far as one could see and here and there in the smooth black patches a wedge of foam boiled behind a rock outside the furious midstream rush of the current dark eddies revolved in angry circles and their backwash weltered along the bank thirlwell seemed to be steering for this belt and agatha thought he meant to run down through the slack as they swerved towards the rocks she looked round sharply for there was a shout from the canoe astern  voici qui ven  an indistinct figure scrambled along the rough bank turning and twisting among the driftwood and boulders for the most part the bank was in shadow but in places where the trees were not so thick the moonlight pierced the gloom  but he run exclaimed the metis in thirlwells canoe lak caribou vent a terre  pren garde said thirlwell warningly and thrust hard with his paddle as the canoe drove past a foamlapped rock  it is the chase he make the halfbreed resumed and another figure came out of the gloom a short distance in front of the one they had seen  the man moved feebly stumbling now and then but it was obvious that he meant to keep ahead of his pursuer as he crossed a belt of moonlight one of the metis recognized him for he cried steve le sauage regardez moi livrogne  agatha thought the man was drunk this would account for his awkwardness but as he turned and staggered down the bank she saw him plainer and he looked ill he dragged himself along with an effort his gait was uneven as if one leg was weak but he went on towards the waters edge a moment later he pushed off a canoe made a few strokes with the paddle and then let her swing out with an eddy until she was caught by the midstream rush after this he crouched in the stern and the craft began to drift down the rapid the other man stopped and threw out his arms as if he meant to protest that he could do nothing more  father lucien said thirlwell black steves risking a capsize  they sped past the man upon the bank and agatha watched the crouching figure in the canoe the craft was a short distance in front of but outside theirs and she could see the danger of her being smashed or swamped it was plain that the only safe way down was through the slack along the bank but the man made no effort to reach this smoother belt he let the paddle trail in the water while the canoe rocked among the angry waves his rashness fascinated agatha and she could not look away although she knew she might see him drown  cant you do something she asked thirlwell  no he said sternly were loaded and would be swamped steves drunk and must take his chance  a few moments later the canoe in front plunged down a furious rush of the current lurched up on a white wave rolled over and vanished agatha trembled and felt cold and the metis shouted vla cen est fait  a black object that looked like a head rose from the racing foam and agatha turned to thirlwell imperiously  go and help him  he hesitated and she knew it was on her account then he lifted his paddle  au secour  the canoe swerved swung out from the slack and plunged into the foam she lifted her bows high out of the water while a white ridge rolled up astern and for the next minute or two agatha saw nothing clearly spray beat upon her whipping her face she had a confused sense of furious speed but felt that the canoe was controlled water splashed on board the metis bent forward and his shoulders moved in savage jerks behind them the other canoe plunged down the rapid rather bounding than sliding from wave to wave in front the black shape of the overturned craft washed to and fro like a drifting log thirlwell shouted as they sped past a rock the canoe was swung violently sideways and they were out of the main rush there was an eddy behind the rock and the water ran round in whitelined rings the moonlight fell across the center and agatha saw a mans dark head  thirlwell backed his paddle and as they swept round in a semicircle the metis stretched out his arm they were very near the man in the water and when he spun round like a cork in the revolving backwash the moonlight touched his wet face agatha leaning over the side saw that he was the man who had broken into farnams house the halfbreed missed him and he looked up at her as the canoe shot past he was so close that she could almost touch him and she saw a look of fear in his staring eyes then without making an effort to reach the canoe he slipped under thirlwells hand and sank  the canoe turned and an indistinct object broke the surface it vanished the canoe was swept back to the edge of the main rush and for a minute or two thirlwell and the halfbreed struggled desperately when they reached the slack again there was nothing but angry water and racing foam the man had gone and agatha shivered and felt faint  after that she had a hazy impression of streaming woods and flying belts of gloom as they swept down through the slack until they drove out upon the tailpool for some minutes thirlwell and the halfbreeds battled with the eddies and then they floated on smoothly and a light began to twinkle among the pines  thirlwell steered for the bank and scott and some of the miners met them at the landing agatha was glad to leave the canoe for her nerves were badly jarred  thirlwell presented scott who took them to the shack which looked as if it had been recently cleaned he said agatha must make use of it for a day or two and he and thirlwell would find a berth in the storeshed then they began to talk about the accident and scott said driscoll came back from the bush looking ill a week since and shut himself up in his shack one of the boys told father lucien who went along to look after him and found him very sick thats all i know  agatha asked a few questions and then told them about the burglary  i am sure he was the man who opened my trunk she said  ah said scott do you think he knew you  i believe he did its curious but i thought he was afraid  perhaps he was afraid scott agreed with a meaning look at thirlwell who got up  i had better go to meet father lucien hell come down to the landing after us  he found the missionary hurrying along the bank and stopping him sat down  driscolls gone we did our best to pick him up he remarked and related what had happened we may find him in the tailpool tomorrow but i imagine hell be washed away down river like his victim  then you think strange was his victim  i cant doubt it now but how did steve get out of the shack  perhaps that was my fault but he had been delirious for a day and night and in the afternoon when he was calmer i went to sleep one is apt to sleep too long when one is tired when i wakened he was not in bed and a whisky bottle i had taken from him was nearly empty i think he must have disturbed me as he moved about because when i went outside i saw him making for the river i ran but i came too late and you know the rest  you are not to blame said thirlwell you have twice taken pity on a man who tried to starve you he meant you to die of hunger the night he stole into your camp  he is dead one must be charitable what would he gain by leaving me to die  dont you know thirlwell asked we can talk frankly now the matter has been taken out of our hands when he got better after the first attack the time i kept watch with you he had probably some remembrance of his ravings anyhow i expect he remembered hed got a fright and may have talked he thought you knew too much  its possible said father lucien very quietly  thirlwell was silent for a few moments and then resumed i hesitated about going to his help we were heavily loaded the risk was great and i thought miss stranges life worth more than his she made me go and i believe i could have saved him but he saw her and let himself sink she declares he looked afraid  it is very strange  i dont find it strange said thirlwell theres a touch of dramatic justice about the thing that appeals to me i suppose you know what day it is driscoll knew  father lucien shook his head what is one day more than another when all wrongs are put right and crimes punished in the end justice is not theatrical but the obstinate offender cannot escape he paused and then resumed well we shall never know all that happened and as you have said the matter is no longer in our hands perhaps for the girls sake  yes said thirlwell she has borne enough you can imagine the shock shed get if we found out and had to tell her the things done with its some relief to feel that my responsibility has gone  father lucien made a sign of agreement i will come to see her tomorrow he said but thirlwell knew that agatha would never learn from him that stranges canoe had not been accidentally capsized  early next morning thirlwell went to the tailpool but nothing except some driftwood washed about in the eddy the latter had worn out a deep hollow and he scrambled over the rocks in order to look down into its revolving depths there was nothing there and when going back he made his way across some worn slabs that had been covered until the water sank to an unusually low level by and by he stopped at the edge of a pool a small round object that was not the color of the stones lay at the bottom  thirlwell knelt down and rolling up his sleeve got the object out it was made of white metal that had tarnished but not corroded and looked like an oldfashioned pocket tobaccobox the thing was well made for he could hardly find the joint of the lid and below the latter there was some engraving he rubbed it with a little fine sand and then started as he read a name it was stranges tobaccobox and a light dawned on him  he knew now why driscoll had haunted the reefs when the water was low and thought he knew what was inside the box this was the thing strange had taken with him but driscoll had looked in the wrong place the box was heavy but perhaps a flood had rolled it down the rapid or it had fallen from stranges pocket when the stream washed his rotting clothes away  thirlwell shook the box and something rattled inside after which he noted a dark smear round the edge of the lid he scraped this with his knife and thought the stuff was a waterproof gum the freighters used to caulk their canoes it looked as if strange had carefully made the joint watertight and thirlwells curiosity was strongly excited but the box was not his it was too early to look for agatha and he waited with some impatience until she came out of the shack and sat down in the sunshine after breakfast  i think this was your fathers he said putting the box in her hand and told her how he had found it  agatha started yes i gave it him on his birthday long since it was bright then old english pewter i think i saw it in a little store where they sold curiosities and had it engraved  somewhat to thirlwells annoyance scott came up with father lucien whom he presented to agatha but she did not put the box away  mr thirlwell found this in the river but the lid is fast she said will somebody help me to open it  scott took the box into the shack where he had some tools and brought it back with the lid just raised above its socket he gave it to agatha and was going away when she stopped him  i would like you and father lucien to wait you knew my father and i think there is something important in the box  they came nearer and pressing back the lid she shook out a few small stones  specimens she said in a strained voice holding out two or three to thirlwell dont you think theyre very like the piece i gave you  thirlwell examined the stones and handed them to scott who nodded  this stuff and the specimen thirlwell showed me came from the same vein  theres something else agatha resumed taking out a folded paper her hand shook as she opened it and the tears gathered in her eyes then she gave thirlwell the paper  will you read it for me i cant see very well  the paper was spotted with mildew torn at the bottom and cut at the folds but holding it carefully he read  the agatha mine frontage on the lode staked by gordon strange  compass bearings calculated distances and landmarks were given next and then the writing stopped an inch or two from the bottom of the sheet  your father found the lode thirlwell said very quietly  agatha looked up with a curious smile yes i feel as if he had sent me this i have come into my inheritance and it is easier than i thought she paused and added once or twice i was afraid and nearly let it go     chapter xxiv  agatha resumes her journey   there was silence for a minute or two after agatha had spoken and then father lucien said now we know what driscoll looked for few secrets can be kept  thirlwell gave him a warning glance that agatha did not note she was gazing across the river her face towards the north as if she had forgotten the others but she presently roused herself  can we start tomorrow she asked  no said thirlwell firmly you must rest for two or three days and there are a number of things to be got  i dont think i can rest until i have seen the lode  you will have to try it may be some time yet before we find the spot for one thing the directions arent complete you see they stop  agatha took the paper yes i hadnt noticed that it begins very clearly and then breaks off i wonder why  thirlwell said nothing it looked as if strange had been interrupted the shakiness of the last few lines hinted that they had been written in haste there was a space between the last and the bottom of the paper perhaps driscoll had joined him and he had distrusted the man who might have come into the camp while he was writing then when he afterwards sealed the box he had forgotten that he had not finished what he meant to say but if the supposition were correct this was not remarkable strange might have taken some liquor with him but agatha must not suspect  the paper states the claim was staked she resumed so far as that goes it makes the ore mine george must have a share but i mean to work the lode  im afraid it doesnt go very far scott remarked the law requires that the discoverer stakes off the ground he is entitled to and then registers the claim at the nearest record office after this he must do a certain amount of development work before he gets his patent and becomes the owner of the mine the claim has not been recorded yet  no it has lapsed agatha agreed this means that any adult british citizen may make a rediscovery record well we must do so as soon as we can  developing a mine is rough work for a woman  agatha smiled theres something about the discoverer being allowed to appoint a deputy and perhaps mr thirlwell will look after my interests but wont you see about getting us all that he thinks needful  ill see about it now said scott who took thirlwell away but stopped when they were hidden by the pines  strange has given you a useful clue but thats all he said youll find the lode if you find the valley but you may look for a long time  thirlwell made a sign of agreement yes theres something curiously elusive about this ore  all the same its certainly worth a proper search but youll need a large quantity of truck and one or two extra packers i understand miss strange insists upon everything being done at her cost has she money enough  i think not  you know she has not looks as if you had forgotten you showed me her letter when she stated the sum its hard to see how it covers expenses up to date  thirlwell looked embarrassed and scott laughed you seem to have been generous particularly as you didnt believe in the lode but anything you have saved from your wages wont carry you far well you can take the truck and tools you need and ill give you two of the boys miss strange can pay me when she gets her patent or if she likes ill butt in on a partnership basis and run my risk she can decide which line shell take after she locates the ore  thanks ill take the truck said thirlwell  he knew scott wanted to help him and not to gain something for himself but it might be an advantage for agatha to make an arrangement with him when she owned the mine  theres another thing scott went on since the clermont isnt paying i might lend you to miss strange if you were anxious to undertake the development work but the law doesnt require very much of this what are you going to do when the patents granted  thirlwell made an abrupt movement until that morning he had doubted if agatha would find the vein but he was forced to admit the possibility of her doing so when the vein was proved and she owned the claim she would no longer need him as she needed him now nor would he be able to neglect his duties and follow her about as unpaid adviser  i dont know what im going to do i havent thought about it yet  miss strange must have a manager if youre willing to undertake the job i daresay i could let you go then if she wouldnt sooner trust her judgment i think i could give you a pretty good character  no said thirlwell sharply and stopped he suspected that scott was amused and it jarred him to think of becoming agathas hired servant  well said scott with a twinkle exploring the bush with a charming girl is no doubt very pleasant while the summer lasts but it doesnt lead to much in fact so far as i know your views it leads to nothing anyhow i must see what we have in the store that would be useful  he went away and thirlwell after sitting still for some minutes with a frown got up and moodily followed the trail to the river bank scott had shown him that his friendship with agatha could not continue on the lines it ran on now in a way he had for some time recognized this but it was not until he found the tobaccobox the truth became overwhelmingly plain their pleasant relations must either come to an end very shortly or be built up again on a new foundation and the first was unthinkable he walked along the bank until he got calmer and then went back to examine a canoe he meant to caulk after all the lode was not found yet  they stayed three days at the mine while their outfit was got ready and when drummond was not at work he followed agatha about he said he liked the woods spoke of his employers with frank appreciation and declared that he was grateful because she had got him his post besides this he made no secret of a humble devotion to herself that she sometimes found embarrassing and sometimes amusing on the evening before they left the mine he joined the group outside the shack  well said scott rather dryly what do you want  miss strange pulls out for the north tomorrow and if shell take me im going along  wait a moment scott said to agatha and then asked drummond why do you want to go  i mean to get even with stormont and i want to put miss strange as wise as i can  then we are to understand you expect nothing for the job  drummonds black eyes sparkled youre my boss so far but i wont stand for being guyed its not your money im after  perhaps the rejoinders justifiable father lucien remarked smiling and drummond turned to agatha with a touch of dignity  i meant to make my pile by selling the ore to somebody but you treated me like a white man and i guess the lode belongs to you well if i help you get rich and you want to give me something i wont refuse but im not out for money say youll let me go  can you help scott interrupted if you can it looks as if you had kept something back when you made the other deal  drummond grinned i kept something back from stormont when i put him wise i put him off the track but im playing straight with miss strange and thirlwell you can bet on me  then well take you said agatha with a deprecatory glance at thirlwell  youre not going to be sorry about it drummond declared and when he went away agatha turned to father lucien  its your business to judge mens character do you think i have done well  i imagine the lad will make good he has two incentives he likes you and hates your adversary  ah said agatha smiling i wonder which is the stronger  father lucien spread out his hands and his eyes twinkled i am a priest miss strange and must admit that i cannot tell you have won the young mans confidence but his is a primitive nature and hate counts for much  you are an honest man said agatha after all the truth is better than compliments  the party broke up soon afterwards and early next morning agatha left the mine with thirlwell drummond and a white rockborer as well as the halfbreed packers they poled up the shadow for some distance and then followed a small creek tracking the canoes which were heavily loaded indeed when they carried the freight by relays across the portages agatha was surprised to note the quantity of tools and stores since the cost of transport made such things dear it looked as if thirlwell had made her money go a long way  as they pushed on the country got wilder the rocks were more numerous the trees smaller and in places they crossed wide belts where fires had raged the flames had burned off the branches but left the trunks and the long rows of rampikes sprang from the new brush shining a curious silvergray where they caught the light the mode of travel however did not change sometimes they paddled up sparkling lakes and sometimes dragged the canoes over ledges and gravelbeds in shallow creeks until the water shrunk and they made a laborious portage across a rocky height  the journey was made as much by land as water and at first agatha wondered that the men were capable of such toil but by degrees she found that she could carry more than she had thought and laughing at thirlwells protests often struggled through the brush with a heavy load the hot sunshine that lasted so long and the freshness that followed when the shadows deepened calmed and strengthened her she felt braced in mind and body her doubts and impatience had gone she was quietly confident that they would find the ore  but they did not find it and at length the time agatha had allowed herself came to an end it was possible that she had already lost her post at the school but if not and she wanted to keep it she must return at once  she did not however mean to give up the search while their food held out and there was no shortage yet perhaps because the halfbreeds often went fishing and gathered wild berries then one hot day when they nooned beside a shining lake and she sat in the shade of a boulder she heard the men talking  the summer she is good a metis remarked me i lak better make the prospect than the freight chercher largent cest le bo jeu  we havent struck much argent yet said the white miner i wonder what the boss thinks and guess hes up against something walked past at an awkward piece on the last portage as if he didnt see me with his forehead wrinkled up seen him look like that when he reckoned the roof was coming down on us  agathas curiosity was excited because she thought she had noted a subtle difference in thirlwells manner there was a hint of reserve and sometimes he looked disturbed then drummond interrupted his companion  you cant tell what the boss thinks when he doesnt want and were certainly going to find the lode  id like to see you strike it all right because if you dont youre going to be some dollars out the miner replied dont know whos paying for this outfit but id put it pretty high  what dyou reckon it cost drummond asked  the miner made a calculation and agatha listened with strained interest as he enumerated the different items  well said drummond i cant value the tools and powder but allowing for transport youve got the stores nearly right anyhow im going swimming if pierre will give me ten yards ill race him to the island  they went away and agatha sat still with a hot face she had trusted thirlwell and he had deceived her her money had soon been exhausted and the journey was now being made at his expense she felt as if she had been robbed of something to which she had a sacred right she had let a stranger undertake the task that was peculiarly hers then she had been cheated so easily thirlwell must think her a fool or perhaps that she was willing to be deceived  getting calmer she admitted that his object was good he wanted to help but it was unthinkable that she should trade upon his generosity she resolved to talk to him about it but he had gone into the bush to look for the best line across the neck between them and another lake when he came back the men were unloading the canoes and he occupied himself with making up the packs  they had camped and eaten supper before her opportunity came and then as they sat by the waters edge she told him what she had heard he listened quietly until she asked was the mans calculation correct  nearly so he was rather above the mark  then i am in your debt  does that hurt  yes said agatha with some hesitation in a way it hurts very much i dont mean that its embarrassing to take your help though it is embarrassing you see i felt i must find the lode myself its my duty and you have taken away the satisfaction i might have felt besides you cheated me  thirlwell was silent for a few moments and then said im sorry you find it hard to let me help but unless i had done so you couldnt have gone far  you should have been frank and let me wait  for another year the north is no place for a white woman after the rivers freeze  agatha said nothing she had not thought about this and it would have been very hard to wait until summer came again  well he resumed i cheated you because i could see no other plan i think you have waited too long if you had gone on thinking about nothing but the lode it would have done you harm  did it harm my father  yes said thirlwell quietly and agatha dared ask nothing more besides she knew that he would not tell her much  now he went on i have owned my fault but youre rather taking it for granted that my object was altogether unselfish after all the law only gives you so much frontage on the vein and theres nothing to prevent my staking off a claim on the rest  that is so said agatha but the paper states that my father claimed the edge of the cliff where for a time the ore could be easily worked as your block would lie farther back you would have to sink a shaft and drive a tunnel this would cost you much  the cost wouldnt matter if the ore was rich i could get all the capital i wanted  agatha gave him a quiet ironical smile then you really came with me because you meant to stake a claim thats curious mr thirlwell because i think you never believed my father found the lode at all  he colored and hesitated well let it go theres something else if you turn back now can you reach toronto before the school reopens  no said agatha with a soft excited laugh i did not mean to turn back until i was forced when i reached toronto i should find somebody else had got my post  thirlwell noted her courage although he thought she was rash wouldnt it be awkward but i suppose your brother  i should not go to george he is kind but believes i have inherited my fathers illusion he always hated to hear him talk about the lode and would think i was properly punished for my folly but i neednt go on you must understand  i dont understand the only thing i see is that youre not logical its obvious now that you must if possible find the ore and yet you object to letting me help if you give up the search and return to toronto it may be a very long time before you can make another trip  no i suppose im not logical agatha admitted with a mocking smile logic is perhaps a useful guide for a man but it doesnt always take him far however i oughtnt to have expected you to understand and youre getting impatient  lets try to be practical thirlwell rejoined if we turn back at once some of the truck we havent used might be sold and we would save the wages i promised the boys but all we have spent would be thrown away well id hate to feel that either of us must bear a loss like that  i have heard george say that a good business man cuts his losses  its sometimes a better plan to hold on and get your money back  but how can we get our money back if we cant find the lode you dont think well do so  thirlwell frowned theres a chance of finding it a fighting chance now were near the spot and have the truck lets play the chance for all its worth you can pay me when you get your patent or make any plan you like then scott really supplied the stores and made some suggestions that i didnt mean to talk about unless our search succeeded  he related what scott had said and added anyhow lets go on for a fortnight then if you insist well take the back trail  agatha gave him a quick glance and he thought her eyes had softened but she got up  very well she said and went to her tent     chapter xxv  the broken range   the fortnight agatha agreed to had nearly gone when early one morning thirlwell and drummond climbed a hill behind the camp and stood on the summit looking about thin mist drifted across the low ground in front but some miles off a forestcovered ridge rose against the sky it was hardly a range of hills but rather what prospectors call a height of land a moderately elevated watershed marking off two river basins running roughly east and west as far as he could see it limited thirlwells view and had puzzled him for some days  since the rivers that drained the country flowed northeast to hudson bay it was obvious that there must be an opening in the ridge but he had been unable to find one moreover as stranges creek ran south before it turned east he imagined it was on his side of the heighth of land but he had seen no stream flowing in either direction stranges notes were incomplete and although thirlwell calculated that he was about thirty miles from the spot where the ore outcropped he had found none of the landmarks the creek was not behind him but a radius of thirty miles would cover a wide belt of country and he doubted if he could persuade agatha to extend the fortnight her obstinacy was ridiculous but must be reckoned on  by and by a faint breeze sprang up and the mist rolled back here and there a lake sparkled in the light of the rising sun and dark pines rose out of the streaming vapor but there was no glistening thread to indicate a creek and thirlwell turned to drummond with an impatient frown  do you see anything that you think you ought to recognize  no said drummond rather sulkily i dont  you havent been of much use to us yet i think you stated that when you got here youd recollect all your father told you about stranges talk seeing the places would bring things back  i havent seen the places and the old man was very sick when he told me anyhow ive tracked your blamed canoes and packed your stores across the divides guess id have hit the back trail long since if it wasnt for miss strange  then we had better get down said thirlwell the boys dont seem to have started to cook breakfast and i want to pull out soon  he was turning away when drummond stopped him stretching out his arm hold on whats that yonder  mist said thirlwell impatiently  no its too dark look again  thirlwell started the mist was drifting past the detached clump of pines his companion indicated but its color was silvery and he now noted a faint blue streak this was something of a shock for he had thought there was nobody but his party in the neighborhood  smoke he exclaimed go down as fast as you can and tell the boys not to make a fire  when drummond went off thirlwell sat down and watched the smoke it got plainer and rose in a thick blue cloud when the mist rolled away somebody was cooking breakfast and the volume of smoke indicated a large fire it looked as if there were a number of men to be fed and thirlwell had not expected to find indians near the spot just then after a time the smoke died away and he went back to camp but told agatha nothing about what he had seen when breakfast was over he took one of the metis and plunged into the bush there was not much need for caution because the party would no doubt set off when they had finished their meal and if they were indians it did not matter if he met them but he did not think they were indians  when he had gone a mile or two he stopped at the edge of a muskeg and sent the metis on to a clump of pines on the other side the man keeping in the shadow stole round the swamp and vanished noiselessly in the underbrush after a time he reappeared beckoning and thirlwell knitted his brows when he joined him  the ashes of a fire smoldered between two hearthlogs white chips and broken branches were scattered about near his feet were six small round holes spaced in a regular pattern and a cotton flourbag and some empty cans lay beneath a bush  a white mans camp they had a tent he said  sure agreed the metis teepee poles they not mak hole lak dat  well i reckon a sourdough prospector wouldnt have bothered about a tent looks as if one of them was a tenderfoot quen pensetu  the metis keen eyes had wandered round the camp and he nodded but yes dat man sait vivre he lak it comfortable  a city man thirlwell remarked with a frown how many packers  quat said the metis  voyageurs  the metis laughed scornfully as he indicated the trampled brush broken branches greasy papers and scraps of food me i think no railroad outfit voyageur not muss up camp lak dat  thirlwell agreed a halfbreed voyageur does not waste food and with inherited caution seldom disturbs the bush it looked as if the city man had engaged a gang of tracklayers who are used to pioneering and sometimes carry surveyors stores through the wilds  well he said well follow their trail  the party had obviously left the water for a time because their track led away from the creek in the valley and the bush was too thick to permit the portaging of canoes thirlwell followed the trail until he satisfied himself that they were going east and then went back to his camp finding agatha at the waters edge he sat down opposite  im afraid you didnt get much breakfast but i didnt want the fire lighted he said and told her what he had seen  ah she cried do you think stormont is looking for the ore  i think so im not certain  but he failed to find it once and nearly starved  thirlwell smiled i understand the fellows obstinate he may have got a fresh clue or found out something we dont know  do you think he has been following us  i dont if hed known we were in the neighborhood he would not have lighted a fire  after all said agatha thoughtfully my father stated that he had staked the claim  im afraid that doesnt count for much youre not recognized as prospective owner until your records filed i imagine your fathers statement would carry some weight but going to law about a mine is generally an expensive job and its hard to put up a good fight against a man with capital  then what are you going to do about it agatha asked anxiously  get away from here at once and as far as possible keep to the lakes water carries no trail then stormont has decided a point that has been bothering mesince hes gone east we must go north or west  yes unless its possible that his clue is better than ours  i thought about that thirlwell replied we dont know if he has a clue but well stick to ours and take the risk your fathers directions are plain enough if we can find the first of his landmarks  then go west said agatha i imagine the creek is on this side of the range  thirlwell got up and went to see the canoes launched but he wondered whether agatha remembered that there were only two or three days of the fortnight left he thought she did remember but he resolved that they would not turn back  soon after they started a fresh breeze sprang up from the northwest and the shadows of flying clouds sped across the lake the sky between the clouds was a curious vivid blue the light was strong and the woods along the bank flashed into bright color and faded to somber green as the gleams of sunshine passed for a few minutes trunks and branches stood out sharply distinct and then melted suddenly into their background by degrees the ripples that lined the lake got larger there was an angry splashing at the bows of the canoes and little showers of spray began to fly  this clearness means the wind will hold and its right ahead thirlwell said to agatha we havent had much luck of late  the luck will change she answered smiling i am confident  confidence doesnt cost you much effort thirlwell rejoined you were persuaded from the beginning that you would find the ore it looks as if you were naturally optimistic  oh no i had my weak moments when i wanted to shirk i hated to feel i wasnt free like other people and was willing to throw away my chance of getting rich but that wouldnt have helped much i couldnt get rid of the duty  you have pluck for all that i think youre indulging a rather exaggerated sentiment anyhow its hard to imagine you have had many doubts since we left the mine  ive had none when you found the tobaccobox i knew i would succeed there was something strangely significant about your finding it  i happened to look in the right place said thirlwell dryly  agatha laughed you take a very matteroffact view  perhaps so thirlwell agreed if i were steeped in sentiment it wouldnt help me drive the canoe faster against a headwind or carry a heavier load across a portage thats a purely mechanical proposition in the meantime were slowing up and will soon begin to drift astern  then paddle said agatha smiling after all youre much more of a sentimentalist than i think you know  thirlwell bent over his paddle and the canoe forged ahead but the breeze freshened and the ripples changed to crested waves agathas face was wet her slicker dripped and the men breathed hard between the strokes they labored on and at noon ran the canoes aground in the lee of a rocky island thirlwell ordered the metis to use nothing but dry driftwood which makes little smoke for the fire and when they rested after a meal found drummond sitting alone outside the camp he looked moody and his eyes were fixed on the height of land  feeling bothered about something thirlwell asked  yes said drummond im trying to get back all the old man told me about stranges tale he only talked about it once when he was sick looks as if he hadnt thought the lode a business proposition and i didnt then besides i was anxious and didnt listen much part of it came back afterwards but not all theres something i cant get  thats unlucky thirlwell remarked in a dry tone we need a hint  i reckoned id get it when i saw the country drummond went on i allow were not far enough yet  thirlwell made a sign of disagreement strange said the creek ran south and then turned east i imagine there isnt another neighborhood where thats likely to happen if we cross the divide i expect well find the water running north  well said drummond moodily youd better leave me alone theres somethingif im quiet i may get what im feeling for he knitted his brows and a curious fixed look came into his eyes i know its not far off but i miss it when im just getting on the track  thirlwell left him and smiled half impatiently as he went back across the rocks he had sometimes been puzzled and sometimes amused by agathas confidence and now drummond who had given him no help so far talked about an elusive clue it looked as if both allowed their imagination too much rein and trusted to vague feelings instead of their reasoning powers give him a compass bearing or a definite baseline to calculate an angle from and he would engage to take the party to the required spot but he had frankly no use for the other thing yet he sometimes wonderedthere was a calm assurance in agathas eyes if this was not founded on superstition from what did it spring  they launched again in the afternoon and reached the head of the lake wet and tired thirlwell did not talk much after supper but sat by the fire smoking for some time after agatha went to her tent he had in fact been rather silent for the last few days now they were near the end of their journey he did not know if he wanted agatha to find the lode or not when they started he had imagined that the search would lead to nothing and had gone because her society had a charm and he wanted to free her mind of a dangerous illusion but he could no longer think the lode an illusion the silver was there and if one searched long enough could no doubt be found  this was somehow disturbing but with a halfconscious wish to shirk the truth he would not inquire bluntly why it disturbed him he wanted the girl to be happy and had thought it best for her that she should give up the attempt to find the lode now he must readjust his views and it was hard to see what place there would be for him in her affairs if she became the owner of a rich mining claim  next morning they made a difficult portage to another lake and launching the canoes at noon found the wind blowing fresh the lake was wide and when by and by an angry sea got up thirlwell reluctantly steered for the shelter of a rocky point they had covered very little ground since they started and there was only another day of the fortnight left after supper some of the men went fishing and drummond set off alone along the beach while agatha and thirlwell sat among the rocks where the pungent woodsmoke drifted past and kept the mosquitoes off the sun had set and the air was very clear they could see the ragged pines across the lake but the trees on the point behind them cut off their view to the north  presently drummond came back running fast and stopped in front of agatha his eyes sparkled and the sweat ran down his face  whats the matter thirlwell asked have the timber wolves got after you  the broken range drummond gasped get up miss strange and come right along  agatha looked at thirlwell who smiled i dont know what he means but perhaps we had better go  they followed the lad for some distance though the shingle was large and rough now and then he turned and looked back impatiently as if they were not coming fast enough but at length he stopped and indicated the high ground to the north its bold line colored a soft blue stood out against the yellow sky and in one place there was a sharply defined gap  there he exclaimed breathlessly i guess thats the broken range  i see the break said thirlwell what about it  dont embarrass him agatha interrupted its something he remembers perhaps his father talked about the gap  he did said drummond the things been kind of floating in my mind all day but i couldnt get it fixed then i saw that gap and knew id got what id been feeling for  what did your father say  the indian camp he sent strange to was in thin bush close under the broken range on the north side  thirlwell turned to agatha then we oughtnt to have much trouble in locating the ore we know where the factory stood and if we can find the thin bush i can follow the line your father took  agathas eyes shone and her color came and went but with an effort she preserved her calm  after all the bush may have grown  i think not said thirlwell its probably rocky ground where the trees are small  but how was it my father did not see the gap  that is easily accounted for the gaps not large and i expect you can only see it when youre directly opposite at a right angle to the line of the high ground if you moved back a mile or two the rocks and trees would shut it in drummond didnt see it as we came up the lake  i suppose we must wait until tomorrow  yes said thirlwell we must leave the water and cant get through the bush in the dark  agatha made a sign of agreement very well i am glad the nights are very short but i would like to start at daybreak  then they turned and went back silently to camp thirlwell was conscious of a keen disturbance that he would not analyze and saw that agatha did not want to talk as a matter of fact agatha could not talk she felt a curious exaltation her heart was full     chapter xxvi  the lode   at daybreak next morning thirlwell sent the metis up the lake to make a cache of the provisions he did not need and hide the canoes in the brush in the meantime he scattered the ashes of the fire and buried the empty cans and all the chips he could find there was another party in the neighborhood and he wanted to leave nothing to indicate that the spot had been recently occupied by a camp when the men returned the party set off along the beach loaded with food and tools walking across the stones and ledges was laborious but he did not mean to leave a trail and kept to the waters edge for some distance before he plunged into the bush  after this their progress was very slow the small trees grew close together and in places the ground was covered with rotting trunks and branches moreover the line he took led steadily upwards towards the break in the range it did not look very far off when they started but dusk was falling and the packers were nearly exhausted when they threw down their loads at the bottom of the gap thirlwells back ached and the straps had galled his shoulders but he noted with some surprise that agatha did not look tired she dropped behind as they toiled up the last rough stony slope but she helped to pitch camp her movements were not languid and her eyes were bright  by and by she took out the worn paper from the tobaccobox and asked thirlwell a few questions he answered rather moodily and as soon as he could picked up his blanket and went off to the bed he had made of twigs the hollow he had found was sheltered and the twigs were soft but it was long before he slept they were near the spot where strange claimed to have seen the ore and he was now persuaded that they would find the vein if the ore carried as much silver as the specimens indicated agatha would be rich she would go back to the cities and if her riches were not to separate them altogether he must enter her employment somehow he shrank from this  but the ore might prove poorer than one thought and the mine cost much to work he would not admit that he hoped so since he wanted agatha to enjoy all the happiness that wealth could give indeed he did not know what he hoped he was physically tired and although he felt strangely restless his brain was dull at length his eyes closed and for some hours he slept brokenly  getting up at daybreak he scrambled along the bottom of the gap until he could look down on the other side and presently turned with a start as he heard a rattle of stones agatha whom he had thought asleep advanced with a smile she looked very fresh and although he imagined she was highly strung her face was calm for a few moments she said nothing but stood close by gazing fixedly in front  there was some mist on the low ground but for the most part the tops of the pines rose above the haze the sky in the east was getting red and here and there one saw gleams of water and the gray backs of rocks that was all for the landscape was blurred to the north where a vague gray line hinted at another range  the haze is tantalizing she remarked by and by one could not see when we got here and i have been waiting for the dawn  i hoped you slept we made a long march yesterday  did you sleep  no said thirlwell anyhow not very much  agatha smiled yet you havent been thinking about the lode as i havethinking of nothing else for ever so long cant you imagine what it means to feel i am near the place at last  i can imagine it to some extent if the ore carries as much silver as we think you can do what you like when you get your patent build laboratories travel make friends with clever people in fact your money will buy you anything you want  do you really believe that agatha asked with a hint of mockery in her voice do you imagine i have been thinking about the money  i have thought about it thirlwell said and stopped when she gave him a curious glance of course he resumed theres some satisfaction in feeling you have finished a difficult job  now youre nearer the mark but you dont feel in the mood for philosophizing  im often dull before breakfast thirlwell replied all the same im glad youre happy in fact im trying to be sympathetic  and you find it hard  thirlwell colored but looked at her steadily  anyhow if the things possible im going to find the lode for you  yes she said without moving her eyes from his face i know youll try to find it youre trustworthy you play a straight game  i cheated once  that was when you thought the advantage would be mine but how far do you think we will have to go  perhaps i can tell you when the sun gets up we may have to search for three or four days we may strike the creek tonight  ah she said i hope it will not be three or four days now we are very near the suspense is keen then she smiled however we will go back and get breakfast because you must set your brain to work  it was next morning when they saw the first of stranges landmarks and thirlwell taking its bearing with the compass changed their line of march in the evening they climbed a low hill and when they reached its top which rose like an island from a waste of short pinescrub drummond stopped and touching agatha indicated the ridge across the valley  look he said the hollow rock  a small gray object dwarfed by the distance stood out against a smear of dark green on the crest of the high ground after studying it for a few moments thirlwell nodded  yes i think hes right  drummond turned to agatha with a sparkle in his eyes i quit now miss strange youve got there ahead of stormont i guess ive made good  you made good when you found the broken range agatha replied giving him a grateful look and drummonds dark face flushed with color as he turned away  they lost the rock as they went down hill but when they made camp the roar of falling water came faintly across the woods  the creek that runs south said thirlwell as he lighted the fire  they started early next morning but the ground was rough and the sun was getting low when they came down a rocky hill into a small round hollow through which shining water flowed the opposite slope was in shadow but the slanting sunbeams touched a belt of fresh growth that glowed a vivid green against the somber color of the surrounding trees  that said thirlwell is no doubt where the rampikes stood theyve gone and young willows have sprung up yonders the low cliff it looks as if we had arrived  agatha stopped for a few moments and felt her heart beat the dream she had first dreamed long since had come true but she knew it might not have done so had she not had thirlwells help in the meantime the scene impressed itself upon her brain so that she could long afterwards recall it when she wishedthe nearly level sunbeams falling across the trees and turning their bark fiery red the gleam of water and the figures of the men plodding slowly downhill with their loads their faces glowed like polished copper in the searching light their overalls were ragged and stained and one stumbled and lurched wildly down a slope with a rattle of rolling stones then she glanced at thirlwell who stood close by watching her with a sympathetic smile though his pose was rather strained  ah she said you have brought me here just now i cannot thank you as i ought  well go on he answered quietly id like to fire a shot or two before its dark and well need some time to drill the holes  agatha gave him a quick look you are nothing if youre not practical but perhaps thats fortunate one trusts practical people when there are things that must be done  the sunshine had faded when they reached the bottom of the hill and the hollow was shadowy and cool thirlwell ordered the men to make camp and then went with agatha to the foot of the cliff the creek that flowed past the rock ran clear and low and he got across by jumping from ledge to ledge then as he scrambled among the boulders towards a spot he had marked he heard a splash and looking round saw that agatha had slipped into the stream she waded across with the water rippling round her long boots and when she joined him trembled with suspense  you neednt have come over he said smiling as he indicated a band of darker color that seamed the ragged face of the gray stone thats all there is to see hardly looks as if it was worth your coming so far to find it it was a lucky accident the color caught your fathers eye the veins only distinct for a few yards where the frost has brought down the cliff i think well find it dips  agatha noted that his tone was very matteroffact although his face was set and thought she had better follow his lead  then the ore must once have outcropped its a good example of denudation  yes it probably ran out some distance back you can see how the creek has cut down the rock but frost and snow have helped one cant tell yet whether the best or worst has been lost but to begin with well look for the discovery post  they found it driven among the gravel then climbing a gully reached the crest of the rock thirlwell led agatha through the bush by his compass until he traced a rough oblong marked by other posts she followed him with confused emotions and once or twice her eyes filled with tears her father had driven these stakes she could imagine the thrill it gave him to feel that at length his faith and labor were justified his confidence had never wavered although he had borne mockery and contempt and the gentle ridicule of his anxious wife then when the prize he toiled for was won and he went back to enjoy it the river had swept him away but after all love had conquered the angry flood for he had left a clue that the rapid could not destroy  agatha thought thirlwell understood something of her feelings because he did not talk except when he showed her the posts when they reached the last he said on the whole i imagine your fathers judgment was good in fact he picked his ground like a mining engineer  he had twenty years to brood about the vein at home agatha replied are you surprised that he studied all the books on mining he could get  thirlwell made an apologetic gesture i oughtnt to be surprised he was your father and its obvious that you have prepared yourself to carry on his work well i think he has staked off the best of the vein at least his claim covers the part that can best be reached but youll have trouble with the water it may mean driving a drainage heading and putting up expensive pumps the ore may be rich enough to stand the extra cost but i can tell you more when i have fired a shot  they went back to the camp where the metis had cooked supper but thirlwell did not eat much and soon returned to the cliff he took the white rockborer but agatha did not go with him she felt chilled by his quietness it was now plain that since her father had marked off the exposed edge of the inclined lode thirlwell must sink a deep shaft if he wished to reach it farther back this however did not account for his moodiness for one thing he had not expected that they would find the ore besides he was generous and would want her to have the best it would have been a comfort to give him half the claim but he would refuse the gift she had meant to enjoy her triumph with him but this satisfaction had gone it hurt her to see him disturbed but she colored as she resolved that her success should not separate them if he was obstinate something must be risked  in the meantime thirlwell struck the drill his companion held his face was damp with sweat and the hammer slipped in his hands but he did not miss a stroke he had promised the girl his help and when the hole was sunk he chose the best spot for the next with fastidious care he meant to play a straight game although it would cost him much to let her win by and by the miner picked up some of the bits of stone  weights all right guess the stuffs carrying heavy metal he remarked still ive seen a lode pinch out it may be a pocket and the dirt run poor when you get farther in  its possible thirlwell agreed in a dull voice  the miner gave him a sharp glance looks as if you wouldnt be much disappointed dont you want the dirt to go rich  lets get on said thirlwell i want to fire the shot before its dark  then watch out for my fingers the miner rejoined when you pound her as youve been doing i like to see you keep your eye on the drill  they worked for some time and then thirlwell sent for agatha and helping her across the creek held up the ends of two or three fuses and a matchbox  its proper that you should fire the first shot ive put in a heavy charge and well know something about the ore when we see the stuff the blast brings down  agatha lighted the fuses and they hurried back to the shelter of the trees where she stood with her heart beating fast it was proper that she should be first to undertake her fathers work thirlwells thought was graceful she glanced at him but his brown face was inscrutable although his mouth was firm his quietness jarred she felt angry and disappointed as if she had been robbed of something  for all that she thrilled as she watched the faint sparkle of the fuse she had won the first battle more easily than she had thought and had now begun the next stage of the struggle she sprang from a pioneering stock and knew that the shot she fired would break the daunting silence of the woods for good if she failed to develop the mine somebody else would succeed the lonely hollow would soon be covered with tents and shacks mens voices and the rattle of machines would drown the soft splash of the creek she was blasting a way for civilization into the wilderness  a flash springing from different spots leaped across the foot of the cliff gray smoke rolled up and there was a roar that rolled in confused echoes across the woods the front of the rock seemed to totter behind the smoke great stones splashed in the water and flying pieces rattled among the trunks when the vapor began to clear and she wanted to run forward thirlwell put his hand on her arm  it wont be safe for some time youre not used to the fumes he said if you went there now you wouldnt be able to get up tomorrow  she followed him back to the camp where drummond and the miner joined them  in the morning ill go with you to see where we ought to stake the other claims he said to the men you can of course locate where you like but this job will need some capital and you want to get the best frontage you can that will help us later  they agreed without much enthusiasm now they had reached their object a reaction had begun and agatha was sensible of a curious flatness she knew that drummond and the rockborer could do nothing with their claims except sell them to somebody who could supply the money to develop the mines but before they started thirlwell had outlined a plan by which the holdings might be consolidated and worked together the men had approved and promised to give her what thirlwell called an option if it seemed worth while to do the work required before the patents would be granted  when the fumes had cleared they went with him to the cliff and he came back with a heavy bag it was dark but the firelight shone about him as he poured out the stones he had brought and gave her one or two  the stuff looks as good as the specimens we have he said quietly  agatha agreed as she weighed the pieces but her eyes were fixed on his face he looked stern but forced a smile  your father was not deceived and what he left unfinished you can make good i think you are going to be rich  if so i owe it all to you  he shook his head you might have found the lode without me but i expect youre tired and you ought to sleep well tonight i must begin at daybreak the sooner we start back to record the ground we claim the better  then goodnight she said quietly but when she moved away through the shadow her face was resolute     chapter xxvii  thirlwells dullness   soon after daybreak thirlwell drummond and the rockborer pushed their way through the woods behind the cliff the vein dipped and in consequence the farther one went back from the creek the greater would be the cost of reaching the ore besides it was possible that the ore pinched out and the uncovered part was an unusually rich pocket his companions had agreed that he should have the next best location after agathas and followed his advice about staking their claims the halfbreeds had however declined to exercise their rights they were trappers and voyageurs and stated that they had no use for mines  thirlwell thought there was no more ground worth recording and doubted for that matter if his and the others claims were worth much but it was prudent to keep intruders out disputes often rose about the application of the mining laws and it might be dangerous to have a rich and unscrupulous antagonist his companions went away feeling puzzled by his coolness on the journey he had encouraged the party with humorous banter and made a joke of their difficulties now he was quiet and reserved  when they had gone thirlwell sat down and lighted his pipe for he knew he must grapple with his trouble before it mastered him looking back he saw that he had been strangely pleased by agathas letters and when he met her had at once felt her charm this however was all he frankly enjoyed her society and thought she liked his but he was not romantic and was satisfied that they should drift into a close and confidential friendship it was obvious now that he had been remarkably dull scott had seen how things were going  then he had taken it for granted that agatha would not find the vein and had helped her because he thought it better she should convince herself that strange had been the victim of his imagination he had honestly thought this when they started but now recognized that he had unconsciously had another object he wanted her society and to earn her gratitude  a light began to dawn on him when he found stranges tobaccobox but he had so to speak evaded full illumination until it became obvious that they were near the vein then the truth could no longer be denied he was in love with the girl and had unconsciously loved her from the first in a sense this looked ridiculous but there it was and he must face it if she had been poor he would have urged her to marry him although it might have exposed her to some risk of hardship but she was rich and the best he could hope for was a post at a mine like the clermont  he had no ground for imagining that agatha would be willing to marry him but if she were it would look as if he meant to share her riches when he offered his help in fact it would look as if he meant to take advantage of her ignorance about mining matters and her trust it would not disturb him if outsiders thought this but she might come to think so  besides he was not going to be supported by his wifes money in view of their characters the situation would be humiliating for both agatha might learn to despise him which would be intolerable  then he felt a touch on his shoulder and got up with a start agatha stood close by and he thought there was more color in her face than usual although her eyes were calm  brooding over our good luck she said with a smile isnt that a curious attitude  the good luck is yours  if you insist on the difference but i dont know that its kind besides i wanted to give you half my frontage on the vein  thats quite impossible said thirlwell firmly  why is it impossible  it would look as if id meant to take advantage of your generosity  does it matter how the thing would look  yes said thirlwell who hesitated i want to keep your good opinionif i have it  agatha smiled but her glance was soft i wont flatter you because i think you ought to know but why are you moody id expected you to be sympathetic to rejoice with me  for your sake i am glad  but not for yours  i havent quite got used to the situation yet thirlwell answered awkwardly you see i never expected to find the ore  that was rather obvious agatha rejoined with some dryness but if you thought we would be disappointed why did you come  thirlwell was silent he did not mean to admit that he had thought a sharp disappointment would be good for her and might save her worse pain it was difficult to state this properly then if he owned that he had come for the pleasure of her society she might misunderstand him and he might say too much agatha was half amused by his embarrassment but was moved all the same for she understood more than he knew  well let it go she resumed still i dont see why you should be disturbed by my success  one often feels sorry when one finishes a big job it means one has come to the end of things one has got used to and likes  but this is rather the beginning than the end  no he said moodily we have had a glorious trip but its done with you will go back to the cities there are only two or three months when a civilized girl can live in the woods the trail we have broken stops here  but what do you mean to do  help scott at the clermont until hes forced to give up  sit down and light your pipe said agatha we must talk about this  he obeyed and picked up his pipe although he did not light it its touch was soothing and he wanted to keep cool agatha sat down opposite on a fallen trunk and presently went on to begin with the mine must be worked not sold and i need help  you can get a good manager for the wages youll be able to pay  agathas color was higher but she gave him a steady look i want a man i know and trust there are many ways in which i shall need advice because i cannot take this fortune without its responsibility the mine must be worked to the best advantage and the people i employ treated well i mean to build good houses for them not rude shacks make it possible for them to lead happy lives and see they get the best not the worst that our cities can send them when a settlement springs up  its a fine ambition thirlwell remarked however it will cost you something and youll find some resistance from the people you want to help but if the ores as good as we think youll be able to carry out your plans  do you think i could trust this work to a stranger a man hired for wages who might have no sympathy with my aims agatha asked then if when ive done all i mean im rich somebody must help me to use the money well she turned her head for a moment and then resumed cant you see that its daunting to feel i may have to struggle alone with a task im hardly fit forto know ill make mistakes  there is your brother  agatha smiled  george would see i made prudent investments and think i ought to be satisfied with getting ten per cent she gave thirlwell a look that made his heart beat i need help george cannot give and know nobody but you  she stopped for she could go no farther it was for him to meet her now if he wanted but for a moment or two he was silent and knitted his brows his brown face was resolute but something in his eyes indicated that resolution cost him much then he said you offer me the post of manager  she turned her head for it was difficult to preserve her calm he was dull in some respects but it was scarcely possible that he was as dull as he now pretended looking up with a forced smile she said yes of course i want a manager and if you would sooner be businesslike  im afraid im very unbusinesslike he replied with some grimness however if scott is willing ill help you to develop the mine and get your patent but i think it would be prudent to let him join us you may have some trouble to get the money we will need then hes straight and a very good sort  but what will you do when the patents granted  we can talk about that later it will be some time before the mine is yours and im not certain that we have heard the last of stormont  very well said agatha i like mr scott and feel i can trust him because he is your friend do what you think best i leave it all to you  she went away with very mixed feelings and was glad to reach the shelter of the woods her face was hot and her nerves were jarred but when she got calmer she laugheda rather strained laugh it was a lover she wanted not a manager and unless thirlwell was strangely dull she had been firmly repulsed she hoped he was dull but it seemed impossible that he had not understood then it was significant that he had shown some strain and she found comfort in this after all the line he took had cost him much and his obstinacy might break down  besides when one looked at it dispassionately the situation was humorous she had engaged thirlwell for her manager but nothing had been said about his wages which she could not pay for that matter she was in his debt although she was the prospective owner of a valuable mine she had only a few dollars left of the money george had given her hardly enough in fact to pay for a weeks board when she reached toronto her post there had no doubt been filled  the ore was rich but might get poor and she knew enough about mining to realize the difficulties that must yet be overcome getting the money she would need for the preliminary work was perhaps the worst and if the money could be raised it would be a long time before she could look for much return still she was not alone thirlwell had promised to help and she knew he would not fail her she meant to let him help not because she wanted to get rich but because she really knew what had influenced him and suspected that he was not as strong as he thought  for all that she kept out of his way as much as possible while they camped by the creek although she was careful to talk with easy friendliness when they met at meals thirlwell however was generally occupied and when he had made a rough survey of the claims they started south the loads were light now and he forced the pace because he was anxious and felt responsible there was another prospecting party with an unscrupulous leader not far off and ones title to a mineral claim is open to dispute until the record is filed although agathas prosperity would be his loss he meant to run no risk he was her manager and must justify her trust  when they reached the lake he found there would be some delay they had covered the canoes with branches but the pineneedles had withered off and the hot sun had opened the seams some of the thin planks were badly split one had sprung away from its fastenings and it would take a few days to repair the damage without proper tools the caulking composition he had brought would not go round and he had to send the metis into the bush to look for gum to make the indian pitch then it cost him a days hard labor to rough out new plans with an ax and saw and he afterwards found he must make a steamingbox to soften the wood so that it would bend into place  on the second night he was tired and disturbed but his sleep was light and he wakened shortly before daybreak it was not dark he could see the trunks behind the camp and agathas white tent the ripples broke upon the beach with a gentle splash and there was a faint sighing in the pinetops except for all this all was very quiet and he wondered whether he had heard a canoe paddle in his dreams then not far off a stone rattled as if it had been trodden on  thirlwell got up quietly and glanced about the camp the men were asleep he counted their indistinct figures wrapped in blankets nobody was missing still somebody had disturbed a loose stone and he moved cautiously into the gloom one could not creep up to an indian but thirlwell imagined there were none about and if an indian had meant to steal something he would not have crossed the slanting bank strewn with large gravel from which the noise had come thirlwell himself would not have done so for he had learned to be silent when hunting in the bush he suspected a clumsy white man from the cities when he got near the bank he stopped behind a tree there was a narrow opening but he saw nobody and heard nothing except the wind in the pinetops  he tried to creep round the opening but fell among a clump of wildberry canes they were green and did not rustle much but he knew that after this it would be useless to go on with the search besides he was not certain that a man had disturbed the stone the campfire had gone out and an animal might have come down to drink he grumbled at his awkwardness and going back to camp went to sleep again  in the morning he returned to the bank but found no tracks he could account for the stone falling in two or three natural ways but the splash of the paddle was a different thing still he had not actually heard the noise but so to speak wakened with its echo in his ears and sitting down he pondered the matter supposing that somebody from stormonts gang had prowled about the camp it was difficult to see the fellows object thirlwell did not doubt that stormont knew he was the leader of agathas party and she could do nothing without his help if driscoll had been with his former confederate one could have understood the thing black steve had an indians cunning and the instincts of a savage animal but he was dead and stormont was a rascal of another kind steves primitive methods would not appeal to him thirlwell gave up the puzzle and got about his work     chapter xxviii  stormont tries a bribe   when the light began to fade thirlwell put w down his tools and went off to try to catch a trout he had noted that drummond was not about the camp and when he got near the mouth of a creek where he meant to fish thought he saw an indistinct figure some distance in front it vanished but he felt he had not been deceived and stopped for a minute or two  although he had no grounds for distrusting drummond he had marked certain weaknesses in his character the lad might have gone to fish but thirlwell had not seen him make a rod and remembering the falling stone resolved to find out the wood was thin but the light was dim and the turmoil of the creek would drown any noise he made after walking obliquely inland for some distance he stopped to listen he heard nothing but drummond was now between him and the lake and thirlwell thought he could not get across the creek he came down to the mouth of the latter cautiously and when he was close to the lake stopped behind a trunk the water glimmered between the trees and he saw two dark figures outlined against the pale reflection  there was some risk of his being seen but he thought if drummond was afraid he might be followed he would watch the bush along the edge of the lake and he advanced cautiously moving from trunk to trunk a thicket of wildberries grew near the water and stealing up behind it he stopped and crouched down drummond was perhaps a dozen yards off and stood holding a fishingrod while stormont sat on a fallen log opposite thirlwell clenched his fist and listened he could hear them talk  howd you know youd find me here drummond asked  i didnt know said stormont it was good luck i wanted to find out if thirlwell had finished the canoes one can see into your camp from the top of the high ground and ive brought good glasses  it was plain that drummond had not gone to meet the fellow and thirlwell saw that he had to some extent misjudged the lad for all that drummond had reached the spot a few minutes before he did and something had obviously been said in the meantime if possible he must find out what they had talked about  take a smoke this is a pretty good cigar stormont resumed youll let a soft snap go if you dont do what i want  you put me on to a soft snap before drummond remarked with a touch of scorn  i think you got fifty dollarsfor nothing anyhow i want you and im willing to pay in advance  with a cheque that can be stopped  stormont laughed no i dont pay for this kind of job by cheque you can have it in bills ive got a wad in my pocket better take your money now than trust thirlwell to let you in when he makes good his claim but if you like ill give you some stock when we float our company  ill take the bills said drummond in a meaning tone but you want to put it high  thirlwell found it hard to control his anger drummond had professed some liking for him and had made no secret of his devotion to agatha but now he was coolly bargaining with her antagonist it looked as if he was willing to betray her if he could get a good price for all that thirlwell saw that he must find out the plot and lay still behind the thicket watching the lad drummonds pose was easy and his voice was calm he had not lighted the cigar stormont gave him and now and then twisted it round carelessly  very well stormont resumed as ive got to bid against thirlwell ill risk five hundred dollars two hundred and fifty now then as soon as we make a good start you can have a job in the companys office  oh shucks said drummond five hundred dollars for a silver mine you cant find the lode unless i put you wise  thats not going to bother us thirlwell has left a trail we can follow without your help well youve heard my offer what do you say  im thinking some i get two hundred and fifty dollars now but what about the rest suppose i have to wait until you put the job over how are you going to put it over when thirlwell holds the claims  they wont be worth much after i get to work going to laws expensive and thirlwell cant stand up to the men who are backing me hell be glad to sell out at our price when we put the screw to him  this was illuminating to thirlwell since it justified his fears the mining regulations were complicated and it was not unusual for unscrupulous speculators to dispute a poor mans claim he knew of instances where grave injustice had been done moreover he noted that stormont said nothing about agatha but thought him the prospective owner of the minerals people obviously took it for granted that he meant to marry the girl  your job is to stop thirlwell stormont went on the thing must be done cleverly and look like an accident the best plan would be to get at the canoes theyre hauled up side by side and you might perhaps set them on fire when he makes his caulking gum or you might knock loose a plank or two in the bottom anyhow youll have to hold him up long enough for me to pull out his stakes  thirlwell burning with indignation found it hard to keep still it was a cunning plot because a few days delay might enable stormont to restake the ground and file his record first if this were done agatha would have to bear the disadvantage of challenging his claim and if the law expenses were heavy might be forced to compromise still he controlled his rage  the things not as easy as it looks drummond replied thirlwells not a fool if you want me to put it over youll have to come up  a good job in our office and six hundred dollars three hundred now if thirlwell finds out and gets after you come along to my camp  where is your camp  behind some rocks about two miles up the lake follow the creek and youll come to a log that has fallen across  very well ill take the money  stormont pulled out his wallet and then thirlwell came near to betraying himself because the dramatic surprise was almost too much for his selfcontrol drummond snatched the bills from the others hand and laughed a savage scornful laugh  you thieving hog you blasted fool he cried  what dyou mean stormont shouted springing to his feet  did you think you could play me for a sucker twice drummond rejoined three hundred dollars for my claim on the lode thats what it comes to and i reckon thats all id get he flung out his hand scattering the crumpled bills theres your dirty money ive got you corralled  stormont was quiet dangerously quiet thirlwell thought because it was obvious that drummond had led him on until he learned his plans he stooped and began to pick up the bills moving about for the bits of paper were scattered and indistinct one had fallen by a heavy stone and thirlwell felt his nerves tingle as stormont got nearer drummond did not seem to be suspicious his pose was careless and thirlwell imagined the lad was enjoying his triumph both thought they were alone and they stood on a ledge that ran out into deep water  then stormont clutched the stone and thirlwell sprang to his feet the fellows caution had given way mocked and cheated by the lad he meant to use he had suddenly become primitive in his disappointed greed and rage it looked as if drummond did not know his danger but as thirlwell ran forward stormont lifted the stone and the lad leaped upon him like a wild cat  thirlwell stopped for the moment he did not see how he could interfere without doing harm and thought drummond did not need his help the men were locked in a savage grapple at the edge of the ledge and the ripples splashed upon the rocks four or five feet below stormont had been deceived to the end it is hard for a white man to match the instinctive cunning that goes with a strain of indian blood and drummond had suspected that the other meant to pick up the stone  neither saw thirlwell they swayed and panted striking when they got an arm loose and then pressing body against body while each strained for a grip to lift his antagonist from his feet stormont indeed made a better fight than thirlwell had expected but after a time his knees bent his head went back and drummond threw him heavily when he struck the ground he felt for his pocket but drummond fell upon him with a cry that was like a wild beasts howl  thirlwell saw it was time to interfere an indian never forgets an injury and drummond had inherited his fathers grim scottish stubbornness he rolled over with stormont and then getting uppermost savagely bumped his head against the rock this gave thirlwell his opportunity and seizing the lads shoulders he pressed his knee against the small of his back  stop he shouted do you mean to kill the man  sure gasped drummond lemme go  youd better quit ive got you tight  drummond struggled furiously but since he could not turn round found it impossible to break loose his hands however were free and he gave stormonts head another violent bump then thirlwell using his knee as a fulcrum pulled the lads shoulders back until he cried out with pain and let go thirlwell threw him off and stepped between the two before they could get up  this has got to stop and im fresh and able to see it does stop if you try to start again drummond ill throw you into the lake he said and turned to stormont who did not move get up  stormont did so shakily i suppose you had this thing fixed with him  i had not i came along by accident and it might have been better if id left you to drummond and gone off again it was rather for his sake than yours i butted in can you walk  stormont said he thought he could and thirlwell indicated the bush then get off and take the hint that its prudent to leave the agatha mine alone  when stormont had gone thirlwell turned to drummond who was now standing up are you hurt  not much i dont mind if i am hurt so long as stormont is but why in thunder did you come just then  its lucky i did said thirlwell dryly i think you saw he wanted to get that stone  sure i meant to let him wanted him to fire the rock and begin the circus then when hed made me mad enough id have finished it  it would have been awkward if hed brought a pistol  drummond smiled he thought he had but hed forgot the thing id been studying his clothes blue shirt and thin overalls there wasnt a bulge then he stooped and picked up a crumpled bill five dollars dont see much use in leaving money lying round  he hesitated and then putting the bill in his pocket remarked anyhow he gave me the wad lets see if i can find another  thirlwell laughed and told him to rest for a few minutes because he wanted to think stormont had obviously returned to what he imagined was a good center to work from in his search for the vein and had seen the smoke of thirlwells fire he could now follow back the latters trail and then make for the record office after altering the stakes if he did so the probability was that he would arrive too late but accidents often happen in the bush and thirlwell meant to leave nothing to luck moreover stormont had given him a hint when he tried to bribe drummond to damage the canoes in the wilds travel depends upon the means of transport since one cannot go far without food and thirlwell did not see why he should not carry on the game stormont had meant to play he told drummond his plan  well said the latter thoughtfully i guess his packers will be asleep in camp but we want to get there before he does and hes gone off first  hell go round by the log he talked about and i dont think hes able to walk very fast then well save some time by going through the creek  thats so drummond agreed wed better hustle  they crossed the mouth of the creek wading among the boulders and swimming a few yards and then followed the edge of the lake they could see for some distance across the water but the woods were dark and stormont would have some trouble in making his way through the brush he would be behind them if he came down to the lake but it was obvious that they must carry out their plans before he arrived  when thirlwell thought they were near the camp they left the beach and crept cautiously into the darkness among the trees that grew upon a rocky point now and then the underbrush rustled and a low branch cracked but they heard nothing when they stopped and listened after a few minutes they reached the other side of the point and lay down among the stones in front a narrow bay opened with the shadowy bush running round two canoes lay on the beach and although they were black and indistinct thirlwell imagined they had only been pulled up a few feet  farther back the glow of a fire flickered among the trunks but it was a small fire and burned low and red stormont had no doubt given orders that no smoke must be made a tent half seen in the gloom stood at the edge of the bush but thirlwell could not see the packers it looked as if they were asleep because all was quiet except for the wind in the trees and the distant splash of the creek the breeze was light but blew off the shore this would suit thirlwells plan but it would be difficult not to make some noise and he must not be caught the packers were rough men and he rather thought he had taken a risk he ought not to have run  touching drummonds arm he slid down a slab of rock and crouched in the gloom on the ledge below his boots had scratched the stone and he listened when drummond came down but there was no movement in the camp dropping from the ledge he reached the shingle which rattled sharply and for a moment or two he stopped and held his breath he heard nothing and making drummond a sign to be cautious went on again they were now confronted by perhaps the most dangerous part of their task for one cannot cross a stony beach in silence and men used to the wilds are easily wakened by a suspicious noise besides the water glimmered and thirlwell would have liked a darker background  still he meant to reach the canoes and moved on leaning forward to shorten his height and stepping as gently as he could when the stones rattled he and drummond sank down and waited but heard nothing to alarm them and at length stopped and lay down beside the canoes they could not be seen now but what they must do next was risky and thirlwell wanted to get his breath although he had not used much muscular exertion his nerves tingled and his face was wet with sweat  after a few moments he got on his knees and felt inside the canoe it had not been unloaded and this was the craft to launch although the weight would make a difference lying down again he felt along the keel and found that the gravel was small and mixed with sand then he touched something round and knew that a roller had been put under the canoe in order that she might be pulled up without disturbing the cargo this was a stroke of luck because it would help him to run her down  he touched drummond and getting up seized the gunwale they strained their muscles but for a moment or two could not move the craft then the roller jarred across a stone there was a crunch of gravel and she stopped a foot lower down thirlwell gasped and moved his hands to get another grip he thought they had made an alarming noise but it was too late to be cautious they must finish the job  lift her as you shove he said  she went a yard with the roller jolting in the sand and there was a splash as her afterend took the water he could not understand why the packers had not wakened but there was no movement in the camp and the next effort would be easier since the stern was nearly afloat  again he gasped quietly but with all your strength  the roller ran smoothly and they followed the canoe down when their feet were in the water they gave her a last push and small ripples splashed about them as she slid out on the lake the impetus would carry her some distance and the offshore breeze would do the rest  i guess well light out now drummond remarked  they regained the point and the camp was quiet the canoe was distinguishable but thirlwell thought he would not have seen her had he not known where to look it was plain that she was drifting across the lake five minutes later they heard somebody coming through the bush and dropped behind a boulder they could not see the man but heard him push through a thicket and then stumble among some stones he passed and when they went on again drummond laughed  looks as if he was pretty savage but hes hitting up a smarter clip than i thought he could make guess hell feel worse in the morning  thirlwell agreed the canoe would be out of sight when stormont reached the camp and it was unlikely that he would miss her until next day she was no doubt loaded with food and prospecting tools and thirlwell had gained an important advantage by setting her adrift since stormont would not venture farther north without supplies he had probably some stores in camp and would find the canoe but if she stranded on a beach far up the lake the search might cost some time the delay would give thirlwell a longer start  he had fitted the new planks in his canoes and when he got back wakened the metis and melted the caulking gum by daybreak the seams were hard and after a hurried breakfast the party paddled across the lake he would sooner have waited to see if stormont would try to retaliate but this would be rash if the canoes were damaged or he were injured it might prevent him from getting back to record the claims     chapter xxix  george reproaches himself   the days were getting shorter fast but the evening was warm when george strange leaned against the rails of farnams veranda he had arrived looking anxious as supper was served but did not state why he felt disturbed and mrs farnam waited she knew he had come to consult her and thought she knew what about now he gazed moodily across the orchard where red and yellow apples gleamed on the bent branches the slanting sunbeams struck across the trees which melted farther off into the blue shadow of the bush  thats a great show of fruit he remarked  pretty good farnam agreed reports indicate that packers wont find much surplus for shipping in the united states and prices will be high in fact i rather think my speculation is justified although clearing new ground and buying young trees made a drain on my capital  dont tell him hes enterprising hes too adventurous interrupted mrs farnam who wanted to give george a lead its exciting to take chances but they dont always turn out as one hopes but hows your business i understand trade is dull  i have known it better but thats not bothering me  still as you dont look serene i imagine something is bothering you  i dont feel serene and thats why i came you know agatha better than anybody else have you heard from her recently  not since the letter she sent me when she reached the mine and you saw that im getting anxious she has stopped some time and the school has reopened  she has stopped too long said george whose face got red it looks as if you didnt know they had filled her post  i was afraid they might do so but its a shock all the same but perhaps you can do something you persuaded the principal and managers when agatha was ill  ive come from toronto and i saw the principal george replied couldnt get at anybody else and imagine they didnt want to see me  well said mrs farnam when he stopped with some embarrassment  she was very polite with the kind of politeness that freezes you didnt say muchnothing that i could get hold of and deny but she implied a lot  you can be frank i believe im agathas oldest friend and i trust my husband with all i know  very well ive got to talk miss southern began by supposing i had come to explain my sisters neglect of her duty which had made things awkward at the school i said i had not i didnt know why agatha had not come back but had no doubt it was because she found it impossible shed gone off on an excursion into the northern bush and accidents happened one lost ones canoes and provisions ran out  miss southern said it was plain that as agatha had important duties she ought not to run such a risk and asked what was the object of the excursion  i said it was a prospecting trip agatha had gone to find some silver ore and miss southern gave me a look that made me mad it hinted that she thought my statement much too thin then she remarked that the managers felt that their teachers must concentrate on their work and divided interests made for slackness in short as agatha had not come back they had got somebody else to take her post  that was a knock but i said i supposed theyd give her a firstrate testimonial if she applied for another job  she looked as if she didnt want to hurt me but admitted that they would be willing to state that agatha had ability and taught science well then she stopped and i asked if she could go no farther ability wasnt all a teacher needed  she said she must agree and hinted that she had expected much from agatha but felt badly disappointed now she remarked that managers made searching inquiries when they engaged a teacher for young girls and thought i could understand that she felt responsible  well id had enough i said my sister was fit for a better job than the best theyd got and wouldnt bother them for a recommendation then i left thought id better quit before i let myself go george paused and wiped his hot face you see how i was fixed i could have bluffed a man into making a plain statement and then have knocked him out but that cool polite lady made me hate my helplessness  you were at a disadvantage mrs farnam agreed with a smile that was half amused and half sympathetic but i wonder who told her do you think that fellow stormont  im going to find out george said grimly in the meantime its not important i reckon you understand what this thing implies if these people wont support agathas application she cant get another post shed have made her mark teaching but now all thats gone shes turned down and im responsible  you are not to blame i wonder whether she really knew the risk  she knew shed lose her job but it wouldnt stop her agathas like that anyhow i am to blame george rejoined im the head of the family and ought to have made her cut out the blamed foolish notion i knew what the lode meant to my mother and how she hated to hear the old man talk about it it took himand now its got my sister  he stopped struggling with emotion and mrs farnam said  perhaps i ought to have given agatha a plainer hint but except for school managers were not very conventional people in this country then i liked her pluck its weak to give way to the prejudices of censorious folks besides in a sense she really wasnt rash  thats not the trouble george replied with heat i know my sister so do you but shes got to start business since she cant teach school and i hate to think of her clerking in a store she has talent and ambition  talent will make its way anywhere farnam remarked consolingly  i dont know agathas proud and has no use for the cheap tricks that help you get ahead of the other man she wont advertise her smartness and shes too dignified to snatch at chances among the scrambling crowd ive pushed through but it has put some marks on me and im most afraid my sisters going to be hurt  youre taking it for granted she wont find the lode farnam resumed  shucks said george with scorn all the comfort ive got is knowing she wont have the money to waste on looking for the ore again  he stopped and listened to a rattle of wheels some of your friends coming dont mean to be rude but i hope theyre not im not in a mood to talk to strangers  we expect nobody farnam replied i ordered some goods from kingston and gordons man promised to bring them from the depot if they came  the rattle got louder but the trees hid the rig which was approaching the back of the house it stopped there were steps in the hall and mrs farnam turned with an exclamation farnam pushed his chair back and george sprang upright as agatha came out on the veranda  she was very brown and thin her clothes were new but obviously cheap and the fit was bad as she glanced at the group she smiled and there was nothing in her tranquil manner to indicate the repentant prodigal she kissed mrs farnam and gave george her hand  it really looks as if you were rather surprised than pleased she remarked  were both said mrs farnam but how did you come its some time since the toronto train got in george has been here nearly an hour  your neighbors hired man drove me from the station i came by amprior and prescott there was a washout on the sudbury track but what was george doing at toronto  looking after your business george replied im afraid youve got to brace up they told me you were fired  agatha laughed i expected something like that it really doesnt matter  it doesnt matter george exclaimed and gasped with indignation anyhow it matters to me ive been fuming and fretting since i saw your principal he turned to the others as if for support what can you do with a girl who talks in this way howm i to make her understand  i think you had better wait a little mrs farnam said and glanced at agatha but did you travel in those clothes my dear where did you buy them  at a bush store said agatha smiling they were not as cheap as they look and my others had worn to rags besides i hadnt much time and it wasnt worth while to bother about my dress  you dont seem to bother about much george remarked in fact youve come back with a lordly calm thats as exasperating as its unjustifiable  agatha gave him a thoughtful look is florence well  quite well shes disturbed about you  then its probably business i suppose trade is bad  george lost his selfcontrol he was glad to see her back but remembered what he had suffered for her sake  my business doesnt occupy all my thoughts and you have made a blamed poor joke here am i and your friends trying to grapple with an awkward situation and puzzling how were to help you out and you laugh so far as i can see theres nothing humorous  dont be cross agatha interrupted i dont need helping out if business isnt very good i can offer you a post  george made an abrupt movement and looked hard at her farnam laughed softly and his wife leaned forward  you see ive found the lode its richer than i thought agatha resumed  there was silence for a few moments and then george said i want time to get hold of this you found the ore the old man talked about its not another stupid joke  not at all father located the vein on his last journey and left a paper with directions mr thirlwell found it in his tobaccobox the directions were not complete and we had some troublebut well talk about this later the claim is recorded and mr thirlwell has gone back to begin the development mr scott his employer is coming to see you  well said george dully ill own ive got a knock i reckoned if there was a lode it would never be found looks as if i didnt know as much as i thought but thats not all since i was old enough to guess my mothers fears i did the old man wrong hes made good i doubted but you knew him best and you believed  agathas tired mrs farnam broke in she needs a rest and im going to get her some food you can ask her what you like when i bring her back  i suppose you want to satisfy your curiosity first farnam suggested  were not going to talk about mining mrs farnam rejoined however i must do you justice you took agathas side from the first after all your judgments good now and then  she took agatha away and when they had gone george remarked i cant grip the thing yet its hard to get rid of a fixed idea youve had from boyhood still i ought to have known that agatha wouldnt undertake a job she couldnt put over  it was getting dark when mrs farnam and the girl came back and george said now i want to know all about your trip begin where you left the cars and go right on  that will take some time mrs farnam interposed shall i light the lamp in the room  i think not said agatha and smiled my story goes best with the twilight in the open we had no lamps and pretty furniture in the bush  she was silent for a few moments looking across the orchard the fruit trees were blurred and dim and the pines were black but the sky shone softly red and green above their ragged tops then she began to talk disjointedly at first but the scenes she recalled got clearer as she went on and she forgot her audience it was her business to make things plain she had studied this part of her vocation and unconsciously used her power to seize and hold the others interest but she did not know that she was drawing a lifelike portrait of her guide mrs farnam knew and with a tactful question here and there led the girl forward  it was however impossible to relate her journey and leave thirlwell out he took the leading part that belonged to him and his character was firmly outlined by her memory of the things he had said and done with something besides artistic talent agatha unconsciously developed the sketch dwelling upon his cheerfulness courage and resource she told the others how he had nerved her to resolute effort when they had difficulties to overcome sympathized when she was tired and held the confidence of his men moreover she made it obvious that there had been no romantic philandering he had given her an unselfish brotherly protection  the narrative lost something of its force after she came to the finding of the broken range she saw she had been franker than she thought and the change in thirlwell could not be talked about it was dark now the red and green had faded above the trees and she was grateful for the gloom she was not afraid of george and farnam but did not want mabel to study her only the latter noted that she paused awkwardly now and then and added a rather involved explanation the men were engrossed by thirlwells efforts to find the ore when she stopped they were quiet for a few moments  then george said you would never have struck the lode without that man he turned to the others some story of a prospecting trip what do you think  i think agatha was very lucky mrs farnam said with meaning perhaps luckier than she deserved  thirlwells all right george bluntly agreed and then addressed agatha you have often got after me about being a business man and ill own i dont let many chances of making a dollar pass but this thing goes back of business thirlwells entitled to half of all you get  agatha was moved she had found out some time since that she had not always understood george  i offered him half she said and paused he wouldnt accept  mrs farnam seeing the girl was embarrassed got up im cold we had better go in  when she had lighted the lamp farnam went out and came back with a tray of bottles and glasses  its not often we celebrate an event like this he said as he opened a bottle we have no wine but this is some of our own hard cider that i meant to send to the fruitgrowers exhibition theres nothing else good enough  he filled the glasses and with a few happy words wished agatha success she thanked him and afterwards stood up very straight but silent and with her eyes shining softly lifted her glass above her head the others lifted theirs in grave quietness for they knew what she meant the pioneers touch the ridgepole of the tent or the rooftree of the shack when they drink to the memory of comrades who have gone out on the last lone trail but georges look was troubled and his hand shook  he made good he said and added when they had drunk and farnam refilled the glasses heres to the man who helped you prove it the man who did my job  mrs farnam studied agatha and noted the softness of her look then she took the girl away and some time afterwards when they were talking in her room remarked theres an obvious end to your romance my dear i suppose youre going to marry thirlwell  agatha blushed but gave her a steady glance he has not asked me  mrs farnam pondered this and then made a sign of understanding i think i see the man is white although perhaps hes foolishly proud in fact i imagine hes worth ones taking some trouble about  she stopped seeing agathas frown and then resumed with a smile no im not going to meddle its better to wait hes a man after all you really have some charm and human natures strong     chapter xxx  a change of luck   scott met george at montreal and after spending some days there left for new york when he stated the time of his return george sent for agatha and in the evening they went to meet him at the grand trunk station as they walked down the hill and by the cathedral agatha felt excited she had soon discovered that it was one thing to find a silver vein and another to raise the capital one required to open up the mine and refine the ore the cost of these operations as calculated by scott seemed enormous and people rich enough to help either wanted the largest share of the profit or were frankly skeptical george had got promises of some support but much depended on the result of scotts visit to his wealthy friends  it was dark when they walked up and down outside the platform gates the train was late and agatha tried to control her nervous impatience she could trust georges judgment about money matters and she liked scott but she had got a habit of looking to thirlwell when difficulties must be met and he could not help her now he was in the north where winter would soon begin doing her work with drill and giant powder it was good work that demanded strength and courage and knowledge of natures laws she would have liked to have been there with him instead of in the city where one must grapple with commercial subtleties  by and by a bell tolled there was a harsh rattle as the cars rolled in and a few moments later scott pushed through the crowd at the gate agatha went to meet him under a big lamp and saw by his look that he had been successful  i have fixed things and imagine youll approve he said as she gave him her hand  thats a relief george remarked well talk about it when weve got some supper  scott laughed i think well call it dinner tonight im suffering from a natural reaction after our spartan habits at the mine and believe the occasion indicates the place viger in fact i telegraphed about a table and rooms  they drove across the city and agatha looked about with some amusement and curiosity as she ate her dinner among wealthy english and american tourists in the big diningroom george had taken her to a hotel of another kind that catered for small business men but she hoped scotts fastidious choice of the wines and the late flowers he had ordered were justified as she studied some of the other womens clothes and contrasted them with hers he looked up with a twinkle  its obvious that toronto can hold its own with london paris and new york he said however if youre fond of diamonds and such ornaments theres no reason you should exercise much selfdenial  i dont know if im fond of diamonds or not i have never had any agatha replied  well theyre quite unnecessary but youll soon be able to have them if you like your brother is plainly cautious it will be your privilege to enlarge his views  george smiled rather grimly agatha and i were brought up in a shabby frame house behind a store and learned to think of cents instead of dollars our father made some sacrifice to start us well i know what it cost him now  perhaps we had better tell miss strange what we have done when they have brought us our coffee well find a quiet place where we can talk  some minutes later they sat down at a small table behind a pillar in a spacious room and scott took out a bundle of documents  this is the first meeting of the agatha mine company and its proper that miss strange should be our chairman to begin with we must appoint executive officials and the president comes first i think the place belongs to mr strange  no said george the treasurers my job you want a business man to keep a tight hand on the money  they looked at agatha who made a sign of agreement mr scott will be president  very well the next is the general manager thirlwells the best man i know  i appointed him some time since agatha replied its his post as long as he likes and he ought to be paid better than anybody else  george glanced humorously at scott agathas manner was imperious and her voice resolute it looked is if she meant to use her new authority scott nodded and gave her a document  the shareholders may have something to say about these appointments later in the meantime this is a draft of our constitution i must state that we could have kept all the profit if we had borrowed the money we need but we should have had to pay high interest on the whole it seemed better to float a small company just large enough in fact to get the protection the law allows a registered jointstock body we find we can get the money easier in this way and it divides the risk you will see that a large block of shares is reserved for yourself and your brother i take some in payment for the men and supplies i am sending thirlwell and a number will be allotted at about ninety to the people who find the cash  agatha studied the document and gave it to george what does issuing the stock at ninety mean  ninety cents for the dollars worth of stock george explained thats a ten per cent margin when it touches face value and it will soon go higher  i see said agatha but the mine is ours and by parting with these shares we lose control  not altogether scott replied every share carries a vote you and your brother hold a large block and the friends ive persuaded to join us will vote with me of course if anybody bought up the most part of the other shares he could give us trouble but thats not likely when its obvious that were making a good profit none of the holders will be willing to sell in the meantime some of the people are sending up a mining expert and if theyre satisfied with his opinion theyll give us the money  i suppose its a good arrangement said agatha but before i agree you must send the draft to thirlwell  it might mean some delay however i expect hell come down from the mine to meet the expert and if you insist  i do insist said agatha i can do nothing until i know what my manager thinks  scott promised to mail the document and agatha remarked when the people have taken up the shares there will be some left  that is so said george it may be convenient later i dare say we will want more money when we begin the smelting but well probably be able to issue the stock at a dollar then in fact i reckon well presently have to ask for power to extend our capital  you must only sell this reserve block to people you can trust said agatha who began to ask questions about the mine  scott was surprised to find how much she knew but he told her all he could and it was late in the evening when the party broke up  the engineer whom the subscribers sent north returned with a satisfactory report and thirlwell got to work he had much to do and although he was undecided about the future resolved to stay until he had opened up the vein from the beginning he had to grapple with numerous obstacles for when he drove his adit the water broke in and the rock was treacherous still he had tunneled far enough to escape the frost when winter began and the snow that stopped all surface work made transport easier one could travel straight across divides and frozen lakes and the sledges ran smoothly on the ice when the trail south was broken he built shacks at the camping places and kept a gang of halfbreeds felling trees and improving the road  after some months he found it necessary to visit the railroad settlement and reaching it one evening tired and numbed by cold followed his sledge to the hotel in a thoughtful mood for one thing he must write to strange whose last letter had hinted that he was anxious and it would be hard to send an encouraging report the ore was good but the vein was thin and expensive to work in fact the working cost was much higher than he had thought when he entered the hotel he was dazzled by the light and the sudden change of temperature made him dizzy he stopped wondering whether his eyes had deceived him as a man dressed in clothes that were obviously english came forward  hallo jim said the latter  allott exclaimed thirlwell what are you doing here  the other laughed i left helen at new york shes going to florida for the winter with her american friends and i thought id look you up before i followed ive news but it will keep until you have had some food  had thirlwell not been an important man he would probably have had to wait until next morning for a meal but the landlords wife bustled about and supper was soon on the table there were no other guests and when thirlwells appetite was satisfied he and allott pulled their chairs to the stove the floor was not covered the rough board walls were cracked and a tarry liquid dripped from the bend where the stovepipe pierced the ceiling  the hotel is not luxurious and they have very crude ideas about cookery but they tried to suit my fastidious taste when i told them i was a friend of yours allott remarked however i dont suppose you are remarkably comfortable at the mine and you can change all this when you like  thirlwell looked puzzled and allott resumed you havent opened your mail yet and i didnt suggest it because i wanted to talk to you first i wonder whether it will be a shock to hear that sir james is dead  im sorry thirlwell answered i think hed have been kinder if id let him perhaps i ought to have indulged him more than i did but i was obstinate andwell you know he was harsh to my father  allott made a sign of comprehension he died six weeks since and left helen most of his money but he didnt cut you out  thirlwell moved abruptly  i expected nothing  that was obvious allott remarked with some dryness sir james was very sore when you refused to come back but he came round after a time when he was ill he told helen it was refreshing to find a man who could not be bought and you were probably better fitted for roughing it in canada than the career he had planned for you he added that he doubted if there were many like you in that country still i think if you had married evelyn youd have got a larger share  ah said thirlwell i had forgotten evelyn is she with helen  your admissions significant evelyn married campbellyou remember him however you dont seem very curious about your legacy  i was thinking about my quarrel with sir james thirlwell replied but i am curious  allott told him about the will and thirlwell mused for some minutes his share was not very large but he had expected nothing and since he had known agatha he had felt the strain of poverty he was not rich now but his handicap was lighter and he began to see a ray of hope then he opened a letter from the english lawyers and asked allott some questions  after a time allott said helen rather felt she was robbing you when she heard the will and she was excited when you told us about the mine i hope the ore is as good as you thought  the ore is good but difficult to work then im only manager i hold no shares  if you wished you could buy enough to give you some control  yes i shall do so now im able  well said allott helen sent me to look you up and gave me a message this money was something of a surprise and after building a vinery and buying a new car she doesnt know what to do with it i pointed out that it could be invested on good security at three or four per cent but she declares this is not enough in short shes resolved that you are to use the money to develop your mine but she ordered me to mention that she expects a handsome profit  thirlwell smiled although he was moved he knew mrs allott had tried to help him before and it was plain that she had not resented his refusing her aid  i think i see he answered helens very kind we ought to make a profit but theres a risk  helen likes a risk shes something of a gambler for that matter so am i besides although you disappointed her once she has a rather remarkable confidence in you now have you so to speak a sporting chance  the situations much like this said thirlwell thoughtfully the ores rich but i expect well spend all our money before we get results that would encourage the subscribers and warrant our asking for more capital  then if you and helen invested it would enable your friends to carry on and perhaps qualify you for a directors post  yes i shall invest but dont know that id be justified in using helens money yet however suppose you come up and look at the mine the journeys not so rough now we have broken the trail and put up restshacks at the camps  thanks said allott i hoped you were going to ask me  they started in a few days and allott spent a week at the mine on the evening before he left he sat talking with thirlwell in the shack the frost was arctic outside but the night was calm and the corner they occupied by the redhot stove was comfortable  what about helens money allott asked im not a miner but the assay reports look remarkably good and i imagine youll get over your engineering troubles  the financial troubles are the worst thirlwell rejoined  then why not take the money  thirlwell pondered it was his duty to help agatha and mrs allotts offer by making this easier would enable him to earn the girls gratitude he meant to invest his share of the legacy but felt that he ought not to risk his relatives capital for his private gain  ill know better how we stand when we get the new machines to work then if i think its pretty safe ill buy some shares for helen  very well said allott ill open an account for you at the bank of montreal and helen will give you legal power to act for her this will enable you to command her proxy if you want to vote at a shareholders meeting if you dont use the money she will get better interest than in england  thirlwell thanked him and allott began to talk about something else  the latter left the mine next morning and when he had gone thirlwell occupied himself in strenuous and often dangerous work he felt he had to some extent misled agatha and strange expenses had outrun his calculations and he had encountered obstacles he had not foreseen more money would soon be needed and he must get results that would encourage its subscription and warrant his using mrs allotts capital  sometimes the adit roof came down and sometimes the sides crushed in the inclination of the vein was irregular and the dip was often awkwardly steep then the pines about the mine were small and damaged by wind and forestfires it was difficult to find timber that would bear a heavy strain and thirlwell walked long distances in the stinging frost to look for proper logs and now and then camped with his choppers behind a snowbank for all that he made progress and as he pushed on the adit his confidence in the vein grew stronger expenses were heavy but the ore would pay for all  he grew thin and rather haggard sleeping in the snow one night with halfdried moccasins he found his foot frozen when he awoke and the dead part galled he limped as he went about the mine and soon afterwards his hand was nipped by a machine and the wound would not heal he held on however meeting his troubles cheerfully and encouraging his men and the oredump began to grow  his party was not alone for soon after he got to work three men drove in their stakes behind his block of claims they went south to file their records and returning with several more began the development the law required others followed and the neighborhood was soon dotted with tents and discovery posts but for the most part the men were satisfied with blasting a few holes in the surface of their claims one or two experienced miners talked to thirlwell and agreeing that the ore could only be reached from the ground owned by agathas company abandoned their holdings and went back the others waited for a time and then returned disappointed when their food was exhausted  the first arrivals however stayed and had opened two or three rude shafts before the frost began then instead of leaving as thirlwell expected they brought up provisions and built a log shack it was plain that they meant to hold the claims and thirlwell was puzzled because he saw the men were miners and thought they knew their labor was thrown away he imagined that stormont had sent them but could not see the latters object the fellow could hardly expect to reach the inclined vein except at a depth that would make it extremely expensive to work and thirlwell had improved his own and the adjoining claims enough to protect them legally from encroachment still stormont was unscrupulous and it was possible he had some cunning plan for embarrassing the company thirlwell felt disturbed but he had no grounds for interfering with the men and although their relations were rather strained when they met he left them alone     chapter xxxi  thirlwells reward   winter was nearly over when one evening george and scott arrived at the farnam homestead where agatha was a guest the house was centrally heated and when the party gathered in mrs farnams pretty warm room agatha wondered what thirlwell was doing in the frozen north farnam had invested some money in the mine and agatha knew george had come to talk about the companys business  things are not going well with us he said presently our moneys nearly spent and thirlwell has not been able to get out much ore i think i told you he suspected stormont sent the men who staked the claims behind our block and the fellows now getting on our track hes been to see gardner leeson and one or two others  it would be awkward if they turned us down farnam remarked  agatha waited she knew gardner and leeson held a number of the shares but she did not understand the matter yet  very awkward george agreed i went to leeson and although he didnt say much i reckon stormont wants to buy his stock he allowed that he and gardner were not satisfied about our prospects and i couldnt give him much ground for holding on then i went to hill who said hed got an offer for his stock and meant to sell but wouldnt name the buyer i suspected stormont again but we wont know until we get the transfer form  one could head him off by bidding higher for the shares farnam suggested still i suppose its impossible anyhow i have no more money  that applies to all of us george said dryly  agatha smiled for the situation had a touch of ironical humor in a sense she was rich but she was forced to practise stern economy and had not the means to defend her wealth  but what is stormonts plan she asked  i dont know said george thats the worst because its a sure thing he has a plan when hes ready hell get after us  for revenge  not altogether i think scott replied he has a pick on you and thirlwell but its money he wants if he could let you down when he got the money it would no doubt add to his satisfaction  if he bought up a large number of the shares it would give him a dangerous power agatha said thoughtfully besides he might persuade some of the other people to vote with him its unlucky we issued so many shares although of course we needed the capital  scott made a sign of agreement we kept a block large enough to give us control unless nearly all the other holders voted against us which we could not expect the trouble is that our difficulties at the mine have made them anxious stormont has probably worked on this but its hard to see how he means to use the people  for some time they puzzled about stormonts object but could not find a clue and by and by agatha said you must write to mr thirlwell  thirlwells job is to get out the ore and were up against things now because he hasnt done as much as we expected george replied  agathas eyes sparkled he has done all that was possible you must write to him  very well said george and began to talk about something else                                       a week or two later stormont bought a large number of shares but this was all and the snow was beginning to melt when george got an ominous hint that the others plans had matured stormont telephoned asking if he would meet him and a few of the shareholders at montreal to talk about an important matter and george fixed a day a week ahead then he went to see agatha  its lucky mr thirlwell is coming down she said telegraph for somebody to meet him and tell him to be quick he must get to montreal for the meeting  i doubt if he can get through in time and dont see what he can do if he comes george objected  dont argue but send the telegram he has always been able to do something when there was a difficulty to be met agatha rejoined and george did as she ordered  on the day of the meeting she joined george and scott at montreal and felt a pang of disappointment when she found thirlwell had not arrived  your messenger couldnt have gone far and a number of things may have delayed thirlwell but i know hell come she said to george who smiled  hell come if its possible hes an obstinate fellow scott agreed theres a train just before the meeting will you go to the station  yes said agatha i feel he will be there  then youll hold us up that train is often late george grumbled  have you got a hint about what stormont wants agatha asked scott  not yet but well know soon i expect george told you stormont has floated a company to work the claims his men staked behind our block  they had some hours to wait because the meeting was in the afternoon and agatha found the shops strangely unattractive moreover she did not know if it would be prudent to buy the things she wanted in the afternoon she went to the canadianpacific station and being told the train had left ottawa late she sat down in the neighboring square by the cathedral she was surprised to find that she was nervous but this was not altogether because of the money at stake thirlwell had not failed her yet and it would be a painful shock if he did so now she had a halfsuperstitious feeling that it was important he should come if he arrived all would go well if notbut she refused to follow the thought and looked at her watch only a few minutes had gone since her last glance and she tried to conquer her impatience  her heart beat when she stood beside the platform gate as the long train rolled in the cars were crowded but she thrilled when thirlwell jumped down from a vestibule he looked thin and tired but smiled when she gave him her hand  im here he said a little late but the train was held up by a broken trestle  you are always where you are wanted agatha replied with a touch of color in her face one trusts people like that  thirlwell said he would get a hack in the square and agatha studied him as they drove across the city sometimes his face was stern but for the most part it wore a look of quiet satisfaction and once or twice his eyes twinkled as if he were amused by something  its too bad to hurry you off to an important meeting when youre tired she said  thirlwell laughed i expect to hold out until the business is finished in fact im looking forward to meeting mr stormont  he had made a long and risky journey over a rough trail and across rotten ice and after georges messenger found him had pushed on as fast as possible through deep melting snow but he did not mean to talk about this by and by he gave agatha a humorous account of a small accident at the mine and she followed his lead she had felt disturbed and anxious but now he had come she could smile for all that she was silent when they drove up a shabby street where the companys office was situated at the top of an old building  the office had two rooms one very small where a wheatbroker had a desk and combined the secretarys duties with his regular business the other was larger and when george and scott went in was occupied by stormont gardner and two or three other gentlemen george imagined they had come early to arrange their program  you are punctual but im sorry i must ask you to wait he said miss strange will not be long and wishes to be present when we begin she holds the largest block of shares  then i suppose miss strange must be indulged but i dont know that her holding is larger than these gentlemens and mine stormont replied with a meaning smile  george saw he had been given a hint but he and the others began to talk goodhumoredly all knew that a struggle was coming but polite amenities were dignified and marked ones confidence by and by the door opened and stormont frowned as thirlwell came in with agatha  we are glad to see miss strange but mr thirlwell owns none of the companys stock he said  thirlwell smiled in a rather curious way but said nothing and agatha replied mr thirlwell is the manager i asked him to come  then i take back my objection stormont said with a bow i asked you and mr strange to meet us so that we could talk informally about some business although we must call a shareholders meeting if my suggestions are approved we hold enough stock between us to force through any decision at which we arrive  to begin with you had better state whose votes you command said george  when stormont gave the names the secretary opened the register and then nodded if all who are present and the others mr stormont mentions agree it would give a larger majority than our constitution requires  well take it for granted that the gentlemen would vote as mr stormont directs said george who looked disturbed we wait his proposition  my friends and i are dissatisfied with the way things are going no ore has been smelted and so far as we can learn the quantity in the dump is small we are working on an unprofitable scale and need more labor and better and more expensive machines in short we need more money i have no doubt mr thirlwell will admit this  a larger capital would be an advantage thirlwell assented dryly  we cant extend our capital george objected it was hard work to get the stock we have issued taken up  i can show you how the difficulty can be got over stormont resumed you know i floated the adventurers company to work the back blocks and as the claims havent come up to our expectations we have more money than we can use while the agatha company has not enough well i propose that you combine with us on the terms ive drafted if you dont approve them all well meet you where we can  he gave george a paper but agatha interposed you can take it for granted that we will not make the combine  stormont smiled deprecatingly im afraid you cannot help yourselves miss strange  agatha looked at george whose face got red  i can understand the adventurers being anxious to take us in your property is worthless mr stormont and ours is rich  were willing to pay  george studied the paper and then threw it down youre willing to pay about a quarter of what the mine is worth after reading that document its obvious that you mean to put the screw to us but well fight  scott who glanced at the draft of agreement nodded but stormont said you might make some trouble but must be beaten  why agatha asked  i think your brother knows each share in your company carries a vote i hold a large block and the gentlemen who have promised to support me hold more if you force us to call a meeting we will count you out  there are some shares in reserve said agatha whose eyes sparkled defiantly  stormont smiled if you have some rich friends you might of course persuade them to buy the shares and vote for you but you cant sell them in the ordinary way i imagine mr strange has tried  agatha saw that george had tried when she glanced at his disturbed face then she turned to thirlwell and noted with surprise that he looked amused she could see nothing in the way matters were going that warranted his humorous twinkle it looked as if stormont would win and she felt that she was being robbed to satisfy his greed but the mine meant more to her than the money she had expected to get she had resolved to make it famous as a monument to her father its success was to prove that his life had not been wasted in empty dreams  investors are a suspicious lot stormont went on they dont like to lose their money and you must admit that theres not much to encourage buyers of your shares to run the risk the ore is rich but we are up against obstacles that your manager is obviously unable to remove in fact my scheme ought to work out for your benefit  the sneer at thirlwell roused agatha the obstacles will not vanish if you get control and you cannot find a manager who will do as well then the scheme will not benefit me it is meant to benefit nobody but you if your friends are foolish enough to support it you will find a way of overreaching them  george frowned agathas indignation was warranted but this was not the line to take at a business meeting then gardner looked up rather sharply as if the girls remarks had excited some suspicion that was already in his mind  i think you must see that any advantage mr stormont gains will be shared by the rest  if you believe this you are very dull agatha replied  anyhow youll admit that we are short of money and dont know where to get it while to combine with the adventurers would supply the needed capital  yes said agatha but mr stormont wants to take your shares for much less than they are worth you can let him have yours if you like he shall not get mine  then you must try to sell them and youll find it difficult leeson interposed if you force us to call a meeting we can carry our scheme  you are all against me agatha exclaimed looking at the others you have let mr stormont cajole you  i dont know that we have been cajoled leeson answered with a doubtful smile in a sense however we are against you we are business men and must protect our interests in the best way we can  trusting mr stormont is not the best way agatha rejoined without regarding scotts amusement and georges frown  im afraid we must call the meeting gardner broke in we hoped you would have met us miss strange because you are bound to lose when we take a formal vote  agatha felt desperate and glanced at thirlwell if he could do nothing else he could sympathize he gave her an encouraging smile as he got up for he knew his time had come and had been silent because he wanted to let stormont reveal his plans the latter however obviously meant to leave the argument to his dupes agatha noting his confidence remembered that when they reached the office he had asked her to wait a few minutes while he talked to the secretary  mr stormont made two rash statements he said he told us the reserved shares could not be sold and that he could count upon a majority  i object to mr thirlwells speaking stormont said with some alarm we allowed him to stay at miss stranges request but the manager has no vote  i imagine mr stormont doesnt know i am a shareholder perhaps the secretary will enlighten him  stormont started scott smiled and george looked surprised the others waited anxiously  mr thirlwell holds a quantity of our stock  how much stormont asked and when the secretary told him struggled to preserve his calm  the reserved block is sold thirlwell resumed i bought the shares half an hour since for myself and a friend of mine he paused and put a stamped document on the table heres my authority to use the proxy votes  he sat down and scott remarked i think mr stormont will admit that the majority has so to speak changed sides  stormont examined the register and then stood by his chair with his fist clenched he said nothing his supporters looked embarrassed and agatha saw that thirlwell had saved the situation her heart beat with confused emotion she had known he would not fail her  well said george rather dryly do you still demand a meeting  certainly not said gardner with frank relief and the others murmured agreement then he turned to agatha id like you to understand that we took the line we did because it seemed the only plan now however theres no necessity for making the combine  stormont gave him a savage look this means that you and the others turn me down  it means that we want to save our money gardner replied and stormont who said nothing walked out of the room  his friends seemed relieved when he left and began to talk to agatha and george in apologetic tones one or two however looked thoughtful and presently gardner said mr thirlwell has removed the obstacle that bothered us most and i mean to keep my stock although i expect it will be some time before i get a dividend  not as long as you think thirlwell remarked  then you have something to tell us said another  not yet ill make a full report at the shareholders meeting in the meantime do you think stormont will sell out  its possible said gardner he wanted control we knew that but backed him because it seemed the safest plan i guess he knows hes beaten  then if he offers you his stock you had better buy said thirlwell smiling  gardner looked hard at him and nodded i can take a hint what you say goes                                       after this the party broke up and scott gently pushed george out when he saw that agatha was waiting while thirlwell picked up some papers he had got from the secretary when the others had gone she gave him her hand and her face flushed  i wonder whether you know how much you have helped  thirlwell kept her hand i got some satisfaction from beating your antagonist  but you wanted to help me  i did said thirlwell with a steady look i was anxious to do something that would make you happy  agatha turned her head yet you once refused the morning after we found the lode  ah said thirlwell i fought a pretty hard battle then but you see i was a poor engineer and you  she looked up with a smile and blushed do you think i didnt know but you were foolish ridiculously stupid  thirlwell took her other hand perhaps i was but i thought i was right things however are different now  he drew her to him but she resisted wait if things had not been different would your resolution have held out  no said thirlwell im afraid not im not as strong as i imagined  oh she said perhaps thats the nicest thing i have heard you say but you really didnt often try to be very nice  i was afraid i might say too much if i began  no she protested as his grasp got firmer theres something else how long have you really  how long have i wanted you well i think i began to feel the need a day or two after i met you at the summer hotel  agatha blushed but smiled with shining eyes  then if the need hasnt gone you can take me  thirlwell said nothing but took her in his arms
