26268718	the adventure of wisteria lodge   by  sir arthur conan doyle     contents    1 the singular experience of mr john scott eccles   2 the tiger of san pedro     1  the singular experience of mr john scott eccles    i find it recorded in my notebook that it was a bleak and windy day towards the end of march in the year 1892  holmes had received a telegram while we sat at our lunch and he had scribbled a reply  he made no remark but the matter remained in his thoughts for he stood in front of the fire afterwards with a thoughtful face smoking his pipe and casting an occasional glance at the message  suddenly he turned upon me with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes  i suppose watson we must look upon you as a man of letters said he  how do you define the word grotesque  strangeremarkable i suggested  he shook his head at my definition  there is surely something more than that said he some underlying suggestion of the tragic and the terrible  if you cast your mind back to some of those narratives with which you have afflicted a longsuffering public you will recognize how often the grotesque has deepened into the criminal  think of that little affair of the redheaded men  that was grotesque enough in the outset and yet it ended in a desperate attempt at robbery  or again there was that most grotesque affair of the five orange pips which led straight to a murderous conspiracy the word puts me on the alert  have you it there i asked  he read the telegram aloud  have just had most incredible and grotesque experience  may i consult you  scott eccles   post office charing cross   man or woman i asked  oh man of course no woman would ever send a replypaid telegram she would have come  will you see him  my dear watson you know how bored i have been since we locked up colonel carruthers  my mind is like a racing engine tearing itself to pieces because it is not connected up with the work for which it was built  life is commonplace the papers are sterile audacity and romance seem to have passed forever from the criminal world  can you ask me then whether i am ready to look into any new problem however trivial it may prove  but here unless i am mistaken is our client  a measured step was heard upon the stairs and a moment later a stout tall graywhiskered and solemnly respectable person was ushered into the room  his life history was written in his heavy features and pompous manner  from his spats to his goldrimmed spectacles he was a conservative a churchman a good citizen orthodox and conventional to the last degree but some amazing experience had disturbed his native composure and left its traces in his bristling hair his flushed angry cheeks and his flurried excited manner he plunged instantly into his business  i have had a most singular and unpleasant experience mr holmes said he  never in my life have i been placed in such a situation  it is most impropermost outrageous  i must insist upon some explanation  he swelled and puffed in his anger  pray sit down mr scott eccles said holmes in a soothing voice may i ask in the first place why you came to me at all  well sir it did not appear to be a matter which concerned the police and yet when you have heard the facts you must admit that i could not leave it where it was  private detectives are a class with whom i have absolutely no sympathy but none the less having heard your name  quite so  but in the second place why did you not come at once  holmes glanced at his watch  it is a quarterpast two he said  your telegram was dispatched about one  but no one can glance at your toilet and attire without seeing that your disturbance dates from the moment of your waking  our client smoothed down his unbrushed hair and felt his unshaven chin  you are right mr holmes  i never gave a thought to my toilet i was only too glad to get out of such a house  but i have been running round making inquiries before i came to you  i went to the house agents you know and they said that mr garcias rent was paid up all right and that everything was in order at wisteria lodge  come come sir said holmes laughing  you are like my friend dr watson who has a bad habit of telling his stories wrong end foremost please arrange your thoughts and let me know in their due sequence exactly what those events are which have sent you out unbrushed and unkempt with dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry in search of advice and assistance  our client looked down with a rueful face at his own unconventional appearance  im sure it must look very bad mr holmes and i am not aware that in my whole life such a thing has ever happened before  but i will tell you the whole queer business and when i have done so you will admit i am sure that there has been enough to excuse me  but his narrative was nipped in the bud  there was a bustle outside and mrs hudson opened the door to usher in two robust and officiallooking individuals one of whom was well known to us as inspector gregson of scotland yard an energetic gallant and within his limitations a capable officer  he shook hands with holmes and introduced his comrade as inspector baynes of the surrey constabulary  we are hunting together mr holmes and our trail lay in this direction  he turned his bulldog eyes upon our visitor  are you mr john scott eccles of popham house lee  i am  we have been following you about all the morning  you traced him through the telegram no doubt said holmes  exactly mr holmes  we picked up the scent at charing cross postoffice and came on here  but why do you follow me  what do you want  we wish a statement mr scott eccles as to the events which led up to the death last night of mr aloysius garcia of wisteria lodge near esher  our client had sat up with staring eyes and every tinge of colour struck from his astonished face  dead  did you say he was dead  yes sir he is dead  but how  an accident  murder if ever there was one upon earth  good god  this is awful  you dont meanyou dont mean that i am suspected  a letter of yours was found in the dead mans pocket and we know by it that you had planned to pass last night at his house  so i did  oh you did did you  out came the official notebook  wait a bit gregson said sherlock holmes  all you desire is a plain statement is it not  and it is my duty to warn mr scott eccles that it may be used against him  mr eccles was going to tell us about it when you entered the room  i think watson a brandy and soda would do him no harm now sir i suggest that you take no notice of this addition to your audience and that you proceed with your narrative exactly as you would have done had you never been interrupted  our visitor had gulped off the brandy and the colour had returned to his face  with a dubious glance at the inspectors notebook he plunged at once into his extraordinary statement  i am a bachelor said he and being of a sociable turn i cultivate a large number of friends  among these are the family of a retired brewer called melville living at abermarle mansion kensington  it was at his table that i met some weeks ago a young fellow named garcia he was i understood of spanish descent and connected in some way with the embassy  he spoke perfect english was pleasing in his manners and as goodlooking a man as ever i saw in my life  in some way we struck up quite a friendship this young fellow and i he seemed to take a fancy to me from the first and within two days of our meeting he came to see me at lee  one thing led to another and it ended in his inviting me out to spend a few days at his house wisteria lodge between esher and oxshott  yesterday evening i went to esher to fulfil this engagement  he had described his household to me before i went there  he lived with a faithful servant a countryman of his own who looked after all his needs  this fellow could speak english and did his housekeeping for him  then there was a wonderful cook he said a halfbreed whom he had picked up in his travels who could serve an excellent dinner i remember that he remarked what a queer household it was to find in the heart of surrey and that i agreed with him though it has proved a good deal queerer than i thought  i drove to the placeabout two miles on the south side of esher  the house was a fairsized one standing back from the road with a curving drive which was banked with high evergreen shrubs  it was an old tumbledown building in a crazy state of disrepair  when the trap pulled up on the grassgrown drive in front of the blotched and weatherstained door i had doubts as to my wisdom in visiting a man whom i knew so slightly  he opened the door himself however and greeted me with a great show of cordiality  i was handed over to the manservant a melancholy swarthy individual who led the way my bag in his hand to my bedroom  the whole place was depressing  our dinner was teteatete and though my host did his best to be entertaining his thoughts seemed to continually wander and he talked so vaguely and wildly that i could hardly understand him he continually drummed his fingers on the table gnawed his nails and gave other signs of nervous impatience  the dinner itself was neither well served nor well cooked and the gloomy presence of the taciturn servant did not help to enliven us  i can assure you that many times in the course of the evening i wished that i could invent some excuse which would take me back to lee  one thing comes back to my memory which may have a bearing upon the business that you two gentlemen are investigating  i thought nothing of it at the time  near the end of dinner a note was handed in by the servant  i noticed that after my host had read it he seemed even more distrait and strange than before  he gave up all pretence at conversation and sat smoking endless cigarettes lost in his own thoughts but he made no remark as to the contents  about eleven i was glad to go to bed  some time later garcia looked in at my doorthe room was dark at the timeand asked me if i had rung  i said that i had not  he apologized for having disturbed me so late saying that it was nearly one oclock  i dropped off after this and slept soundly all night  and now i come to the amazing part of my tale  when i woke it was broad daylight  i glanced at my watch and the time was nearly nine i had particularly asked to be called at eight so i was very much astonished at this forgetfulness  i sprang up and rang for the servant  there was no response  i rang again and again with the same result  then i came to the conclusion that the bell was out of order i huddled on my clothes and hurried downstairs in an exceedingly bad temper to order some hot water  you can imagine my surprise when i found that there was no one there  i shouted in the hall  there was no answer  then i ran from room to room all were deserted  my host had shown me which was his bedroom the night before so i knocked at the door no reply  i turned the handle and walked in  the room was empty and the bed had never been slept in  he had gone with the rest the foreign host the foreign footman the foreign cook all had vanished in the night  that was the end of my visit to wisteria lodge  sherlock holmes was rubbing his hands and chuckling as he added this bizarre incident to his collection of strange episodes  your experience is so far as i know perfectly unique said he may i ask sir what you did then  i was furious  my first idea was that i had been the victim of some absurd practical joke  i packed my things banged the hall door behind me and set off for esher with my bag in my hand i called at allan brothers the chief land agents in the village and found that it was from this firm that the villa had been rented  it struck me that the whole proceeding could hardly be for the purpose of making a fool of me and that the main object must be to get out of the rent  it is late in march so quarterday is at hand  but this theory would not work  the agent was obliged to me for my warning but told me that the rent had been paid in advance  then i made my way to town and called at the spanish embassy  the man was unknown there  after this i went to see melville at whose house i had first met garcia but i found that he really knew rather less about him than i did finally when i got your reply to my wire i came out to you since i gather that you are a person who gives advice in difficult cases  but now mr inspector i understand from what you said when you entered the room that you can carry the story on and that some tragedy had occurred i can assure you that every word i have said is the truth and that outside of what i have told you i know absolutely nothing about the fate of this man  my only desire is to help the law in every possible way  i am sure of it mr scott ecclesi am sure of it said inspector gregson in a very amiable tone  i am bound to say that everything which you have said agrees very closely with the facts as they have come to our notice  for example there was that note which arrived during dinner  did you chance to observe what became of it  yes i did  garcia rolled it up and threw it into the fire  what do you say to that mr baynes  the country detective was a stout puffy red man whose face was only redeemed from grossness by two extraordinarily bright eyes almost hidden behind the heavy creases of cheek and brow  with a slow smile he drew a folded and discoloured scrap of paper from his pocket  it was a doggrate mr holmes and he overpitched it  i picked this out unburned from the back of it  holmes smiled his appreciation  you must have examined the house very carefully to find a single pellet of paper  i did mr holmes  its my way  shall i read it mr gregson  the londoner nodded  the note is written upon ordinary creamlaid paper without watermark it is a quartersheet  the paper is cut off in two snips with a shortbladed scissors  it has been folded over three times and sealed with purple wax put on hurriedly and pressed down with some flat oval object  it is addressed to mr garcia wisteria lodge it says  our own colours green and white  green open white shut  main stair first corridor seventh right green baize  godspeed  d  it is a womans writing done with a sharppointed pen but the address is either done with another pen or by someone else  it is thicker and bolder as you see  a very remarkable note said holmes glancing it over  i must compliment you mr baynes upon your attention to detail in your examination of it  a few trifling points might perhaps be added the oval seal is undoubtedly a plain sleevelinkwhat else is of such a shape  the scissors were bent nail scissors  short as the two snips are you can distinctly see the same slight curve in each  the country detective chuckled  i thought i had squeezed all the juice out of it but i see there was a little over he said  im bound to say that i make nothing of the note except that there was something on hand and that a woman as usual was at the bottom of it  mr scott eccles had fidgeted in his seat during this conversation  i am glad you found the note since it corroborates my story said he  but i beg to point out that i have not yet heard what has happened to mr garcia nor what has become of his household  as to garcia said gregson that is easily answered  he was found dead this morning upon oxshott common nearly a mile from his home his head had been smashed to pulp by heavy blows of a sandbag or some such instrument which had crushed rather than wounded  it is a lonely corner and there is no house within a quarter of a mile of the spot he had apparently been struck down first from behind but his assailant had gone on beating him long after he was dead  it was a most furious assault  there are no footsteps nor any clue to the criminals  robbed  no there was no attempt at robbery  this is very painfulvery painful and terrible said mr scott eccles in a querulous voice but it is really uncommonly hard on me i had nothing to do with my host going off upon a nocturnal excursion and meeting so sad an end  how do i come to be mixed up with the case  very simply sir inspector baynes answered  the only document found in the pocket of the deceased was a letter from you saying that you would be with him on the night of his death it was the envelope of this letter which gave us the dead mans name and address  it was after nine this morning when we reached his house and found neither you nor anyone else inside it  i wired to mr gregson to run you down in london while i examined wisteria lodge  then i came into town joined mr gregson and here we are  i think now said gregson rising we had best put this matter into an official shape  you will come round with us to the station mr scott eccles and let us have your statement in writing  certainly i will come at once  but i retain your services mr holmes  i desire you to spare no expense and no pains to get at the truth  my friend turned to the country inspector  i suppose that you have no objection to my collaborating with you mr baynes  highly honoured sir i am sure  you appear to have been very prompt and businesslike in all that you have done  was there any clue may i ask as to the exact hour that the man met his death  he had been there since one oclock  there was rain about that time and his death had certainly been before the rain  but that is perfectly impossible mr baynes cried our client his voice is unmistakable  i could swear to it that it was he who addressed me in my bedroom at that very hour  remarkable but by no means impossible said holmes smiling  you have a clue asked gregson  on the face of it the case is not a very complex one though it certainly presents some novel and interesting features  a further knowledge of facts is necessary before i would venture to give a final and definite opinion  by the way mr baynes did you find anything remarkable besides this note in your examination of the house  the detective looked at my friend in a singular way  there were said he one or two very remarkable things perhaps when i have finished at the policestation you would care to come out and give me your opinion of them  i am entirely at your service said sherlock holmes ringing the bell  you will show these gentlemen out mrs hudson and kindly send the boy with this telegram  he is to pay a fiveshilling reply  we sat for some time in silence after our visitors had left holmes smoked hard with his browns drawn down over his keen eyes and his head thrust forward in the eager way characteristic of the man  well watson he asked turning suddenly upon me what do you make of it  i can make nothing of this mystification of scott eccles  but the crime  well taken with the disappearance of the mans companions i should say that they were in some way concerned in the murder and had fled from justice  that is certainly a possible point of view  on the face of it you must admit however that it is very strange that his two servants should have been in a conspiracy against him and should have attacked him on the one night when he had a guest  they had him alone at their mercy every other night in the week  then why did they fly  quite so  why did they fly  there is a big fact  another big fact is the remarkable experience of our client scott eccles now my dear watson is it beyond the limits of human ingenuity to furnish an explanation which would cover both of these big facts  if it were one which would also admit of the mysterious note with its very curious phraseology why then it would be worth accepting as a temporary hypothesis  if the fresh facts which come to our knowledge all fit themselves into the scheme then our hypothesis may gradually become a solution  but what is our hypothesis  holmes leaned back in his chair with halfclosed eyes  you must admit my dear watson that the idea of a joke is impossible there were grave events afoot as the sequel showed and the coaxing of scott eccles to wisteria lodge had some connection with them  but what possible connection  let us take it link by link  there is on the face of it something unnatural about this strange and sudden friendship between the young spaniard and scott eccles  it was the former who forced the pace  he called upon eccles at the other end of london on the very day after he first met him and he kept in close touch with him until he got him down to esher  now what did he want with eccles  what could eccles supply  i see no charm in the man  he is not particularly intelligentnot a man likely to be congenial to a quickwitted latin why then was he picked out from all the other people whom garcia met as particularly suited to his purpose  has he any one outstanding quality  i say that he has  he is the very type of conventional british respectability and the very man as a witness to impress another briton  you saw yourself how neither of the inspectors dreamed of questioning his statement extraordinary as it was  but what was he to witness  nothing as things turned out but everything had they gone another way  that is how i read the matter  i see he might have proved an alibi  exactly my dear watson he might have proved an alibi  we will suppose for arguments sake that the household of wisteria lodge are confederates in some design  the attempt whatever it may be is to come off we will say before one oclock  by some juggling of the clocks it is quite possible that they may have got scott eccles to bed earlier than he thought but in any case it is likely that when garcia went out of his way to tell him that it was one it was really not more than twelve  if garcia could do whatever he had to do and be back by the hour mentioned he had evidently a powerful reply to any accusation here was this irreproachable englishman ready to swear in any court of law that the accused was in the house all the time  it was an insurance against the worst  yes yes i see that  but how about the disappearance of the others  i have not all my facts yet but i do not think there are any insuperable difficulties  still it is an error to argue in front of your data  you find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit your theories  and the message  how did it run  our own colours green and white  sounds like racing  green open white shut  that is clearly a signal  main stair first corridor seventh right green baize  this is an assignation  we may find a jealous husband at the bottom of it all it was clearly a dangerous quest  she would not have said godspeed had it not been so  dthat should be a guide  the man was a spaniard  i suggest that d stands for dolores a common female name in spain  good watson very goodbut quite inadmissable  a spaniard would write to a spaniard in spanish  the writer of this note is certainly english  well we can only possess our soul in patience until this excellent inspector come back for us meanwhile we can thank our lucky fate which has rescued us for a few short hours from the insufferable fatigues of idleness                                  an answer had arrived to holmess telegram before our surrey officer had returned  holmes read it and was about to place it in his notebook when he caught a glimpse of my expectant face he tossed it across with a laugh  we are moving in exalted circles said he  the telegram was a list of names and addresses  lord harringby the dingle sir george ffolliott oxshott towers mr hynes hynes jp purdley place mr james baker williams forton old hall mr henderson high gable rev joshua stone nether walsling  this is a very obvious way of limiting our field of operations said holmes  no doubt baynes with his methodical mind has already adopted some similar plan  i dont quite understand  well my dear fellow we have already arrived at the conclusion that the message received by garcia at dinner was an appointment or an assignation  now if the obvious reading of it is correct and in order to keep the tryst one has to ascend a main stair and seek the seventh door in a corridor it is perfectly clear that the house is a very large one  it is equally certain that this house cannot be more than a mile or two from oxshott since garcia was walking in that direction and hoped according to my reading of the facts to be back in wisteria lodge in time to avail himself of an alibi which would only be valid up to one oclock  as the number of large houses close to oxshott must be limited i adopted the obvious method of sending to the agents mentioned by scott eccles and obtaining a list of them here they are in this telegram and the other end of our tangled skein must lie among them                                  it was nearly six oclock before we found ourselves in the pretty surrey village of esher with inspector baynes as our companion  holmes and i had taken things for the night and found comfortable quarters at the bull  finally we set out in the company of the detective on our visit to wisteria lodge  it was a cold dark march evening with a sharp wind and a fine rain beating upon our faces a fit setting for the wild common over which our road passed and the tragic goal to which it led us     2  the tiger of san pedro   a cold and melancholy walk of a couple of miles brought us to a high wooden gate which opened into a gloomy avenue of chestnuts the curved and shadowed drive led us to a low dark house pitchblack against a slatecoloured sky from the front window upon the left of the door there peeped a glimmer of a feeble light  theres a constable in possession said baynes  ill knock at the window  he stepped across the grass plot and tapped with his hand on the pane  through the fogged glass i dimly saw a man spring up from a chair beside the fire and heard a sharp cry from within the room  an instant later a whitefaced hardbreathing policeman had opened the door the candle wavering in his trembling hand  whats the matter walters asked baynes sharply  the man mopped his forehead with his handkerchief and gave a long sigh of relief  i am glad you have come sir  it has been a long evening and i dont think my nerve is as good as it was  your nerve walters  i should not have thought you had a nerve in your body  well sir its this lonely silent house and the queer thing in the kitchen  then when you tapped at the window i thought it had come again  that what had come again  the devil sir for all i know  it was at the window  what was at the window and when  it was just about two hours ago  the light was just fading  i was sitting reading in the chair  i dont know what made me look up but there was a face looking in at me through the lower pane lord sir what a face it was  ill see it in my dreams  tut tut walters  this is not talk for a policeconstable  i know sir i know but it shook me sir and theres no use to deny it  it wasnt black sir nor was it white nor any colour that i know but a kind of queer shade like clay with a splash of milk in it  then there was the size of itit was twice yours sir  and the look of itthe great staring goggle eyes and the line of white teeth like a hungry beast  i tell you sir i couldnt move a finger nor get my breath till it whisked away and was gone  out i ran and through the shrubbery but thank god there was no one there  if i didnt know you were a good man walters i should put a black mark against you for this  if it were the devil himself a constable on duty should never thank god that he could not lay his hands upon him i suppose the whole thing is not a vision and a touch of nerves  that at least is very easily settled said holmes lighting his little pocket lantern  yes he reported after a short examination of the grass bed a number twelve shoe i should say  if he was all on the same scale as his foot he must certainly have been a giant  what became of him  he seems to have broken through the shrubbery and made for the road  well said the inspector with a grave and thoughtful face whoever he may have been and whatever he may have wanted hes gone for the present and we have more immediate things to attend to  now mr holmes with your permission i will show you round the house  the various bedrooms and sittingrooms had yielded nothing to a careful search  apparently the tenants had brought little or nothing with them and all the furniture down to the smallest details had been taken over with the house  a good deal of clothing with the stamp of marx and co high holborn had been left behind  telegraphic inquiries had been already made which showed that marx knew nothing of his customer save that he was a good payer  odds and ends some pipes a few novels two of them in spanish an oldfashioned pinfire revolver and a guitar were among the personal property  nothing in all this said baynes stalking candle in hand from room to room  but now mr holmes i invite your attention to the kitchen  it was a gloomy highceilinged room at the back of the house with a straw litter in one corner which served apparently as a bed for the cook  the table was piled with halfeaten dishes and dirty plates the debris of last nights dinner  look at this said baynes  what do you make of it  he held up his candle before an extraordinary object which stood at the back of the dresser  it was so wrinkled and shrunken and withered that it was difficult to say what it might have been one could but say that it was black and leathery and that it bore some resemblance to a dwarfish human figure  at first as i examined it i thought that it was a mummified negro baby and then it seemed a very twisted and ancient monkey  finally i was left in doubt as to whether it was animal or human  a double band of white shells were strung round the centre of it  very interestingvery interesting indeed said holmes peering at this sinister relic  anything more  in silence baynes led the way to the sink and held forward his candle the limbs and body of some large white bird torn savagely to pieces with the feathers still on were littered all over it  holmes pointed to the wattles on the severed head  a white cock said he  most interesting  it is really a very curious case  but mr baynes had kept his most sinister exhibit to the last from under the sink he drew a zinc pail which contained a quantity of blood then from the table he took a platter heaped with small pieces of charred bone  something has been killed and something has been burned  we raked all these out of the fire  we had a doctor in this morning  he says that they are not human  holmes smiled and rubbed his hands  i must congratulate you inspector on handling so distinctive and instructive a case  your powers if i may say so without offence seem superior to your opportunities  inspector bayness small eyes twinkled with pleasure  youre right mr holmes  we stagnate in the provinces  a case of this sort gives a man a chance and i hope that i shall take it  what do you make of these bones  a lamb i should say or a kid  and the white cock  curious mr baynes very curious  i should say almost unique  yes sir there must have been some very strange people with some very strange ways in this house  one of them is dead  did his companions follow him and kill him  if they did we should have them for every port is watched  but my own views are different  yes sir my own views are very different  you have a theory then  and ill work it myself mr holmes  its only due to my own credit to do so  your name is made but i have still to make mine  i should be glad to be able to say afterwards that i had solved it without your help  holmes laughed goodhumoredly  well well inspector said he do you follow your path and i will follow mine  my results are always very much at your service if you care to apply to me for them  i think that i have seen all that i wish in this house and that my time may be more profitably employed elsewhere  au revoir and good luck  i could tell by numerous subtle signs which might have been lost upon anyone but myself that holmes was on a hot scent  as impassive as ever to the casual observer there were none the less a subdued eagerness and suggestion of tension in his brightened eyes and brisker manner which assured me that the game was afoot  after his habit he said nothing and after mine i asked no questions  sufficient for me to share the sport and lend my humble help to the capture without distracting that intent brain with needless interruption  all would come round to me in due time  i waited thereforebut to my everdeepening disappointment i waited in vain  day succeeded day and my friend took no step forward  one morning he spent in town and i learned from a casual reference that he had visited the british museum  save for this one excursion he spent his days in long and often solitary walks or in chatting with a number of village gossips whose acquaintance he had cultivated  im sure watson a week in the country will be invaluable to you he remarked  it is very pleasant to see the first green shoots upon the hedges and the catkins on the hazels once again with a spud a tin box and an elementary book on botany there are instructive days to be spent  he prowled about with this equipment himself but it was a poor show of plants which he would bring back of an evening  occasionally in our rambles we came across inspector baynes  his fat red face wreathed itself in smiles and his small eyes glittered as he greeted my companion  he said little about the case but from that little we gathered that he also was not dissatisfied at the course of events  i must admit however that i was somewhat surprised when some five days after the crime i opened my morning paper to find in large letters      the oxshott mystery     a solution     arrest of supposed assassin  holmes sprang in his chair as if he had been stung when i read the headlines  by jove he cried  you dont mean that baynes has got him  apparently said i as i read the following report  great excitement was caused in esher and the neighbouring district when it was learned late last night that an arrest had been effected in connection with the oxshott murder  it will be remembered that mr garcia of wisteria lodge was found dead on oxshott common his body showing signs of extreme violence and that on the same night his servant and his cook fled which appeared to show their participation in the crime  it was suggested but never proved that the deceased gentleman may have had valuables in the house and that their abstraction was the motive of the crime  every effort was made by inspector baynes who has the case in hand to ascertain the hiding place of the fugitives and he had good reason to believe that they had not gone far but were lurking in some retreat which had been already prepared  it was certain from the first however that they would eventually be detected as the cook from the evidence of one or two tradespeople who have caught a glimpse of him through the window was a man of most remarkable appearancebeing a huge and hideous mulatto with yellowish features of a pronounced negroid type  this man has been seen since the crime for he was detected and pursued by constable walters on the same evening when he had the audacity to revisit wisteria lodge  inspector baynes considering that such a visit must have some purpose in view and was likely therefore to be repeated abandoned the house but left an ambuscade in the shrubbery  the man walked into the trap and was captured last night after a struggle in which constable downing was badly bitten by the savage  we understand that when the prisoner is brought before the magistrates a remand will be applied for by the police and that great developments are hoped from his capture  really we must see baynes at once cried holmes picking up his hat we will just catch him before he starts  we hurried down the village street and found as we had expected that the inspector was just leaving his lodgings  youve seen the paper mr holmes he asked holding one out to us  yes baynes ive seen it  pray dont think it a liberty if i give you a word of friendly warning  of warning mr holmes  i have looked into this case with some care and i am not convinced that you are on the right lines  i dont want you to commit yourself too far unless you are sure  youre very kind mr holmes  i assure you i speak for your good  it seemed to me that something like a wink quivered for an instant over one of mr bayness tiny eyes  we agreed to work on our own lines mr holmes  thats what i am doing  oh very good said holmes  dont blame me  no sir i believe you mean well by me  but we all have our own systems mr holmes  you have yours and maybe i have mine  let us say no more about it  youre welcome always to my news  this fellow is a perfect savage as strong as a carthorse and as fierce as the devil  he chewed downings thumb nearly off before they could master him he hardly speaks a word of english and we can get nothing out of him but grunts  and you think you have evidence that he murdered his late master  i didnt say so mr holmes i didnt say so  we all have our little ways  you try yours and i will try mine  thats the agreement  holmes shrugged his shoulders as we walked away together  i cant make the man out  he seems to be riding for a fall  well as he says we must each try our own way and see what comes of it  but theres something in inspector baynes which i cant quite understand  just sit down in that chair watson said sherlock holmes when we had returned to our apartment at the bull  i want to put you in touch with the situation as i may need your help tonight let me show you the evolution of this case so far as i have been able to follow it simple as it has been in its leading features it has none the less presented surprising difficulties in the way of an arrest  there are gaps in that direction which we have still to fill  we will go back to the note which was handed in to garcia upon the evening of his death  we may put aside this idea of bayness that garcias servants were concerned in the matter  the proof of this lies in the fact that it was he who had arranged for the presence of scott eccles which could only have been done for the purpose of an alibi it was garcia then who had an enterprise and apparently a criminal enterprise in hand that night in the course of which he met his death i say criminal because only a man with a criminal enterprise desires to establish an alibi who then is most likely to have taken his life  surely the person against whom the criminal enterprise was directed  so far it seems to me that we are on safe ground  we can now see a reason for the disappearance of garcias household they were all confederates in the same unknown crime if it came off when garcia returned any possible suspicion would be warded off by the englishmans evidence and all would be well  but the attempt was a dangerous one and if garcia did not return by a certain hour it was probable that his own life had been sacrificed  it had been arranged therefore that in such a case his two subordinates were to make for some prearranged spot where they could escape investigation and be in a position afterwards to renew their attempt  that would fully explain the facts would it not  the whole inexplicable tangle seemed to straighten out before me i wondered as i always did how it had not been obvious to me before  but why should one servant return  we can imagine that in the confusion of flight something precious something which he could not bear to part with had been left behind that would explain his persistence would it not  well what is the next step  the next step is the note received by garcia at the dinner  it indicates a confederate at the other end  now where was the other end  i have already shown you that it could only lie in some large house and that the number of large houses is limited my first days in this village were devoted to a series of walks in which in the intervals of my botanical researches i made a reconnaissance of all the large houses and an examination of the family history of the occupants one house and only one riveted my attention  it is the famous old jacobean grange of high gable one mile on the farther side of oxshott and less than half a mile from the scene of the tragedy  the other mansions belonged to prosaic and respectable people who live far aloof from romance  but mr henderson of high gable was by all accounts a curious man to whom curious adventures might befall i concentrated my attention therefore upon him and his household  a singular set of people watsonthe man himself the most singular of them all  i managed to see him on a plausible pretext but i seemed to read in his dark deepset brooding eyes that he was perfectly aware of my true business  he is a man of fifty strong active with irongray hair great bunched black eyebrows the step of a deer and the air of an emperora fierce masterful man with a redhot spirit behind his parchment face he is either a foreigner or has lived long in the tropics for he is yellow and sapless but tough as whipcord  his friend and secretary mr lucas is undoubtedly a foreigner chocolate brown wily suave and catlike with a poisonous gentleness of speech you see watson we have come already upon two sets of foreignersone at wisteria lodge and one at high gableso our gaps are beginning to close  these two men close and confidential friends are the centre of the household but there is one other person who for our immediate purpose may be even more important  henderson has two childrengirls of eleven and thirteen  their governess is a miss burnet an englishwoman of forty or thereabouts  there is also one confidential manservant this little group forms the real family for they travel about together and henderson is a great traveller always on the move  it is only within the last weeks that he has returned after a years absence to high gable  i may add that he is enormously rich and whatever his whims may be he can very easily satisfy them  for the rest his house is full of butlers footmen maidservants and the usual overfed underworked staff of a large english country house  so much i learned partly from village gossip and partly from my own observation  there are no better instruments than discharged servants with a grievance and i was lucky enough to find one  i call it luck but it would not have come my way had i not been looking out for it as baynes remarks we all have our systems it was my system which enabled me to find john warner late gardener of high gable sacked in a moment of temper by his imperious employer  he in turn had friends among the indoor servants who unite in their fear and dislike of their master  so i had my key to the secrets of the establishment  curious people watson  i dont pretend to understand it all yet but very curious people anyway  its a doublewinged house and the servants live on one side the family on the other theres no link between the two save for hendersons own servant who serves the familys meals  everything is carried to a certain door which forms the one connection  governess and children hardly go out at all except into the garden  henderson never by any chance walks alone his dark secretary is like his shadow  the gossip among the servants is that their master is terribly afraid of something  sold his soul to the devil in exchange for money says warner and expects his creditor to come up and claim his own  where they came from or who they are nobody has an idea  they are very violent  twice henderson has lashed at folk with his dogwhip and only his long purse and heavy compensation have kept him out of the courts  well now watson let us judge the situation by this new information we may take it that the letter came out of this strange household and was an invitation to garcia to carry out some attempt which had already been planned who wrote the note it was someone within the citadel and it was a woman  who then but miss burnet the governess  all our reasoning seems to point that way  at any rate we may take it as a hypothesis and see what consequences it would entail  i may add that miss burnets age and character make it certain that my first idea that there might be a love interest in our story is out of the question  if she wrote the note she was presumably the friend and confederate of garcia  what then might she be expected to do if she heard of his death  if he met it in some nefarious enterprise her lips might be sealed  still in her heart she must retain bitterness and hatred against those who had killed him and would presumably help so far as she could to have revenge upon them  could we see her then and try to use her  that was my first thought  but now we come to a sinister fact  miss burnet has not been seen by any human eye since the night of the murder  from that evening she has utterly vanished  is she alive  has she perhaps met her end on the same night as the friend whom she had summoned  or is she merely a prisoner there is the point which we still have to decide  you will appreciate the difficulty of the situation watson there is nothing upon which we can apply for a warrant  our whole scheme might seem fantastic if laid before a magistrate the womans disappearance counts for nothing since in that extraordinary household any member of it might be invisible for a week  and yet she may at the present moment be in danger of her life  all i can do is to watch the house and leave my agent warner on guard at the gates  we cant let such a situation continue  if the law can do nothing we must take the risk ourselves  what do you suggest  i know which is her room  it is accessible from the top of an outhouse  my suggestion is that you and i go tonight and see if we can strike at the very heart of the mystery  it was not i must confess a very alluring prospect  the old house with its atmosphere of murder the singular and formidable inhabitants the unknown dangers of the approach and the fact that we were putting ourselves legally in a false position all combined to damp my ardour but there was something in the icecold reasoning of holmes which made it impossible to shrink from any adventure which he might recommend one knew that thus and only thus could a solution be found  i clasped his hand in silence and the die was cast  but it was not destined that our investigation should have so adventurous an ending  it was about five oclock and the shadows of the march evening were beginning to fall when an excited rustic rushed into our room  theyve gone mr holmes  they went by the last train  the lady broke away and ive got her in a cab downstairs  excellent warner cried holmes springing to his feet watson the gaps are closing rapidly  in the cab was a woman halfcollapsed from nervous exhaustion she bore upon her aquiline and emaciated face the traces of some recent tragedy  her head hung listlessly upon her breast but as she raised it and turned her dull eyes upon us i saw that her pupils were dark dots in the centre of the broad gray iris  she was drugged with opium  i watched at the gate same as you advised mr holmes said our emissary the discharged gardener  when the carriage came out i followed it to the station  she was like one walking in her sleep but when they tried to get her into the train she came to life and struggled  they pushed her into the carriage  she fought her way out again  i took her part got her into a cab and here we are  i shant forget the face at the carriage window as i led her away id have a short life if he had his waythe blackeyed scowling yellow devil  we carried her upstairs laid her on the sofa and a couple of cups of the strongest coffee soon cleared her brain from the mists of the drug baynes had been summoned by holmes and the situation rapidly explained to him  why sir youve got me the very evidence i want said the inspector warmly shaking my friend by the hand  i was on the same scent as you from the first  what  you were after henderson  why mr holmes when you were crawling in the shrubbery at high gable i was up one of the trees in the plantation and saw you down below  it was just who would get his evidence first  then why did you arrest the mulatto  baynes chuckled  i was sure henderson as he calls himself felt that he was suspected and that he would lie low and make no move so long as he thought he was in any danger  i arrested the wrong man to make him believe that our eyes were off him  i knew he would be likely to clear off then and give us a chance of getting at miss burnet  holmes laid his hand upon the inspectors shoulder  you will rise high in your profession  you have instinct and intuition said he  baynes flushed with pleasure  ive had a plainclothes man waiting at the station all the week wherever the high gable folk go he will keep them in sight  but he must have been hard put to it when miss burnet broke away  however your man picked her up and it all ends well  we cant arrest without her evidence that is clear so the sooner we get a statement the better  every minute she gets stronger said holmes glancing at the governess  but tell me baynes who is this man henderson  henderson the inspector answered is don murillo once called the tiger of san pedro  the tiger of san pedro  the whole history of the man came back to me in a flash  he had made his name as the most lewd and bloodthirsty tyrant that had ever governed any country with a pretence to civilization  strong fearless and energetic he had sufficient virtue to enable him to impose his odious vices upon a cowering people for ten or twelve years  his name was a terror through all central america  at the end of that time there was a universal rising against him  but he was as cunning as he was cruel and at the first whisper of coming trouble he had secretly conveyed his treasures aboard a ship which was manned by devoted adherents  it was an empty palace which was stormed by the insurgents next day  the dictator his two children his secretary and his wealth had all escaped them from that moment he had vanished from the world and his identity had been a frequent subject for comment in the european press  yes sir don murillo the tiger of san pedro said baynes if you look it up you will find that the san pedro colours are green and white same as in the note mr holmes  henderson he called himself but i traced him back paris and rome and madrid to barcelona where his ship came in in 86  theyve been looking for him all the time for their revenge but it is only now that they have begun to find him out  they discovered him a year ago said miss burnet who had sat up and was now intently following the conversation  once already his life has been attempted but some evil spirit shielded him  now again it is the noble chivalrous garcia who has fallen while the monster goes safe  but another will come and yet another until some day justice will be done that is as certain as the rise of tomorrows sun  her thin hands clenched and her worn face blanched with the passion of her hatred  but how come you into this matter miss burnet asked holmes how can an english lady join in such a murderous affair  i join in it because there is no other way in the world by which justice can be gained  what does the law of england care for the rivers of blood shed years ago in san pedro or for the shipload of treasure which this man has stolen  to you they are like crimes committed in some other planet  but we know  we have learned the truth in sorrow and in suffering  to us there is no fiend in hell like juan murillo and no peace in life while his victims still cry for vengeance  no doubt said holmes he was as you say i have heard that he was atrocious  but how are you affected  i will tell you it all this villains policy was to murder on one pretext or another every man who showed such promise that he might in time come to be a dangerous rival  my husbandyes my real name is signora victor durandowas the san pedro minister in london  he met me and married me there  a nobler man never lived upon earth unhappily murillo heard of his excellence recalled him on some pretext and had him shot  with a premonition of his fate he had refused to take me with him  his estates were confiscated and i was left with a pittance and a broken heart  then came the downfall of the tyrant  he escaped as you have just described  but the many whose lives he had ruined whose nearest and dearest had suffered torture and death at his hands would not let the matter rest  they banded themselves into a society which should never be dissolved until the work was done it was my part after we had discovered in the transformed henderson the fallen despot to attach myself to his household and keep the others in touch with his movements  this i was able to do by securing the position of governess in his family  he little knew that the woman who faced him at every meal was the woman whose husband he had hurried at an hours notice into eternity  i smiled on him did my duty to his children and bided my time  an attempt was made in paris and failed  we zigzagged swiftly here and there over europe to throw off the pursuers and finally returned to this house which he had taken upon his first arrival in england  but here also the ministers of justice were waiting  knowing that he would return there garcia who is the son of the former highest dignitary in san pedro was waiting with two trusty companions of humble station all three fired with the same reasons for revenge he could do little during the day for murillo took every precaution and never went out save with his satellite lucas or lopez as he was known in the days of his greatness  at night however he slept alone and the avenger might find him  on a certain evening which had been prearranged i sent my friend final instructions for the man was forever on the alert and continually changed his room  i was to see that the doors were open and the signal of a green or white light in a window which faced the drive was to give notice if all was safe or if the attempt had better be postponed  but everything went wrong with us  in some way i had excited the suspicion of lopez the secretary  he crept up behind me and sprang upon me just as i had finished the note  he and his master dragged me to my room and held judgment upon me as a convicted traitress  then and there they would have plunged their knives into me could they have seen how to escape the consequences of the deed  finally after much debate they concluded that my murder was too dangerous  but they determined to get rid forever of garcia  they had gagged me and murillo twisted my arm round until i gave him the address  i swear that he might have twisted it off had i understood what it would mean to garcia  lopez addressed the note which i had written sealed it with his sleevelink and sent it by the hand of the servant jose how they murdered him i do not know save that it was murillos hand who struck him down for lopez had remained to guard me  i believe he must have waited among the gorse bushes through which the path winds and struck him down as he passed at first they were of a mind to let him enter the house and to kill him as a detected burglar but they argued that if they were mixed up in an inquiry their own identity would at once be publicly disclosed and they would be open to further attacks with the death of garcia the pursuit might cease since such a death might frighten others from the task  all would now have been well for them had it not been for my knowledge of what they had done  i have no doubt that there were times when my life hung in the balance  i was confined to my room terrorized by the most horrible threats cruelly illused to break my spiritsee this stab on my shoulder and the bruises from end to end of my armsand a gag was thrust into my mouth on the one occasion when i tried to call from the window  for five days this cruel imprisonment continued with hardly enough food to hold body and soul together  this afternoon a good lunch was brought me but the moment after i took it i knew that i had been drugged  in a sort of dream i remember being halfled halfcarried to the carriage in the same state i was conveyed to the train  only then when the wheels were almost moving did i suddenly realize that my liberty lay in my own hands  i sprang out they tried to drag me back and had it not been for the help of this good man who led me to the cab i should never had broken away  now thank god i am beyond their power forever  we had all listened intently to this remarkable statement  it was holmes who broke the silence  our difficulties are not over he remarked shaking his head our police work ends but our legal work begins  exactly said i  a plausible lawyer could make it out as an act of selfdefence  there may be a hundred crimes in the background but it is only on this one that they can be tried  come come said baynes cheerily i think better of the law than that  selfdefence is one thing  to entice a man in cold blood with the object of murdering him is another whatever danger you may fear from him  no no we shall all be justified when we see the tenants of high gable at the next guildford assizes                                  it is a matter of history however that a little time was still to elapse before the tiger of san pedro should meet with his deserts wily and bold he and his companion threw their pursuer off their track by entering a lodginghouse in edmonton street and leaving by the backgate into curzon square  from that day they were seen no more in england  some six months afterwards the marquess of montalva and signor rulli his secretary were both murdered in their rooms at the hotel escurial at madrid the crime was ascribed to nihilism and the murderers were never arrested  inspector baynes visited us at baker street with a printed description of the dark face of the secretary and of the masterful features the magnetic black eyes and the tufted brows of his master  we could not doubt that justice if belated had come at last  a chaotic case my dear watson said holmes over an evening pipe it will not be possible for you to present in that compact form which is dear to your heart  it covers two continents concerns two groups of mysterious persons and is further complicated by the highly respectable presence of our friend scott eccles whose inclusion shows me that the deceased garcia had a scheming mind and a welldeveloped instinct of selfpreservation  it is remarkable only for the fact that amid a perfect jungle of possibilities we with our worthy collaborator the inspector have kept our close hold on the essentials and so been guided along the crooked and winding path  is there any point which is not quite clear to you  the object of the mulatto cooks return  i think that the strange creature in the kitchen may account for it the man was a primitive savage from the backwoods of san pedro and this was his fetish  when his companion and he had fled to some prearranged retreatalready occupied no doubt by a confederatethe companion had persuaded him to leave so compromising an article of furniture  but the mulattos heart was with it and he was driven back to it next day when on reconnoitering through the window he found policeman walters in possession  he waited three days longer and then his piety or his superstition drove him to try once more  inspector baynes who with his usual astuteness had minimized the incident before me had really recognized its importance and had left a trap into which the creature walked  any other point watson  the torn bird the pail of blood the charred bones all the mystery of that weird kitchen  holmes smiled as he turned up an entry in his notebook  i spent a morning in the british museum reading up on that and other points  here is a quotation from eckermanns voodooism and the negroid religions  the true voodooworshipper attempts nothing of importance without certain sacrifices which are intended to propitiate his unclean gods in extreme cases these rites take the form of human sacrifices followed by cannibalism  the more usual victims are a white cock which is plucked in pieces alive or a black goat whose throat is cut and body burned  so you see our savage friend was very orthodox in his ritual it is grotesque watson holmes added as he slowly fastened his notebook but as i have had occasion to remark there is but one step from the grotesque to the horrible
