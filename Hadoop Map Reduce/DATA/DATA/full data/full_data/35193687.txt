reprinted december 1907 december 1911  october 1913     love of life      this out of all will remain       they have lived and have tossed    so much of the game will be gain       though the gold of the dice has been lost  they limped painfully down the bank and once the foremost of the two men staggered among the roughstrewn rocks  they were tired and weak and their faces had the drawn expression of patience which comes of hardship long endured  they were heavily burdened with blanket packs which were strapped to their shoulders  headstraps passing across the forehead helped support these packs  each man carried a rifle  they walked in a stooped posture the shoulders well forward the head still farther forward the eyes bent upon the ground  i wish we had just about two of them cartridges thats layin in that cache of ourn said the second man  his voice was utterly and drearily expressionless  he spoke without enthusiasm and the first man limping into the milky stream that foamed over the rocks vouchsafed no reply  the other man followed at his heels  they did not remove their footgear though the water was icy coldso cold that their ankles ached and their feet went numb  in places the water dashed against their knees and both men staggered for footing  the man who followed slipped on a smooth boulder nearly fell but recovered himself with a violent effort at the same time uttering a sharp exclamation of pain  he seemed faint and dizzy and put out his free hand while he reeled as though seeking support against the air when he had steadied himself he stepped forward but reeled again and nearly fell  then he stood still and looked at the other man who had never turned his head  the man stood still for fully a minute as though debating with himself then he called out  i say bill ive sprained my ankle  bill staggered on through the milky water  he did not look around  the man watched him go and though his face was expressionless as ever his eyes were like the eyes of a wounded deer  the other man limped up the farther bank and continued straight on without looking back  the man in the stream watched him  his lips trembled a little so that the rough thatch of brown hair which covered them was visibly agitated  his tongue even strayed out to moisten them  bill he cried out  it was the pleading cry of a strong man in distress but bills head did not turn  the man watched him go limping grotesquely and lurching forward with stammering gait up the slow slope toward the soft skyline of the lowlying hill  he watched him go till he passed over the crest and disappeared  then he turned his gaze and slowly took in the circle of the world that remained to him now that bill was gone  near the horizon the sun was smouldering dimly almost obscured by formless mists and vapors which gave an impression of mass and density without outline or tangibility  the man pulled out his watch the while resting his weight on one leg  it was four oclock and as the season was near the last of july or first of augusthe did not know the precise date within a week or twohe knew that the sun roughly marked the northwest  he looked to the south and knew that somewhere beyond those bleak hills lay the great bear lake also he knew that in that direction the arctic circle cut its forbidding way across the canadian barrens  this stream in which he stood was a feeder to the coppermine river which in turn flowed north and emptied into coronation gulf and the arctic ocean  he had never been there but he had seen it once on a hudson bay company chart  again his gaze completed the circle of the world about him  it was not a heartening spectacle  everywhere was soft skyline  the hills were all lowlying  there were no trees no shrubs no grassesnaught but a tremendous and terrible desolation that sent fear swiftly dawning into his eyes  bill he whispered once and twice bill  he cowered in the midst of the milky water as though the vastness were pressing in upon him with overwhelming force brutally crushing him with its complacent awfulness  he began to shake as with an aguefit till the gun fell from his hand with a splash  this served to rouse him  he fought with his fear and pulled himself together groping in the water and recovering the weapon  he hitched his pack farther over on his left shoulder so as to take a portion of its weight from off the injured ankle  then he proceeded slowly and carefully wincing with pain to the bank  he did not stop  with a desperation that was madness unmindful of the pain he hurried up the slope to the crest of the hill over which his comrade had disappearedmore grotesque and comical by far than that limping jerking comrade  but at the crest he saw a shallow valley empty of life  he fought with his fear again overcame it hitched the pack still farther over on his left shoulder and lurched on down the slope  the bottom of the valley was soggy with water which the thick moss held spongelike close to the surface  this water squirted out from under his feet at every step and each time he lifted a foot the action culminated in a sucking sound as the wet moss reluctantly released its grip  he picked his way from muskeg to muskeg and followed the other mans footsteps along and across the rocky ledges which thrust like islets through the sea of moss  though alone he was not lost  farther on he knew he would come to where dead spruce and fir very small and weazened bordered the shore of a little lake the titchinnichilie in the tongue of the country the land of little sticks  and into that lake flowed a small stream the water of which was not milky  there was rushgrass on that streamthis he remembered wellbut no timber and he would follow it till its first trickle ceased at a divide  he would cross this divide to the first trickle of another stream flowing to the west which he would follow until it emptied into the river dease and here he would find a cache under an upturned canoe and piled over with many rocks  and in this cache would be ammunition for his empty gun fishhooks and lines a small netall the utilities for the killing and snaring of food  also he would find flournot mucha piece of bacon and some beans  bill would be waiting for him there and they would paddle away south down the dease to the great bear lake  and south across the lake they would go ever south till they gained the mackenzie  and south still south they would go while the winter raced vainly after them and the ice formed in the eddies and the days grew chill and crisp south to some warm hudson bay company post where timber grew tall and generous and there was grub without end  these were the thoughts of the man as he strove onward  but hard as he strove with his body he strove equally hard with his mind trying to think that bill had not deserted him that bill would surely wait for him at the cache  he was compelled to think this thought or else there would not be any use to strive and he would have lain down and died  and as the dim ball of the sun sank slowly into the northwest he covered every inchand many timesof his and bills flight south before the downcoming winter  and he conned the grub of the cache and the grub of the hudson bay company post over and over again  he had not eaten for two days for a far longer time he had not had all he wanted to eat often he stooped and picked pale muskeg berries put them into his mouth and chewed and swallowed them  a muskeg berry is a bit of seed enclosed in a bit of water  in the mouth the water melts away and the seed chews sharp and bitter  the man knew there was no nourishment in the berries but he chewed them patiently with a hope greater than knowledge and defying experience  at nine oclock he stubbed his toe on a rocky ledge and from sheer weariness and weakness staggered and fell  he lay for some time without movement on his side  then he slipped out of the packstraps and clumsily dragged himself into a sitting posture  it was not yet dark and in the lingering twilight he groped about among the rocks for shreds of dry moss  when he had gathered a heap he built a firea smouldering smudgy fireand put a tin pot of water on to boil  he unwrapped his pack and the first thing he did was to count his matches  there were sixtyseven  he counted them three times to make sure  he divided them into several portions wrapping them in oil paper disposing of one bunch in his empty tobacco pouch of another bunch in the inside band of his battered hat of a third bunch under his shirt on the chest  this accomplished a panic came upon him and he unwrapped them all and counted them again  there were still sixtyseven  he dried his wet footgear by the fire  the moccasins were in soggy shreds  the blanket socks were worn through in places and his feet were raw and bleeding  his ankle was throbbing and he gave it an examination  it had swollen to the size of his knee  he tore a long strip from one of his two blankets and bound the ankle tightly  he tore other strips and bound them about his feet to serve for both moccasins and socks  then he drank the pot of water steaming hot wound his watch and crawled between his blankets  he slept like a dead man  the brief darkness around midnight came and went  the sun arose in the northeastat least the day dawned in that quarter for the sun was hidden by gray clouds  at six oclock he awoke quietly lying on his back  he gazed straight up into the gray sky and knew that he was hungry  as he rolled over on his elbow he was startled by a loud snort and saw a bull caribou regarding him with alert curiosity  the animal was not mere than fifty feet away and instantly into the mans mind leaped the vision and the savor of a caribou steak sizzling and frying over a fire  mechanically he reached for the empty gun drew a bead and pulled the trigger  the bull snorted and leaped away his hoofs rattling and clattering as he fled across the ledges  the man cursed and flung the empty gun from him  he groaned aloud as he started to drag himself to his feet  it was a slow and arduous task  his joints were like rusty hinges  they worked harshly in their sockets with much friction and each bending or unbending was accomplished only through a sheer exertion of will  when he finally gained his feet another minute or so was consumed in straightening up so that he could stand erect as a man should stand  he crawled up a small knoll and surveyed the prospect  there were no trees no bushes nothing but a gray sea of moss scarcely diversified by gray rocks gray lakelets and gray streamlets  the sky was gray  there was no sun nor hint of sun  he had no idea of north and he had forgotten the way he had come to this spot the night before  but he was not lost  he knew that  soon he would come to the land of the little sticks  he felt that it lay off to the left somewhere not farpossibly just over the next low hill  he went back to put his pack into shape for travelling  he assured himself of the existence of his three separate parcels of matches though he did not stop to count them  but he did linger debating over a squat moosehide sack  it was not large  he could hide it under his two hands  he knew that it weighed fifteen poundsas much as all the rest of the packand it worried him  he finally set it to one side and proceeded to roll the pack  he paused to gaze at the squat moosehide sack  he picked it up hastily with a defiant glance about him as though the desolation were trying to rob him of it and when he rose to his feet to stagger on into the day it was included in the pack on his back  he bore away to the left stopping now and again to eat muskeg berries his ankle had stiffened his limp was more pronounced but the pain of it was as nothing compared with the pain of his stomach  the hunger pangs were sharp  they gnawed and gnawed until he could not keep his mind steady on the course he must pursue to gain the land of little sticks the muskeg berries did not allay this gnawing while they made his tongue and the roof of his mouth sore with their irritating bite  he came upon a valley where rock ptarmigan rose on whirring wings from the ledges and muskegs  kerkerker was the cry they made  he threw stones at them but could not hit them  he placed his pack on the ground and stalked them as a cat stalks a sparrow  the sharp rocks cut through his pants legs till his knees left a trail of blood but the hurt was lost in the hurt of his hunger  he squirmed over the wet moss saturating his clothes and chilling his body but he was not aware of it so great was his fever for food  and always the ptarmigan rose whirring before him till their kerkerker became a mock to him and he cursed them and cried aloud at them with their own cry  once he crawled upon one that must have been asleep  he did not see it till it shot up in his face from its rocky nook  he made a clutch as startled as was the rise of the ptarmigan and there remained in his hand three tailfeathers  as he watched its flight he hated it as though it had done him some terrible wrong  then he returned and shouldered his pack  as the day wore along he came into valleys or swales where game was more plentiful  a band of caribou passed by twenty and odd animals tantalizingly within rifle range  he felt a wild desire to run after them a certitude that he could run them down  a black fox came toward him carrying a ptarmigan in his mouth  the man shouted  it was a fearful cry but the fox leaping away in fright did not drop the ptarmigan  late in the afternoon he followed a stream milky with lime which ran through sparse patches of rushgrass  grasping these rushes firmly near the root he pulled up what resembled a young onionsprout no larger than a shinglenail  it was tender and his teeth sank into it with a crunch that promised deliciously of food  but its fibers were tough  it was composed of stringy filaments saturated with water like the berries and devoid of nourishment  he threw off his pack and went into the rushgrass on hands and knees crunching and munching like some bovine creature  he was very weary and often wished to restto lie down and sleep but he was continually driven onnot so much by his desire to gain the land of little sticks as by his hunger  he searched little ponds for frogs and dug up the earth with his nails for worms though he knew in spite that neither frogs nor worms existed so far north  he looked into every pool of water vainly until as the long twilight came on he discovered a solitary fish the size of a minnow in such a pool  he plunged his arm in up to the shoulder but it eluded him  he reached for it with both hands and stirred up the milky mud at the bottom  in his excitement he fell in wetting himself to the waist  then the water was too muddy to admit of his seeing the fish and he was compelled to wait until the sediment had settled  the pursuit was renewed till the water was again muddied  but he could not wait  he unstrapped the tin bucket and began to bale the pool  he baled wildly at first splashing himself and flinging the water so short a distance that it ran back into the pool  he worked more carefully striving to be cool though his heart was pounding against his chest and his hands were trembling  at the end of half an hour the pool was nearly dry  not a cupful of water remained  and there was no fish  he found a hidden crevice among the stones through which it had escaped to the adjoining and larger poola pool which he could not empty in a night and a day  had he known of the crevice he could have closed it with a rock at the beginning and the fish would have been his  thus he thought and crumpled up and sank down upon the wet earth  at first he cried softly to himself then he cried loudly to the pitiless desolation that ringed him around and for a long time after he was shaken by great dry sobs  he built a fire and warmed himself by drinking quarts of hot water and made camp on a rocky ledge in the same fashion he had the night before the last thing he did was to see that his matches were dry and to wind his watch  the blankets were wet and clammy  his ankle pulsed with pain  but he knew only that he was hungry and through his restless sleep he dreamed of feasts and banquets and of food served and spread in all imaginable ways  he awoke chilled and sick  there was no sun  the gray of earth and sky had become deeper more profound  a raw wind was blowing and the first flurries of snow were whitening the hilltops  the air about him thickened and grew white while he made a fire and boiled more water  it was wet snow half rain and the flakes were large and soggy  at first they melted as soon as they came in contact with the earth but ever more fell covering the ground putting out the fire spoiling his supply of mossfuel  this was a signal for him to strap on his pack and stumble onward he knew not where  he was not concerned with the land of little sticks nor with bill and the cache under the upturned canoe by the river dease  he was mastered by the verb to eat  he was hungermad  he took no heed of the course he pursued so long as that course led him through the swale bottoms  he felt his way through the wet snow to the watery muskeg berries and went by feel as he pulled up the rushgrass by the roots but it was tasteless stuff and did not satisfy  he found a weed that tasted sour and he ate all he could find of it which was not much for it was a creeping growth easily hidden under the several inches of snow  he had no fire that night nor hot water and crawled under his blanket to sleep the broken hungersleep  the snow turned into a cold rain  he awakened many times to feel it falling on his upturned face  day camea gray day and no sun  it had ceased raining  the keenness of his hunger had departed  sensibility as far as concerned the yearning for food had been exhausted  there was a dull heavy ache in his stomach but it did not bother him so much  he was more rational and once more he was chiefly interested in the land of little sticks and the cache by the river dease  he ripped the remnant of one of his blankets into strips and bound his bleeding feet  also he recinched the injured ankle and prepared himself for a day of travel  when he came to his pack he paused long over the squat moosehide sack but in the end it went with him  the snow had melted under the rain and only the hilltops showed white the sun came out and he succeeded in locating the points of the compass though he knew now that he was lost  perhaps in his previous days wanderings he had edged away too far to the left  he now bore off to the right to counteract the possible deviation from his true course  though the hunger pangs were no longer so exquisite he realized that he was weak  he was compelled to pause for frequent rests when he attacked the muskeg berries and rushgrass patches  his tongue felt dry and large as though covered with a fine hairy growth and it tasted bitter in his mouth  his heart gave him a great deal of trouble  when he had travelled a few minutes it would begin a remorseless thump thump thump and then leap up and away in a painful flutter of beats that choked him and made him go faint and dizzy  in the middle of the day he found two minnows in a large pool  it was impossible to bale it but he was calmer now and managed to catch them in his tin bucket  they were no longer than his little finger but he was not particularly hungry  the dull ache in his stomach had been growing duller and fainter  it seemed almost that his stomach was dozing  he ate the fish raw masticating with painstaking care for the eating was an act of pure reason  while he had no desire to eat he knew that he must eat to live  in the evening he caught three more minnows eating two and saving the third for breakfast  the sun had dried stray shreds of moss and he was able to warm himself with hot water  he had not covered more than ten miles that day and the next day travelling whenever his heart permitted him he covered no more than five miles  but his stomach did not give him the slightest uneasiness  it had gone to sleep  he was in a strange country too and the caribou were growing more plentiful also the wolves  often their yelps drifted across the desolation and once he saw three of them slinking away before his path  another night and in the morning being more rational he untied the leather string that fastened the squat moosehide sack  from its open mouth poured a yellow stream of coarse golddust and nuggets  he roughly divided the gold in halves caching one half on a prominent ledge wrapped in a piece of blanket and returning the other half to the sack he also began to use strips of the one remaining blanket for his feet  he still clung to his gun for there were cartridges in that cache by the river dease  this was a day of fog and this day hunger awoke in him again  he was very weak and was afflicted with a giddiness which at times blinded him it was no uncommon thing now for him to stumble and fall and stumbling once he fell squarely into a ptarmigan nest  there were four newly hatched chicks a day oldlittle specks of pulsating life no more than a mouthful and he ate them ravenously thrusting them alive into his mouth and crunching them like eggshells between his teeth  the mother ptarmigan beat about him with great outcry  he used his gun as a club with which to knock her over but she dodged out of reach  he threw stones at her and with one chance shot broke a wing  then she fluttered away running trailing the broken wing with him in pursuit  the little chicks had no more than whetted his appetite  he hopped and bobbed clumsily along on his injured ankle throwing stones and screaming hoarsely at times at other times hopping and bobbing silently along picking himself up grimly and patiently when he fell or rubbing his eyes with his hand when the giddiness threatened to overpower him  the chase led him across swampy ground in the bottom of the valley and he came upon footprints in the soggy moss  they were not his ownhe could see that  they must be bills  but he could not stop for the mother ptarmigan was running on  he would catch her first then he would return and investigate  he exhausted the mother ptarmigan but he exhausted himself  she lay panting on her side  he lay panting on his side a dozen feet away unable to crawl to her  and as he recovered she recovered fluttering out of reach as his hungry hand went out to her  the chase was resumed night settled down and she escaped  he stumbled from weakness and pitched head foremost on his face cutting his cheek his pack upon his back  he did not move for a long while then he rolled over on his side wound his watch and lay there until morning  another day of fog  half of his last blanket had gone into footwrappings  he failed to pick up bills trail  it did not matter his hunger was driving him too compellinglyonlyonly he wondered if bill too were lost  by midday the irk of his pack became too oppressive  again he divided the gold this time merely spilling half of it on the ground  in the afternoon he threw the rest of it away there remaining to him only the halfblanket the tin bucket and the rifle  an hallucination began to trouble him  he felt confident that one cartridge remained to him  it was in the chamber of the rifle and he had overlooked it  on the other hand he knew all the time that the chamber was empty  but the hallucination persisted  he fought it off for hours then threw his rifle open and was confronted with emptiness  the disappointment was as bitter as though he had really expected to find the cartridge  he plodded on for half an hour when the hallucination arose again  again he fought it and still it persisted till for very relief he opened his rifle to unconvince himself  at times his mind wandered farther afield and he plodded on a mere automaton strange conceits and whimsicalities gnawing at his brain like worms  but these excursions out of the real were of brief duration for ever the pangs of the hungerbite called him back  he was jerked back abruptly once from such an excursion by a sight that caused him nearly to faint  he reeled and swayed doddering like a drunken man to keep from falling  before him stood a horse  a horse  he could not believe his eyes  a thick mist was in them intershot with sparkling points of light  he rubbed his eyes savagely to clear his vision and beheld not a horse but a great brown bear  the animal was studying him with bellicose curiosity  the man had brought his gun halfway to his shoulder before he realized he lowered it and drew his huntingknife from its beaded sheath at his hip  before him was meat and life  he ran his thumb along the edge of his knife  it was sharp  the point was sharp  he would fling himself upon the bear and kill it  but his heart began its warning thump thump thump  then followed the wild upward leap and tattoo of flutters the pressing as of an iron band about his forehead the creeping of the dizziness into his brain  his desperate courage was evicted by a great surge of fear  in his weakness what if the animal attacked him  he drew himself up to his most imposing stature gripping the knife and staring hard at the bear the bear advanced clumsily a couple of steps reared up and gave vent to a tentative growl  if the man ran he would run after him but the man did not run  he was animated now with the courage of fear  he too growled savagely terribly voicing the fear that is to life germane and that lies twisted about lifes deepest roots  the bear edged away to one side growling menacingly himself appalled by this mysterious creature that appeared upright and unafraid  but the man did not move  he stood like a statue till the danger was past when he yielded to a fit of trembling and sank down into the wet moss  he pulled himself together and went on afraid now in a new way  it was not the fear that he should die passively from lack of food but that he should be destroyed violently before starvation had exhausted the last particle of the endeavor in him that made toward surviving  there were the wolves  back and forth across the desolation drifted their howls weaving the very air into a fabric of menace that was so tangible that he found himself arms in the air pressing it back from him as it might be the walls of a windblown tent  now and again the wolves in packs of two and three crossed his path but they sheered clear of him  they were not in sufficient numbers and besides they were hunting the caribou which did not battle while this strange creature that walked erect might scratch and bite  in the late afternoon he came upon scattered bones where the wolves had made a kill  the debris had been a caribou calf an hour before squawking and running and very much alive  he contemplated the bones cleanpicked and polished pink with the celllife in them which had not yet died  could it possibly be that he might be that ere the day was done  such was life eh  a vain and fleeting thing  it was only life that pained  there was no hurt in death  to die was to sleep  it meant cessation rest  then why was he not content to die  but he did not moralize long  he was squatting in the moss a bone in his mouth sucking at the shreds of life that still dyed it faintly pink the sweet meaty taste thin and elusive almost as a memory maddened him he closed his jaws on the bones and crunched  sometimes it was the bone that broke sometimes his teeth  then he crushed the bones between rocks pounded them to a pulp and swallowed them  he pounded his fingers too in his haste and yet found a moment in which to feel surprise at the fact that his fingers did not hurt much when caught under the descending rock  came frightful days of snow and rain  he did not know when he made camp when he broke camp  he travelled in the night as much as in the day  he rested wherever he fell crawled on whenever the dying life in him flickered up and burned less dimly  he as a man no longer strove  it was the life in him unwilling to die that drove him on  he did not suffer  his nerves had become blunted numb while his mind was filled with weird visions and delicious dreams  but ever he sucked and chewed on the crushed bones of the caribou calf the least remnants of which he had gathered up and carried with him  he crossed no more hills or divides but automatically followed a large stream which flowed through a wide and shallow valley  he did not see this stream nor this valley  he saw nothing save visions  soul and body walked or crawled side by side yet apart so slender was the thread that bound them  he awoke in his right mind lying on his back on a rocky ledge  the sun was shining bright and warm  afar off he heard the squawking of caribou calves  he was aware of vague memories of rain and wind and snow but whether he had been beaten by the storm for two days or two weeks he did not know  for some time he lay without movement the genial sunshine pouring upon him and saturating his miserable body with its warmth  a fine day he thought  perhaps he could manage to locate himself  by a painful effort he rolled over on his side  below him flowed a wide and sluggish river its unfamiliarity puzzled him  slowly he followed it with his eyes winding in wide sweeps among the bleak bare hills bleaker and barer and lowerlying than any hills he had yet encountered  slowly deliberately without excitement or more than the most casual interest he followed the course of the strange stream toward the skyline and saw it emptying into a bright and shining sea  he was still unexcited  most unusual he thought a vision or a miragemore likely a vision a trick of his disordered mind  he was confirmed in this by sight of a ship lying at anchor in the midst of the shining sea  he closed his eyes for a while then opened them  strange how the vision persisted  yet not strange  he knew there were no seas or ships in the heart of the barren lands just as he had known there was no cartridge in the empty rifle  he heard a snuffle behind hima halfchoking gasp or cough  very slowly because of his exceeding weakness and stiffness he rolled over on his other side  he could see nothing near at hand but he waited patiently  again came the snuffle and cough and outlined between two jagged rocks not a score of feet away he made out the gray head of a wolf  the sharp ears were not pricked so sharply as he had seen them on other wolves the eyes were bleared and bloodshot the head seemed to droop limply and forlornly  the animal blinked continually in the sunshine  it seemed sick  as he looked it snuffled and coughed again  this at least was real he thought and turned on the other side so that he might see the reality of the world which had been veiled from him before by the vision  but the sea still shone in the distance and the ship was plainly discernible  was it reality after all  he closed his eyes for a long while and thought and then it came to him  he had been making north by east away from the dease divide and into the coppermine valley  this wide and sluggish river was the coppermine  that shining sea was the arctic ocean  that ship was a whaler strayed east far east from the mouth of the mackenzie and it was lying at anchor in coronation gulf  he remembered the hudson bay company chart he had seen long ago and it was all clear and reasonable to him  he sat up and turned his attention to immediate affairs  he had worn through the blanketwrappings and his feet were shapeless lumps of raw meat  his last blanket was gone  rifle and knife were both missing  he had lost his hat somewhere with the bunch of matches in the band but the matches against his chest were safe and dry inside the tobacco pouch and oil paper  he looked at his watch  it marked eleven oclock and was still running  evidently he had kept it wound  he was calm and collected  though extremely weak he had no sensation of pain  he was not hungry  the thought of food was not even pleasant to him and whatever he did was done by his reason alone  he ripped off his pants legs to the knees and bound them about his feet  somehow he had succeeded in retaining the tin bucket  he would have some hot water before he began what he foresaw was to be a terrible journey to the ship  his movements were slow  he shook as with a palsy  when he started to collect dry moss he found he could not rise to his feet  he tried again and again then contented himself with crawling about on hands and knees once he crawled near to the sick wolf  the animal dragged itself reluctantly out of his way licking its chops with a tongue which seemed hardly to have the strength to curl  the man noticed that the tongue was not the customary healthy red  it was a yellowish brown and seemed coated with a rough and halfdry mucus  after he had drunk a quart of hot water the man found he was able to stand and even to walk as well as a dying man might be supposed to walk every minute or so he was compelled to rest  his steps were feeble and uncertain just as the wolfs that trailed him were feeble and uncertain and that night when the shining sea was blotted out by blackness he knew he was nearer to it by no more than four miles  throughout the night he heard the cough of the sick wolf and now and then the squawking of the caribou calves  there was life all around him but it was strong life very much alive and well and he knew the sick wolf clung to the sick mans trail in the hope that the man would die first  in the morning on opening his eyes he beheld it regarding him with a wistful and hungry stare  it stood crouched with tail between its legs like a miserable and woebegone dog  it shivered in the chill morning wind and grinned dispiritedly when the man spoke to it in a voice that achieved no more than a hoarse whisper  the sun rose brightly and all morning the man tottered and fell toward the ship on the shining sea  the weather was perfect  it was the brief indian summer of the high latitudes  it might last a week  tomorrow or next day it might he gone  in the afternoon the man came upon a trail  it was of another man who did not walk but who dragged himself on all fours  the man thought it might be bill but he thought in a dull uninterested way  he had no curiosity  in fact sensation and emotion had left him  he was no longer susceptible to pain  stomach and nerves had gone to sleep  yet the life that was in him drove him on  he was very weary but it refused to die  it was because it refused to die that he still ate muskeg berries and minnows drank his hot water and kept a wary eye on the sick wolf  he followed the trail of the other man who dragged himself along and soon came to the end of ita few freshpicked bones where the soggy moss was marked by the footpads of many wolves  he saw a squat moosehide sack mate to his own which had been torn by sharp teeth  he picked it up though its weight was almost too much for his feeble fingers  bill had carried it to the last  ha ha  he would have the laugh on bill  he would survive and carry it to the ship in the shining sea  his mirth was hoarse and ghastly like a ravens croak and the sick wolf joined him howling lugubriously  the man ceased suddenly  how could he have the laugh on bill if that were bill if those bones so pinkywhite and clean were bill  he turned away  well bill had deserted him but he would not take the gold nor would he suck bills bones  bill would have though had it been the other way around he mused as he staggered on  he came to a pool of water  stooping over in quest of minnows he jerked his head back as though he had been stung  he had caught sight of his reflected face  so horrible was it that sensibility awoke long enough to be shocked  there were three minnows in the pool which was too large to drain and after several ineffectual attempts to catch them in the tin bucket he forbore  he was afraid because of his great weakness that he might fall in and drown  it was for this reason that he did not trust himself to the river astride one of the many driftlogs which lined its sandspits  that day he decreased the distance between him and the ship by three miles the next day by twofor he was crawling now as bill had crawled and the end of the fifth day found the ship still seven miles away and him unable to make even a mile a day  still the indian summer held on and he continued to crawl and faint turn and turn about and ever the sick wolf coughed and wheezed at his heels  his knees had become raw meat like his feet and though he padded them with the shirt from his back it was a red track he left behind him on the moss and stones  once glancing back he saw the wolf licking hungrily his bleeding trail and he saw sharply what his own end might beunlessunless he could get the wolf  then began as grim a tragedy of existence as was ever playeda sick man that crawled a sick wolf that limped two creatures dragging their dying carcasses across the desolation and hunting each others lives  had it been a well wolf it would not have mattered so much to the man but the thought of going to feed the maw of that loathsome and all but dead thing was repugnant to him  he was finicky  his mind had begun to wander again and to be perplexed by hallucinations while his lucid intervals grew rarer and shorter  he was awakened once from a faint by a wheeze close in his ear  the wolf leaped lamely back losing its footing and falling in its weakness  it was ludicrous but he was not amused  nor was he even afraid  he was too far gone for that  but his mind was for the moment clear and he lay and considered  the ship was no more than four miles away  he could see it quite distinctly when he rubbed the mists out of his eyes and he could see the white sail of a small boat cutting the water of the shining sea  but he could never crawl those four miles  he knew that and was very calm in the knowledge  he knew that he could not crawl half a mile and yet he wanted to live  it was unreasonable that he should die after all he had undergone  fate asked too much of him  and dying he declined to die  it was stark madness perhaps but in the very grip of death he defied death and refused to die  he closed his eyes and composed himself with infinite precaution  he steeled himself to keep above the suffocating languor that lapped like a rising tide through all the wells of his being  it was very like a sea this deadly languor that rose and rose and drowned his consciousness bit by bit  sometimes he was all but submerged swimming through oblivion with a faltering stroke and again by some strange alchemy of soul he would find another shred of will and strike out more strongly  without movement he lay on his back and he could hear slowly drawing near and nearer the wheezing intake and output of the sick wolfs breath  it drew closer ever closer through an infinitude of time and he did not move  it was at his ear  the harsh dry tongue grated like sandpaper against his cheek  his hands shot outor at least he willed them to shoot out  the fingers were curved like talons but they closed on empty air  swiftness and certitude require strength and the man had not this strength  the patience of the wolf was terrible  the mans patience was no less terrible  for half a day he lay motionless fighting off unconsciousness and waiting for the thing that was to feed upon him and upon which he wished to feed  sometimes the languid sea rose over him and he dreamed long dreams but ever through it all waking and dreaming he waited for the wheezing breath and the harsh caress of the tongue  he did not hear the breath and he slipped slowly from some dream to the feel of the tongue along his hand  he waited  the fangs pressed softly the pressure increased the wolf was exerting its last strength in an effort to sink teeth in the food for which it had waited so long  but the man had waited long and the lacerated hand closed on the jaw slowly while the wolf struggled feebly and the hand clutched feebly the other hand crept across to a grip  five minutes later the whole weight of the mans body was on top of the wolf  the hands had not sufficient strength to choke the wolf but the face of the man was pressed close to the throat of the wolf and the mouth of the man was full of hair  at the end of half an hour the man was aware of a warm trickle in his throat  it was not pleasant  it was like molten lead being forced into his stomach and it was forced by his will alone  later the man rolled over on his back and slept        there were some members of a scientific expedition on the whaleship bedford  from the deck they remarked a strange object on the shore  it was moving down the beach toward the water  they were unable to classify it and being scientific men they climbed into the whaleboat alongside and went ashore to see  and they saw something that was alive but which could hardly be called a man  it was blind unconscious  it squirmed along the ground like some monstrous worm  most of its efforts were ineffectual but it was persistent and it writhed and twisted and went ahead perhaps a score of feet an hour        three weeks afterward the man lay in a bunk on the whaleship bedford and with tears streaming down his wasted cheeks told who he was and what he had undergone  he also babbled incoherently of his mother of sunny southern california and a home among the orange groves and flowers  the days were not many after that when he sat at table with the scientific men and ships officers  he gloated over the spectacle of so much food watching it anxiously as it went into the mouths of others with the disappearance of each mouthful an expression of deep regret came into his eyes  he was quite sane yet he hated those men at mealtime  he was haunted by a fear that the food would not last  he inquired of the cook the cabinboy the captain concerning the food stores  they reassured him countless times but he could not believe them and pried cunningly about the lazarette to see with his own eyes  it was noticed that the man was getting fat  he grew stouter with each day  the scientific men shook their heads and theorized  they limited the man at his meals but still his girth increased and he swelled prodigiously under his shirt  the sailors grinned  they knew  and when the scientific men set a watch on the man they knew too  they saw him slouch forard after breakfast and like a mendicant with outstretched palm accost a sailor  the sailor grinned and passed him a fragment of sea biscuit  he clutched it avariciously looked at it as a miser looks at gold and thrust it into his shirt bosom  similar were the donations from other grinning sailors  the scientific men were discreet  they let him alone  but they privily examined his bunk  it was lined with hardtack the mattress was stuffed with hardtack every nook and cranny was filled with hardtack  yet he was sane  he was taking precautions against another possible faminethat was all  he would recover from it the scientific men said and he did ere the bedfords anchor rumbled down in san francisco bay     a days lodging      it was the goshdangdest stampede i ever seen  a thousand dogteams    hittin the ice  you couldnt see m fer smoke  two white men an a    swede froze to death that night an there was a dozen busted their    lungs  but didnt i see with my own eyes the bottom of the    waterhole  it was yellow with gold like a mustardplaster  thats    why i staked the yukon for a minin claim  thats what made the    stampede  an then there was nothin to it  thats what i    saidnothin to it  an i aint got over guessin yetnarrative of    shorty  john messner clung with mittened hand to the bucking geepole and held the sled in the trail  with the other mittened hand he rubbed his cheeks and nose  he rubbed his cheeks and nose every little while  in point of fact he rarely ceased from rubbing them and sometimes as their numbness increased he rubbed fiercely  his forehead was covered by the visor of his fur cap the flaps of which went over his ears  the rest of his face was protected by a thick beard goldenbrown under its coating of frost  behind him churned a heavily loaded yukon sled and before him toiled a string of five dogs  the rope by which they dragged the sled rubbed against the side of messners leg  when the dogs swung on a bend in the trail he stepped over the rope  there were many bends and he was compelled to step over it often  sometimes he tripped on the rope or stumbled and at all times he was awkward betraying a weariness so great that the sled now and again ran upon his heels  when he came to a straight piece of trail where the sled could get along for a moment without guidance he let go the geepole and batted his right hand sharply upon the hard wood  he found it difficult to keep up the circulation in that hand  but while he pounded the one hand he never ceased from rubbing his nose and cheeks with the other  its too cold to travel anyway he said  he spoke aloud after the manner of men who are much by themselves  only a fool would travel at such a temperature  if it isnt eighty below its because its seventy nine  he pulled out his watch and after some fumbling got it back into the breast pocket of his thick woollen jacket  then he surveyed the heavens and ran his eye along the white skyline to the south  twelve oclock he mumbled a clear sky and no sun  he plodded on silently for ten minutes and then as though there had been no lapse in his speech he added  and no ground covered and its too cold to travel  suddenly he yelled whoa at the dogs and stopped  he seemed in a wild panic over his right hand and proceeded to hammer it furiously against the geepole  youpoordevils he addressed the dogs which had dropped down heavily on the ice to rest  his was a broken jerky utterance caused by the violence with which he hammered his numb hand upon the wood  what have you done anyway that a twolegged other animal should come along break you to harness curb all your natural proclivities and make slave beasts out of you  he rubbed his nose not reflectively but savagely in order to drive the blood into it and urged the dogs to their work again  he travelled on the frozen surface of a great river  behind him it stretched away in a mighty curve of many miles losing itself in a fantastic jumble of mountains snowcovered and silent  ahead of him the river split into many channels to accommodate the freight of islands it carried on its breast  these islands were silent and white  no animals nor humming insects broke the silence  no birds flew in the chill air  there was no sound of man no mark of the handiwork of man  the world slept and it was like the sleep of death  john messner seemed succumbing to the apathy of it all  the frost was benumbing his spirit  he plodded on with bowed head unobservant mechanically rubbing nose and cheeks and batting his steering hand against the geepole in the straight trailstretches  but the dogs were observant and suddenly they stopped turning their heads and looking back at their master out of eyes that were wistful and questioning  their eyelashes were frosted white as were their muzzles and they had all the seeming of decrepit old age what of the frostrime and exhaustion  the man was about to urge them on when he checked himself roused up with an effort and looked around  the dogs had stopped beside a water hole not a fissure but a hole manmade chopped laboriously with an axe through three and a half feet of ice  a thick skin of new ice showed that it had not been used for some time  messner glanced about him  the dogs were already pointing the way each wistful and hoary muzzle turned toward the dim snowpath that left the main river trail and climbed the bank of the island  all right you sorefooted brutes he said  ill investigate  youre not a bit more anxious to quit than i am  he climbed the bank and disappeared  the dogs did not lie down but on their feet eagerly waited his return  he came back to them took a haulingrope from the front of the sled and put it around his shoulders then he geed the dogs to the right and put them at the bank on the run  it was a stiff pull but their weariness fell from them as they crouched low to the snow whining with eagerness and gladness as they struggled upward to the last ounce of effort in their bodies  when a dog slipped or faltered the one behind nipped his hind quarters  the man shouted encouragement and threats and threw all his weight on the haulingrope  they cleared the bank with a rush swung to the left and dashed up to a small log cabin  it was a deserted cabin of a single room eight feet by ten on the inside  messner unharnessed the animals unloaded his sled and took possession  the last chance wayfarer had left a supply of firewood  messner set up his light sheetiron stove and starred a fire he put five suncured salmon into the oven to thaw out for the dogs and from the waterhole filled his coffeepot and cookingpail  while waiting for the water to boil he held his face over the stove  the moisture from his breath had collected on his beard and frozen into a great mass of ice and this he proceeded to thaw out  as it melted and dropped upon the stove it sizzled and rose about him in steam  he helped the process with his fingers working loose small icechunks that fell rattling to the floor  a wild outcry from the dogs without did not take him from his task  he heard the wolfish snarling and yelping of strange dogs and the sound of voices  a knock came on the door  come in messner called in a voice muffled because at the moment he was sucking loose a fragment of ice from its anchorage on his upper lip  the door opened and gazing out of his cloud of steam he saw a man and a woman pausing on the threshold  come in he said peremptorily and shut the door  peering through the steam he could make out but little of their personal appearance  the nose and cheek strap worn by the woman and the trail wrappings about her head allowed only a pair of black eyes to be seen the man was darkeyed and smoothshaven all except his mustache which was so iced up as to hide his mouth  we just wanted to know if there is any other cabin around here he said at the same time glancing over the unfurnished state of the room we thought this cabin was empty  it isnt my cabin messner answered  i just found it a few minutes ago  come right in and camp  plenty of room and you wont need your stove  theres room for all  at the sound of his voice the woman peered at him with quick curiousness  get your things off her companion said to her  ill unhitch and get the water so we can start cooking  messner took the thawed salmon outside and fed his dogs  he had to guard them against the second team of dogs and when he had reentered the cabin the other man had unpacked the sled and fetched water  messners pot was boiling  he threw in the coffee settled it with half a cup of cold water and took the pot from the stove  he thawed some sourdough biscuits in the oven at the same time heating a pot of beans he had boiled the night before and that had ridden frozen on the sled all morning  removing his utensils from the stove so as to give the newcomers a chance to cook he proceeded to take his meal from the top of his grub box himself sitting on his bedroll  between mouthfuls he talked trail and dogs with the man who with head over the stove was thawing the ice from his mustache  there were two bunks in the cabin and into one of them when he had cleared his lip the stranger tossed his bedroll  well sleep here he said unless you prefer this bunk  youre the first comer and you have first choice you know  thats all right messner answered  one bunks just as good as the other  he spread his own bedding in the second bunk and sat down on the edge the stranger thrust a physicians small travelling case under his blankets at one end to serve for a pillow  doctor messner asked  yes came the answer but i assure you i didnt come into the klondike to practise  the woman busied herself with cooking while the man sliced bacon and fired the stove  the light in the cabin was dim filtering through in a small window made of onionskin writing paper and oiled with bacon grease so that john messner could not make out very well what the woman looked like  not that he tried  he seemed to have no interest in her but she glanced curiously from time to time into the dark corner where he sat  oh its a great life the doctor proclaimed enthusiastically pausing from sharpening his knife on the stovepipe  what i like about it is the struggle the endeavor with ones own hands the primitiveness of it the realness  the temperature is real enough messner laughed  do you know how cold it actually is the doctor demanded  the other shook his head  well ill tell you  seventyfour below zero by spirit thermometer on the sled  thats one hundred and six below freezing pointtoo cold for travelling eh  practically suicide was the doctors verdict  one exerts himself  he breathes heavily taking into his lungs the frost itself  it chills his lungs freezes the edges of the tissues  he gets a dry hacking cough as the dead tissue sloughs away and dies the following summer of pneumonia wondering what its all about  ill stay in this cabin for a week unless the thermometer rises at least to fifty below  i say tess he said the next moment dont you think that coffees boiled long enough  at the sound of the womans name john messner became suddenly alert  he looked at her quickly while across his face shot a haunting expression the ghost of some buried misery achieving swift resurrection  but the next moment and by an effort of will the ghost was laid again  his face was as placid as before though he was still alert dissatisfied with what the feeble light had shown him of the womans face  automatically her first act had been to set the coffeepot back  it was not until she had done this that she glanced at messner  but already he had composed himself  she saw only a man sitting on the edge of the bunk and incuriously studying the toes of his moccasins  but as she turned casually to go about her cooking he shot another swift look at her and she glancing as swiftly back caught his look  he shifted on past her to the doctor though the slightest smile curled his lip in appreciation of the way she had trapped him  she drew a candle from the grubbox and lighted it  one look at her illuminated face was enough for messner  in the small cabin the widest limit was only a matter of several steps and the next moment she was alongside of him  she deliberately held the candle close to his face and stared at him out of eyes wide with fear and recognition  he smiled quietly back at her  what are you looking for tess the doctor called  hairpins she replied passing on and rummaging in a clothesbag on the bunk  they served their meal on their grubbox sitting on messners grubbox and facing him  he had stretched out on his bunk to rest lying on his side his head on his arm  in the close quarters it was as though the three were together at table  what part of the states do you come from messner asked  san francisco answered the doctor  ive been in here two years though  i hail from california myself was messners announcement  the woman looked at him appealingly but he smiled and went on  berkeley you know  the other man was becoming interested  u c he asked  yes class of 86  i meant faculty the doctor explained  you remind me of the type  sorry to hear you say so messner smiled back  id prefer being taken for a prospector or a dogmusher  i dont think he looks any more like a professor than you do a doctor the woman broke in  thank you said messner  then turning to her companion by the way doctor what is your name if i may ask  haythorne if youll take my word for it  i gave up cards with civilization  and mrs haythorne messner smiled and bowed  she flashed a look at him that was more anger than appeal  haythorne was about to ask the others name  his mouth had opened to form the question when messner cut him off  come to think of it doctor you may possibly be able to satisfy my curiosity  there was a sort of scandal in faculty circles some two or three years ago  the wife of one of the english professorser if you will pardon me mrs haythornedisappeared with some san francisco doctor i understood though his name does not just now come to my lips do you remember the incident  haythorne nodded his head  made quite a stir at the time  his name was womblegraham womble  he had a magnificent practice  i knew him somewhat  well what i was trying to get at was what had become of them  i was wondering if you had heard  they left no trace hide nor hair  he covered his tracks cunningly  haythorne cleared his throat  there was rumor that they went to the south seaswere lost on a trading schooner in a typhoon or something like that  i never heard that messner said  you remember the case mrs haythorne  perfectly she answered in a voice the control of which was in amazing contrast to the anger that blazed in the face she turned aside so that haythorne might not see  the latter was again on the verge of asking his name when messner remarked  this dr womble ive heard he was very handsome anderquite a success so to say with the ladies  well if he was he finished himself off by that affair haythorne grumbled  and the woman was a termagantat least so ive been told  it was generally accepted in berkeley that she made lifeernot exactly paradise for her husband  i never heard that haythorne rejoined  in san francisco the talk was all the other way  woman sort of a martyr ehcrucified on the cross of matrimony  the doctor nodded  messners gray eyes were mildly curious as he went on  that was to be expectedtwo sides to the shield  living in berkeley i only got the one side  she was a great deal in san francisco it seems  some coffee please haythorne said  the woman refilled his mug at the same time breaking into light laughter  youre gossiping like a pair of beldames she chided them  its so interesting messner smiled at her then returned to the doctor  the husband seems then to have had a not very savory reputation in san francisco  on the contrary he was a moral prig haythorne blurted out with apparently undue warmth  he was a little scholastic shrimp without a drop of red blood in his body  did you know him  never laid eyes on him  i never knocked about in university circles  one side of the shield again messner said with an air of weighing the matter judicially  while he did not amount to much it is truethat is physicallyid hardly say he was as bad as all that  he did take an active interest in student athletics  and he had some talent  he once wrote a nativity play that brought him quite a bit of local appreciation i have heard also that he was slated for the head of the english department only the affair happened and he resigned and went away  it quite broke his career or so it seemed  at any rate on our side the shield it was considered a knockout blow to him  it was thought he cared a great deal for his wife  haythorne finishing his mug of coffee grunted uninterestedly and lighted his pipe  it was fortunate they had no children messner continued  but haythorne with a glance at the stove pulled on his cap and mittens  im going out to get some wood he said  then i can take off my moccasins and he comfortable  the door slammed behind him  for a long minute there was silence  the man continued in the same position on the bed  the woman sat on the grub box facing him  what are you going to do she asked abruptly  messner looked at her with lazy indecision  what do you think i ought to do  nothing scenic i hope  you see i am stiff and trailsore and this bunk is so restful  she gnawed her lower lip and fumed dumbly  but she began vehemently then clenched her hands and stopped  i hope you dont want me to kill mrerhaythorne he said gently almost pleadingly  it would be most distressing and i assure you really it is unnecessary  but you must do something she cried  on the contrary it is quite conceivable that i do not have to do anything  you would stay here  he nodded  she glanced desperately around the cabin and at the bed unrolled on the other bunk  night is coming on  you cant stop here  you cant  i tell you you simply cant  of course i can  i might remind you that i found this cabin first and that you are my guests  again her eyes travelled around the room and the terror in them leaped up at sight of the other bunk  then well have to go she announced decisively  impossible  you have a dry hacking coughthe sort mrerhaythorne so aptly described  youve already slightly chilled your lungs  besides he is a physician and knows  he would never permit it  then what are you going to do she demanded again with a tense quiet utterance that boded an outbreak  messner regarded her in a way that was almost paternal what of the profundity of pity and patience with which he contrived to suffuse it  my dear theresa as i told you before i dont know  i really havent thought about it  oh  you drive me mad  she sprang to her feet wringing her hands in impotent wrath  you never used to be this way  i used to be all softness and gentleness he nodded concurrence  was that why you left me  you are so different so dreadfully calm  you frighten me  i feel you have something terrible planned all the while  but whatever you do dont do anything rash  dont get excited  i dont get excited any more he interrupted  not since you went away  you have improvedremarkably she retorted  he smiled acknowledgment  while i am thinking about what i shall do ill tell you what you will have to dotell mrerhaythorne who i am it may make our stay in this cabin moremay i say sociable  why have you followed me into this frightful country she asked irrelevantly  dont think i came here looking for you theresa  your vanity shall not be tickled by any such misapprehension  our meeting is wholly fortuitous  i broke with the life academic and i had to go somewhere  to be honest i came into the klondike because i thought it the place you were least liable to be in  there was a fumbling at the latch then the door swung in and haythorne entered with an armful of firewood  at the first warning theresa began casually to clear away the dishes  haythorne went out again after more wood  why didnt you introduce us messner queried  ill tell him she replied with a toss of her head  dont think im afraid  i never knew you to be afraid very much of anything  and im not afraid of confession either she said with softening face and voice  in your case i fear confession is exploitation by indirection profit making by ruse selfaggrandizement at the expense of god  dont be literary she pouted with growing tenderness  i never did like epigrammatic discussion  besides im not afraid to ask you to forgive me  there is nothing to forgive theresa  i really should thank you  true at first i suffered and then with all the graciousness of spring it dawned upon me that i was happy very happy  it was a most amazing discovery  but what if i should return to you she asked  i should he looked at her whimsically be greatly perturbed  i am your wife  you know you have never got a divorce  i see he meditated  i have been careless  it will be one of the first things i attend to  she came over to his side resting her hand on his arm  you dont want me john  her voice was soft and caressing her hand rested like a lure  if i told you i had made a mistake  if i told you that i was very unhappyand i am  and i did make a mistake  fear began to grow on messner  he felt himself wilting under the lightly laid hand  the situation was slipping away from him all his beautiful calmness was going  she looked at him with melting eyes and he too seemed all dew and melting  he felt himself on the edge of an abyss powerless to withstand the force that was drawing him over  i am coming back to you john  i am coming back today    now  as in a nightmare he strove under the hand  while she talked he seemed to hear rippling softly the song of the lorelei  it was as though somewhere a piano were playing and the actual notes were impinging on his eardrums  suddenly he sprang to his feet thrust her from him as her arms attempted to clasp him and retreated backward to the door  he was in a panic  ill do something desperate he cried  i warned you not to get excited  she laughed mockingly and went about washing the dishes  nobody wants you  i was just playing with you  i am happier where i am  but messner did not believe  he remembered her facility in changing front  she had changed front now  it was exploitation by indirection she was not happy with the other man  she had discovered her mistake the flame of his ego flared up at the thought  she wanted to come back to him which was the one thing he did not want  unwittingly his hand rattled the doorlatch  dont run away she laughed  i wont bite you  i am not running away he replied with childlike defiance at the same time pulling on his mittens  im only going to get some water  he gathered the empty pails and cooking pots together and opened the door  he looked back at her  dont forget youre to tell mrerhaythorne who i am  messner broke the skin that had formed on the waterhole within the hour and filled his pails  but he did not return immediately to the cabin leaving the pails standing in the trail he walked up and down rapidly to keep from freezing for the frost bit into the flesh like fire  his beard was white with his frozen breath when the perplexed and frowning brows relaxed and decision came into his face  he had made up his mind to his course of action and his frigid lips and cheeks crackled into a chuckle over it  the pails were already skinned over with young ice when he picked them up and made for the cabin  when he entered he found the other man waiting standing near the stove a certain stiff awkwardness and indecision in his manner  messner set down his waterpails  glad to meet you graham womble he said in conventional tones as though acknowledging an introduction  messner did not offer his hand  womble stirred uneasily feeling for the other the hatred one is prone to feel for one he has wronged  and so youre the chap messner said in marvelling accents  well well  you see i really am glad to meet you  i have beenercurious to know what theresa found in youwhere i may say the attraction lay well well  and he looked the other up and down as a man would look a horse up and down  i know how you must feel about me womble began  dont mention it messner broke in with exaggerated cordiality of voice and manner  never mind that  what i want to know is how do you find her  up to expectations  has she worn well  life been all a happy dream ever since  dont be silly theresa interjected  i cant help being natural messner complained  you can be expedient at the same time and practical womble said sharply  what we want to know is what are you going to do  messner made a wellfeigned gesture of helplessness  i really dont know  it is one of those impossible situations against which there can be no provision  all three of us cannot remain the night in this cabin  messner nodded affirmation  then somebody must get out  that also is incontrovertible messner agreed  when three bodies cannot occupy the same space at the same time one must get out  and youre that one womble announced grimly  its a tenmile pull to the next camp but you can make it all right  and thats the first flaw in your reasoning the other objected  why necessarily should i be the one to get out  i found this cabin first  but tess cant get out womble explained  her lungs are already slightly chilled  i agree with you  she cant venture ten miles of frost  by all means she must remain  then it is as i said womble announced with finality  messner cleared his throat  your lungs are all right arent they  yes but what of it  again the other cleared his throat and spoke with painstaking and judicial slowness  why i may say nothing of it except ah according to your own reasoning there is nothing to prevent your getting out hitting the frost so to speak for a matter of ten miles  you can make it all right  womble looked with quick suspicion at theresa and caught in her eyes a glint of pleased surprise  well he demanded of her  she hesitated and a surge of anger darkened his face  he turned upon messner  enough of this  you cant stop here  yes i can  i wont let you womble squared his shoulders  im running things  ill stay anyway the other persisted  ill put you out  ill come back  womble stopped a moment to steady his voice and control himself  then he spoke slowly in a low tense voice  look here messner if you refuse to get out ill thrash you  this isnt california  ill beat you to a jelly with my two fists  messner shrugged his shoulders  if you do ill call a miners meeting and see you strung up to the nearest tree  as you said this is not california  theyre a simple folk these miners and all ill have to do will be to show them the marks of the beating tell them the truth about you and present my claim for my wife  the woman attempted to speak but womble turned upon her fiercely  you keep out of this he cried  in marked contrast was messners please dont intrude theresa  what of her anger and pent feelings her lungs were irritated into the dry hacking cough and with bloodsuffused face and one hand clenched against her chest she waited for the paroxysm to pass  womble looked gloomily at her noting her cough  something must be done he said  yet her lungs cant stand the exposure  she cant travel till the temperature rises  and im not going to give her up  messner hemmed cleared his throat and hemmed again semiapologetically and said i need some money  contempt showed instantly in wombles face  at last beneath him in vileness had the other sunk himself  youve got a fat sack of dust messner went on  i saw you unload it from the sled  how much do you want womble demanded with a contempt in his voice equal to that in his face  i made an estimate of the sack and iahshould say it weighed about twenty pounds  what do you say we call it four thousand  but its all ive got man womble cried out  youve got her the other said soothingly  she must be worth it think what im giving up  surely it is a reasonable price  all right  womble rushed across the floor to the goldsack  cant put this deal through too quick for me youyou little worm  now there you err was the smiling rejoinder  as a matter of ethics isnt the man who gives a bribe as bad as the man who takes a bribe  the receiver is as bad as the thief you know and you neednt console yourself with any fictitious moral superiority concerning this little deal  to hell with your ethics the other burst out  come here and watch the weighing of this dust  i might cheat you  and the woman leaning against the bunk raging and impotent watched herself weighed out in yellow dust and nuggets in the scales erected on the grubbox  the scales were small making necessary many weighings and messner with precise care verified each weighing  theres too much silver in it he remarked as he tied up the goldsack i dont think it will run quite sixteen to the ounce  you got a trifle the better of me womble  he handled the sack lovingly and with due appreciation of its preciousness carried it out to his sled  returning he gathered his pots and pans together packed his grubbox and rolled up his bed  when the sled was lashed and the complaining dogs harnessed he returned into the cabin for his mittens  goodby tess he said standing at the open door  she turned on him struggling for speech but too frantic to word the passion that burned in her  goodby tess he repeated gently  beast she managed to articulate  she turned and tottered to the bunk flinging herself face down upon it sobbing  you beasts  you beasts  john messner closed the door softly behind him and as he started the dogs looked back at the cabin with a great relief in his face  at the bottom of the bank beside the waterhole he halted the sled  he worked the sack of gold out between the lashings and carried it to the water hole  already a new skin of ice had formed  this he broke with his fist  untying the knotted mouth with his teeth he emptied the contents of the sack into the water  the river was shallow at that point and two feet beneath the surface he could see the bottom dullyellow in the fading light  at the sight of it he spat into the hole  he started the dogs along the yukon trail  whining spiritlessly they were reluctant to work  clinging to the geepole with his right band and with his left rubbing cheeks and nose he stumbled over the rope as the dogs swung on a bend  mushon you poor sorefooted brutes he cried  thats it mushon     the white mans way   to cook by your fire and to sleep under your roof for the night i had announced on entering old ebbitss cabin and he had looked at me blear eyed and vacuous while zilla had favored me with a sour face and a contemptuous grunt  zilla was his wife and no more bittertongued implacable old squaw dwelt on the yukon  nor would i have stopped there had my dogs been less tired or had the rest of the village been inhabited  but this cabin alone had i found occupied and in this cabin perforce i took my shelter  old ebbits now and again pulled his tangled wits together and hints and sparkles of intelligence came and went in his eyes  several times during the preparation of my supper he even essayed hospitable inquiries about my health the condition and number of my dogs and the distance i had travelled that day  and each time zilla had looked sourer than ever and grunted more contemptuously  yet i confess that there was no particular call for cheerfulness on their part  there they crouched by the fire the pair of them at the end of their days old and withered and helpless racked by rheumatism bitten by hunger and tantalized by the fryingodors of my abundance of meat they rocked back and forth in a slow and hopeless way and regularly once every five minutes ebbits emitted a low groan  it was not so much a groan of pain as of painweariness  he was oppressed by the weight and the torment of this thing called life and still more was he oppressed by the fear of death  his was that eternal tragedy of the aged with whom the joy of life has departed and the instinct for death has not come  when my moosemeat spluttered rowdily in the fryingpan i noticed old ebbitss nostrils twitch and distend as he caught the foodscent  he ceased rocking for a space and forgot to groan while a look of intelligence seemed to come into his face  zilla on the other hand rocked more rapidly and for the first time in sharp little yelps voiced her pain  it came to me that their behavior was like that of hungry dogs and in the fitness of things i should not have been astonished had zilla suddenly developed a tail and thumped it on the floor in right doggish fashion  ebbits drooled a little and stopped his rocking very frequently to lean forward and thrust his tremulous nose nearer to the source of gustatory excitement  when i passed them each a plate of the fried meat they ate greedily making loud mouthnoiseschampings of worn teeth and sucking intakes of the breath accompanied by a continuous spluttering and mumbling  after that when i gave them each a mug of scalding tea the noises ceased easement and content came into their faces  zilla relaxed her sour mouth long enough to sigh her satisfaction  neither rocked any more and they seemed to have fallen into placid meditation  then a dampness came into ebbitss eyes and i knew that the sorrow of selfpity was his  the search required to find their pipes told plainly that they had been without tobacco a long time and the old mans eagerness for the narcotic rendered him helpless so that i was compelled to light his pipe for him  why are you all alone in the village i asked  is everybody dead  has there been a great sickness  are you alone left of the living  old ebbits shook his head saying  nay there has been no great sickness  the village has gone away to hunt meat  we be too old our legs are not strong nor can our backs carry the burdens of camp and trail  wherefore we remain here and wonder when the young men will return with meat  what if the young men do return with meat zilla demanded harshly  they may return with much meat he quavered hopefully  even so with much meat she continued more harshly than before  but of what worth to you and me  a few bones to gnaw in our toothless old age  but the backfat the kidneys and the tonguesthese shall go into other mouths than thine and mine old man  ebbits nodded his head and wept silently  there be no one to hunt meat for us she cried turning fiercely upon me  there was accusation in her manner and i shrugged my shoulders in token that i was not guilty of the unknown crime imputed to me  know o white man that it is because of thy kind because of all white men that my man and i have no meat in our old age and sit without tobacco in the cold  nay ebbits said gravely with a stricter sense of justice  wrong has been done us it be true but the white men did not mean the wrong  where be moklan she demanded  where be thy strong son moklan and the fish he was ever willing to bring that you might eat  the old man shook his head  and where be bidarshik thy strong son  ever was he a mighty hunter and ever did he bring thee the good backfat and the sweet dried tongues of the moose and the caribou  i see no backfat and no sweet dried tongues  your stomach is full with emptiness through the days and it is for a man of a very miserable and lying people to give you to eat  nay old ebbits interposed in kindliness the white mans is not a lying people  the white man speaks true  always does the white man speak true  he paused casting about him for words wherewith to temper the severity of what he was about to say  but the white man speaks true in different ways  today he speaks true one way tomorrow he speaks true another way and there is no understanding him nor his way  today speak true one way tomorrow speak true another way which is to lie was zillas dictum  there is no understanding the white man ebbits went on doggedly  the meat and the tea and the tobacco seemed to have brought him back to life and he gripped tighter hold of the idea behind his agebleared eyes  he straightened up somewhat  his voice lost its querulous and whimpering note and became strong and positive  he turned upon me with dignity and addressed me as equal addresses equal  the white mans eyes are not shut he began  the white man sees all things and thinks greatly and is very wise  but the white man of one day is not the white man of next day and there is no understanding him he does not do things always in the same way  and what way his next way is to be one cannot know  always does the indian do the one thing in the one way  always does the moose come down from the high mountains when the winter is here  always does the salmon come in the spring when the ice has gone out of the river  always does everything do all things in the same way and the indian knows and understands  but the white man does not do all things in the same way and the indian does not know nor understand  tobacco be very good  it be food to the hungry man  it makes the strong man stronger and the angry man to forget that he is angry  also is tobacco of value  it is of very great value  the indian gives one large salmon for one leaf of tobacco and he chews the tobacco for a long time  it is the juice of the tobacco that is good  when it runs down his throat it makes him feel good inside  but the white man  when his mouth is full with the juice what does he do  that juice that juice of great value he spits it out in the snow and it is lost  does the white man like tobacco  i do not know  but if he likes tobacco why does he spit out its value and lose it in the snow  it is a great foolishness and without understanding  he ceased puffed at the pipe found that it was out and passed it over to zilla who took the sneer at the white man off her lips in order to pucker them about the pipestem  ebbits seemed sinking back into his senility with the tale untold and i demanded  what of thy sons moklan and bidarshik  and why is it that you and your old woman are without meat at the end of your years  he roused himself as from sleep and straightened up with an effort  it is not good to steal he said  when the dog takes your meat you beat the dog with a club  such is the law  it is the law the man gave to the dog and the dog must live to the law else will it suffer the pain of the club  when man takes your meat or your canoe or your wife you kill that man  that is the law and it is a good law  it is not good to steal wherefore it is the law that the man who steals must die whoso breaks the law must suffer hurt  it is a great hurt to die  but if you kill the man why do you not kill the dog i asked  old ebbits looked at me in childlike wonder while zilla sneered openly at the absurdity of my question  it is the way of the white man ebbits mumbled with an air of resignation  it is the foolishness of the white man snapped zilla  then let old ebbits teach the white man wisdom i said softly  the dog is not killed because it must pull the sled of the man  no man pulls another mans sled wherefore the man is killed  oh i murmured  that is the law old ebbits went on  now listen o white man and i will tell you of a great foolishness  there is an indian  his name is mobits  from white man he steals two pounds of flour  what does the white man do  does he beat mobits  no  does he kill mobits  no what does he do to mobits  i will tell you o white man  he has a house  he puts mobits in that house  the roof is good  the walls are thick  he makes a fire that mobits may be warm  he gives mobits plenty grub to eat  it is good grub  never in his all days does mobits eat so good grub  there is bacon and bread and beans without end  mobits have very good time  there is a big lock on door so that mobits does not run away  this also is a great foolishness  mobits will not run away  all the time is there plenty grub in that place and warm blankets and a big fire  very foolish to run away  mobits is not foolish  three months mobits stop in that place  he steal two pounds of flour  for that white man take plenty good care of him  mobits eat many pounds of flour many pounds of sugar of bacon of beans without end  also mobits drink much tea after three months white man open door and tell mobits he must go  mobits does not want to go  he is like dog that is fed long time in one place he want to stay in that place and the white man must drive mobits away so mobits come back to this village and he is very fat  that is the white mans way and there is no understanding it  it is a foolishness a great foolishness  but thy sons i insisted  thy very strong sons and thine oldage hunger  there was moklan ebbits began  a strong man interrupted the mother  he could dip paddle all of a day and night and never stop for the need of rest  he was wise in the way of the salmon and in the way of the water  he was very wise  there was moklan ebbits repeated ignoring the interruption  in the spring he went down the yukon with the young men to trade at cambell fort  there is a post there filled with the goods of the white man and a trader whose name is jones  likewise is there a white mans medicine man what you call missionary  also is there bad water at cambell fort where the yukon goes slim like a maiden and the water is fast and the currents rush this way and that and come together and there are whirls and sucks and always are the currents changing and the face of the water changing so at any two times it is never the same  moklan is my son wherefore he is brave man  was not my father brave man zilla demanded  thy father was brave man ebbits acknowledged with the air of one who will keep peace in the house at any cost  moklan is thy son and mine wherefore he is brave  mayhap because of thy very brave father moklan is too brave  it is like when too much water is put in the pot it spills over  so too much bravery is put into moklan and the bravery spills over  the young men are much afraid of the bad water at cambell fort  but moklan is not afraid  he laughs strong ho ho and he goes forth into the bad water  but where the currents come together the canoe is turned over  a whirl takes moklan by the legs and he goes around and around and down and down and is seen no more  ai ai wailed zilla  crafty and wise was he and my firstborn  i am the father of moklan ebbits said having patiently given the woman space for her noise  i get into canoe and journey down to cambell fort to collect the debt  debt interrupted  what debt  the debt of jones who is chief trader came the answer  such is the law of travel in a strange country  i shook my head in token of my ignorance and ebbits looked compassion at me while zilla snorted her customary contempt  look you o white man he said  in thy camp is a dog that bites  when the dog bites a man you give that man a present because you are sorry and because it is thy dog  you make payment  is it not so  also if you have in thy country bad hunting or bad water you must make payment it is just  it is the law  did not my fathers brother go over into the tanana country and get killed by a bear  and did not the tanana tribe pay my father many blankets and fine furs  it was just  it was bad hunting and the tanana people made payment for the bad hunting  so i ebbits journeyed down to cambell fort to collect the debt  jones who is chief trader looked at me and he laughed  he made great laughter and would not give payment  i went to the medicineman what you call missionary and had large talk about the bad water and the payment that should be mine  and the missionary made talk about other things  he talk about where moklan has gone now he is dead  there be large fires in that place and if missionary make true talk i know that moklan will be cold no more  also the missionary talk about where i shall go when i am dead  and he say bad things  he say that i am blind which is a lie  he say that i am in great darkness  which is a lie  and i say that the day come and the night come for everybody just the same and that in my village it is no more dark than at cambell fort  also i say that darkness and light and where we go when we die be different things from the matter of payment of just debt for bad water  then the missionary make large anger and call me bad names of darkness and tell me to go away  and so i come back from cambell fort and no payment has been made and moklan is dead and in my old age i am without fish and meat  because of the white man said zilla  because of the white man ebbits concurred  and other things because of the white man  there was bidarshik  one way did the white man deal with him and yet another way for the same thing did the white man deal with yamikan  and first must i tell you of yamikan who was a young man of this village and who chanced to kill a white man  it is not good to kill a man of another people  always is there great trouble  it was not the fault of yamikan that he killed the white man  yamikan spoke always soft words and ran away from wrath as a dog from a stick  but this white man drank much whiskey and in the nighttime came to yamikans house and made much fight  yamikan cannot run away and the white man tries to kill him  yamikan does not like to die so he kills the white man  then is all the village in great trouble  we are much afraid that we must make large payment to the white mans people and we hide our blankets and our furs and all our wealth so that it will seem that we are poor people and can make only small payment  after long time white men come  they are soldier white men and they take yamikan away with them  his mother make great noise and throw ashes in her hair for she knows yamikan is dead  and all the village knows that yamikan is dead and is glad that no payment is asked  that is in the spring when the ice has gone out of the river  one year go by two years go by  it is springtime again and the ice has gone out of the river  and then yamikan who is dead comes back to us and he is not dead but very fat and we know that he has slept warm and had plenty grub to eat  he has much fine clothes and is all the same white man and he has gathered large wisdom so that he is very quick head man in the village  and he has strange things to tell of the way of the white man for he has seen much of the white man and done a great travel into the white mans country  first place soldier white men take him down the river long way  all the way do they take him down the river to the end where it runs into a lake which is larger than all the land and large as the sky  i do not know the yukon is so big river but yamikan has seen with his own eyes  i do not think there is a lake larger than all the land and large as the sky but yamikan has seen  also he has told me that the waters of this lake be salt which is a strange thing and beyond understanding  but the white man knows all these marvels for himself so i shall not weary him with the telling of them  only will i tell him what happened to yamikan  the white man give yamikan much fine grub  all the time does yamikan eat and all the time is there plenty more grub  the white man lives under the sun so said yamikan where there be much warmth and animals have only hair and no fur and the green things grow large and strong and become flour and beans and potatoes  and under the sun there is never famine  always is there plenty grub  i do not know yamikan has said  and here is a strange thing that befell yamikan  never did the white man hurt him  only did they give him warm bed at night and plenty fine grub  they take him across the salt lake which is big as the sky  he is on white mans fireboat what you call steamboat only he is on boat maybe twenty times bigger than steamboat on yukon  also it is made of iron this boat and yet does it not sink  this i do not understand but yamikan has said i have journeyed far on the iron boat behold i am still alive  it is a white mans soldierboat with many soldier men upon it  after many sleeps of travel a long long time yamikan comes to a land where there is no snow  i cannot believe this  it is not in the nature of things that when winter comes there shall be no snow  but yamikan has seen  also have i asked the white men and they have said yes there is no snow in that country  but i cannot believe and now i ask you if snow never come in that country  also i would hear the name of that country i have heard the name before but i would hear it again if it be the samethus will i know if i have heard lies or true talk  old ebbits regarded me with a wistful face  he would have the truth at any cost though it was his desire to retain his faith in the marvel he had never seen  yes i answered it is true talk that you have heard  there is no snow in that country and its name is california  caleeforneeyeh he mumbled twice and thrice listening intently to the sound of the syllables as they fell from his lips  he nodded his head in confirmation  yes it is the same country of which yamikan made talk  i recognized the adventure of yamikan as one likely to occur in the early days when alaska first passed into the possession of the united states such a murder case occurring before the instalment of territorial law and officials might well have been taken down to the united states for trial before a federal court  when yamikan is in this country where there is no snow old ebbits continued he is taken to large house where many men make much talk long time men talk  also many questions do they ask yamikan  by and by they tell yamikan he have no more trouble  yamikan does not understand for never has he had any trouble  all the time have they given him warm place to sleep and plenty grub  but after that they give him much better grub and they give him money and they take him many places in white mans country and he see many strange things which are beyond the understanding of ebbits who is an old man and has not journeyed far  after two years yamikan comes back to this village and he is head man and very wise until he dies  but before he dies many times does he sit by my fire and make talk of the strange things he has seen  and bidarshik who is my son sits by the fire and listens and his eyes are very wide and large because of the things he hears  one night after yamikan has gone home bidarshik stands up so very tall and he strikes his chest with his fist and says when i am a man i shall journey in far places even to the land where there is no snow and see things for myself  always did bidarshik journey in far places zilla interrupted proudly  it be true ebbits assented gravely  and always did he return to sit by the fire and hunger for yet other and unknown far places  and always did he remember the salt lake as big as the sky and the country under the sun where there is no snow quoth zilla  and always did he say when i have the full strength of a man i will go and see for myself if the talk of yamikan be true talk said ebbits  but there was no way to go to the white mans country said zilla  did he not go down to the salt lake that is big as the sky ebbits demanded  and there was no way for him across the salt lake said zilla  save in the white mans fireboat which is of iron and is bigger than twenty steamboats on the yukon said ebbits  he scowled at zilla whose withered lips were again writhing into speech and compelled her to silence  but the white man would not let him cross the salt lake in the fireboat and he returned to sit by the fire and hunger for the country under the sun where there is no snow  yet on the salt lake had he seen the fireboat of iron that did not sink cried out zilla the irrepressible  ay said ebbits and he saw that yamikan had made true talk of the things he had seen  but there was no way for bidarshik to journey to the white mans land under the sun and he grew sick and weary like an old man and moved not away from the fire  no longer did he go forth to kill meat  and no longer did he eat the meat placed before him zilla broke in he would shake his head and say only do i care to eat the grub of the white man and grow fat after the manner of yamikan  and he did not eat the meat ebbits went on  and the sickness of bidarshik grew into a great sickness until i thought he would die  it was not a sickness of the body but of the head  it was a sickness of desire  i ebbits who am his father make a great think  i have no more sons and i do not want bidarshik to die  it is a headsickness and there is but one way to make it well  bidarshik must journey across the lake as large as the sky to the land where there is no snow else will he die  i make a very great think and then i see the way for bidarshik to go  so one night when he sits by the fire very sick his head hanging down i say my son i have learned the way for you to go to the white mans land  he looks at me and his face is glad  go i say even as yamikan went  but bidarshik is sick and does not understand  go forth i say and find a white man and even as yamikan do you kill that white man  then will the soldier white men come and get you and even as they took yamikan will they take you across the salt lake to the white mans land  and then even as yamikan will you return very fat your eyes full of the things you have seen your head filled with wisdom  and bidarshik stands up very quick and his hand is reaching out for his gun  where do you go i ask  to kill the white man he says  and i see that my words have been good in the ears of bidarshik and that he will grow well again  also do i know that my words have been wise  there is a white man come to this village  he does not seek after gold in the ground nor after furs in the forest  all the time does he seek after bugs and flies  he does not eat the bugs and flies then why does he seek after them  i do not know  only do i know that he is a funny white man  also does he seek after the eggs of birds  he does not eat the eggs  all that is inside he takes out and only does he keep the shell  eggshell is not good to eat  nor does he eat the eggshells but puts them away in soft boxes where they will not break  he catch many small birds  but he does not eat the birds  he takes only the skins and puts them away in boxes  also does he like bones  bones are not good to eat  and this strange white man likes best the bones of long time ago which he digs out of the ground  but he is not a fierce white man and i know he will die very easy so i say to bidarshik my son there is the white man for you to kill  and bidarshik says that my words be wise  so he goes to a place he knows where are many bones in the ground  he digs up very many of these bones and brings them to the strange white mans camp  the white man is made very glad  his face shines like the sun and he smiles with much gladness as he looks at the bones  he bends his head over so to look well at the bones and then bidarshik strikes him hard on the head with axe once so and the strange white man kicks and is dead  now i say to bidarshik will the white soldier men come and take you away to the land under the sun where you will eat much and grow fat bidarshik is happy  already has his sickness gone from him and he sits by the fire and waits for the coming of the white soldier men  how was i to know the way of the white man is never twice the same the old man demanded whirling upon me fiercely  how was i to know that what the white man does yesterday he will not do today and that what he does today he will not do tomorrow  ebbits shook his head sadly there is no understanding the white man  yesterday he takes yamikan to the land under the sun and makes him fat with much grub  today he takes bidarshik andwhat does he do with bidarshik  let me tell you what he does with bidarshik  i ebbits his father will tell you  he takes bidarshik to cambell fort and he ties a rope around his neck so and when his feet are no more on the ground he dies  ai ai wailed zilla  and never does he cross the lake large as the sky nor see the land under the sun where there is no snow  wherefore old ebbits said with grave dignity there be no one to hunt meat for me in my old age and i sit hungry by my fire and tell my story to the white man who has given me grub and strong tea and tobacco for my pipe  because of the lying and very miserable white people zilla proclaimed shrilly  nay answered the old man with gentle positiveness  because of the way of the white man which is without understanding and never twice the same     the story of keesh   keesh lived long ago on the rim of the polar sea was head man of his village through many and prosperous years and died full of honors with his name on the lips of men  so long ago did he live that only the old men remember his name his name and the tale which they got from the old men before them and which the old men to come will tell to their children and their childrens children down to the end of time  and the winter darkness when the north gales make their long sweep across the icepack and the air is filled with flying white and no man may venture forth is the chosen time for the telling of how keesh from the poorest igloo in the village rose to power and place over them all  he was a bright boy so the tale runs healthy and strong and he had seen thirteen suns in their way of reckoning time  for each winter the sun leaves the land in darkness and the next year a new sun returns so that they may be warm again and look upon one anothers faces  the father of keesh had been a very brave man but he had met his death in a time of famine when he sought to save the lives of his people by taking the life of a great polar bear  in his eagerness he came to close grapples with the bear and his bones were crushed but the bear had much meat on him and the people were saved  keesh was his only son and after that keesh lived alone with his mother  but the people are prone to forget and they forgot the deed of his father and he being but a boy and his mother only a woman they too were swiftly forgotten and ere long came to live in the meanest of all the igloos  it was at a council one night in the big igloo of kloshkwan the chief that keesh showed the blood that ran in his veins and the manhood that stiffened his back  with the dignity of an elder he rose to his feet and waited for silence amid the babble of voices  it is true that meat be apportioned me and mine he said  but it is ofttimes old and tough this meat and moreover it has an unusual quantity of bones  the hunters grizzled and gray and lusty and young were aghast  the like had never been known before  a child that talked like a grown man and said harsh things to their very faces  but steadily and with seriousness keesh went on  for that i know my father bok was a great hunter i speak these words  it is said that bok brought home more meat than any of the two best hunters that with his own hands he attended to the division of it that with his own eyes he saw to it that the least old woman and the last old man received fair share  na na the men cried  put the child out  send him off to bed he is no man that he should talk to men and graybeards  he waited calmly till the uproar died down  thou hast a wife ughgluk he said and for her dost thou speak  and thou too massuk a mother also and for them dost thou speak  my mother has no one save me wherefore i speak  as i say though bok be dead because he hunted overkeenly it is just that i who am his son and that ikeega who is my mother and was his wife should have meat in plenty so long as there be meat in plenty in the tribe  i keesh the son of bok have spoken  he sat down his ears keenly alert to the flood of protest and indignation his words had created  that a boy should speak in council old ughgluk was mumbling  shall the babes in arms tell us men the things we shall do massuk demanded in a loud voice  am i a man that i should be made a mock by every child that cries for meat  the anger boiled a white heat  they ordered him to bed threatened that he should have no meat at all and promised him sore beatings for his presumption  keeshs eyes began to flash and the blood to pound darkly under his skin  in the midst of the abuse he sprang to his feet  hear me ye men he cried  never shall i speak in the council again never again till the men come to me and say it is well keesh that thou shouldst speak it is well and it is our wish  take this now ye men for my last word  bok my father was a great hunter  i too his son shall go and hunt the meat that i eat  and be it known now that the division of that which i kill shall be fair  and no widow nor weak one shall cry in the night because there is no meat when the strong men are groaning in great pain for that they have eaten overmuch  and in the days to come there shall be shame upon the strong men who have eaten overmuch  i keesh have said it  jeers and scornful laughter followed him out of the igloo but his jaw was set and he went his way looking neither to right nor left  the next day he went forth along the shoreline where the ice and the land met together  those who saw him go noted that he carried his bow with a goodly supply of bonebarbed arrows and that across his shoulder was his fathers big huntingspear  and there was laughter and much talk at the event  it was an unprecedented occurrence  never did boys of his tender age go forth to hunt much less to hunt alone  also were there shaking of heads and prophetic mutterings and the women looked pityingly at ikeega and her face was grave and sad  he will be back ere long they said cheeringly  let him go it will teach him a lesson the hunters said  and he will come back shortly and he will be meek and soft of speech in the days to follow  but a day passed and a second and on the third a wild gale blew and there was no keesh  ikeega tore her hair and put soot of the sealoil on her face in token of her grief and the women assailed the men with bitter words in that they had mistreated the boy and sent him to his death and the men made no answer preparing to go in search of the body when the storm abated  early next morning however keesh strode into the village  but he came not shamefacedly  across his shoulders he bore a burden of freshkilled meat  and there was importance in his step and arrogance in his speech  go ye men with the dogs and sledges and take my trail for the better part of a days travel he said  there is much meat on the icea she bear and two halfgrown cubs  ikeega was overcome with joy but he received her demonstrations in manlike fashion saying  come ikeega let us eat  and after that i shall sleep for i am weary  and he passed into their igloo and ate profoundly and after that slept for twenty running hours  there was much doubt at first much doubt and discussion  the killing of a polar bear is very dangerous but thrice dangerous is it and three times thrice to kill a mother bear with her cubs  the men could not bring themselves to believe that the boy keesh singlehanded had accomplished so great a marvel  but the women spoke of the freshkilled meat he had brought on his back and this was an overwhelming argument against their unbelief  so they finally departed grumbling greatly that in all probability if the thing were so he had neglected to cut up the carcasses  now in the north it is very necessary that this should be done as soon as a kill is made  if not the meat freezes so solidly as to turn the edge of the sharpest knife and a threehundredpound bear frozen stiff is no easy thing to put upon a sled and haul over the rough ice  but arrived at the spot they found not only the kill which they had doubted but that keesh had quartered the beasts in true hunter fashion and removed the entrails  thus began the mystery of keesh a mystery that deepened and deepened with the passing of the days  his very next trip he killed a young bear nearly fullgrown and on the trip following a large male bear and his mate  he was ordinarily gone from three to four days though it was nothing unusual for him to stay away a week at a time on the icefield always he declined company on these expeditions and the people marvelled  how does he do it they demanded of one another  never does he take a dog with him and dogs are of such great help too  why dost thou hunt only bear kloshkwan once ventured to ask him  and keesh made fitting answer  it is well known that there is more meat on the bear he said  but there was also talk of witchcraft in the village  he hunts with evil spirits some of the people contended wherefore his hunting is rewarded  how else can it be save that he hunts with evil spirits  mayhap they be not evil but good these spirits others said  it is known that his father was a mighty hunter  may not his father hunt with him so that he may attain excellence and patience and understanding  who knows  none the less his success continued and the less skilful hunters were often kept busy hauling in his meat  and in the division of it he was just  as his father had done before him he saw to it that the least old woman and the last old man received a fair portion keeping no more for himself than his needs required  and because of this and of his merit as a hunter he was looked upon with respect and even awe and there was talk of making him chief after old kloshkwan  because of the things he had done they looked for him to appear again in the council but he never came and they were ashamed to ask  i am minded to build me an igloo he said one day to kloshkwan and a number of the hunters  it shall be a large igloo wherein ikeega and i can dwell in comfort  ay they nodded gravely  but i have no time  my business is hunting and it takes all my time so it is but just that the men and women of the village who eat my meat should build me my igloo  and the igloo was built accordingly on a generous scale which exceeded even the dwelling of kloshkwan  keesh and his mother moved into it and it was the first prosperity she had enjoyed since the death of bok  nor was material prosperity alone hers for because of her wonderful son and the position he had given her she came to be looked upon as the first woman in all the village and the women were given to visiting her to asking her advice and to quoting her wisdom when arguments arose among themselves or with the men  but it was the mystery of keeshs marvellous hunting that took chief place in all their minds  and one day ughgluk taxed him with witchcraft to his face  it is charged ughgluk said ominously that thou dealest with evil spirits wherefore thy hunting is rewarded  is not the meat good keesh made answer  has one in the village yet to fall sick from the eating of it  how dost thou know that witchcraft be concerned  or dost thou guess in the dark merely because of the envy that consumes thee  and ughgluk withdrew discomfited the women laughing at him as he walked away  but in the council one night after long deliberation it was determined to put spies on his track when he went forth to hunt so that his methods might be learned  so on his next trip bim and bawn two young men and of hunters the craftiest followed after him taking care not to be seen  after five days they returned their eyes bulging and their tongues atremble to tell what they had seen  the council was hastily called in kloshkwans dwelling and bim took up the tale  brothers  as commanded we journeyed on the trail of keesh and cunningly we journeyed so that he might not know  and midway of the first day he picked up with a great hebear  it was a very great bear  none greater bawn corroborated and went on himself  yet was the bear not inclined to fight for he turned away and made off slowly over the ice  this we saw from the rocks of the shore and the bear came toward us and after him came keesh very much unafraid  and he shouted harsh words after the bear and waved his arms about and made much noise  then did the bear grow angry and rise up on his hind legs and growl  but keesh walked right up to the bear  ay bim continued the story  right up to the bear keesh walked  and the bear took after him and keesh ran away  but as he ran he dropped a little round ball on the ice  and the bear stopped and smelled of it then swallowed it up  and keesh continued to run away and drop little round balls and the bear continued to swallow them up  exclamations and cries of doubt were being made and ughgluk expressed open unbelief  with our own eyes we saw it bim affirmed  and bawnay with our own eyes  and this continued until the bear stood suddenly upright and cried aloud in pain and thrashed his fore paws madly about  and keesh continued to make off over the ice to a safe distance  but the bear gave him no notice being occupied with the misfortune the little round balls had wrought within him  ay within him bim interrupted  for he did claw at himself and leap about over the ice like a playful puppy save from the way he growled and squealed it was plain it was not play but pain  never did i see such a sight  nay never was such a sight seen bawn took up the strain  and furthermore it was such a large bear  witchcraft ughgluk suggested  i know not bawn replied  i tell only of what my eyes beheld  and after a while the bear grew weak and tired for he was very heavy and he had jumped about with exceeding violence and he went off along the shore ice shaking his head slowly from side to side and sitting down ever and again to squeal and cry  and keesh followed after the bear and we followed after keesh and for that day and three days more we followed the bear grew weak and never ceased crying from his pain  it was a charm ughgluk exclaimed  surely it was a charm  it may well be  and bim relieved bawn  the bear wandered now this way and now that doubling back and forth and crossing his trail in circles so that at the end he was near where keesh had first come upon him  by this time he was quite sick the bear and could crawl no farther so keesh came up close and speared him to death  and then kloshkwan demanded  then we left keesh skinning the bear and came running that the news of the killing might be told  and in the afternoon of that day the women hauled in the meat of the bear while the men sat in council assembled  when keesh arrived a messenger was sent to him bidding him come to the council  but he sent reply saying that he was hungry and tired also that his igloo was large and comfortable and could hold many men  and curiosity was so strong on the men that the whole council kloshkwan to the fore rose up and went to the igloo of keesh  he was eating but he received them with respect and seated them according to their rank  ikeega was proud and embarrassed by turns but keesh was quite composed  kloshkwan recited the information brought by bim and bawn and at its close said in a stern voice  so explanation is wanted o keesh of thy manner of hunting  is there witchcraft in it  keesh looked up and smiled  nay o kloshkwan  it is not for a boy to know aught of witches and of witches i know nothing  i have but devised a means whereby i may kill the icebear with ease that is all  it be headcraft not witchcraft  and may any man  any man  there was a long silence  the men looked in one anothers faces and keesh went on eating  and    and    and wilt thou tell us o keesh kloshkwan finally asked in a tremulous voice  yea i will tell thee  keesh finished sucking a marrowbone and rose to his feet  it is quite simple  behold  he picked up a thin strip of whalebone and showed it to them  the ends were sharp as needlepoints  the strip he coiled carefully till it disappeared in his hand  then suddenly releasing it it sprang straight again  he picked up a piece of blubber  so he said one takes a small chunk of blubber thus and thus makes it hollow  then into the hollow goes the whalebone so tightly coiled and another piece of blubber is fitted over the whalebone  after that it is put outside where it freezes into a little round ball  the bear swallows the little round ball the blubber melts the whalebone with its sharp ends stands out straight the bear gets sick and when the bear is very sick why you kill him with a spear  it is quite simple  and ughgluk said oh and kloshkwan said ah  and each said something after his own manner and all understood  and this is the story of keesh who lived long ago on the rim of the polar sea  because he exercised headcraft and not witchcraft he rose from the meanest igloo to be head man of his village and through all the years that he lived it is related his tribe was prosperous and neither widow nor weak one cried aloud in the night because there was no meat     the unexpected   it is a simple matter to see the obvious to do the expected  the tendency of the individual life is to be static rather than dynamic and this tendency is made into a propulsion by civilization where the obvious only is seen and the unexpected rarely happens  when the unexpected does happen however and when it is of sufficiently grave import the unfit perish  they do not see what is not obvious are unable to do the unexpected are incapable of adjusting their wellgrooved lives to other and strange grooves  in short when they come to the end of their own groove they die  on the other hand there are those that make toward survival the fit individuals who escape from the rule of the obvious and the expected and adjust their lives to no matter what strange grooves they may stray into or into which they may be forced  such an individual was edith whittlesey  she was born in a rural district of england where life proceeds by rule of thumb and the unexpected is so very unexpected that when it happens it is looked upon as an immorality  she went into service early and while yet a young woman by ruleofthumb progression she became a ladys maid  the effect of civilization is to impose human law upon environment until it becomes machinelike in its regularity  the objectionable is eliminated the inevitable is foreseen  one is not even made wet by the rain nor cold by the frost while death instead of stalking about grewsome and accidental becomes a prearranged pageant moving along a welloiled groove to the family vault where the hinges are kept from rusting and the dust from the air is swept continually away  such was the environment of edith whittlesey  nothing happened  it could scarcely be called a happening when at the age of twentyfive she accompanied her mistress on a bit of travel to the united states  the groove merely changed its direction  it was still the same groove and well oiled  it was a groove that bridged the atlantic with uneventfulness so that the ship was not a ship in the midst of the sea but a capacious manycorridored hotel that moved swiftly and placidly crushing the waves into submission with its colossal bulk until the sea was a millpond monotonous with quietude  and at the other side the groove continued on over the landa welldisposed respectable groove that supplied hotels at every stoppingplace and hotels on wheels between the stoppingplaces  in chicago while her mistress saw one side of social life edith whittlesey saw another side and when she left her ladys service and became edith nelson she betrayed perhaps faintly her ability to grapple with the unexpected and to master it  hans nelson immigrant swede by birth and carpenter by occupation had in him that teutonic unrest that drives the race ever westward on its great adventure  he was a largemuscled stolid sort of a man in whom little imagination was coupled with immense initiative and who possessed withal loyalty and affection as sturdy as his own strength  when i have worked hard and saved me some money i will go to colorado he had told edith on the day after their wedding  a year later they were in colorado where hans nelson saw his first mining and caught the mining fever himself  his prospecting led him through the dakotas idaho and eastern oregon and on into the mountains of british columbia  in camp and on trail edith nelson was always with him sharing his luck his hardship and his toil  the short step of the housereared woman she exchanged for the long stride of the mountaineer  she learned to look upon danger cleareyed and with understanding losing forever that panic fear which is bred of ignorance and which afflicts the cityreared making them as silly as silly horses so that they await fate in frozen horror instead of grappling with it or stampede in blind selfdestroying terror which clutters the way with their crushed carcasses  edith nelson met the unexpected at every turn of the trail and she trained her vision so that she saw in the landscape not the obvious but the concealed  she who had never cooked in her life learned to make bread without the mediation of hops yeast or bakingpowder and to bake bread top and bottom in a fryingpan before an open fire  and when the last cup of flour was gone and the last rind of bacon she was able to rise to the occasion and of moccasins and the softertanned bits of leather in the outfit to make a grubstake substitute that somehow held a mans soul in his body and enabled him to stagger on  she learned to pack a horse as well as a mana task to break the heart and the pride of any citydweller and she knew how to throw the hitch best suited for any particular kind of pack  also she could build a fire of wet wood in a downpour of rain and not lose her temper  in short in all its guises she mastered the unexpected  but the great unexpected was yet to come into her life and put its test upon her  the goldseeking tide was flooding northward into alaska and it was inevitable that hans nelson and his wife should he caught up by the stream and swept toward the klondike  the fall of 1897 found them at dyea but without the money to carry an outfit across chilcoot pass and float it down to dawson  so hans nelson worked at his trade that winter and helped rear the mushroom outfittingtown of skaguay  he was on the edge of things and throughout the winter he heard all alaska calling to him  latuya bay called loudest so that the summer of 1898 found him and his wife threading the mazes of the broken coastline in seventyfoot siwash canoes  with them were indians also three other men  the indians landed them and their supplies in a lonely bight of land a hundred miles or so beyond latuya bay and returned to skaguay but the three other men remained for they were members of the organized party  each had put an equal share of capital into the outfitting and the profits were to be divided equally  in that edith nelson undertook to cook for the outfit a mans share was to be her portion  first spruce trees were cut down and a threeroom cabin constructed  to keep this cabin was edith nelsons task  the task of the men was to search for gold which they did and to find gold which they likewise did  it was not a startling find merely a lowpay placer where long hours of severe toil earned each man between fifteen and twenty dollars a day  the brief alaskan summer protracted itself beyond its usual length and they took advantage of the opportunity delaying their return to skaguay to the last moment  and then it was too late  arrangements had been made to accompany the several dozen local indians on their fall trading trip down the coast  the siwashes had waited on the white people until the eleventh hour and then departed  there was no course left the party but to wait for chance transportation  in the meantime the claim was cleaned up and firewood stocked in  the indian summer had dreamed on and on and then suddenly with the sharpness of bugles winter came  it came in a single night and the miners awoke to howling wind driving snow and freezing water  storm followed storm and between the storms there was the silence broken only by the boom of the surf on the desolate shore where the salt spray rimmed the beach with frozen white  all went well in the cabin  their golddust had weighed up something like eight thousand dollars and they could not but be contented  the men made snowshoes hunted fresh meat for the larder and in the long evenings played endless games of whist and pedro  now that the mining had ceased edith nelson turned over the firebuilding and the dishwashing to the men while she darned their socks and mended their clothes  there was no grumbling no bickering nor petty quarrelling in the little cabin and they often congratulated one another on the general happiness of the party  hans nelson was stolid and easygoing while edith had long before won his unbounded admiration by her capacity for getting on with people  harkey a long lank texan was unusually friendly for one with a saturnine disposition and as long as his theory that gold grew was not challenged was quite companionable  the fourth member of the party michael dennin contributed his irish wit to the gayety of the cabin  he was a large powerful man prone to sudden rushes of anger over little things and of unfailing goodhumor under the stress and strain of big things  the fifth and last member dutchy was the willing butt of the party  he even went out of his way to raise a laugh at his own expense in order to keep things cheerful  his deliberate aim in life seemed to be that of a maker of laughter  no serious quarrel had ever vexed the serenity of the party and now that each had sixteen hundred dollars to show for a short summers work there reigned the wellfed contented spirit of prosperity  and then the unexpected happened  they had just sat down to the breakfast table  though it was already eight oclock late breakfasts had followed naturally upon cessation of the steady work at mining a candle in the neck of a bottle lighted the meal  edith and hans sat at each end of the table  on one side with their backs to the door sat harkey and dutchy  the place on the other side was vacant  dennin had not yet come in  hans nelson looked at the empty chair shook his head slowly and with a ponderous attempt at humor said  always is he first at the grub  it is very strange  maybe he is sick  where is michael edith asked  got up a little ahead of us and went outside harkey answered  dutchys face beamed mischievously  he pretended knowledge of dennins absence and affected a mysterious air while they clamored for information  edith after a peep into the mens bunkroom returned to the table  hans looked at her and she shook her head  he was never late at mealtime before she remarked  i cannot understand said hans  always has he the great appetite like the horse  it is too bad dutchy said with a sad shake of his head  they were beginning to make merry over their comrades absence  it is a great pity dutchy volunteered  what they demanded in chorus  poor michael was the mournful reply  well whats wrong with michael harkey asked  he is not hungry no more wailed dutchy  he has lost der appetite  he do not like der grub  not from the way he pitches into it up to his ears remarked harkey  he does dot shust to be politeful to mrs nelson was dutchys quick retort  i know i know and it is too pad  why is he not here  pecause he haf gone out  why haf he gone out  for der defelopment of der appetite  how does he defelop der appetite  he walks barefoots in der snow  ach dont i know  it is der way der rich peoples chases after der appetite when it is no more and is running away  michael haf sixteen hundred dollars  he is rich peoples  he haf no appetite  derefore pecause he is chasing der appetite  shust you open der door und you will see his barefoots in der snow  no you will not see der appetite dot is shust his trouble  when he sees der appetite he will catch it und come to preakfast  they burst into loud laughter at dutchys nonsense  the sound had scarcely died away when the door opened and dennin came in  all turned to look at him  he was carrying a shotgun  even as they looked he lifted it to his shoulder and fired twice  at the first shot dutchy sank upon the table overturning his mug of coffee his yellow mop of hair dabbling in his plate of mush  his forehead which pressed upon the near edge of the plate tilted the plate up against his hair at an angle of fortyfive degrees  harkey was in the air in his spring to his feet at the second shot and he pitched face down upon the floor his my god gurgling and dying in his throat  it was the unexpected  hans and edith were stunned  they sat at the table with bodies tense their eyes fixed in a fascinated gaze upon the murderer  dimly they saw him through the smoke of the powder and in the silence nothing was to be heard save the dripdrip of dutchys spilled coffee on the floor  dennin threw open the breech of the shotgun ejecting the empty shells  holding the gun with one hand he reached with the other into his pocket for fresh shells  he was thrusting the shells into the gun when edith nelson was aroused to action  it was patent that he intended to kill hans and her  for a space of possibly three seconds of time she had been dazed and paralysed by the horrible and inconceivable form in which the unexpected had made its appearance  then she rose to it and grappled with it she grappled with it concretely making a catlike leap for the murderer and gripping his neckcloth with both her hands  the impact of her body sent him stumbling backward several steps  he tried to shake her loose and still retain his hold on the gun  this was awkward for her firmfleshed body had become a cats  she threw herself to one side and with her grip at his throat nearly jerked him to the floor  he straightened himself and whirled swiftly  still faithful to her hold her body followed the circle of his whirl so that her feet left the floor and she swung through the air fastened to his throat by her hands  the whirl culminated in a collision with a chair and the man and woman crashed to the floor in a wild struggling fall that extended itself across half the length of the room  hans nelson was half a second behind his wife in rising to the unexpected  his nerve processed and mental processes were slower than hers  his was the grosser organism and it had taken him half a second longer to perceive and determine and proceed to do  she had already flown at dennin and gripped his throat when hans sprang to his feet  but her coolness was not his  he was in a blind fury a berserker rage  at the instant he sprang from his chair his mouth opened and there issued forth a sound that was half roar half bellow  the whirl of the two bodies had already started and still roaring or bellowing he pursued this whirl down the room overtaking it when it fell to the floor  hans hurled himself upon the prostrate man striking madly with his fists  they were sledgelike blows and when edith felt dennins body relax she loosed her grip and rolled clear  she lay on the floor panting and watching  the fury of blows continued to rain down  dennin did not seem to mind the blows  he did not even move  then it dawned upon her that he was unconscious  she cried out to hans to stop  she cried out again  but he paid no heed to her voice  she caught him by the arm but her clinging to it merely impeded his effort  it was no reasoned impulse that stirred her to do what she then did  nor was it a sense of pity nor obedience to the thou shalt not of religion  rather was it some sense of law an ethic of her race and early environment that compelled her to interpose her body between her husband and the helpless murderer  it was not until hans knew he was striking his wife that he ceased  he allowed himself to be shoved away by her in much the same way that a ferocious but obedient dog allows itself to be shoved away by its master  the analogy went even farther deep in his throat in an animallike way hanss rage still rumbled and several times he made as though to spring back upon his prey and was only prevented by the womans swiftly interposed body  back and farther back edith shoved her husband  she had never seen him in such a condition and she was more frightened of him than she had been of dennin in the thick of the struggle  she could not believe that this raging beast was her hans and with a shock she became suddenly aware of a shrinking instinctive fear that he might snap her hand in his teeth like any wild animal  for some seconds unwilling to hurt her yet dogged in his desire to return to the attack hans dodged back and forth but she resolutely dodged with him until the first glimmerings of reason returned and he gave over  both crawled to their feet  hans staggered back against the wall where he leaned his face working in his throat the deep and continuous rumble that died away with the seconds and at last ceased  the time for the reaction had come  edith stood in the middle of the floor wringing her hands panting and gasping her whole body trembling violently  hans looked at nothing but ediths eyes wandered wildly from detail to detail of what had taken place  dennin lay without movement  the overturned chair hurled onward in the mad whirl lay near him  partly under him lay the shotgun still broken open at the breech  spilling out of his right hand were the two cartridges which he had failed to put into the gun and which he had clutched until consciousness left him harkey lay on the floor face downward where he had fallen while dutchy rested forward on the table his yellow mop of hair buried in his mush plate the plate itself still tilted at an angle of fortyfive degrees this tilted plate fascinated her  why did it not fall down  it was ridiculous  it was not in the nature of things for a mushplate to up end itself on the table even if a man or so had been killed  she glanced back at dennin but her eyes returned to the tilted plate  it was so ridiculous  she felt a hysterical impulse to laugh  then she noticed the silence and forgot the plate in a desire for something to happen  the monotonous drip of the coffee from the table to the floor merely emphasized the silence  why did not hans do something say something  she looked at him and was about to speak when she discovered that her tongue refused its wonted duty  there was a peculiar ache in her throat and her mouth was dry and furry  she could only look at hans who in turn looked at her  suddenly the silence was broken by a sharp metallic clang  she screamed jerking her eyes back to the table  the plate had fallen down hans sighed as though awakening from sleep  the clang of the plate had aroused them to life in a new world  the cabin epitomized the new world in which they must thenceforth live and move  the old cabin was gone forever  the horizon of life was totally new and unfamiliar  the unexpected had swept its wizardry over the face of things changing the perspective juggling values and shuffling the real and the unreal into perplexing confusion  my god hans was ediths first speech  he did not answer but stared at her with horror  slowly his eyes wandered over the room for the first time taking in its details  then he put on his cap and started for the door  where are you going edith demanded in an agony of apprehension  his hand was on the doorknob and he half turned as he answered to dig some graves  dont leave me hans with her eyes swept the roomwith this  the graves must be dug sometime he said  but you do not know how many she objected desperately  she noted his indecision and added besides ill go with you and help  hans stepped back to the table and mechanically snuffed the candle  then between them they made the examination  both harkey and dutchy were deadfrightfully dead because of the close range of the shotgun  hans refused to go near dennin and edith was forced to conduct this portion of the investigation by herself  he isnt dead she called to hans  he walked over and looked down at the murderer  what did you say edith demanded having caught the rumble of inarticulate speech in her husbands throat  i said it was a damn shame that he isnt dead came the reply  edith was bending over the body  leave him alone hans commanded harshly in a strange voice  she looked at him in sudden alarm  he had picked up the shotgun dropped by dennin and was thrusting in the shells  what are you going to do she cried rising swiftly from her bending position  hans did not answer but she saw the shotgun going to his shoulder  she grasped the muzzle with her hand and threw it up  leave me alone he cried hoarsely  he tried to jerk the weapon away from her but she came in closer and clung to him  hans  hans  wake up she cried  dont be crazy  he killed dutchy and harkey was her husbands reply and i am going to kill him  but that is wrong she objected  there is the law  he sneered his incredulity of the laws potency in such a region but he merely iterated dispassionately doggedly he killed dutchy and harkey  long she argued it with him but the argument was onesided for he contented himself with repeating again and again he killed dutchy and harkey  but she could not escape from her childhood training nor from the blood that was in her  the heritage of law was hers and right conduct to her was the fulfilment of the law  she could see no other righteous course to pursue  hanss taking the law in his own hands was no more justifiable than dennins deed  two wrongs did not make a right she contended and there was only one way to punish dennin and that was the legal way arranged by society  at last hans gave in to her  all right he said  have it your own way  and tomorrow or next day look to see him kill you and me  she shook her head and held out her hand for the shotgun  he started to hand it to her then hesitated  better let me shoot him he pleaded  again she shook her head and again he started to pass her the gun when the door opened and an indian without knocking came in  a blast of wind and flurry of snow came in with him  they turned and faced him hans still holding the shotgun  the intruder took in the scene without a quiver  his eyes embraced the dead and wounded in a sweeping glance no surprise showed in his face not even curiosity  harkey lay at his feet but he took no notice of him  so far as he was concerned harkeys body did not exist  much wind the indian remarked by way of salutation  all well  very well  hans still grasping the gun felt sure that the indian attributed to him the mangled corpses  he glanced appealingly at his wife  good morning negook she said her voice betraying her effort  no not very well  much trouble  goodby i go now much hurry the indian said and without semblance of haste with great deliberation stepping clear of a red pool on the floor he opened the door and went out  the man and woman looked at each other  he thinks we did it hans gasped that i did it  edith was silent for a space  then she said briefly in a businesslike way  never mind what he thinks  that will come after  at present we have two graves to dig  but first of all weve got to tie up dennin so he cant escape  hans refused to touch dennin but edith lashed him securely hand and foot  then she and hans went out into the snow  the ground was frozen it was impervious to a blow of the pick  they first gathered wood then scraped the snow away and on the frozen surface built a fire  when the fire had burned for an hour several inches of dirt had thawed  this they shovelled out and then built a fresh fire  their descent into the earth progressed at the rate of two or three inches an hour  it was hard and bitter work  the flurrying snow did not permit the fire to burn any too well while the wind cut through their clothes and chilled their bodies  they held but little conversation  the wind interfered with speech  beyond wondering at what could have been dennins motive they remained silent oppressed by the horror of the tragedy  at one oclock looking toward the cabin hans announced that he was hungry  no not now hans edith answered  i couldnt go back alone into that cabin the way it is and cook a meal  at two oclock hans volunteered to go with her but she held him to his work and four oclock found the two graves completed  they were shallow not more than two feet deep but they would serve the purpose night had fallen  hans got the sled and the two dead men were dragged through the darkness and storm to their frozen sepulchre  the funeral procession was anything but a pageant  the sled sank deep into the drifted snow and pulled hard  the man and the woman had eaten nothing since the previous day and were weak from hunger and exhaustion  they had not the strength to resist the wind and at times its buffets hurled them off their feet  on several occasions the sled was overturned and they were compelled to reload it with its sombre freight  the last hundred feet to the graves was up a steep slope and this they took on all fours like sleddogs making legs of their arms and thrusting their hands into the snow  even so they were twice dragged backward by the weight of the sled and slid and fell down the hill the living and the dead the haulropes and the sled in ghastly entanglement  tomorrow i will put up headboards with their names hans said when the graves were filled in  edith was sobbing  a few broken sentences had been all she was capable of in the way of a funeral service and now her husband was compelled to halfcarry her back to the cabin  dennin was conscious  he had rolled over and over on the floor in vain efforts to free himself  he watched hans and edith with glittering eyes but made no attempt to speak  hans still refused to touch the murderer and sullenly watched edith drag him across the floor to the mens bunk room  but try as she would she could not lift him from the floor into his bunk  better let me shoot him and well have no more trouble hans said in final appeal  edith shook her head and bent again to her task  to her surprise the body rose easily and she knew hans had relented and was helping her then came the cleansing of the kitchen  but the floor still shrieked the tragedy until hans planed the surface of the stained wood away and with the shavings made a fire in the stove  the days came and went  there was much of darkness and silence broken only by the storms and the thunder on the beach of the freezing surf hans was obedient to ediths slightest order  all his splendid initiative had vanished  she had elected to deal with dennin in her way and so he left the whole matter in her hands  the murderer was a constant menace  at all times there was the chance that he might free himself from his bonds and they were compelled to guard him day and night  the man or the woman sat always beside him holding the loaded shotgun  at first edith tried eighthour watches but the continuous strain was too great and afterwards she and hans relieved each other every four hours  as they had to sleep and as the watches extended through the night their whole waking time was expended in guarding dennin  they had barely time left over for the preparation of meals and the getting of firewood  since negooks inopportune visit the indians had avoided the cabin edith sent hans to their cabins to get them to take dennin down the coast in a canoe to the nearest white settlement or trading post but the errand was fruitless  then edith went herself and interviewed negook  he was head man of the little village keenly aware of his responsibility and he elucidated his policy thoroughly in few words  it is white mans trouble he said not siwash trouble  my people help you then will it be siwash trouble too  when white mans trouble and siwash trouble come together and make a trouble it is a great trouble beyond understanding and without end  trouble no good  my people do no wrong  what for they help you and have trouble  so edith nelson went back to the terrible cabin with its endless alternating fourhour watches  sometimes when it was her turn and she sat by the prisoner the loaded shotgun in her lap her eyes would close and she would doze  always she aroused with a start snatching up the gun and swiftly looking at him  these were distinct nervous shocks and their effect was not good on her  such was her fear of the man that even though she were wide awake if he moved under the bedclothes she could not repress the start and the quick reach for the gun  she was preparing herself for a nervous breakdown and she knew it first came a fluttering of the eyeballs so that she was compelled to close her eyes for relief  a little later the eyelids were afflicted by a nervous twitching that she could not control  to add to the strain she could not forget the tragedy  she remained as close to the horror as on the first morning when the unexpected stalked into the cabin and took possession  in her daily ministrations upon the prisoner she was forced to grit her teeth and steel herself body and spirit  hans was affected differently  he became obsessed by the idea that it was his duty to kill dennin and whenever he waited upon the bound man or watched by him edith was troubled by the fear that hans would add another red entry to the cabins record  always he cursed dennin savagely and handled him roughly  hans tried to conceal his homicidal mania and he would say to his wife  by and by you will want me to kill him and then i will not kill him  it would make me sick  but more than once stealing into the room when it was her watch off she would catch the two men glaring ferociously at each other wild animals the pair of them in hanss face the lust to kill in dennins the fierceness and savagery of the cornered rat  hans she would cry wake up and he would come to a recollection of himself startled and shamefaced and unrepentant  so hans became another factor in the problem the unexpected had given edith nelson to solve  at first it had been merely a question of right conduct in dealing with dennin and right conduct as she conceived it lay in keeping him a prisoner until he could be turned over for trial before a proper tribunal  but now entered hans and she saw that his sanity and his salvation were involved  nor was she long in discovering that her own strength and endurance had become part of the problem  she was breaking down under the strain  her left arm had developed involuntary jerkings and twitchings  she spilled her food from her spoon and could place no reliance in her afflicted arm  she judged it to be a form of st vituss dance and she feared the extent to which its ravages might go  what if she broke down  and the vision she had of the possible future when the cabin might contain only dennin and hans was an added horror  after the third day dennin had begun to talk  his first question had been what are you going to do with me and this question he repeated daily and many times a day  and always edith replied that he would assuredly be dealt with according to law  in turn she put a daily question to himwhy did you do it  to this he never replied  also he received the question with outbursts of anger raging and straining at the rawhide that bound him and threatening her with what he would do when he got loose which he said he was sure to do sooner or later  at such times she cocked both triggers of the gun prepared to meet him with leaden death if he should burst loose herself trembling and palpitating and dizzy from the tension and shock  but in time dennin grew more tractable  it seemed to her that he was growing weary of his unchanging recumbent position  he began to beg and plead to be released  he made wild promises  he would do them no harm he would himself go down the coast and give himself up to the officers of the law  he would give them his share of the gold  he would go away into the heart of the wilderness and never again appear in civilization he would take his own life if she would only free him  his pleadings usually culminated in involuntary raving until it seemed to her that he was passing into a fit but always she shook her head and denied him the freedom for which he worked himself into a passion  but the weeks went by and he continued to grow more tractable  and through it all the weariness was asserting itself more and more  i am so tired so tired he would murmur rolling his head back and forth on the pillow like a peevish child  at a little later period he began to make impassioned pleas for death to beg her to kill him to beg hans to put him our of his misery so that he might at least rest comfortably  the situation was fast becoming impossible  ediths nervousness was increasing and she knew her breakdown might come any time  she could not even get her proper rest for she was haunted by the fear that hans would yield to his mania and kill dennin while she slept  though january had already come months would have to elapse before any trading schooner was even likely to put into the bay  also they had not expected to winter in the cabin and the food was running low nor could hans add to the supply by hunting  they were chained to the cabin by the necessity of guarding their prisoner  something must be done and she knew it  she forced herself to go back into a reconsideration of the problem  she could not shake off the legacy of her race the law that was of her blood and that had been trained into her  she knew that whatever she did she must do according to the law and in the long hours of watching the shotgun on her knees the murderer restless beside her and the storms thundering without she made original sociological researches and worked out for herself the evolution of the law  it came to her that the law was nothing more than the judgment and the will of any group of people  it mattered not how large was the group of people  there were little groups she reasoned like switzerland and there were big groups like the united states  also she reasoned it did not matter how small was the group of people  there might be only ten thousand people in a country yet their collective judgment and will would be the law of that country  why then could not one thousand people constitute such a group she asked herself  and if one thousand why not one hundred  why not fifty  why not five  why nottwo  she was frightened at her own conclusion and she talked it over with hans  at first he could not comprehend and then when he did he added convincing evidence  he spoke of miners meetings where all the men of a locality came together and made the law and executed the law  there might be only ten or fifteen men altogether he said but the will of the majority became the law for the whole ten or fifteen and whoever violated that will was punished  edith saw her way clear at last  dennin must hang  hans agreed with her  between them they constituted the majority of this particular group  it was the groupwill that dennin should be hanged  in the execution of this will edith strove earnestly to observe the customary forms but the group was so small that hans and she had to serve as witnesses as jury and as judgesalso as executioners  she formally charged michael dennin with the murder of dutchy and harkey and the prisoner lay in his bunk and listened to the testimony first of hans and then of edith  he refused to plead guilty or not guilty and remained silent when she asked him if he had anything to say in his own defence  she and hans without leaving their seats brought in the jurys verdict of guilty  then as judge she imposed the sentence  her voice shook her eyelids twitched her left arm jerked but she carried it out  michael dennin in three days time you are to be hanged by the neck until you are dead  such was the sentence  the man breathed an unconscious sigh of relief then laughed defiantly and said thin im thinkin the damn bunk wont be achin me back anny more an thats a consolation  with the passing of the sentence a feeling of relief seemed to communicate itself to all of them  especially was it noticeable in dennin  all sullenness and defiance disappeared and he talked sociably with his captors and even with flashes of his oldtime wit  also he found great satisfaction in ediths reading to him from the bible  she read from the new testament and he took keen interest in the prodigal son and the thief on the cross  on the day preceding that set for the execution when edith asked her usual question why did you do it dennin answered tis very simple i was thinkin  but she hushed him abruptly asked him to wait and hurried to hanss bedside  it was his watch off and he came out of his sleep rubbing his eyes and grumbling  go she told him and bring up negook and one other indian  michaels going to confess  make them come  take the rifle along and bring them up at the point of it if you have to  half an hour later negook and his uncle hadikwan were ushered into the death chamber  they came unwillingly hans with his rifle herding them along  negook edith said there is to be no trouble for you and your people only is it for you to sit and do nothing but listen and understand  thus did michael dennin under sentence of death make public confession of his crime  as he talked edith wrote his story down while the indians listened and hans guarded the door for fear the witnesses might bolt  he had not been home to the old country for fifteen years dennin explained and it had always been his intention to return with plenty of money and make his old mother comfortable for the rest of her days  an how was i to be doin it on sixteen hundred he demanded  what i was after wantin was all the goold the whole eight thousan  thin i cud go back in style  what ud be aisier thinks i to myself than to kill all iv yez report it at skaguay for an indiankillin an thin pull out for ireland  an so i started in to kill all iv yez but as harkey was fond of sayin i cut out too large a chunk an fell down on the swallowin iv it  an thats me confession  i did me duty to the devil an now god willin ill do me duty to god  negook and hadikwan you have heard the white mans words edith said to the indians  his words are here on this paper and it is for you to make a sign thus on the paper so that white men to come after will know that you have heard  the two siwashes put crosses opposite their signatures received a summons to appear on the morrow with all their tribe for a further witnessing of things and were allowed to go  dennins hands were released long enough for him to sign the document then a silence fell in the room  hans was restless and edith felt uncomfortable  dennin lay on his back staring straight up at the moss chinked roof  an now ill do me duty to god he murmured  he turned his head toward edith  read to me he said from the book then added with a glint of playfulness mayhap twill help me to forget the bunk  the day of the execution broke clear and cold  the thermometer was down to twentyfive below zero and a chill wind was blowing which drove the frost through clothes and flesh to the bones  for the first time in many weeks dennin stood upon his feet  his muscles had remained inactive so long and he was so out of practice in maintaining an erect position that he could scarcely stand  he reeled back and forth staggered and clutched hold of edith with his bound hands for support  sure an its dizzy i am he laughed weakly  a moment later he said an its glad i am that its over with  that damn bunk would iv been the death iv me i know  when edith put his fur cap on his head and proceeded to pull the flaps down over his ears he laughed and said  what are you doin that for  its freezing cold outside she answered  an in tin minutes time whatll matter a frozen ear or so to poor michael dennin he asked  she had nerved herself for the last culminating ordeal and his remark was like a blow to her selfpossession  so far everything had seemed phantomlike as in a dream but the brutal truth of what he had said shocked her eyes wide open to the reality of what was taking place  nor was her distress unnoticed by the irishman  im sorry to be troublin you with me foolish spache he said regretfully  i mint nothin by it  tis a great day for michael dennin an hes as gay as a lark  he broke out in a merry whistle which quickly became lugubrious and ceased  im wishin there was a priest he said wistfully then added swiftly but michael dennins too old a campaigner to miss the luxuries when he hits the trail  he was so very weak and unused to walking that when the door opened and he passed outside the wind nearly carried him off his feet  edith and hans walked on either side of him and supported him the while he cracked jokes and tried to keep them cheerful breaking off once long enough to arrange the forwarding of his share of the gold to his mother in ireland  they climbed a slight hill and came out into an open space among the trees  here circled solemnly about a barrel that stood on end in the snow were negook and hadikwan and all the siwashes down to the babies and the dogs come to see the way of the white mans law  near by was an open grave which hans had burned into the frozen earth  dennin cast a practical eye over the preparations noting the grave the barrel the thickness of the rope and the diameter of the limb over which the rope was passed  sure an i couldnt iv done better meself hans if itd been for you  he laughed loudly at his own sally but hanss face was frozen into a sullen ghastliness that nothing less than the trump of doom could have broken  also hans was feeling very sick  he had not realized the enormousness of the task of putting a fellowman out of the world  edith on the other hand had realized but the realization did not make the task any easier  she was filled with doubt as to whether she could hold herself together long enough to finish it  she felt incessant impulses to scream to shriek to collapse into the snow to put her hands over her eyes and turn and run blindly away into the forest anywhere away it was only by a supreme effort of soul that she was able to keep upright and go on and do what she had to do  and in the midst of it all she was grateful to dennin for the way he helped her  lind me a hand he said to hans with whose assistance he managed to mount the barrel  he bent over so that edith could adjust the rope about his neck  then he stood upright while hans drew the rope taut across the overhead branch  michael dennin have you anything to say edith asked in a clear voice that shook in spite of her  dennin shuffled his feet on the barrel looked down bashfully like a man making his maiden speech and cleared his throat  im glad its over with he said  youve treated me like a christian an im thankin you hearty for your kindness  then may god receive you a repentant sinner she said  ay he answered his deep voice as a response to her thin one may god receive me a repentant sinner  goodby michael she cried and her voice sounded desperate  she threw her weight against the barrel but it did not overturn  hans  quick  help me she cried faintly  she could feel her last strength going and the barrel resisted her  hans hurried to her and the barrel went out from under michael dennin  she turned her back thrusting her fingers into her ears  then she began to laugh harshly sharply metallically and hans was shocked as he had not been shocked through the whole tragedy  edith nelsons breakdown had come  even in her hysteria she knew it and she was glad that she had been able to hold up under the strain until everything had been accomplished  she reeled toward hans  take me to the cabin hans she managed to articulate  and let me rest she added  just let me rest and rest and rest  with hanss arm around her supporting her weight and directing her helpless steps she went off across the snow  but the indians remained solemnly to watch the working of the white mans law that compelled a man to dance upon the air     brown wolf   she had delayed because of the dewwet grass in order to put on her overshoes and when she emerged from the house found her waiting husband absorbed in the wonder of a bursting almondbud  she sent a questing glance across the tall grass and in and out among the orchard trees  wheres wolf she asked  he was here a moment ago  walt irvine drew himself away with a jerk from the metaphysics and poetry of the organic miracle of blossom and surveyed the landscape  he was running a rabbit the last i saw of him  wolf  wolf  here wolf she called as they left the clearing and took the trail that led down through the waxenbelled manzanita jungle to the county road  irvine thrust between his lips the little finger of each hand and lent to her efforts a shrill whistling  she covered her ears hastily and made a wry grimace  my for a poet delicately attuned and all the rest of it you can make unlovely noises  my eardrums are pierced  you outwhistle  orpheus  i was about to say a streetarab she concluded severely  poesy does not prevent one from being practicalat least it doesnt prevent me  mine is no futility of genius that cant sell gems to the magazines  he assumed a mock extravagance and went on  i am no attic singer no ballroom warbler  and why  because i am practical  mine is no squalor of song that cannot transmute itself with proper exchange value into a flowercrowned cottage a sweet mountain meadow a grove of redwoods an orchard of thirtyseven trees one long row of blackberries and two short rows of strawberries to say nothing of a quarter of a mile of gurgling brook  i am a beautymerchant a trader in song and i pursue utility dear madge  i sing a song and thanks to the magazine editors i transmute my song into a waft of the west wind sighing through our redwoods into a murmur of waters over mossy stones that sings back to me another song than the one i sang and yet the same song wonderfullyertransmuted  o that all your songtransmutations were as successful she laughed  name one that wasnt  those two beautiful sonnets that you transmuted into the cow that was accounted the worst milker in the township  she was beautiful he began  but she didnt give milk madge interrupted  but she was beautiful now wasnt she he insisted  and heres where beauty and utility fall out was her reply  and theres the wolf  from the thicketcovered hillside came a crashing of underbrush and then forty feet above them on the edge of the sheer wall of rock appeared a wolfs head and shoulders  his braced fore paws dislodged a pebble and with sharppricked ears and peering eyes he watched the fall of the pebble till it struck at their feet  then he transferred his gaze and with open mouth laughed down at them  you wolf you and you blessed wolf the man and woman called out to him  the ears flattened back and down at the sound and the head seemed to snuggle under the caress of an invisible hand  they watched him scramble backward into the thicket then proceeded on their way  several minutes later rounding a turn in the trail where the descent was less precipitous he joined them in the midst of a miniature avalanche of pebbles and loose soil  he was not demonstrative  a pat and a rub around the ears from the man and a more prolonged caressing from the woman and he was away down the trail in front of them gliding effortlessly over the ground in true wolf fashion  in build and coat and brush he was a huge timberwolf but the lie was given to his wolfhood by his color and marking  there the dog unmistakably advertised itself  no wolf was ever colored like him  he was brown deep brown redbrown an orgy of browns  back and shoulders were a warm brown that paled on the sides and underneath to a yellow that was dingy because of the brown that lingered in it  the white of the throat and paws and the spots over the eyes was dirty because of the persistent and ineradicable brown while the eyes themselves were twin topazes golden and brown  the man and woman loved the dog very much perhaps this was because it had been such a task to win his love  it had been no easy matter when he first drifted in mysteriously out of nowhere to their little mountain cottage  footsore and famished he had killed a rabbit under their very noses and under their very windows and then crawled away and slept by the spring at the foot of the blackberry bushes  when walt irvine went down to inspect the intruder he was snarled at for his pains and madge likewise was snarled at when she went down to present as a peaceoffering a large pan of bread and milk  a most unsociable dog he proved to be resenting all their advances refusing to let them lay hands on him menacing them with bared fangs and bristling hair  nevertheless he remained sleeping and resting by the spring and eating the food they gave him after they set it down at a safe distance and retreated  his wretched physical condition explained why he lingered and when he had recuperated after several days sojourn he disappeared  and this would have been the end of him so far as irvine and his wife were concerned had not irvine at that particular time been called away into the northern part of the state  riding along on the train near to the line between california and oregon he chanced to look out of the window and saw his unsociable guest sliding along the wagon road brown and wolfish tired yet tireless dustcovered and soiled with two hundred miles of travel  now irvine was a man of impulse a poet  he got off the train at the next station bought a piece of meat at a butcher shop and captured the vagrant on the outskirts of the town  the return trip was made in the baggage car and so wolf came a second time to the mountain cottage  here he was tied up for a week and made love to by the man and woman  but it was very circumspect lovemaking  remote and alien as a traveller from another planet he snarled down their softspoken lovewords  he never barked  in all the time they had him he was never known to bark  to win him became a problem  irvine liked problems  he had a metal plate made on which was stamped  return to walt irvine glen ellen sonoma county california  this was riveted to a collar and strapped about the dogs neck  then he was turned loose and promptly he disappeared  a day later came a telegram from mendocino county  in twenty hours he had made over a hundred miles to the north and was still going when captured  he came back by wells fargo express was tied up three days and was loosed on the fourth and lost  this time he gained southern oregon before he was caught and returned  always as soon as he received his liberty he fled away and always he fled north  he was possessed of an obsession that drove him north  the homing instinct irvine called it after he had expended the selling price of a sonnet in getting the animal back from northern oregon  another time the brown wanderer succeeded in traversing half the length of california all of oregon and most of washington before he was picked up and returned collect  a remarkable thing was the speed with which he travelled  fed up and rested as soon as he was loosed he devoted all his energy to getting over the ground  on the first days run he was known to cover as high as a hundred and fifty miles and after that he would average a hundred miles a day until caught  he always arrived back lean and hungry and savage and always departed fresh and vigorous cleaving his way northward in response to some prompting of his being that no one could understand  but at last after a futile year of flight he accepted the inevitable and elected to remain at the cottage where first he had killed the rabbit and slept by the spring  even after that a long time elapsed before the man and woman succeeded in patting him  it was a great victory for they alone were allowed to put hands on him  he was fastidiously exclusive and no guest at the cottage ever succeeded in making up to him  a low growl greeted such approach if any one had the hardihood to come nearer the lips lifted the naked fangs appeared and the growl became a snarla snarl so terrible and malignant that it awed the stoutest of them as it likewise awed the farmers dogs that knew ordinary dogsnarling but had never seen wolfsnarling before  he was without antecedents  his history began with walt and madge  he had come up from the south but never a clew did they get of the owner from whom he had evidently fled  mrs johnson their nearest neighbor and the one who supplied them with milk proclaimed him a klondike dog her brother was burrowing for frozen paystreaks in that far country and so she constituted herself an authority on the subject  but they did not dispute her  there were the tips of wolfs ears obviously so severely frozen at some time that they would never quite heal again  besides he looked like the photographs of the alaskan dogs they saw published in magazines and newspapers  they often speculated over his past and tried to conjure up from what they had read and heard what his northland life had been  that the northland still drew him they knew for at night they sometimes heard him crying softly and when the north wind blew and the bite of frost was in the air a great restlessness would come upon him and he would lift a mournful lament which they knew to be the long wolfhowl  yet he never barked  no provocation was great enough to draw from him that canine cry  long discussion they had during the time of winning him as to whose dog he was  each claimed him and each proclaimed loudly any expression of affection made by him  but the man had the better of it at first chiefly because he was a man  it was patent that wolf had had no experience with women  he did not understand women  madges skirts were something he never quite accepted  the swish of them was enough to set him abristle with suspicion and on a windy day she could not approach him at all  on the other hand it was madge who fed him also it was she who ruled the kitchen and it was by her favor and her favor alone that he was permitted to come within that sacred precinct  it was because of these things that she bade fair to overcome the handicap of her garments  then it was that walt put forth special effort making it a practice to have wolf lie at his feet while he wrote and between petting and talking losing much time from his work  walt won in the end and his victory was most probably due to the fact that he was a man though madge averred that they would have had another quarter of a mile of gurgling brook and at least two west winds sighing through their redwoods had wait properly devoted his energies to songtransmutation and left wolf alone to exercise a natural taste and an unbiassed judgment  its about time i heard from those triolets walt said after a silence of five minutes during which they had swung steadily down the trail therell be a check at the postoffice i know and well transmute it into beautiful buckwheat flour a gallon of maple syrup and a new pair of overshoes for you  and into beautiful milk from mrs johnsons beautiful cow madge added tomorrows the first of the month you know  walt scowled unconsciously then his face brightened and he clapped his hand to his breast pocket  never mind  i have here a nice beautiful new cow the best milker in california  when did you write it she demanded eagerly  then reproachfully and you never showed it to me  i saved it to read to you on the way to the postoffice in a spot remarkably like this one he answered indicating with a wave of his hand a dry log on which to sit  a tiny stream flowed out of a dense fernbrake slipped down a mossylipped stone and ran across the path at their feet  from the valley arose the mellow song of meadowlarks while about them in and out through sunshine and shadow fluttered great yellow butterflies  up from below came another sound that broke in upon walt reading softly from his manuscript  it was a crunching of heavy feet punctuated now and again by the clattering of a displaced stone  as walt finished and looked to his wife for approval a man came into view around the turn of the trail  he was bareheaded and sweaty  with a handkerchief in one hand he mopped his face while in the other hand he carried a new hat and a wilted starched collar which he had removed from his neck  he was a wellbuilt man and his muscles seemed on the point of bursting out of the painfully new and readymade black clothes he wore  warm day walt greeted him  walt believed in country democracy and never missed an opportunity to practise it  the man paused and nodded  i guess i aint used much to the warm he vouchsafed half apologetically  im more accustomed to zero weather  you dont find any of that in this country walt laughed  should say not the man answered  an i aint here alookin for it neither  im tryin to find my sister  mebbe you know where she lives her names johnson mrs william johnson  youre not her klondike brother madge cried her eyes bright with interest about whom weve heard so much  yesm thats me he answered modestly  my names miller skiff miller  i just thought id sprise her  you are on the right track then  only youve come by the footpath madge stood up to direct him pointing up the canyon a quarter of a mile you see that blasted redwood  take the little trail turning off to the right  its the short cut to her house  you cant miss it  yesm thank you maam he said  he made tentative efforts to go but seemed awkwardly rooted to the spot  he was gazing at her with an open admiration of which he was quite unconscious and which was drowning along with him in the rising sea of embarrassment in which he floundered  wed like to hear you tell about the klondike madge said  maynt we come over some day while you are at your sisters  or better yet wont you come over and have dinner with us  yesm thank you maam he mumbled mechanically  then he caught himself up and added  i aint stoppin long  i got to be pullin north again  i go out on tonights train  you see ive got a mail contract with the government  when madge had said that it was too bad he made another futile effort to go  but he could not take his eyes from her face  he forgot his embarrassment in his admiration and it was her turn to flush and feel uncomfortable  it was at this juncture when walt had just decided it was time for him to be saying something to relieve the strain that wolf who had been away nosing through the brush trotted wolflike into view  skiff millers abstraction disappeared  the pretty woman before him passed out of his field of vision  he had eyes only for the dog and a great wonder came into his face  well ill be damned he enunciated slowly and solemnly  he sat down ponderingly on the log leaving madge standing  at the sound of his voice wolfs ears had flattened down then his mouth had opened in a laugh  he trotted slowly up to the stranger and first smelled his hands then licked them with his tongue  skiff miller patted the dogs head and slowly and solemnly repeated well ill be damned  excuse me maam he said the next moment i was just sprised some that was all  were surprised too she answered lightly  we never saw wolf make up to a stranger before  is that what you call himwolf the man asked  madge nodded  but i cant understand his friendliness toward youunless its because youre from the klondike  hes a klondike dog you know  yesm miller said absently  he lifted one of wolfs fore legs and examined the footpads pressing them and denting them with his thumb kind of soft he remarked  he aint been on trail for a long time  i say walt broke in it is remarkable the way he lets you handle him  skiff miller arose no longer awkward with admiration of madge and in a sharp businesslike manner asked how long have you had him  but just then the dog squirming and rubbing against the newcomers legs opened his mouth and barked  it was an explosive bark brief and joyous but a bark  thats a new one on me skiff miller remarked  walt and madge stared at each other  the miracle had happened  wolf had barked  its the first time he ever barked madge said  first time i ever heard him too miller volunteered  madge smiled at him  the man was evidently a humorist  of course she said since you have only seen him for five minutes  skiff miller looked at her sharply seeking in her face the guile her words had led him to suspect  i thought you understood he said slowly  i thought youd tumbled to it from his makin up to me  hes my dog  his name aint wolf  its brown  oh walt was madges instinctive cry to her husband  walt was on the defensive at once  how do you know hes your dog he demanded  because he is was the reply  mere assertion walt said sharply  in his slow and pondering way skiff miller looked at him then asked with a nod of his head toward madge  how dyou know shes your wife  you just say because she is and ill say its mere assertion  the dogs mine  i bred m an raised m an i guess i ought to know  look here  ill prove it to you  skiff miller turned to the dog  brown  his voice rang out sharply and at the sound the dogs ears flattened down as to a caress  gee the dog made a swinging turn to the right  now mushon  and the dog ceased his swing abruptly and started straight ahead halting obediently at command  i can do it with whistles skiff miller said proudly  he was my lead dog  but you are not going to take him away with you madge asked tremulously  the man nodded  back into that awful klondike world of suffering  he nodded and added  oh it aint so bad as all that  look at me pretty healthy specimen aint i  but the dogs  the terrible hardship the heartbreaking toil the starvation the frost  oh ive read about it and i know  i nearly ate him once over on little fish river miller volunteered grimly  if i hadnt got a moose that day was all that saved m  id have died first madge cried  things is different down here miller explained  you dont have to eat dogs  you think different just about the time youre all in  youve never ben all in so you dont know anything about it  thats the very point she argued warmly  dogs are not eaten in california  why not leave him here  he is happy  hell never want for foodyou know that  hell never suffer from cold and hardship  here all is softness and gentleness  neither the human nor nature is savage he will never know a whiplash again  and as for the weatherwhy it never snows here  but its allfired hot in summer beggin your pardon skiff miller laughed  but you do not answer madge continued passionately  what have you to offer him in that northland life  grub when ive got it and thats most of the time came the answer  and the rest of the time  no grub  and the work  yes plenty of work miller blurted out impatiently  work without end an famine an frost an all the rest of the miseriesthats what hell get when he comes with me  but he likes it  he is used to it  he knows that life  he was born to it an brought up to it  an you dont know anything about it  you dont know what youre talking about  thats where the dog belongs and thats where hell be happiest  the dog doesnt go walt announced in a determined voice  so there is no need of further discussion  whats that skiff miller demanded his brows lowering and an obstinate flush of blood reddening his forehead  i said the dog doesnt go and that settles it  i dont believe hes your dog  you may have seen him sometime  you may even sometime have driven him for his owner  but his obeying the ordinary driving commands of the alaskan trail is no demonstration that he is yours  any dog in alaska would obey you as he obeyed  besides he is undoubtedly a valuable dog as dogs go in alaska and that is sufficient explanation of your desire to get possession of him  anyway youve got to prove property  skiff miller cool and collected the obstinate flush a trifle deeper on his forehead his huge muscles bulging under the black cloth of his coat carefully looked the poet up and down as though measuring the strength of his slenderness  the klondikers face took on a contemptuous expression as he said finally i reckon theres nothin in sight to prevent me takin the dog right here an now  walts face reddened and the strikingmuscles of his arms and shoulders seemed to stiffen and grow tense  his wife fluttered apprehensively into the breach  maybe mr miller is right she said  i am afraid that he is  wolf does seem to know him and certainly he answers to the name of brown he made friends with him instantly and you know thats something he never did with anybody before  besides look at the way he barked  he was just bursting with joy  joy over what  without doubt at finding mr miller  walts strikingmuscles relaxed and his shoulders seemed to droop with hopelessness  i guess youre right madge he said  wolf isnt wolf but brown and he must belong to mr miller  perhaps mr miller will sell him she suggested  we can buy him  skiff miller shook his head no longer belligerent but kindly quick to be generous in response to generousness  i had five dogs he said casting about for the easiest way to temper his refusal  he was the leader  they was the crack team of alaska nothin could touch em  in 1898 i refused five thousand dollars for the bunch  dogs was high then anyway but that wasnt what made the fancy price  it was the team itself  brown was the best in the team  that winter i refused twelve hundred for m  i didnt sell m then an i aint asellin m now  besides i think a mighty lot of that dog  ive ben lookin for m for three years  it made me fair sick when i found hed ben stolenot the value of him but thewell i liked m like hell thats all beggin your pardon  i couldnt believe my eyes when i seen m just now  i thought i was dreamin  it was too good to be true why i was his wetnurse  i put m to bed snug every night  his mother died and i brought m up on condensed milk at two dollars a can when i couldnt afford it in my own coffee  he never knew any mother but me  he used to suck my finger regular the darn little cussthat finger right there  and skiff miller too overwrought for speech held up a fore finger for them to see  that very finger he managed to articulate as though it somehow clinched the proof of ownership and the bond of affection  he was still gazing at his extended finger when madge began to speak  but the dog she said  you havent considered the dog  skiff miller looked puzzled  have you thought about him she asked  dont know what youre drivin at was the response  maybe the dog has some choice in the matter madge went on  maybe he has his likes and desires  you have not considered him  you give him no choice  it has never entered your mind that possibly he might prefer california to alaska  you consider only what you like  you do with him as you would with a sack of potatoes or a bale of hay  this was a new way of looking at it and miller was visibly impressed as he debated it in his mind  madge took advantage of his indecision  if you really love him what would be happiness to him would be your happiness also she urged  skiff miller continued to debate with himself and madge stole a glance of exultation to her husband who looked back warm approval  what do you think the klondiker suddenly demanded  it was her turn to be puzzled  what do you mean she asked  dye think hed sooner stay in california  she nodded her head with positiveness  i am sure of it  skiff miller again debated with himself though this time aloud at the same time running his gaze in a judicial way over the mooted animal  he was a good worker  hes done a heap of work for me  he never loafed on me an he was a joedandy at hammerin a raw team into shape  hes got a head on him  he can do everything but talk  he knows what you say to him  look at m now  he knows were talkin about him  the dog was lying at skiff millers feet head close down on paws ears erect and listening and eyes that were quick and eager to follow the sound of speech as it fell from the lips of first one and then the other  an theres a lot of work in m yet  hes good for years to come  an i do like him  i like him like hell  once or twice after that skiff miller opened his mouth and closed it again without speaking  finally he said  ill tell you what ill do  your remarks maam has some weight in them  the dogs worked hard and maybe hes earned a soft berth an has got a right to choose  anyway well leave it up to him  whatever he says goes  you people stay right here settin down  ill say goodby and walk off casuallike  if he wants to stay he can stay  if he wants to come with me let m come  i wont call m to come an dont you call m to come back  he looked with sudden suspicion at madge and added only you must play fair  no persuadin after my back is turned  well play fair madge began but skiff miller broke in on her assurances  i know the ways of women he announced  their hearts is soft  when their hearts is touched theyre likely to stack the cards look at the bottom of the deck an lie like the devilbeggin your pardon maam im only discoursin about women in general  i dont know how to thank you madge quavered  i dont see as youve got any call to thank me he replied  brown aint decided yet  now you wont mind if i go away slow  its no moren fair seein ill be out of sight inside a hundred yardsmadge agreed and added and i promise you faithfully that we wont do anything to influence him  well then i might as well be gettin along skiff miller said in the ordinary tones of one departing  at this change in his voice wolf lifted his head quickly and still more quickly got to his feet when the man and woman shook hands  he sprang up on his hind legs resting his fore paws on her hip and at the same time licking skiff millers hand  when the latter shook hands with walt wolf repeated his act resting his weight on walt and licking both mens hands  it aint no picnic i can tell you that were the klondikers last words as he turned and went slowly up the trail  for the distance of twenty feet wolf watched him go himself all eagerness and expectancy as though waiting for the man to turn and retrace his steps  then with a quick low whine wolf sprang after him overtook him caught his hand between his teeth with reluctant tenderness and strove gently to make him pause  failing in this wolf raced back to where walt irvine sat catching his coatsleeve in his teeth and trying vainly to drag him after the retreating man  wolfs perturbation began to wax  he desired ubiquity  he wanted to be in two places at the same time with the old master and the new and steadily the distance between them was increasing  he sprang about excitedly making short nervous leaps and twists now toward one now toward the other in painful indecision not knowing his own mind desiring both and unable to choose uttering quick sharp whines and beginning to pant  he sat down abruptly on his haunches thrusting his nose upward the mouth opening and closing with jerking movements each time opening wider  these jerking movements were in unison with the recurrent spasms that attacked the throat each spasm severer and more intense than the preceding one  and in accord with jerks and spasms the larynx began to vibrate at first silently accompanied by the rush of air expelled from the lungs then sounding a low deep note the lowest in the register of the human ear  all this was the nervous and muscular preliminary to howling  but just as the howl was on the verge of bursting from the full throat the wideopened mouth was closed the paroxysms ceased and he looked long and steadily at the retreating man  suddenly wolf turned his head and over his shoulder just as steadily regarded walt  the appeal was unanswered  not a word nor a sign did the dog receive no suggestion and no clew as to what his conduct should be  a glance ahead to where the old master was nearing the curve of the trail excited him again  he sprang to his feet with a whine and then struck by a new idea turned his attention to madge  hitherto he had ignored her but now both masters failing him she alone was left  he went over to her and snuggled his head in her lap nudging her arm with his nosean old trick of his when begging for favors  he backed away from her and began writhing and twisting playfully curvetting and prancing half rearing and striking his fore paws to the earth struggling with all his body from the wheedling eyes and flattening ears to the wagging tail to express the thought that was in him and that was denied him utterance  this too he soon abandoned  he was depressed by the coldness of these humans who had never been cold before  no response could he draw from them no help could he get  they did not consider him  they were as dead  he turned and silently gazed after the old master  skiff miller was rounding the curve  in a moment he would be gone from view  yet he never turned his head plodding straight onward slowly and methodically as though possessed of no interest in what was occurring behind his back  and in this fashion he went out of view  wolf waited for him to reappear  he waited a long minute silently quietly without movement as though turned to stonewithal stone quick with eagerness and desire he barked once and waited  then he turned and trotted back to walt irvine  he sniffed his hand and dropped down heavily at his feet watching the trail where it curved emptily from view  the tiny stream slipping down the mossylipped stone seemed suddenly to increase the volume of its gurgling noise  save for the meadowlarks there was no other sound  the great yellow butterflies drifted silently through the sunshine and lost themselves in the drowsy shadows  madge gazed triumphantly at her husband  a few minutes later wolf got upon his feet  decision and deliberation marked his movements  he did not glance at the man and woman  his eyes were fixed up the trail  he had made up his mind  they knew it  and they knew so far as they were concerned that the ordeal had just begun  he broke into a trot and madges lips pursed forming an avenue for the caressing sound that it was the will of her to send forth  but the caressing sound was not made  she was impelled to look at her husband and she saw the sternness with which he watched her  the pursed lips relaxed and she sighed inaudibly  wolfs trot broke into a run  wider and wider were the leaps he made not once did he turn his head his wolfs brush standing out straight behind him  he cut sharply across the curve of the trail and was gone     the sundog trail   sitka charley smoked his pipe and gazed thoughtfully at the police gazette illustration on the wall  for half an hour he had been steadily regarding it and for half an hour i had been slyly watching him something was going on in that mind of his and whatever it was i knew it was well worth knowing  he had lived life and seen things and performed that prodigy of prodigies namely the turning of his back upon his own people and in so far as it was possible for an indian becoming a white man even in his mental processes  as he phrased it himself he had come into the warm sat among us by our fires and become one of us he had never learned to read nor write but his vocabulary was remarkable and more remarkable still was the completeness with which he had assumed the white mans point of view the white mans attitude toward things  we had struck this deserted cabin after a hard day on trail  the dogs had been fed the supper dishes washed the beds made and we were now enjoying that most delicious hour that comes each day and but once each day on the alaskan trail the hour when nothing intervenes between the tired body and bed save the smoking of the evening pipe  some former denizen of the cabin had decorated its walls with illustrations torn from magazines and newspapers and it was these illustrations that had held sitka charleys attention from the moment of our arrival two hours before  he had studied them intently ranging from one to another and back again and i could see that there was uncertainty in his mind and bepuzzlement  well i finally broke the silence  he took the pipe from his mouth and said simply i do not understand  he smoked on again and again removed the pipe using it to point at the police gazette illustration  that picturewhat does it mean  i do not understand  i looked at the picture  a man with a preposterously wicked face his right hand pressed dramatically to his heart was falling backward to the floor  confronting him with a face that was a composite of destroying angel and adonis was a man holding a smoking revolver  one man is killing the other man i said aware of a distinct bepuzzlement of my own and of failure to explain  why asked sitka charley  i do not know i confessed  that picture is all end he said  it has no beginning  it is life i said  life has beginning he objected  i was silenced for the moment while his eyes wandered on to an adjoining decoration a photographic reproduction of somebodys leda and the swan  that picture he said has no beginning  it has no end  i do not understand pictures  look at that picture i commanded pointing to a third decoration  it means something  tell me what it means to you  he studied it for several minutes  the little girl is sick he said finally  that is the doctor looking at her  they have been up all nightsee the oil is low in the lamp the first morning light is coming in at the window  it is a great sickness maybe she will die that is why the doctor looks so hard  that is the mother  it is a great sickness because the mothers head is on the table and she is crying  how do you know she is crying i interrupted  you cannot see her face  perhaps she is asleep  sitka charley looked at me in swift surprise then back at the picture it was evident that he had not reasoned the impression  perhaps she is asleep he repeated  he studied it closely  no she is not asleep  the shoulders show that she is not asleep  i have seen the shoulders of a woman who cried  the mother is crying  it is a very great sickness  and now you understand the picture i cried  he shook his head and asked the little girldoes it die  it was my turn for silence  does it die he reiterated  you are a painterman  maybe you know  no i do not know i confessed  it is not life he delivered himself dogmatically  in life little girl die or get well  something happen in life  in picture nothing happen  no i do not understand pictures  his disappointment was patent  it was his desire to understand all things that white men understand and here in this matter he failed  i felt also that there was challenge in his attitude  he was bent upon compelling me to show him the wisdom of pictures  besides he had remarkable powers of visualization  i had long since learned this  he visualized everything  he saw life in pictures felt life in pictures generalized life in pictures and yet he did not understand pictures when seen through other mens eyes and expressed by those men with color and line upon canvas  pictures are bits of life i said  we paint life as we see it  for instance charley you are coming along the trail  it is night  you see a cabin  the window is lighted  you look through the window for one second or for two seconds you see something and you go on your way you saw maybe a man writing a letter  you saw something without beginning or end  nothing happened  yet it was a bit of life you saw you remember it afterward  it is like a picture in your memory  the window is the frame of the picture  i could see that he was interested and i knew that as i spoke he had looked through the window and seen the man writing the letter  there is a picture you have painted that i understand he said  it is a true picture  it has much meaning  it is in your cabin at dawson  it is a faro table  there are men playing  it is a large game  the limit is off  how do you know the limit is off i broke in excitedly for here was where my work could be tried out on an unbiassed judge who knew life only and not art and who was a sheer master of reality  also i was very proud of that particular piece of work  i had named it the last turn and i believed it to be one of the best things i had ever done  there are no chips on the table sitka charley explained  the men are playing with markers  that means the roof is the limit  one man play yellow markersmaybe one yellow marker worth one thousand dollars maybe two thousand dollars  one man play red markers  maybe they are worth five hundred dollars maybe one thousand dollars  it is a very big game everybody play very high up to the roof  how do i know  you make the dealer with blood little bit warm in face  i was delighted  the lookout you make him lean forward in his chair  why he lean forward why his face very much quiet  why his eyes very much bright  why dealer warm with blood a little bit in the face  why all men very quietthe man with yellow markers the man with white markers the man with red markers  why nobody talk  because very much money  because last turn  how do you know it is the last turn i asked  the king is coppered the seven is played open he answered  nobody bet on other cards  other cards all gone  everybody one mind  everybody play king to lose seven to win  maybe bank lose twenty thousand dollars maybe bank win  yes that picture i understand  yet you do not know the end i cried triumphantly  it is the last turn but the cards are not yet turned  in the picture they will never be turned  nobody will ever know who wins nor who loses  and the men will sit there and never talk he said wonder and awe growing in his face  and the lookout will lean forward and the blood will be warm in the face of the dealer  it is a strange thing  always will they sit there always and the cards will never be turned  it is a picture i said  it is life  you have seen things like it yourself  he looked at me and pondered then said very slowly  no as you say there is no end to it  nobody will ever know the end  yet is it a true thing  i have seen it  it is life  for a long time he smoked on in silence weighing the pictorial wisdom of the white man and verifying it by the facts of life  he nodded his head several times and grunted once or twice  then he knocked the ashes from his pipe carefully refilled it and after a thoughtful pause lighted it again  then have i too seen many pictures of life he began pictures not painted but seen with the eyes  i have looked at them like through the window at the man writing the letter  i have seen many pieces of life without beginning without end without understanding  with a sudden change of position he turned his eyes full upon me and regarded me thoughtfully  look you he said you are a painterman  how would you paint this which i saw a picture without beginning the ending of which i do not understand a piece of life with the northern lights for a candle and alaska for a frame  it is a large canvas i murmured  but he ignored me for the picture he had in mind was before his eyes and he was seeing it  there are many names for this picture he said  but in the picture there are many sundogs and it comes into my mind to call it the sun dog trail  it was a long time ago seven years ago the fall of 97 when i saw the woman first time  at lake linderman i had one canoe very good peterborough canoe  i came over chilcoot pass with two thousand letters for dawson  i was letter carrier  everybody rush to klondike at that time  many people on trail  many people chop down trees and make boats  last water snow in the air snow on the ground ice on the lake on the

muscles all soft and round like baby  her waist is small and when she stand up when she walk or move her head or arm it isi do not know the wordbut it is nice to look at likemaybe i say she is built on lines like the lines of a good canoe just like that and when she move she is like the movement of the good canoe sliding through still water or leaping through water when it is white and fast and angry  it is very good to see  why does she come into klondike all alone with plenty of money  i do not know  next day i ask her  she laugh and says  sitka charley that is none of your business  i

and i feel good all over like when i go into church at holy cross mission and when she sing i feel strong and paddle like hell  then she laugh and says you think we get to dawson before freezeup charley sometimes she sit in canoe and is thinking far away her eyes like that all empty  she does not see sitka charley nor the ice nor the snow she is far away  very often she is like that thinking far away sometimes when she is thinking far away her face is not good to see  it looks like a face that is angry like the face of one man when he want to kill another man  last day to dawson very bad

below  she is soft  he is soft  the cold bites  they get tired  they cry under their breaths to themselves by and by i say better we stop and make camp  but they say that they will go on  three times i say better to make camp and rest but each time they say they will go on  after that i say nothing  all the time day after day is it that way  they are very soft  they get stiff and sore  they do not understand moccasins and their feet hurt very much they limp they stagger like drunken people they cry under their breaths and all the time they say on on  we will go on  they are like crazy people  all the time do they go on and on  why do they go on  i do not know  only do they go on  what are they after  i do not know  they are not after gold  there is no stampede  besides they spend plenty of money  but i ask questions no more  i too go on and on because i am strong on the trail and because i am greatly paid  we make circle city  that for which they look is not there  i think now that we will rest and rest the dogs  but we do not rest not for one day do we rest  come says the woman to the man let us go on and we go on  we leave the yukon  we cross the divide to the west and swing down into the tanana country  there are new diggings there  but that for which they look is not there and we take the back trail to circle city  it is a hard journey  december is most gone  the days are short  it is very cold  one morning it is seventy below zero  better that we dont travel today i say else will the frost be unwarmed in the breathing and bite all the edges of our lungs  after that we will have bad cough and maybe next spring will come pneumonia  but they are chechaquo  they do not understand the trail  they are like dead people they are so tired but they say let us go on  we go on  the frost bites their lungs and they get the dry cough  they cough till the tears run down their cheeks  when bacon is frying they must run away from the fire and cough half an hour in the snow  they freeze their cheeks a little bit so that the skin turns black and is very sore  also the man freezes his thumb till the end is like to come off and he must wear a large thumb on his mitten to keep it warm  and sometimes when the frost bites hard and the thumb is very cold he must take off the mitten and put the hand between his legs next to the skin so that the thumb may get warm again  we limp into circle city and even i sitka charley am tired  it is christmas eve  i dance drink make a good time for tomorrow is christmas day and we will rest  but no  it is five oclock in the morningchristmas morning  i am two hours asleep  the man stand by my bed  come charley he says harness the dogs  we start  have i not said that i ask questions no more  they pay me seven hundred and fifty dollars each month  they are my masters  i am their man  if they say charley come let us start for hell i will harness the dogs and snap the whip and start for hell  so i harness the dogs and we start down the yukon  where do we go  they do not say  only do they say on on  we will go on  they are very weary  they have travelled many hundreds of miles and they do not understand the way of the trail  besides their cough is very badthe dry cough that makes strong men swear and weak men cry  but they go on  every day they go on  never do they rest the dogs  always do they buy new dogs  at every camp at every post at every indian village do they cut out the tired dogs and put in fresh dogs  they have much money money without end and like water they spend it  they are crazy  sometimes i think so for there is a devil in them that drives them on and on always on  what is it that they try to find  it is not gold  never do they dig in the ground  i think a long time  then i think it is a man they try to find  but what man  never do we see the man  yet are they like wolves on the trail of the kill  but they are funny wolves soft wolves baby wolves who do not understand the way of the trail  they cry aloud in their sleep at night  in their sleep they moan and groan with the pain of their weariness  and in the day as they stagger along the trail they cry under their breaths  they are funny wolves  we pass fort yukon  we pass fort hamilton  we pass minook  january has come and nearly gone  the days are very short  at nine oclock comes daylight  at three oclock comes night  and it is cold  and even i sitka charley am tired  will we go on forever this way without end i do not know  but always do i look along the trail for that which they try to find  there are few people on the trail  sometimes we travel one hundred miles and never see a sign of life  it is very quiet  there is no sound  sometimes it snows and we are like wandering ghosts sometimes it is clear and at midday the sun looks at us for a moment over the hills to the south  the northern lights flame in the sky and the sundogs dance and the air is filled with frostdust  i am sitka charley a strong man  i was born on the trail and all my days have i lived on the trail  and yet have these two baby wolves made me very tired  i am lean like a starved cat and i am glad of my bed at night and in the morning am i greatly weary  yet ever are we hitting the trail in the dark before daylight and still on the trail does the dark after nightfall find us  these two baby wolves  if i am lean like a starved cat they are lean like cats that have never eaten and have died  their eyes are sunk deep in their heads bright sometimes as with fever dim and cloudy sometimes like the eyes of the dead  their cheeks are hollow like caves in a cliff  also are their cheeks black and raw from many freezings  sometimes it is the woman in the morning who says i cannot get up  i cannot move  let me die  and it is the man who stands beside her and says come let us go on  and they go on  and sometimes it is the man who cannot get up and the woman says come let us go on  but the one thing they do and always do is to go on  always do they go on  sometimes at the trading posts the man and woman get letters  i do not know what is in the letters  but it is the scent that they follow these letters themselves are the scent  one time an indian gives them a letter  i talk with him privately  he says it is a man with one eye who gives him the letter a man who travels fast down the yukon  that is all  but i know that the baby wolves are after the man with the one eye  it is february and we have travelled fifteen hundred miles  we are getting near bering sea and there are storms and blizzards  the going is hard  we come to anvig  i do not know but i think sure they get a letter at anvig for they are much excited and they say come hurry let us go on  but i say we must buy grub and they say we must travel light and fast  also they say that we can get grub at charley mckeons cabin  then do i know that they take the big cutoff for it is there that charley mckeon lives where the black rock stands by the trail  before we start i talk maybe two minutes with the priest at anvig  yes there is a man with one eye who has gone by and who travels fast  and i know that for which they look is the man with the one eye  we leave anvig with little grub and travel light and fast  there are three fresh dogs bought in anvig and we travel very fast  the man and woman are like mad  we start earlier in the morning we travel later at night  i look sometimes to see them die these two baby wolves but they will not die  they go on and on  when the dry cough take hold of them hard they hold their hands against their stomach and double up in the snow and cough and cough and cough  they cannot walk they cannot talk  maybe for ten minutes they cough maybe for half an hour and then they straighten up the tears from the coughing frozen on their faces and the words they say are come let us go on  even i sitka charley am greatly weary and i think seven hundred and fifty dollars is a cheap price for the labor i do  we take the big cut off and the trail is fresh  the baby wolves have their noses down to the trail and they say hurry  all the time do they say hurry faster  faster  it is hard on the dogs  we have not much food and we cannot give them enough to eat and they grow weak  also they must work hard  the woman has true sorrow for them and often because of them the tears are in her eyes  but the devil in her that drives her on will not let her stop and rest the dogs  and then we come upon the man with the one eye  he is in the snow by the trail and his leg is broken  because of the leg he has made a poor camp and has been lying on his blankets for three days and keeping a fire going  when we find him he is swearing  he swears like hell  never have i heard a man swear like that man  i am glad  now that they have found that for which they look we will have rest  but the woman says let us start  hurry  i am surprised  but the man with the one eye says never mind me  give me your grub  you will get more grub at mckeons cabin tomorrow  send mckeon back for me  but do you go on  here is another wolf an old wolf and he too thinks but the one thought to go on  so we give him our grub which is not much and we chop wood for his fire and we take his strongest dogs and go on  we left the man with one eye there in the snow and he died there in the snow for mckeon never went back for him and who that man was and why he came to be there i do not know  but i think he was greatly paid by the man and the woman like me to do their work for them  that day and that night we had nothing to eat and all next day we travelled fast and we were weak with hunger  then we came to the black rock which rose five hundred feet above the trail  it was at the end of the day  darkness was coming and we could not find the cabin of mckeon we slept hungry and in the morning looked for the cabin  it was not there which was a strange thing for everybody knew that mckeon lived in a cabin at black rock  we were near to the coast where the wind blows hard and there is much snow  everywhere there were small hills of snow where the wind had piled it up  i have a thought and i dig in one and another of the hills of snow  soon i find the walls of the cabin and i dig down to the door  i go inside  mckeon is dead  maybe two or three weeks he is dead  a sickness had come upon him so that he could not leave the cabin  the wind and the snow had covered the cabin  he had eaten his grub and died  i looked for his cache but there was no grub in it  let us go on said the woman  her eyes were hungry and her hand was upon her heart as with the hurt of something inside  she bent back and forth like a tree in the wind as she stood there  yes let us go on said the man  his voice was hollow like the klonk of an old raven and he was hungermad  his eyes were like live coals of fire and as his body rocked to and fro so rocked his soul inside  and i too said let us go on  for that one thought laid upon me like a lash for every mile of fifteen hundred miles had burned itself into my soul and i think that i too was mad  besides we could only go on for there was no grub  and we went on giving no thought to the man with the one eye in the snow  there is little travel on the big cutoff  sometimes two or three months and nobody goes by  the snow had covered the trail and there was no sign that men had ever come or gone that way  all day the wind blew and the snow fell and all day we travelled while our stomachs gnawed their desire and our bodies grew weaker with every step they took  then the woman began to fall  then the man  i did not fall but my feet were heavy and i caught my toes and stumbled many times  that night is the end of february  i kill three ptarmigan with the womans revolver and we are made somewhat strong again  but the dogs have nothing to eat  they try to eat their harness which is of leather and walrushide and i must fight them off with a club and hang all the harness in a tree  and all night they howl and fight around that tree but we do not mind  we sleep like dead people and in the morning get up like dead people out of their graves and go on along the trail  that morning is the 1st of march and on that morning i see the first sign of that after which the baby wolves are in search  it is clear weather and cold  the sun stay longer in the sky and there are sun dogs flashing on either side and the air is bright with frostdust  the snow falls no more upon the trail and i see the fresh sign of dogs and sled  there is one man with that outfit and i see in the snow that he is not strong  he too has not enough to eat  the young wolves see the fresh sign too and they are much excited  hurry they say  all the time they say hurry  faster charley faster  we make hurry very slow  all the time the man and the woman fall down when they try to ride on sled the dogs are too weak and the dogs fall down  besides it is so cold that if they ride on the sled they will freeze  it is very easy for a hungry man to freeze  when the woman fall down the man help her up  sometimes the woman help the man up  by and by both fall down and cannot get up and i must help them up all the time else they will not get up and will die there in the snow  this is very hard work for i am greatly weary and as well i must drive the dogs and the man and woman are very heavy with no strength in their bodies  so by and by i too fall down in the snow and there is no one to help me up  i must get up by myself  and always do i get up by myself and help them up and make the dogs go on  that night i get one ptarmigan and we are very hungry  and that night the man says to me what time start tomorrow charley  it is like the voice of a ghost  i say all the time you make start at five oclock tomorrow he says we will start at three oclock  i laugh in great bitterness and i say you are dead man  and he says tomorrow we will start at three oclock  and we start at three oclock for i am their man and that which they say is to be done i do  it is clear and cold and there is no wind when daylight comes we can see a long way off  and it is very quiet  we can hear no sound but the beat of our hearts and in the silence that is a very loud sound  we are like sleepwalkers and we walk in dreams until we fall down and then we know we must get up and we see the trail once more and bear the beating of our hearts  sometimes when i am walking in dreams this way i have strange thoughts  why does sitka charley live i ask myself  why does sitka charley work hard and go hungry and have all this pain  for seven hundred and fifty dollars a month i make the answer and i know it is a foolish answer  also is it a true answer  and after that never again do i care for money  for that day a large wisdom came to me  there was a great light and i saw clear and i knew that it was not for money that a man must live but for a happiness that no man can give or buy or sell and that is beyond all value of all money in the world  in the morning we come upon the lastnight camp of the man who is before us  it is a poor camp the kind a man makes who is hungry and without strength  on the snow there are pieces of blanket and of canvas and i know what has happened  his dogs have eaten their harness and he has made new harness out of his blankets  the man and woman stare hard at what is to be seen and as i look at them my back feels the chill as of a cold wind against the skin  their eyes are toilmad and hungermad and burn like fire deep in their heads  their faces are like the faces of people who have died of hunger and their cheeks are black with the dead flesh of many freezings  let us go on says the man  but the woman coughs and falls in the snow  it is the dry cough where the frost has bitten the lungs  for a long time she coughs then like a woman crawling out of her grave she crawls to her feet  the tears are ice upon her cheeks and her breath makes a noise as it comes and goes and she says let us go on  we go on  and we walk in dreams through the silence  and every time we walk is a dream and we are without pain and every time we fall down is an awakening and we see the snow and the mountains and the fresh trail of the man who is before us and we know all our pain again  we come to where we can see a long way over the snow and that for which they look is before them  a mile away there are black spots upon the snow  the black spots move  my eyes are dim and i must stiffen my soul to see and i see one man with dogs and a sled  the baby wolves see too  they can no longer talk but they whisper on on  let us hurry  and they fall down but they go on  the man who is before us his blanket harness breaks often and he must stop and mend it  our harness is good for i have hung it in trees each night  at eleven oclock the man is half a mile away  at one oclock he is a quarter of a mile away he is very weak  we see him fall down many times in the snow  one of his dogs can no longer travel and he cuts it out of the harness  but he does not kill it  i kill it with the axe as i go by as i kill one of my dogs which loses its legs and can travel no more  now we are three hundred yards away  we go very slow  maybe in two three hours we go one mile  we do not walk  all the time we fall down we stand up and stagger two steps maybe three steps then we fall down again  and all the time i must help up the man and woman  sometimes they rise to their knees and fall forward maybe four or five times before they can get to their feet again and stagger two or three steps and fall  but always do they fall forward  standing or kneeling always do they fall forward gaining on the trail each time by the length of their bodies  sometimes they crawl on hands and knees like animals that live in the forest  we go like snails like snails that are dying we go so slow  and yet we go faster than the man who is before us  for he too falls all the time and there is no sitka charley to lift him up  now he is two hundred yards away  after a long time he is one hundred yards away  it is a funny sight  i want to laugh out loud ha ha just like that it is so funny  it is a race of dead men and dead dogs  it is like in a dream when you have a nightmare and run away very fast for your life and go very slow  the man who is with me is mad  the woman is mad  i am mad  all the world is mad and i want to laugh it is so funny  the strangerman who is before us leaves his dogs behind and goes on alone across the snow  after a long time we come to the dogs  they lie helpless in the snow their harness of blanket and canvas on them the sled behind them and as we pass them they whine to us and cry like babies that are hungry  then we too leave our dogs and go on alone across the snow  the man and the woman are nearly gone and they moan and groan and sob but they go on  i too go on  i have but one thought  it is to come up to the strangerman  then it is that i shall rest and not until then shall i rest and it seems that i must lie down and sleep for a thousand years i am so tired  the strangerman is fifty yards away all alone in the white snow  he falls and crawls staggers and falls and crawls again  he is like an animal that is sore wounded and trying to run from the hunter  by and by he crawls on hands and knees  he no longer stands up  and the man and woman no longer stand up  they too crawl after him on hands and knees but i stand up  sometimes i fall but always do i stand up again  it is a strange thing to see  all about is the snow and the silence and through it crawl the man and the woman and the strangerman who goes before  on either side the sun are sundogs so that there are three suns in the sky  the frostdust is like the dust of diamonds and all the air is filled with it  now the woman coughs and lies still in the snow until the fit has passed when she crawls on again  now the man looks ahead and he is bleareyed as with old age and must rub his eyes so that he can see the strangerman  and now the strangerman looks back over his shoulder  and sitka charley standing upright maybe falls down and stands upright again  after a long time the strangerman crawls no more  he stands slowly upon his feet and rocks back and forth  also does he take off one mitten and wait with revolver in his hand rocking back and forth as he waits his face is skin and bones and frozen black  it is a hungry face  the eyes are deepsunk in his head and the lips are snarling  the man and woman too get upon their feet and they go toward him very slowly  and all about is the snow and the silence  and in the sky are three suns and all the air is flashing with the dust of diamonds  and thus it was that i sitka charley saw the baby wolves make their kill  no word is spoken  only does the strangerman snarl with his hungry face  also does he rock to and fro his shoulders drooping his knees bent and his legs wide apart so that he does not fall down  the man and the woman stop maybe fifty feet away  their legs too are wide apart so that they do not fall down and their bodies rock to and fro the strangerman is very weak  his arm shakes so that when he shoots at the man his bullet strikes in the snow  the man cannot take off his mitten  the strangerman shoots at him again and this time the bullet goes by in the air  then the man takes the mitten in his teeth and pulls it off  but his hand is frozen and he cannot hold the revolver and it fails in the snow  i look at the woman  her mitten is off and the big colts revolver is in her hand  three times she shoot quick just like that  the hungry face of the strangerman is still snarling as he falls forward into the snow  they do not look at the dead man  let us go on they say  and we go on  but now that they have found that for which they look they are like dead  the last strength has gone out of them  they can stand no more upon their feet  they will not crawl but desire only to close their eyes and sleep  i see not far away a place for camp  i kick them  i have my dogwhip and i give them the lash of it  they cry aloud but they must crawl  and they do crawl to the place for camp  i build fire so that they will not freeze  then i go back for sled  also i kill the dogs of the strangerman so that we may have food and not die  i put the man and woman in blankets and they sleep  sometimes i wake them and give them little bit of food  they are not awake but they take the food  the woman sleep one day and a half  then she wake up and go to sleep again the man sleep two days and wake up and go to sleep again  after that we go down to the coast at st michaels  and when the ice goes out of bering sea the man and woman go away on a steamship  but first they pay me my seven hundred and fifty dollars a month  also they make me a present of one thousand dollars  and that was the year that sitka charley gave much money to the mission at holy cross  but why did they kill the man i asked  sitka charley delayed reply until he had lighted his pipe  he glanced at the police gazette illustration and nodded his head at it familiarly then he said speaking slowly and ponderingly  i have thought much  i do not know  it is something that happened  it is a picture i remember  it is like looking in at the window and seeing the man writing a letter  they came into my life and they went out of my life and the picture is as i have said without beginning the end without understanding  you have painted many pictures in the telling i said  ay he nodded his head  but they were without beginning and without end  the last picture of all had an end i said  ay he answered  but what end  it was a piece of life i said  ay he answered  it was a piece of life     negore the coward   he had followed the trail of his fleeing people for eleven days and his pursuit had been in itself a flight for behind him he knew full well were the dreaded russians toiling through the swampy lowlands and over the steep divides bent on no less than the extermination of all his people  he was travelling light  a rabbitskin sleepingrobe a muzzle loading rifle and a few pounds of sundried salmon constituted his outfit  he would have marvelled that a whole peoplewomen and children and agedcould travel so swiftly had he not known the terror that drove them on  it was in the old days of the russian occupancy of alaska when the nineteenth century had run but half its course that negore fled after his fleeing tribe and came upon it this summer night by the head waters of the peelat  though near the midnight hour it was bright day as he passed through the weary camp  many saw him all knew him but few and cold were the greetings he received  negore the coward he heard illiha a young woman laugh and sunne his sisters daughter laughed with her  black anger ate at his heart but he gave no sign threading his way among the campfires until he came to one where sat an old man  a young woman was kneading with skilful fingers the tired muscles of his legs  he raised a sightless face and listened intently as negores foot crackled a dead twig  who comes he queried in a thin tremulous voice  negore said the young woman scarcely looking up from her task  negores face was expressionless  for many minutes he stood and waited the old mans head had sunk back upon his chest  the young woman pressed and prodded the wasted muscles resting her body on her knees her bowed head hidden as in a cloud by her black wealth of hair  negore watched the supple body bending at the hips as a lynxs body might bend pliant as a young willow stalk and withal strong as only youth is strong  he looked and was aware of a great yearning akin in sensation to physical hunger  at last he spoke saying  is there no greeting for negore who has been long gone and has but now come back  she looked up at him with cold eyes  the old man chuckled to himself after the manner of the old  thou art my woman oona negore said his tones dominant and conveying a hint of menace  she arose with catlike ease and suddenness to her full height her eyes flashing her nostrils quivering like a deers  i was thy woman to be negore but thou art a coward the daughter of old kinoos mates not with a coward  she silenced him with an imperious gesture as he strove to speak  old kinoos and i came among you from a strange land  thy people took us in by their fires and made us warm nor asked whence or why we wandered it was their thought that old kinoos had lost the sight of his eyes from age nor did old kinoos say otherwise nor did i his daughter  old kinoos is a brave man but old kinoos was never a boaster  and now when i tell thee of how his blindness came to be thou wilt know beyond question that the daughter of kinoos cannot mother the children of a coward such as thou art negore  again she silenced the speech that rushed up to his tongue  know negore if journey be added unto journey of all thy journeyings through this land thou wouldst not come to the unknown sitka on the great salt sea  in that place there be many russian folk and their rule is harsh  and from sitka old kinoos who was young kinoos in those days fled away with me a babe in his arms along the islands in the midst of the sea  my mother dead tells the tale of his wrong a russian dead with a spear through breast and back tells the tale of the vengeance of kinoos  but wherever we fled and however far we fled always did we find the hated russian folk  kinoos was unafraid but the sight of them was a hurt to his eyes so we fled on and on through the seas and years till we came to the great fog sea negore of which thou hast heard but which thou hast never seen  we lived among many peoples and i grew to be a woman but kinoos growing old took to him no other woman nor did i take a man  at last we came to pastolik which is where the yukon drowns itself in the great fog sea  here we lived long on the rim of the sea among a people by whom the russians were well hated  but sometimes they came these russians in great ships and made the people of pastolik show them the way through the islands uncountable of the manymouthed yukon  and sometimes the men they took to show them the way never came back till the people became angry and planned a great plan  so when there came a ship old kinoos stepped forward and said he would show the way  he was an old man then and his hair was white but he was unafraid  and he was cunning for he took the ship to where the sea sucks in to the land and the waves beat white on the mountain called romanoff  the sea sucked the ship in to where the waves beat white and it ground upon the rocks and broke open its sides  then came all the people of pastolik for this was the plan with their warspears and arrows and some few guns  but first the russians put out the eyes of old kinoos that he might never show the way again and then they fought where the waves beat white with the people of pastolik  now the headman of these russians was ivan  he it was with his two thumbs who drove out the eyes of kinoos  he it was who fought his way through the white water with two men left of all his men and went away along the rim of the great fog sea into the north  kinoos was wise  he could see no more and was helpless as a child  so he fled away from the sea up the great strange yukon even to nulato and i fled with him  this was the deed my father did kinoos an old man  but how did the young man negore  once again she silenced him  with my own eyes i saw at nulato before the gates of the great fort and but few days gone  i saw the russian ivan who thrust out my fathers eyes lay the lash of his dogwhip upon thee and beat thee like a dog  this i saw and knew thee for a coward  but i saw thee not that night when all thy peopleyea even the boys not yet huntersfell upon the russians and slew them all  not ivan said negore quietly  even now is he on our heels and with him many russians fresh up from the sea  oona made no effort to hide her surprise and chagrin that ivan was not dead but went on  in the day i saw thee a coward in the night when all men fought even the boys not yet hunters i saw thee not and knew thee doubly a coward  thou art done  all done negore asked  she nodded her head and looked at him askance as though astonished that he should have aught to say  know then that negore is no coward he said and his speech was very low and quiet  know that when i was yet a boy i journeyed alone down to the place where the yukon drowns itself in the great fog sea  even to pastolik i journeyed and even beyond into the north along the rim of the sea  this i did when i was a boy and i was no coward  nor was i coward when i journeyed a young man and alone up the yukon farther than man had ever been so far that i came to another folk with white faces who live in a great fort and talk speech other than that the russians talk  also have i killed the great bear of the tanana country where no one of my people hath ever been  and i have fought with the nuklukyets and the kaltags and the sticks in far regions even i and alone  these deeds whereof no man knows i speak for myself  let my people speak for me of things i have done which they know  they will not say negore is a coward  he finished proudly and proudly waited  these be things which happened before i came into the land she said and i know not of them  only do i know what i know and i know i saw thee lashed like a dog in the day and in the night when the great fort flamed red and the men killed and were killed i saw thee not  also thy people do call thee negore the coward  it is thy name now negore the coward  it is not a good name old kinoos chuckled  thou dost not understand kinoos negore said gently  but i shall make thee understand  know that i was away on the hunt of the bear with kamotah my mothers son  and kamotah fought with a great bear  we had no meat for three days and kamotah was not strong of arm nor swift of foot  and the great bear crushed him so till his bones cracked like dry sticks  thus i found him very sick and groaning upon the ground and there was no meat nor could i kill aught that the sick man might eat  so i said i will go to nulato and bring thee food also strong men to carry thee to camp  and kamotah said go thou to nulato and get food but say no word of what has befallen me  and when i have eaten and am grown well and strong i will kill this bear  then will i return in honor to nulato and no man may laugh and say kamotah was undone by a bear  so i gave heed to my brothers words and when i was come to nulato and the russian ivan laid the lash of his dogwhip upon me i knew i must not fight  for no man knew of kamotah sick and groaning and hungry and did i fight with ivan and die then would my brother die too  so it was oona that thou sawest me beaten like a dog  then i heard the talk of the shamans and chiefs that the russians had brought strange sicknesses upon the people and killed our men and stolen our women and that the land must be made clean  as i say i heard the talk and i knew it for good talk and i knew that in the night the russians were to be killed  but there was my brother kamotah sick and groaning and with no meat so i could not stay and fight with the men and the boys not yet hunters  and i took with me meat and fish and the lashmarks of ivan and i found kamotah no longer groaning but dead  then i went back to nulato and behold there was no nulatoonly ashes where the great fort had stood and the bodies of many men  and i saw the russians come up the yukon in boats fresh from the sea many russians and i saw ivan creep forth from where he lay hid and make talk with them  and the next day i saw ivan lead them upon the trail of the tribe  even now are they upon the trail and i am here negore but no coward  this is a tale i hear said oona though her voice was gentler than before  kamotah is dead and cannot speak for thee and i know only what i know and i must know thee of my own eyes for no coward  negore made an impatient gesture  there be ways and ways she added  art thou willing to do no less than what old kinoos hath done  he nodded his head and waited  as thou hast said they seek for us even now these russians  show them the way negore even as old kinoos showed them the way so that they come unprepared to where we wait for them in a passage up the rocks thou knowest the place where the wall is broken and high  then will we destroy them even ivan  when they cling like flies to the wall and top is no less near than bottom our men shall fall upon them from above and either side with spears and arrows and guns  and the women and children from above shall loosen the great rocks and hurl them down upon them  it will be a great day for the russians will be killed the land will be made clean and ivan even ivan who thrust out my fathers eyes and laid the lash of his dogwhip upon thee will be killed  like a dog gone mad will he die his breath crushed out of him beneath the rocks  and when the fighting begins it is for thee negore to crawl secretly away so that thou be not slain  even so he answered  negore will show them the way  and then  and then i shall be thy woman negores woman the brave mans woman and thou shalt hunt meat for me and old kinoos and i shall cook thy food and sew thee warm parkas and strong and make thee moccasins after the way of my people which is a better way than thy peoples way  and as i say i shall be thy woman negore always thy woman  and i shall make thy life glad for thee so that all thy days will be a song and laughter and thou wilt know the woman oona as unlike all other women for she has journeyed far and lived in strange places and is wise in the ways of men and in the ways they may be made glad  and in thine old age will she still make thee glad and thy memory of her in the days of thy strength will be sweet for thou wilt know always that she was ease to thee and peace and rest and that beyond all women to other men has she been woman to thee  even so said negore and the hunger for her ate at his heart and his arms went out for her as a hungry mans arms might go out for food  when thou hast shown the way negore she chided him but her eyes were soft and warm and he knew she looked upon him as woman had never looked before  it is well he said turning resolutely on his heel  i go now to make talk with the chiefs so that they may know i am gone to show the russians the way  oh negore my man my man she said to herself as she watched him go but she said it so softly that even old kinoos did not hear and his ears were over keen what of his blindness        three days later having with craft illconcealed his hidingplace negore was dragged forth like a rat and brought before ivanivan the terrible he was known by the men who marched at his back  negore was armed with a miserable bonebarbed spear and he kept his rabbitskin robe wrapped closely about him and though the day was warm he shivered as with an ague  he shook his head that he did not understand the speech ivan put at him and made that he was very weary and sick and wished only to sit down and rest pointing the while to his stomach in sign of his sickness and shivering fiercely  but ivan had with him a man from pastolik who talked the speech of negore and many and vain were the questions they asked him concerning his tribe till the man from pastolik who was called karduk said  it is the word of ivan that thou shalt be lashed till thou diest if thou dost not speak  and know strange brother when i tell thee the word of ivan is the law that i am thy friend and no friend of ivan  for i come not willingly from my country by the sea and i desire greatly to live wherefore i obey the will of my masteras thou wilt obey strange brother if thou art wise and wouldst live  nay strange brother negore answered i know not the way my people are gone for i was sick and they fled so fast my legs gave out from under me and i fell behind  negore waited while karduk talked with ivan  then negore saw the russians face go dark and he saw the men step to either side of him snapping the lashes of their whips  whereupon he betrayed a great fright and cried aloud that he was a sick man and knew nothing but would tell what he knew  and to such purpose did he tell that ivan gave the word to his men to march and on either side of negore marched the men with the whips that he might not run away  and when he made that he was weak of his sickness and stumbled and walked not so fast as they walked they laid their lashes upon him till he screamed with pain and discovered new strength  and when karduk told him all would he well with him when they had overtaken his tribe he asked and then may i rest and move not  continually he asked and then may i rest and move not  and while he appeared very sick and looked about him with dull eyes he noted the fighting strength of ivans men and noted with satisfaction that ivan did not recognize him as the man he had beaten before the gates of the fort  it was a strange following his dull eyes saw  there were slavonian hunters fairskinned and mightymuscled short squat finns with flat noses and round faces siberian halfbreeds whose noses were more like eaglebeaks and lean slanteyed men who bore in their veins the mongol and tartar blood as well as the blood of the slav  wild adventurers they were forayers and destroyers from the far lands beyond the sea of bering who blasted the new and unknown world with fire and sword and clutched greedily for its wealth of fur and hide  negore looked upon them with satisfaction and in his minds eye he saw them crushed and lifeless at the passage up the rocks  and ever he saw waiting for him at the passage up the rocks the face and the form of oona and ever he heard her voice in his ears and felt the soft warm glow of her eyes  but never did he forget to shiver nor to stumble where the footing was rough nor to cry aloud at the bite of the lash also he was afraid of karduk for he knew him for no true man  his was a false eye and an easy tonguea tongue too easy he judged for the awkwardness of honest speech  all that day they marched  and on the next when karduk asked him at command of ivan he said he doubted they would meet with his tribe till the morrow  but ivan who had once been shown the way by old kinoos and had found that way to lead through the white water and a deadly fight believed no more in anything  so when they came to a passage up the rocks he halted his forty men and through karduk demanded if the way were clear  negore looked at it shortly and carelessly  it was a vast slide that broke the straight wall of a cliff and was overrun with brush and creeping plants where a score of tribes could have lain well hidden  he shook his head  nay there be nothing there he said  the way is clear  again ivan spoke to karduk and karduk said  know strange brother if thy talk be not straight and if thy people block the way and fall upon ivan and his men that thou shalt die and at once  my talk is straight negore said  the way is clear  still ivan doubted and ordered two of his slavonian hunters to go up alone  two other men he ordered to the side of negore  they placed their guns against his breast and waited  all waited  and negore knew should one arrow fly or one spear be flung that his death would come upon him  the two slavonian hunters toiled upward till they grew small and smaller and when they reached the top and waved their hats that all was well they were like black specks against the sky  the guns were lowered from negores breast and ivan gave the order for his men to go forward  ivan was silent lost in thought  for an hour he marched as though puzzled and then through karduks mouth he said to negore  how didst thou know the way was clear when thou didst look so briefly upon it  negore thought of the little birds he had seen perched among the rocks and upon the bushes and smiled it was so simple but he shrugged his shoulders and made no answer  for he was thinking likewise of another passage up the rocks to which they would soon come and where the little birds would all be gone  and he was glad that karduk came from the great fog sea where there were no trees or bushes and where men learned water craft instead of landcraft and woodcraft  three hours later when the sun rode overhead they came to another passage up the rocks and karduk said  look with all thine eyes strange brother and see if the way be clear for ivan is not minded this time to wait while men go up before  negore looked and he looked with two men by his side their guns resting against his breast  he saw that the little birds were all gone and once he saw the glint of sunlight on a riflebarrel  and he thought of oona and of her words  and when the fighting begins it is for thee negore to crawl secretly away so that thou be not slain  he felt the two guns pressing on his breast  this was not the way she had planned  there would be no crawling secretly away  he would be the first to die when the fighting began  but he said and his voice was steady and he still feigned to see with dull eyes and to shiver from his sickness  the way is clear  and they started up ivan and his forty men from the far lands beyond the sea of bering  and there was karduk the man from pastolik and negore with the two guns always upon him  it was a long climb and they could not go fast but very fast to negore they seemed to approach the midway point where top was no less near than bottom  a gun cracked among the rocks to the right and negore heard the waryell of all his tribe and for an instant saw the rocks and bushes bristle alive with his kinfolk  then he felt torn asunder by a burst of flame hot through his being and as he fell he knew the sharp pangs of life as it wrenches at the flesh to be free  but he gripped his life with a misers clutch and would not let it go  he still breathed the air which bit his lungs with a painful sweetness and dimly he saw and heard with passing spells of blindness and deafness the flashes of sight and sound again wherein he saw the hunters of ivan falling to their deaths and his own brothers fringing the carnage and filling the air with the tumult of their cries and weapons and far above the women and children loosing the great rocks that leaped like things alive and thundered down  the sun danced above him in the sky the huge walls reeled and swung and still he heard and saw dimly  and when the great ivan fell across his legs hurled there lifeless and crushed by a downrushing rock he remembered the blind eyes of old kinoos and was glad  then the sounds died down and the rocks no longer thundered past and he saw his tribespeople creeping close and closer spearing the wounded as they came  and near to him he heard the scuffle of a mighty slavonian hunter loath to die and half uprisen borne back and down by the thirsty spears  then he saw above him the face of oona and felt about him the arms of oona and for a moment the sun steadied and stood still and the great walls were upright and moved not  thou art a brave man negore he heard her say in his ear thou art my man negore  and in that moment he lived all the life of gladness of which she had told him and the laughter and the song and as the sun went out of the sky above him as in his old age he knew the memory of her was sweet and as even the memories dimmed and died in the darkness that fell upon him he knew in her arms the fulfilment of all the ease and rest she had promised him  and as black night wrapped around him his head upon her breast he felt a great peace steal about him and he was aware of the hush of many twilights and the mystery of silence
