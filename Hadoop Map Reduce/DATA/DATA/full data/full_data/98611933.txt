98611933	the people that time forgot   by  edgar rice burroughs   jtable 4 7 1   chapter 1  i am forced to admit that even though i had traveled a long distance to place bowen tylers manuscript in the hands of his father i was still a trifle skeptical as to its sincerity since i could not but recall that it had not been many years since bowen had been one of the most notorious practical jokers of his alma mater  the truth was that as i sat in the tyler library at santa monica i commenced to feel a trifle foolish and to wish that i had merely forwarded the manuscript by express instead of bearing it personally for i confess that i do not enjoy being laughed at  i have a welldeveloped sense of humorwhen the joke is not on me  mr tyler sr was expected almost hourly  the last steamer in from honolulu had brought information of the date of the expected sailing of his yacht toreador which was now twentyfour hours overdue  mr tylers assistant secretary who had been left at home assured me that there was no doubt but that the toreador had sailed as promised since he knew his employer well enough to be positive that nothing short of an act of god would prevent his doing what he had planned to do  i was also aware of the fact that the sending apparatus of the toreadors wireless equipment was sealed and that it would only be used in event of dire necessity  there was therefore nothing to do but wait and we waited  we discussed the manuscript and hazarded guesses concerning it and the strange events it narrated  the torpedoing of the liner upon which bowen j tyler jr had taken passage for france to join the american ambulance was a wellknown fact and i had further substantiated by wire to the new york office of the owners that a miss la rue had been booked for passage  further neither she nor bowen had been mentioned among the list of survivors nor had the body of either of them been recovered  their rescue by the english tug was entirely probable the capture of the enemy u33 by the tugs crew was not beyond the range of possibility and their adventures during the perilous cruise which the treachery and deceit of benson extended until they found themselves in the waters of the far south pacific with depleted stores and poisoned watercasks while bordering upon the fantastic appeared logical enough as narrated event by event in the manuscript  caprona has always been considered a more or less mythical land though it is vouched for by an eminent navigator of the eighteenth century but bowens narrative made it seem very real however many miles of trackless ocean lay between us and it  yes the narrative had us guessing  we were agreed that it was most improbable but neither of us could say that anything which it contained was beyond the range of possibility  the weird flora and fauna of caspak were as possible under the thick warm atmospheric conditions of the superheated crater as they were in the mesozoic era under almost exactly similar conditions which were then probably worldwide  the assistant secretary had heard of caproni and his discoveries but admitted that he never had taken much stock in the one nor the other  we were agreed that the one statement most difficult of explanation was that which reported the entire absence of human young among the various tribes which tyler had had intercourse  this was the one irreconcilable statement of the manuscript  a world of adults  it was impossible  we speculated upon the probable fate of bradley and his party of english sailors  tyler had found the graves of two of them how many more might have perished  and miss la ruecould a young girl long have survived the horrors of caspak after having been separated from all of her own kind  the assistant secretary wondered if nobs still was with her and then we both smiled at this tacit acceptance of the truth of the whole uncanny tale  i suppose im a fool remarked the assistant secretary but by george i cant help believing it and i can see that girl now with the big airedale at her side protecting her from the terrors of a million years ago  i can visualize the entire scenethe apelike grimaldi men huddled in their filthy caves the huge pterodactyls soaring through the heavy air upon their batlike wings the mighty dinosaurs moving their clumsy hulks beneath the dark shadows of preglacial foreststhe dragons which we considered myths until science taught us that they were the true recollections of the first man handed down through countless ages by word of mouth from father to son out of the unrecorded dawn of humanity  it is stupendousif true i replied  and to think that possibly they are still theretyler and miss la ruesurrounded by hideous dangers and that possibly bradley still lives and some of his party i cant help hoping all the time that bowen and the girl have found the others the last bowen knew of them there were six left all toldthe mate bradley the engineer olson and wilson whitely brady and sinclair  there might be some hope for them if they could join forces but separated im afraid they couldnt last long  if only they hadnt let the german prisoners capture the u33  bowen should have had better judgment than to have trusted them at all  the chances are von schoenvorts succeeded in getting safely back to kiel and is strutting around with an iron cross this very minute  with a large supply of oil from the wells they discovered in caspak with plenty of water and ample provisions there is no reason why they couldnt have negotiated the submerged tunnel beneath the barrier cliffs and made good their escape  i dont like em said the assistant secretary but sometimes you got to hand it to em  yes i growled and theres nothing id enjoy more than handing it to them and then the telephonebell rang  the assistant secretary answered and as i watched him i saw his jaw drop and his face go white  my god he exclaimed as he hung up the receiver as one in a trance  it cant be  what i asked  mr tyler is dead he answered in a dull voice  he died at sea suddenly yesterday  the next ten days were occupied in burying mr bowen j tyler sr and arranging plans for the succor of his son  mr tom billings the late mr tylers secretary did it all  he is force energy initiative and good judgment combined and personified  i never have beheld a more dynamic young man  he handled lawyers courts and executors as a sculptor handles his modeling clay  he formed fashioned and forced them to his will  he had been a classmate of bowen tyler at college and a fraternity brother and before that he had been an impoverished and improvident cowpuncher on one of the great tyler ranches  tyler sr had picked him out of thousands of employees and made him or rather tyler had given him the opportunity and then billings had made himself  tyler jr as good a judge of men as his father had taken him into his friendship and between the two of them they had turned out a man who would have died for a tyler as quickly as he would have for his flag  yet there was none of the sycophant or fawner in billings ordinarily i do not wax enthusiastic about men but this man billings comes as close to my conception of what a regular man should be as any i have ever met  i venture to say that before bowen j tyler sent him to college he had never heard the word ethics and yet i am equally sure that in all his life he never has transgressed a single tenet of the code of ethics of an american gentleman  ten days after they brought mr tylers body off the toreador we steamed out into the pacific in search of caprona  there were forty in the party including the master and crew of the toreador and billings the indomitable was in command  we had a long and uninteresting search for caprona for the old map upon which the assistant secretary had finally located it was most inaccurate  when its grim walls finally rose out of the oceans mists before us we were so far south that it was a question as to whether we were in the south pacific or the antarctic  bergs were numerous and it was very cold  all during the trip billings had steadfastly evaded questions as to how we were to enter caspak after we had found caprona  bowen tylers manuscript had made it perfectly evident to all that the subterranean outlet of the caspakian river was the only means of ingress or egress to the crater world beyond the impregnable cliffs  tylers party had been able to navigate this channel because their craft had been a submarine but the toreador could as easily have flown over the cliffs as sailed under them  jimmy hollis and colin short whiled away many an hour inventing schemes for surmounting the obstacle presented by the barrier cliffs and making ridiculous wagers as to which one tom billings had in mind but immediately we were all assured that we had raised caprona billings called us together  there was no use in talking about these things he said until we found the island  at best it can be but conjecture on our part until we have been able to scrutinize the coast closely  each of us has formed a mental picture of the capronian seacoast from bowens manuscript and it is not likely that any two of these pictures resemble each other or that any of them resemble the coast as we shall presently find it  i have in view three plans for scaling the cliffs and the means for carrying out each is in the hold  there is an electric drill with plenty of waterproof cable to reach from the ships dynamos to the clifftop when the toreador is anchored at a safe distance from shore and there is sufficient halfinch iron rod to build a ladder from the base to the top of the cliff  it would be a long arduous and dangerous work to bore the holes and insert the rungs of the ladder from the bottom upward yet it can be done  i also have a lifesaving mortar with which we might be able to throw a line over the summit of the cliffs but this plan would necessitate one of us climbing to the top with the chances more than even that the line would cut at the summit or the hooks at the upper end would slip  my third plan seems to me the most feasible  you all saw a number of large heavy boxes lowered into the hold before we sailed  i know you did because you asked me what they contained and commented upon the large letter h which was painted upon each box  these boxes contain the various parts of a hydroaeroplane  i purpose assembling this upon the strip of beach described in bowens manuscriptthe beach where he found the dead body of the apelike manprovided there is sufficient space above high water otherwise we shall have to assemble it on deck and lower it over the side  after it is assembled i shall carry tackle and ropes to the clifftop and then it will be comparatively simple to hoist the searchparty and its supplies in safety  or i can make a sufficient number of trips to land the entire party in the valley beyond the barrier all will depend of course upon what my first reconnaissance reveals  that afternoon we steamed slowly along the face of capronas towering barrier  you see now remarked billings as we craned our necks to scan the summit thousands of feet above us how futile it would have been to waste our time in working out details of a plan to surmount those and he jerked his thumb toward the cliffs  it would take weeks possibly months to construct a ladder to the top  i had no conception of their formidable height  our mortar would not carry a line halfway to the crest of the lowest point  there is no use discussing any plan other than the hydroaeroplane  well find the beach and get busy  late the following morning the lookout announced that he could discern surf about a mile ahead and as we approached we all saw the line of breakers broken by a long sweep of rolling surf upon a narrow beach the launch was lowered and five of us made a landing getting a good ducking in the icecold waters in the doing of it but we were rewarded by the finding of the cleanpicked bones of what might have been the skeleton of a high order of ape or a very low order of man lying close to the base of the cliff  billings was satisfied as were the rest of us that this was the beach mentioned by bowen and we further found that there was ample room to assemble the seaplane  billings having arrived at a decision lost no time in acting with the result that before midafternoon we had landed all the large boxes marked h upon the beach and were busily engaged in opening them two days later the plane was assembled and tuned  we loaded tackles and ropes water food and ammunition in it and then we each implored billings to let us be the one to accompany him  but he would take no one  that was billings if there was any especially difficult or dangerous work to be done that one man could do billings always did it himself  if he needed assistance he  never  called  for volunteersjust selected the man or men he considered best qualified for the duty  he said that he considered the principles underlying all volunteer service fundamentally wrong and that it seemed to him that calling for volunteers reflected upon the courage and loyalty of the entire command  we rolled the plane down to the waters edge and billings mounted the pilots seat  there was a moments delay as he assured himself that he had everything necessary  jimmy hollis went over his armament and ammunition to see that nothing had been omitted  besides pistol and rifle there was the machinegun mounted in front of him on the plane and ammunition for all three  bowens account of the terrors of caspak had impressed us all with the necessity for proper means of defense  at last all was ready  the motor was started and we pushed the plane out into the surf  a moment later and she was skimming seaward gently she rose from the surface of the water executed a wide spiral as she mounted rapidly circled once far above us and then disappeared over the crest of the cliffs  we all stood silent and expectant our eyes glued upon the towering summit above us  hollis who was now in command consulted his wristwatch at frequent intervals  gad exclaimed short we ought to be hearing from him pretty soon  hollis laughed nervously  hes been gone only ten minutes he announced  seems like an hour snapped short  whats that  did you hear that hes firing  its the machinegun  oh lord and here we are as helpless as a lot of old ladies ten thousand miles away  we cant do a thing  we dont know whats happening  why didnt he let one of us go with him  yes it was the machinegun  we would hear it distinctly for at least a minute  then came silence  that was two weeks ago  we have had no sign nor signal from tom billings since    chapter 2  ill never forget my first impressions of caspak as i circled in high over the surrounding cliffs  from the plane i looked down through a mist upon the blurred landscape beneath me  the hot humid atmosphere of caspak condenses as it is fanned by the cold antarctic aircurrents which sweep across the craters top sending a tenuous ribbon of vapor far out across the pacific  through this the picture gave one the suggestion of a colossal impressionistic canvas in greens and browns and scarlets and yellows surrounding the deep blue of the inland seajust blobs of color taking form through the tumbling mist  i dived close to the cliffs and skirted them for several miles without finding the least indication of a suitable landingplace and then i swung back at a lower level looking for a clearing close to the bottom of the mighty escarpment but i could find none of sufficient area to insure safety  i was flying pretty low by this time not only looking for landing places but watching the myriad life beneath me  i was down pretty well toward the south end of the island where an arm of the lake reaches far inland and i could see the surface of the water literally black with creatures of some sort  i was too far up to recognize individuals but the general impression was of a vast army of amphibious monsters  the land was almost equally alive with crawling leaping running flying things  it was one of the latter which nearly did for me while my attention was fixed upon the weird scene below  the first intimation i had of it was the sudden blotting out of the sunlight from above and as i glanced quickly up i saw a most terrific creature swooping down upon me  it must have been fully eighty feet long from the end of its long hideous beak to the tip of its thick short tail with an equal spread of wings  it was coming straight for me and hissing frightfullyi could hear it above the whir of the propeller  it was coming straight down toward the muzzle of the machinegun and i let it have it right in the breast but still it came for me so that i had to dive and turn though i was dangerously close to earth  the thing didnt miss me by a dozen feet and when i rose it wheeled and followed me but only to the cooler air close to the level of the clifftops there it turned again and dropped  somethingmans natural love of battle and the chase i presumeimpelled me to pursue it and so i too circled and dived  the moment i came down into the warm atmosphere of caspak the creature came for me again rising above me so that it might swoop down upon me  nothing could better have suited my armament since my machinegun was pointed upward at an angle of about degrees  and could not be either depressed or elevated by the pilot  if i had brought someone along with me we could have raked the great reptile from almost any position but as the creatures mode of attack was always from above he always found me ready with a hail of bullets  the battle must have lasted a minute or more before the thing suddenly turned completely over in the air and fell to the ground  bowen and i roomed together at college and i learned a lot from him outside my regular course  he was a pretty good scholar despite his love of fun and his particular hobby was paleontology  he used to tell me about the various forms of animal and vegetable life which had covered the globe during former eras and so i was pretty well acquainted with the fishes amphibians reptiles and mammals of paleolithic times  i knew that the thing that had attacked me was some sort of pterodactyl which should have been extinct millions of years ago  it was all that i needed to realize that bowen had exaggerated nothing in his manuscript  having disposed of my first foe i set myself once more to search for a landingplace near to the base of the cliffs beyond which my party awaited me  i knew how anxious they would be for word from me and i was equally anxious to relieve their minds and also to get them and our supplies well within caspak so that we might set off about our business of finding and rescuing bowen tyler but the pterodactyls carcass had scarcely fallen before i was surrounded by at least a dozen of the hideous things some large some small but all bent upon my destruction  i could not cope with them all and so i rose rapidly from among them to the cooler strata wherein they dared not follow and then i recalled that bowens narrative distinctly indicated that the farther north one traveled in caspak the fewer were the terrible reptiles which rendered human life impossible at the southern end of the island  there seemed nothing now but to search out a more northerly landingplace and then return to the toreador and transport my companions two by two over the cliffs and deposit them at the rendezvous  as i flew north the temptation to explore overcame me  i knew that i could easily cover caspak and return to the beach with less petrol than i had in my tanks and there was the hope too that i might find bowen or some of his party  the broad expanse of the inland sea lured me out over its waters and as i crossed i saw at either extremity of the great body of water an islandone to the south and one to the north but i did not alter my course to examine either closely leaving that to a later time  the further shore of the sea revealed a much narrower strip of land between the cliffs and the water than upon the western side but it was a hillier and more open country  there were splendid landingplaces and in the distance toward the north i thought i descried a village but of that i was not positive  however as i approached the land i saw a number of human figures apparently pursuing one who fled across a broad expanse of meadow  as i dropped lower to have a better look at these people they caught the whirring of my propellers and looked aloft  they paused an instantpursuers and pursued and then they broke and raced for the shelter of the nearest wood  almost instantaneously a huge bulk swooped down upon me and as i looked up i realized that there were flying reptiles even in this part of caspak the creature dived for my right wing so quickly that nothing but a sheer drop could have saved me  i was already close to the ground so that my maneuver was extremely dangerous but i was in a fair way of making it successfully when i saw that i was too closely approaching a large tree  my effort to dodge the tree and the pterodactyl at the same time resulted disastrously  one wing touched an upper branch the plane tipped and swung around and then out of control dashed into the branches of the tree where it came to rest battered and torn forty feet above the ground  hissing loudly the huge reptile swept close above the tree in which my plane had lodged circled twice over me and then flapped away toward the south  as i guessed then and was to learn later forests are the surest sanctuary from these hideous creatures which with their enormous spread of wing and their great weight are as much out of place among trees as is a seaplane  for a minute or so i clung there to my battered flyer now useless beyond redemption my brain numbed by the frightful catastrophe that had befallen me  all my plans for the succor of bowen and miss la rue had depended upon this craft and in a few brief minutes my own selfish love of adventure had wrecked their hopes and mine  and what effect it might have upon the future of the balance of the rescuing expedition i could not even guess  their lives too might be sacrificed to my suicidal foolishness  that i was doomed seemed inevitable but i can honestly say that the fate of my friends concerned me more greatly than did my own  beyond the barrier cliffs my party was even now nervously awaiting my return  presently apprehension and fear would claim themand they would never know  they would attempt to scale the cliffsof that i was sure but i was not so positive that they would succeed and after a while they would turn back what there were left of them and go sadly and mournfully upon their return journey to home  home  i set my jaws and tried to forget the word for i knew that i should never again see home  and what of bowen and his girl  i had doomed them too  they would never even know that an attempt had been made to rescue them  if they still lived they might some day come upon the ruined remnants of this great plane hanging in its lofty sepulcher and hazard vain guesses and be filled with wonder but they would never know and i could not but be glad that they would not know that tom billings had sealed their deathwarrants by his criminal selfishness  all these useless regrets were getting me in a bad way but at last i shook myself and tried to put such things out of my mind and take hold of conditions as they existed and do my level best to wrest victory from defeat  i was badly shaken up and bruised but considered myself mighty lucky to escape with my life  the plane hung at a precarious angle so that it was with difficulty and considerable danger that i climbed from it into the tree and then to the ground  my predicament was grave  between me and my friends lay an inland sea fully sixty miles wide at this point and an estimated landdistance of some three hundred miles around the northern end of the sea through such hideous dangers as i am perfectly free to admit had me pretty well buffaloed  i had seen quite enough of caspak this day to assure me that bowen had in no way exaggerated its perils  as a matter of fact i am inclined to believe that he had become so accustomed to them before he started upon his manuscript that he rather slighted them  as i stood there beneath that treea tree which should have been part of a coalbed countless ages sinceand looked out across a sea teeming with frightful lifelife which should have been fossil before god conceived of adami would not have given a minim of stale beer for my chances of ever seeing my friends or the outside world again yet then and there i swore to fight my way as far through this hideous land as circumstances would permit  i had plenty of ammunition an automatic pistol and a heavy riflethe latter one of twenty added to our equipment on the strength of bowens description of the huge beasts of prey which ravaged caspak  my greatest danger lay in the hideous reptilia whose low nervous organizations permitted their carnivorous instincts to function for several minutes after they had ceased to live  but to these things i gave less thought than to the sudden frustration of all our plans  with the bitterest of thoughts i condemned myself for the foolish weakness that had permitted me to be drawn from the main object of my flight into premature and useless exploration  it seemed to me then that i must be totally eliminated from further search for bowen since as i estimated it the three hundred miles of caspakian territory i must traverse to reach the base of the cliffs beyond which my party awaited me were practically impassable for a single individual unaccustomed to caspakian life and ignorant of all that lay before him  yet i could not give up hope entirely  my duty lay clear before me i must follow it while life remained to me and so i set forth toward the north  the country through which i took my way was as lovely as it was unusuali had almost said unearthly for the plants the trees the blooms were not of the earth that i knew  they were larger the colors more brilliant and the shapes startling some almost to grotesqueness though even such added to the charm and romance of the landscape as the giant cacti render weirdly beautiful the waste spots of the sad mohave and over all the sun shone huge and round and red a monster sun above a monstrous world its light dispersed by the humid air of caspakthe warm moist air which lies sluggish upon the breast of this great mother of life natures mightiest incubator  all about me in every direction was life  it moved through the treetops and among the boles it displayed itself in widening and intermingling circles upon the bosom of the sea it leaped from the depths i could hear it in a dense wood at my right the murmur of it rising and falling in ceaseless volumes of sound riven at intervals by a horrid scream or a thunderous roar which shook the earth and always i was haunted by that inexplicable sensation that unseen eyes were watching me that soundless feet dogged my trail  i am neither nervous nor highstrung but the burden of responsibility upon me weighed heavily so that i was more cautious than is my wont  i turned often to right and left and rear lest i be surprised and i carried my rifle at the ready in my hand  once i could have sworn that among the many creatures dimly perceived amidst the shadows of the wood i saw a human figure dart from one cover to another but i could not be sure  for the most part i skirted the wood making occasional detours rather than enter those forbidding depths of gloom though many times i was forced to pass through arms of the forest which extended to the very shore of the inland sea  there was so sinister a suggestion in the uncouth sounds and the vague glimpses of moving things within the forest of the menace of strange beasts and possibly still stranger men that i always breathed more freely when i had passed once more into open country  i had traveled northward for perhaps an hour still haunted by the conviction that i was being stalked by some creature which kept always hidden among the trees and shrubbery to my right and a little to my rear when for the hundredth time i was attracted by a sound from that direction and turning saw some animal running rapidly through the forest toward me  there was no longer any effort on its part at concealment it came on through the underbrush swiftly and i was confident that whatever it was it had finally gathered the courage to charge me boldly  before it finally broke into plain view i became aware that it was not alone for a few yards in its rear a second thing thrashed through the leafy jungle  evidently i was to be attacked in force by a pair of hunting beasts or men  and then through the last clump of waving ferns broke the figure of the foremost creature which came leaping toward me on light feet as i stood with my rifle to my shoulder covering the point at which i had expected it would emerge  i must have looked foolish indeed if my surprise and consternation were in any way reflected upon my countenance as i lowered my rifle and gazed incredulous at the lithe figure of the girl speeding swiftly in my direction  but i did not have long to stand thus with lowered weapon for as she came i saw her cast an affrighted glance over her shoulder and at the same moment there broke from the jungle at the same spot at which i had seen her the hugest cat i had ever looked upon  at first i took the beast for a sabertooth tiger as it was quite the most fearsomeappearing beast one could imagine but it was not that dread monster of the past though quite formidable enough to satisfy the most fastidious thrillhunter  on it came grim and terrible its baleful eyes glaring above its distended jaws its lips curled in a frightful snarl which exposed a whole mouthful of formidable teeth  at sight of me it had abandoned its impetuous rush and was now sneaking slowly toward us while the girl a long knife in her hand took her stand bravely at my left and a little to my rear  she had called something to me in a strange tongue as she raced toward me and now she spoke again but what she said i could not then of course knowonly that her tones were sweet well modulated and free from any suggestion of panic  facing the huge cat which i now saw was an enormous panther i waited until i could place a shot where i felt it would do the most good for at best a frontal shot at any of the large carnivora is a ticklish matter  i had some advantage in that the beast was not charging its head was held low and its back exposed and so at forty yards i took careful aim at its spine at the junction of neck and shoulders  but at the same instant as though sensing my intention the great creature lifted its head and leaped forward in full charge  to fire at that sloping forehead i knew would be worse than useless and so i quickly shifted my aim and pulled the trigger hoping against hope that the softnosed bullet and the heavy charge of powder would have sufficient stopping effect to give me time to place a second shot  in answer to the report of the rifle i had the satisfaction of seeing the brute spring into the air turning a complete somersault but it was up again almost instantly though in the brief second that it took it to scramble to its feet and get its bearings it exposed its left side fully toward me and a second bullet went crashing through its heart  down it went for the second timeand then up and at me  the vitality of these creatures of caspak is one of the marvelous features of this strange world and bespeaks the low nervous organization of the old paleolithic life which has been so long extinct in other portions of the world  i put a third bullet into the beast at three paces and then i thought that i was done for but it rolled over and stopped at my feet stone dead  i found that my second bullet had torn its heart almost completely away and yet it had lived to charge ferociously upon me and but for my third shot would doubtless have slain me before it finally expiredor as bowen tyler so quaintly puts it before it knew that it was dead  with the panther quite evidently conscious of the fact that dissolution had overtaken it i turned toward the girl who was regarding me with evident admiration and not a little awe though i must admit that my rifle claimed quite as much of her attention as did i  she was quite the most wonderful animal that i have ever looked upon and what few of her charms her apparel hid it quite effectively succeeded in accentuating  a bit of soft undressed leather was caught over her left shoulder and beneath her right breast falling upon her left side to her hip and upon the right to a metal band which encircled her leg above the knee and to which the lowest point of the hide was attached about her waist was a loose leather belt to the center of which was attached the scabbard belonging to her knife  there was a single armlet between her right shoulder and elbow and a series of them covered her left forearm from elbow to wrist  these i learned later answered the purpose of a shield against knife attack when the left arm is raised in guard across the breast or face  her masses of heavy hair were held in place by a broad metal band which bore a large triangular ornament directly in the center of her forehead  this ornament appeared to be a huge turquoise while the metal of all her ornaments was beaten virgin gold inlaid in intricate design with bits of motherofpearl and tiny pieces of stone of various colors  from the left shoulder depended a leopards tail while her feet were shod with sturdy little sandals  the knife was her only weapon  its blade was of iron the grip was wound with hide and protected by a guard of three outbowing strips of flat iron and upon the top of the hilt was a knob of gold  i took in much of this in the few seconds during which we stood facing each other and i also observed another salient feature of her appearance she was frightfully dirty  her face and limbs and garment were streaked with mud and perspiration and yet even so i felt that i had never looked upon so perfect and beautiful a creature as she  her figure beggars description and equally so her face  were i one of these writerfellows i should probably say that her features were grecian but being neither a writer nor a poet i can do her greater justice by saying that she combined all of the finest lines that one sees in the typical american girls face rather than the pronounced sheeplike physiognomy of the greek goddess  no even the dirt couldnt hide that fact she was beautiful beyond compare  as we stood looking at each other a slow smile came to her face parting her symmetrical lips and disclosing a row of strong white teeth  galu she asked with rising inflection  and remembering that i read in bowens manuscript that galu seemed to indicate a higher type of man i answered by pointing to myself and repeating the word  then she started off on a regular catechism if i could judge by her inflection for i certainly understood no word of what she said  all the time the girl kept glancing toward the forest and at last she touched my arm and pointed in that direction  turning i saw a hairy figure of a manlike thing standing watching us and presently another and another emerged from the jungle and joined the leader until there must have been at least twenty of them  they were entirely naked  their bodies were covered with hair and though they stood upon their feet without touching their hands to the ground they had a very apelike appearance since they stooped forward and had very long arms and quite apish features  they were not pretty to look upon with their closeset eyes flat noses long upper lips and protruding yellow fangs  alus said the girl  i had reread bowens adventures so often that i knew them almost by heart and so now i knew that i was looking upon the last remnant of that ancient manracethe alus of a forgotten periodthe speechless man of antiquity  kazor cried the girl and at the same moment the alus came jabbering toward us  they made strange growling barking noises as with much baring of fangs they advanced upon us  they were armed only with natures weaponspowerful muscles and giant fangs yet i knew that these were quite sufficient to overcome us had we nothing better to offer in defense and so i drew my pistol and fired at the leader  he dropped like a stone and the others turned and fled  once again the girl smiled her slow smile and stepping closer caressed the barrel of my automatic  as she did so her fingers came in contact with mine and a sudden thrill ran through me which i attributed to the fact that it had been so long since i had seen a woman of any sort or kind  she said something to me in her low liquid tones but i could not understand her and then she pointed toward the north and started away i followed her for my way was north too but had it been south i still should have followed so hungry was i for human companionship in this world of beasts and reptiles and halfmen  we walked along the girl talking a great deal and seeming mystified that i could not understand her  her silvery laugh rang merrily when i in turn essayed to speak to her as though my language was the quaintest thing she ever had heard  often after fruitless attempts to make me understand she would hold her palm toward me saying galu and then touch my breast or arm and cry alu alu i knew what she meant for i had learned from bowens narrative the negative gesture and the two words which she repeated  she meant that i was no galu as i claimed but an alu or speechless one  yet every time she said this she laughed again and so infectious were her tones that i could only join her  it was only natural too that she should be mystified by my inability to comprehend her or to make her comprehend me for from the clubmen the lowest human type in caspak to have speech to the golden race of galus the tongues of the various tribes are identicalexcept for amplifications in the rising scale of evolution  she who is a galu can understand one of the bolu and make herself understood to him or to a hatchetman a spearman or an archer  the holus or apes the alus and myself were the only creatures of human semblance with which she could hold no converse yet it was evident that her intelligence told her that i was neither holu nor alu neither anthropoid ape nor speechless man  yet she did not despair but set out to teach me her language and had it not been that i worried so greatly over the fate of bowen and my companions of the toreador i could have wished the period of instruction prolonged  i never have been what one might call a ladies man though i like their company immensely and during my college days and since have made various friends among the sex  i think that i rather appeal to a certain type of girl for the reason that i never make love to them i leave that to the numerous others who do it infinitely better than i could hope to and take my pleasure out of girls society in what seem to be more rational waysdancing golfing boating riding tennis and the like  yet in the company of this halfnaked little savage i found a new pleasure that was entirely distinct from any that i ever had experienced  when she touched me i thrilled as i had never before thrilled in contact with another woman  i could not quite understand it for i am sufficiently sophisticated to know that this is a symptom of love and i certainly did not love this filthy little barbarian with her broken unkempt nails and her skin so besmeared with mud and the green of crushed foliage that it was difficult to say what color it originally had been  but if she was outwardly uncouth her clear eyes and strong white even teeth her silvery laugh and her queenly carriage bespoke an innate fineness which dirt could not quite successfully conceal  the sun was low in the heavens when we came upon a little river which emptied into a large bay at the foot of low cliffs  our journey so far had been beset with constant danger as is every journey in this frightful land  i have not bored you with a recital of the wearying successions of attacks by the multitude of creatures which were constantly crossing our path or deliberately stalking us  we were always upon the alert for here to paraphrase eternal vigilance is indeed the price of life  i had managed to progress a little in the acquisition of a knowledge of her tongue so that i knew many of the animals and reptiles by their caspakian names and trees and ferns and grasses  i knew the words for sea and river and cliff for sky and sun and cloud  yes i was getting along finely and then it occurred to me that i didnt know my companions name so i pointed to myself and said tom and to her and raised my eyebrows in interrogation  the girl ran her fingers into that mass of hair and looked puzzled  i repeated the action a dozen times  tom she said finally in that clear sweet liquid voice  tom  i had never thought much of my name before but when she spoke it it sounded to me for the first time in my life like a mighty nice name and then she brightened suddenly and tapped her own breast and said ajor  ajor i repeated and she laughed and struck her palms together  well we knew each others names now and that was some satisfaction i rather liked hersajor  and she seemed to like mine for she repeated it  we came to the cliffs beside the little river where it empties into the bay with the great inland sea beyond  the cliffs were weatherworn and rotted and in one place a deep hollow ran back beneath the overhanging stone for several feet suggesting shelter for the night  there were loose rocks strewn all about with which i might build a barricade across the entrance to the cave and so i halted there and pointed out the place to ajor trying to make her understand that we would spend the night there  as soon as she grasped my meaning she assented with the caspakian equivalent of an affirmative nod and then touching my rifle motioned me to follow her to the river  at the bank she paused removed her belt and dagger dropping them to the ground at her side then unfastening the lower edge of her garment from the metal legband to which it was attached slipped it off her left shoulder and let it drop to the ground around her feet  it was done so naturally so simply and so quickly that it left me gasping like a fish out of water  turning she flashed a smile at me and then dived into the river and there she bathed while i stood guard over her  for five or ten minutes she splashed about and when she emerged her glistening skin was smooth and white and beautiful  without means of drying herself she simply ignored what to me would have seemed a necessity and in a moment was arrayed in her simple though effective costume  it was now within an hour of darkness and as i was nearly famished i led the way back about a quarter of a mile to a low meadow where we had seen antelope and small horses a short time before  here i brought down a young buck the report of my rifle sending the balance of the herd scampering for the woods where they were met by a chorus of hideous roars as the carnivora took advantage of their panic and leaped among them  with my huntingknife i removed a hindquarter and then we returned to camp  here i gathered a great quantity of wood from fallen trees ajor helping me but before i built a fire i also gathered sufficient loose rock to build my barricade against the frightful terrors of the night to come  i shall never forget the expression upon ajors face as she saw me strike a match and light the kindling beneath our campfire  it was such an expression as might transform a mortal face with awe as its owner beheld the mysterious workings of divinity  it was evident that ajor was quite unfamiliar with modern methods of firemaking  she had thought my rifle and pistol wonderful but these tiny slivers of wood which from a magic rub brought flame to the camp hearth were indeed miracles to her  as the meat roasted above the fire ajor and i tried once again to talk but though copiously filled with incentive gestures and sounds the conversation did not flourish notably  and then ajor took up in earnest the task of teaching me her language  she commenced as i later learned with the simplest form of speech known to caspak or for that matter to the worldthat employed by the bolu  i found it far from difficult and even though it was a great handicap upon my instructor that she could not speak my language she did remarkably well and demonstrated that she possessed ingenuity and intelligence of a high order  after we had eaten i added to the pile of firewood so that i could replenish the fire before the entrance to our barricade believing this as good a protection against the carnivora as we could have and then ajor and i sat down before it and the lesson proceeded while from all about us came the weird and awesome noises of the caspakian nightthe moaning and the coughing and roaring of the tigers the panthers and the lions the barking and the dismal howling of a wolf jackal and hyaenadon the shrill shrieks of stricken prey and the hissing of the great reptiles the voice of man alone was silent  but though the voice of this choirterrible rose and fell from far and near in all directions reaching at time such a tremendous volume of sound that the earth shook to it yet so engrossed was i in my lesson and in my teacher that often i was deaf to what at another time would have filled me with awe  the face and voice of the beautiful girl who leaned so eagerly toward me as she tried to explain the meaning of some word or correct my pronunciation of another quite entirely occupied my every faculty of perception  the firelight shone upon her animated features and sparkling eyes it accentuated the graceful motions of her gesturing arms and hands it sparkled from her white teeth and from her golden ornaments and glistened on the smooth firmness of her perfect skin  i am afraid that often i was more occupied with admiration of this beautiful animal than with a desire for knowledge but be that as it may i nevertheless learned much that evening though part of what i learned had naught to do with any new language  ajor seemed determined that i should speak caspakian as quickly as possible and i thought i saw in her desire a little of that allfeminine trait which has come down through all the ages from the first lady of the worldcuriosity  ajor desired that i should speak her tongue in order that she might satisfy a curiosity concerning me that was filling her to a point where she was in danger of bursting of that i was positive  she was a regular little animated questionmark she bubbled over with interrogations which were never to be satisfied unless i learned to speak her tongue  her eyes sparkled with excitement her hand flew in expressive gestures her little tongue raced with time yet all to no avail  i could say man and tree and cliff and lion and a number of other words in perfect caspakian but such a vocabulary was only tantalizing it did not lend itself well to a very general conversation and the result was that ajor would wax so wroth that she would clench her little fists and beat me on the breast as hard as ever she could and then she would sink back laughing as the humor of the situation captured her  she was trying to teach me some verbs by going through the actions herself as she repeated the proper word  we were very much engrossedso much so that we were giving no heed to what went on beyond our cavewhen ajor stopped very suddenly crying  kazor now she had been trying to teach me that ju meant stop so when she cried kazor and at the same time stopped i thought for a moment that this was part of my lessonfor the moment i forgot that kazor means beware i therefore repeated the word after her but when i saw the expression in her eyes as they were directed past me and saw her point toward the entrance to the cave i turned quicklyto see a hideous face at the small aperture leading out into the night  it was the fierce and snarling countenance of a gigantic bear  i have hunted silvertips in the white mountains of arizona and thought them quite the largest and most formidable of big game but from the appearance of the head of this awful creature i judged that the largest grizzly i had ever seen would shrink by comparison to the dimensions of a newfoundland dog  our fire was just within the cave the smoke rising through the apertures between the rocks that i had piled in such a way that they arched inward toward the cliff at the top  the opening by means of which we were to reach the outside was barricaded with a few large fragments which did not by any means close it entirely but through the apertures thus left no large animal could gain ingress  i had depended most however upon our fire feeling that none of the dangerous nocturnal beasts of prey would venture close to the flames  in this however i was quite evidently in error for the great bear stood with his nose not a foot from the blaze which was now low owing to the fact that i had been so occupied with my lesson and my teacher that i had neglected to replenish it  ajor whipped out her futile little knife and pointed to my rifle  at the same time she spoke in a quite level voice entirely devoid of nervousness or any evidence of fear or panic  i knew she was exhorting me to fire upon the beast but this i did not wish to do other than as a last resort for i was quite sure that even my heavy bullets would not more than further enrage himin which case he might easily force an entrance to our cave  instead of firing i piled some more wood upon the fire and as the smoke and blaze arose in the beasts face it backed away growling most frightfully but i still could see two ugly points of light blazing in the outer darkness and hear its growls rumbling terrifically without  for some time the creature stood there watching the entrance to our frail sanctuary while i racked my brains in futile endeavor to plan some method of defense or escape  i knew full well that should the bear make a determined effort to get at us the rocks i had piled as a barrier would come tumbling down about his giant shoulders like a house of cards and that he would walk directly in upon us  ajor having less knowledge of the effectiveness of firearms than i and therefore greater confidence in them entreated me to shoot the beast but i knew that the chance that i could stop it with a single shot was most remote while that i should but infuriate it was real and present and so i waited for what seemed an eternity watching those devilish points of fire glaring balefully at us and listening to the everincreasing volume of those seismic growls which seemed to rumble upward from the bowels of the earth shaking the very cliffs beneath which we cowered until at last i saw that the brute was again approaching the aperture  it availed me nothing that i piled the blaze high with firewood until ajor and i were near to roasting on came that mighty engine of destruction until once again the hideous face yawned its fanged yawn directly within the barriers opening  it stood thus a moment and then the head was withdrawn  i breathed a sigh of relief the thing had altered its intention and was going on in search of other and more easily procurable prey the fire had been too much for it  but my joy was shortlived and my heart sank once again as a moment later i saw a mighty paw insinuated into the openinga paw as large around as a large dishpan  very gently the paw toyed with the great rock that partly closed the entrance pushed and pulled upon it and then very deliberately drew it outward and to one side  again came the head and this time much farther into the cavern but still the great shoulders would not pass through the opening  ajor moved closer to me until her shoulder touched my side and i thought i felt a slight tremor run through her body but otherwise she gave no indication of fear  involuntarily i threw my left arm about her and drew her to me for an instant  it was an act of reassurance rather than a caress though i must admit that again and even in the face of death i thrilled at the contact with her and then i released her and threw my rifle to my shoulder for at last i had reached the conclusion that nothing more could be gained by waiting  my only hope was to get as many shots into the creature as i could before it was upon me  already it had torn away a second rock and was in the very act of forcing its huge bulk through the opening it had now made  so now i took careful aim between its eyes my right fingers closed firmly and evenly upon the small of the stock drawing back my triggerfinger by the muscular action of the hand  the bullet could not fail to hit its mark  i held my breath lest i swerve the muzzle a hair by my breathing  i was as steady and cool as i ever had been upon a targetrange and i had the full consciousness of a perfect hit in anticipation i knew that i could not miss  and then as the bear surged forward toward me the hammer fellfutilely upon an imperfect cartridge  almost simultaneously i heard from without a perfectly hellish roar the bear gave voice to a series of growls far transcending in volume and ferocity anything that he had yet essayed and at the same time backed quickly from the cave  for an instant i couldnt understand what had happened to cause this sudden retreat when his prey was practically within his clutches  the idea that the harmless clicking of the hammer had frightened him was too ridiculous to entertain however we had not long to wait before we could at least guess at the cause of the diversion for from without came mingled growls and roars and the sound of great bodies thrashing about until the earth shook the bear had been attacked in the rear by some other mighty beast and the two were now locked in a titanic struggle for supremacy  with brief respites during which we could hear the labored breathing of the contestants the battle continued for the better part of an hour until the sounds of combat grew gradually less and finally ceased entirely  at ajors suggestion made by signs and a few of the words we knew in common i moved the fire directly to the entrance to the cave so that a beast would have to pass directly through the flames to reach us and then we sat and waited for the victor of the battle to come and claim his reward but though we sat for a long time with our eyes glued to the opening we saw no sign of any beast  at last i signed to ajor to lie down for i knew that she must have sleep and i sat on guard until nearly morning when the girl awoke and insisted that i take some rest nor would she be denied but dragged me down as she laughingly menaced me with her knife    chapter 3  when i awoke it was daylight and i found ajor squatting before a fine bed of coals roasting a large piece of antelopemeat  believe me the sight of the new day and the delicious odor of the cooking meat filled me with renewed happiness and hope that had been all but expunged by the experience of the previous night and perhaps the slender figure of the brightfaced girl proved also a potent restorative  she looked up and smiled at me showing those perfect teeth and dimpling with evident happinessthe most adorable picture that i had ever seen  i recall that it was then i first regretted that she was only a little untutored savage and so far beneath me in the scale of evolution  her first act was to beckon me to follow her outside and there she pointed to the explanation of our rescue from the beara huge sabertooth tiger its fine coat and its flesh torn to ribbons lying dead a few paces from our cave and beside it equally mangled and disemboweled was the carcass of a huge cavebear  to have had ones life saved by a sabertooth tiger and in the twentieth century into the bargain was an experience that was to say the least unique but it had happenedi had the proof of it before my eyes  so enormous are the great carnivora of caspak that they must feed perpetually to support their giant thews and the result is that they will eat the meat of any other creature and will attack anything that comes within their ken no matter how formidable the quarry  from later observationi mention this as worthy the attention of paleontologists and naturalistsi came to the conclusion that such creatures as the cavebear the cavelion and the sabertooth tiger as well as the larger carnivorous reptiles make ordinarily two kills a dayone in the morning and one after night  they immediately devour the entire carcass after which they lie up and sleep for a few hours fortunately their numbers are comparatively few otherwise there would be no other life within caspak  it is their very voracity that keeps their numbers down to a point which permits other forms of life to persist for even in the season of love the great males often turn upon their own mates and devour them while both males and females occasionally devour their young  how the human and semihuman races have managed to survive during all the countless ages that these conditions must have existed here is quite beyond me  after breakfast ajor and i set out once more upon our northward journey  we had gone but a little distance when we were attacked by a number of apelike creatures armed with clubs  they seemed a little higher in the scale than the alus  ajor told me they were bolu or clubmen  a revolvershot killed one and scattered the others but several times later during the day we were menaced by them until we had left their country and entered that of the stolu or hatchetmen these people were less hairy and more manlike nor did they appear so anxious to destroy us  rather they were curious and followed us for some distance examining us most closely  they called out to us and ajor answered them but her replies did not seem to satisfy them for they gradually became threatening and i think they were preparing to attack us when a small deer that had been hiding in some low brush suddenly broke cover and dashed across our front  we needed meat for it was near one oclock and i was getting hungry so i drew my pistol and with a single shot dropped the creature in its tracks  the effect upon the bolu was electrical  immediately they abandoned all thoughts of war and turning scampered for the forest which fringed our path  that night we spent beside a little stream in the stolu country  we found a tiny cave in the rock bank so hidden away that only chance could direct a beast of prey to it and after we had eaten of the deermeat and some fruit which ajor gathered we crawled into the little hole and with sticks and stones which i had gathered for the purpose i erected a strong barricade inside the entrance  nothing could reach us without swimming and wading through the stream and i felt quite secure from attack  our quarters were rather cramped  the ceiling was so low that we could not stand up and the floor so narrow that it was with difficulty that we both wedged into it together but we were very tired and so we made the most of it and so great was the feeling of security that i am sure i fell asleep as soon as i had stretched myself beside ajor  during the three days which followed our progress was exasperatingly slow  i doubt if we made ten miles in the entire three days  the country was hideously savage so that we were forced to spend hours at a time in hiding from one or another of the great beasts which menaced us continually  there were fewer reptiles but the quantity of carnivora seemed to have increased and the reptiles that we did see were perfectly gigantic  i shall never forget one enormous specimen which we came upon browsing upon waterreeds at the edge of the great sea  it stood well over twelve feet high at the rump its highest point and with its enormously long tail and neck it was somewhere between seventyfive and a hundred feet in length  its head was ridiculously small its body was unarmored but its great bulk gave it a most formidable appearance  my experience of caspakian life led me to believe that the gigantic creature would but have to see us to attack us and so i raised my rifle and at the same time drew away toward some brush which offered concealment but ajor only laughed and picking up a stick ran toward the great thing shouting  the little head was raised high upon the long neck as the animal stupidly looked here and there in search of the author of the disturbance  at last its eyes discovered tiny little ajor and then she hurled the stick at the diminutive head  with a cry that sounded not unlike the bleat of a sheep the colossal creature shuffled into the water and was soon submerged  as i slowly recalled my collegiate studies and paleontological readings in bowens textbooks i realized that i had looked upon nothing less than a diplodocus of the upper jurassic but how infinitely different was the true live thing from the crude restorations of hatcher and holland  i had had the idea that the diplodocus was a landanimal but evidently it is partially amphibious  i have seen several since my first encounter and in each case the creature took to the sea for concealment as soon as it was disturbed  with the exception of its gigantic tail it has no weapon of defense but with this appendage it can lash so terrific a blow as to lay low even a giant cavebear stunned and broken  it is a stupid simple gentle beastone of the few within caspak which such a description might even remotely fit  for three nights we slept in trees finding no caves or other places of concealment  here we were free from the attacks of the large land carnivora but the smaller flying reptiles the snakes leopards and panthers were a constant menace though by no means as much to be feared as the huge beasts that roamed the surface of the earth  at the close of the third day ajor and i were able to converse with considerable fluency and it was a great relief to both of us especially to ajor  she now did nothing but ask questions whenever i would let her which could not be all the time as our preservation depended largely upon the rapidity with which i could gain knowledge of the geography and customs of caspak and accordingly i had to ask numerous questions myself  i enjoyed immensely hearing and answering her so naive were many of her queries and so filled with wonder was she at the things i told her of the world beyond the lofty barriers of caspak not once did she seem to doubt me however marvelous my statements must have seemed and doubtless they were the cause of marvel to ajor who before had never dreamed that any life existed beyond caspak and the life she knew  artless though many of her questions were they evidenced a keen intellect and a shrewdness which seemed far beyond her years of her experience  altogether i was finding my little savage a mighty interesting and companionable person and i often thanked the kind fate that directed the crossing of our paths  from her i learned much of caspak but there still remained the mystery that had proved so baffling to bowen tylerthe total absence of young among the ape the semihuman and the human races with which both he and i had come in contact upon opposite shores of the inland sea  ajor tried to explain the matter to me though it was apparent that she could not conceive how so natural a condition should demand explanation  she told me that among the galus there were a few babies that she had once been a baby but that most of her people came up as he put it cor sva jo or literally from the beginning and as they all did when they used that phrase she would wave a broad gesture toward the south  for long she explained leaning very close to me and whispering the words into my ear while she cast apprehensive glances about and mostly skyward for long my mother kept me hidden lest the wieroo passing through the air by night should come and take me away to oooh  and the child shuddered as she voiced the word  i tried to get her to tell me more but her terror was so real when she spoke of the wieroo and the land of oooh where they dwell that i at last desisted though i did learn that the wieroo carried off only female babes and occasionally women of the galus who had come up from the beginning it was all very mysterious and unfathomable but i got the idea that the wieroo were creatures of imaginationthe demons or gods of her race omniscient and omnipresent  this led me to assume that the galus had a religious sense and further questioning brought out the fact that such was the case  ajor spoke in tones of reverence of luata the god of heat and life  the word is derived from two others  lua meaning sun and ata meaning variously eggs life young and reproduction  she told me that they worshiped luata in several forms as fire the sun eggs and other material objects which suggested heat and reproduction  i had noticed that whenever i built a fire ajor outlined in the air before her with a forefinger an isosceles triangle and that she did the same in the morning when she first viewed the sun  at first i had not connected her act with anything in particular but after we learned to converse and she had explained a little of her religious superstitions i realized that she was making the sign of the triangle as a roman catholic makes the sign of the cross  always the short side of the triangle was uppermost  as she explained all this to me she pointed to the decorations on her golden armlets upon the knob of her daggerhilt and upon the band which encircled her right leg above the kneealways was the design partly made up of isosceles triangles and when she explained the significance of this particular geometric figure i at once grasped its appropriateness  we were now in the country of the bandlu the spearmen of caspak bowen had remarked in his narrative that these people were analogous to the socalled cromagnon race of the upper paleolithic and i was therefore very anxious to see them  nor was i to be disappointed i saw them all right  we had left the stolu country and literally fought our way through cordons of wild beasts for two days when we decided to make camp a little earlier than usual owing to the fact that we had reached a line of cliffs running east and west in which were numerous likely cavelodgings  we were both very tired and the sight of these caverns several of which could be easily barricaded decided us to halt until the following morning  it took but a few minutes exploration to discover one particular cavern high up the face of the cliff which seemed ideal for our purpose  it opened upon a narrow ledge where we could build our cookfire the opening was so small that we had to lie flat and wriggle through it to gain ingress while the interior was highceiled and spacious  i lighted a faggot and looked about but as far as i could see the chamber ran back into the cliff  laying aside my rifle pistol and heavy ammunitionbelt i left ajor in the cave while i went down to gather firewood  we already had meat and fruits which we had gathered just before reaching the cliffs and my canteen was filled with fresh water  therefore all we required was fuel and as i always saved ajors strength when i could i would not permit her to accompany me  the poor girl was very tired but she would have gone with me until she dropped i know so loyal was she she was the best comrade in the world and sometimes i regretted and sometimes i was glad that she was not of my own caste for had she been i should unquestionably have fallen in love with her  as it was we traveled together like two boys with huge respect for each other but no softer sentiment  there was little timber close to the base of the cliffs and so i was forced to enter the wood some two hundred yards distant  i realize now how foolhardy was my act in such a land as caspak teeming with danger and with death but there is a certain amount of fool in every man and whatever proportion of it i own must have been in the ascendant that day for the truth of the matter is that i went down into those woods absolutely defenseless and i paid the price as people usually do for their indiscretions  as i searched around in the brush for likely pieces of firewood my head bowed and my eyes upon the ground i suddenly felt a great weight hurl itself upon me  i struggled to my knees and seized my assailant a huge naked mannaked except for a breechcloth of snakeskin the head hanging down to the knees  the fellow was armed with a stoneshod spear a stone knife and a hatchet in his black hair were several gaycolored feathers  as we struggled to and fro i was slowly gaining advantage of him when a score of his fellows came running up and overpowered me  they bound my hands behind me with long rawhide thongs and then surveyed me critically  i found them finelooking specimens of manhood for the most part  there were some among them who bore a resemblance to the stolu and were hairy but the majority had massive heads and not unlovely features  there was little about them to suggest the ape as in the stolu bolu and alus  i expected them to kill me at once but they did not  instead they questioned me but it was evident that they did not believe my story for they scoffed and laughed  the galus have turned you out they cried  if you go back to them you will die  if you remain here you will die  we shall kill you but first we shall have a dance and you shall dance with usthe dance of death  it sounded quite reassuring  but i knew that i was not to be killed immediately and so i took heart  they led me toward the cliffs and as we approached them i glanced up and was sure that i saw ajors bright eyes peering down upon us from our lofty cave but she gave no sign if she saw me and we passed on rounded the end of the cliffs and proceeded along the opposite face of them until we came to a section literally honeycombed with caves  all about upon the ground and swarming the ledges before the entrances were hundreds of members of the tribe  there were many women but no babes or children though i noticed that the females had better developed breasts than any that i had seen among the hatchetmen the clubmen the alus or the apes  in fact among the lower orders of caspakian man the female breast is but a rudimentary organ barely suggested in the apes and alus and only a little more defined in the bolu and stolu though always increasingly so until it is found about half developed in the females of the spearmen yet never was there an indication that the females had suckled young nor were there any young among them  some of the bandlu women were quite comely  the figures of all both men and women were symmetrical though heavy and though there were some who verged strongly upon the stolu type there were others who were positively handsome and whose bodies were quite hairless  the alus are all bearded but among the bolu the beard disappears in the women the stolu men show a sparse beard the bandlu none and there is little hair upon the bodies of their women  the members of the tribe showed great interest in me especially in my clothing the like of which of course they never had seen  they pulled and hauled upon me and some of them struck me but for the most part they were not inclined to brutality  it was only the hairier ones who most closely resembled the stolu who maltreated me  at last my captors led me into a great cave in the mouth of which a fire was burning  the floor was littered with filth including the bones of many animals and the atmosphere reeked with the stench of human bodies and putrefying flesh  here they fed me releasing my arms and i ate of halfcooked aurochs steak and a stew which may have been made of snakes for many of the long round pieces of meat suggested them most nauseatingly  the meal completed they led me well within the cavern which they lighted with torches stuck in various crevices in the light of which i saw to my astonishment that the walls were covered with paintings and etchings  there were aurochs red deer sabertooth tiger cavebear hyaenadon and many other examples of the fauna of caspak done in colors usually of four shades of brown or scratched upon the surface of the rock  often they were superimposed upon each other until it required careful examination to trace out the various outlines  but they all showed a rather remarkable aptitude for delineation which further fortified bowens comparisons between these people and the extinct cromagnons whose ancient art is still preserved in the caverns of niaux and le portel  the bandlu however did not have the bow and arrow and in this respect they differ from their extinct progenitors or descendants of western europe  should any of my friends chance to read the story of my adventures upon caprona i hope they will not be bored by these diversions and if they are i can only say that i am writing my memoirs for my own edification and therefore setting down those things which interested me particularly at the time  i have no desire that the general public should ever have access to these pages but it is possible that my friends may and also certain savants who are interested and to them while i do not apologize for my philosophizing i humbly explain that they are witnessing the groupings of a finite mind after the infinite the search for explanations of the inexplicable  in a far recess of the cavern my captors bade me halt  again my hands were secured and this time my feet as well  during the operation they questioned me and i was mighty glad that the marked similarity between the various tribal tongues of caspak enabled us to understand each other perfectly even though they were unable to believe or even to comprehend the truth of my origin and the circumstances of my advent in caspak and finally they left me saying that they would come for me before the dance of death upon the morrow  before they departed with their torches i saw that i had not been conducted to the farthest extremity of the cavern for a dark and gloomy corridor led beyond my prison room into the heart of the cliff  i could not but marvel at the immensity of this great underground grotto  already i had traversed several hundred yards of it from many points of which other corridors diverged  the whole cliff must be honeycombed with apartments and passages of which this community occupied but a comparatively small part so that the possibility of the more remote passages being the lair of savage beasts that have other means of ingress and egress than that used by the bandlu filled me with dire forebodings  i believe that i am not ordinarily hysterically apprehensive yet i must confess that under the conditions with which i was confronted i felt my nerves to be somewhat shaken  on the morrow i was to die some sort of nameless death for the diversion of a savage horde but the morrow held fewer terrors for me than the present and i submit to any fairminded man if it is not a terrifying thing to lie bound hand and foot in the stygian blackness of an immense cave peopled by unknown dangers in a land overrun by hideous beasts and reptiles of the greatest ferocity  at any moment perhaps at this very moment some silentfooted beast of prey might catch my scent where it laired in some contiguous passage and might creep stealthily upon me  i craned my neck about and stared through the inky darkness for the twin spots of blazing hate which i knew would herald the coming of my executioner so real were the imaginings of my overwrought brain that i broke into a cold sweat in absolute conviction that some beast was close before me yet the hours dragged and no sound broke the gravelike stillness of the cavern  during that period of eternity many events of my life passed before my mental vision a vast parade of friends and occurrences which would be blotted out forever on the morrow  i cursed myself for the foolish act which had taken me from the searchparty that so depended upon me and i wondered what progress if any they had made  were they still beyond the barrier cliffs awaiting my return  or had they found a way into caspak  i felt that the latter would be the truth for the party was not made up of men easily turned from a purpose  quite probable it was that they were already searching for me but that they would ever find a trace of me i doubted  long since had i come to the conclusion that it was beyond human prowess to circle the shores of the inland sea of caspak in the face of the myriad menaces which lurked in every shadow by day and by night  long since had i given up any hope of reaching the point where i had made my entry into the country and so i was now equally convinced that our entire expedition had been worse than futile before ever it was conceived since bowen j  tyler and his wife could not by any possibility have survived during all these long months no more could bradley and his party of seamen be yet in existence  if the superior force and equipment of my party enabled them to circle the north end of the sea they might some day come upon the broken wreck of my plane hanging in the great tree to the south but long before that my bones would be added to the litter upon the floor of this mighty cavern  and through all my thoughts real and fanciful moved the image of a perfect girl cleareyed and strong and straight and beautiful with the carriage of a queen and the supple undulating grace of a leopard though i loved my friends their fate seemed of less importance to me than the fate of this little barbarian stranger for whom i had convinced myself many a time i felt no greater sentiment than passing friendship for a fellowwayfarer in this land of horrors  yet i so worried and fretted about her and her future that at last i quite forgot my own predicament though i still struggled intermittently with bonds in vain endeavor to free myself as much however that i might hasten to her protection as that i might escape the fate which had been planned for me  and while i was thus engaged and had for the moment forgotten my apprehensions concerning prowling beasts i was startled into tense silence by a distinct and unmistakable sound coming from the dark corridor farther toward the heart of the cliffthe sound of padded feet moving stealthily in my direction  i believe that never before in all my life even amidst the terrors of childhood nights have i suffered such a sensation of extreme horror as i did that moment in which i realized that i must lie bound and helpless while some horrid beast of prey crept upon me to devour me in that utter darkness of the bandlu pits of caspak  i reeked with cold sweat and my flesh crawledi could feel it crawl  if ever i came nearer to abject cowardice i do not recall the instance and yet it was not that i was afraid to die for i had long since given myself up as losta few days of caspak must impress anyone with the utter nothingness of life  the waters the land the air teem with it and always it is being devoured by some other form of life  life is the cheapest thing in caspak as it is the cheapest thing on earth and doubtless the cheapest cosmic production  no i was not afraid to die in fact i prayed for death that i might be relieved of the frightfulness of the interval of life which remained to methe waiting the awful waiting for that fearsome beast to reach me and to strike  presently it was so close that i could hear its breathing and then it touched me and leaped quickly back as though it had come upon me unexpectedly  for long moments no sound broke the sepulchral silence of the cave  then i heard a movement on the part of the creature near me and again it touched me and i felt something like a hairless hand pass over my face and down until it touched the collar of my flannel shirt  and then subdued but filled with pent emotion a voice cried tom  i think i nearly fainted so great was the reaction  ajor  i managed to say  ajor my girl can it be you  oh tom she cried again in a trembly little voice and flung herself upon me sobbing softly  i had not known that ajor could cry  as she cut away my bonds she told me that from the entrance to our cave she had seen the bandlu coming out of the forest with me and she had followed until they took me into the cave which she had seen was upon the opposite side of the cliff in which ours was located and then knowing that she could do nothing for me until after the bandlu slept she had hastened to return to our cave  with difficulty she had reached it after having been stalked by a cavelion and almost seized i trembled at the risk she had run  it had been her intention to wait until after midnight when most of the carnivora would have made their kills and then attempt to reach the cave in which i was imprisoned and rescue me  she explained that with my rifle and pistolboth of which she assured me she could use having watched me so many timesshe planned upon frightening the bandlu and forcing them to give me up  brave little girl  she would have risked her life willingly to save me  but some time after she reached our cave she heard voices from the far recesses within and immediately concluded that we had but found another entrance to the caves which the bandlu occupied upon the other face of the cliff then she had set out through those winding passages and in total darkness had groped her way guided solely by a marvelous sense of direction to where i lay  she had had to proceed with utmost caution lest she fall into some abyss in the darkness and in truth she had thrice come upon sheer drops and had been forced to take the most frightful risks to pass them  i shudder even now as i contemplate what this girl passed through for my sake and how she enhanced her peril in loading herself down with the weight of my arms and ammunition and the awkwardness of the long rifle which she was unaccustomed to bearing  i could have knelt and kissed her hand in reverence and gratitude nor am i ashamed to say that that is precisely what i did after i had been freed from my bonds and heard the story of her trials  brave little ajor  wondergirl out of the dim unthinkable past  never before had she been kissed but she seemed to sense something of the meaning of the new caress for she leaned forward in the dark and pressed her own lips to my forehead  a sudden urge surged through me to seize her and strain her to my bosom and cover her hot young lips with the kisses of a real love but i did not do so for i knew that i did not love her and to have kissed her thus with passion would have been to inflict a great wrong upon her who had offered her life for mine  no ajor should be as safe with me as with her own mother if she had one which i was inclined to doubt even though she told me that she had once been a babe and hidden by her mother  i had come to doubt if there was such a thing as a mother in caspak a mother such as we know from the bolu to the krolu there is no word which corresponds with our word mother  they speak of ata and cor sva jo meaning reproduction and from the beginning and point toward the south but no one has a mother  after considerable difficulty we gained what we thought was our cave only to find that it was not and then we realized that we were lost in the labyrinthine mazes of the great cavern  we retraced our steps and sought the point from which we had started but only succeeded in losing ourselves the more  ajor was aghastnot so much from fear of our predicament but that she should have failed in the functioning of that wonderful sense she possessed in common with most other creatures caspakian which makes it possible for them to move unerringly from place to place without compass or guide  hand in hand we crept along searching for an opening into the outer world yet realizing that at each step we might be burrowing more deeply into the heart of the great cliff or circling futilely in the vague wandering that could end only in death  and the darkness  it was almost palpable and utterly depressing  i had matches and in some of the more difficult places i struck one but we couldnt afford to waste them and so we groped our way slowly along doing the best we could to keep to one general direction in the hope that it would eventually lead us to an opening into the outer world  when i struck matches i noticed that the walls bore no paintings nor was there other sign that man had penetrated this far within the cliff nor any spoor of animals of other kinds  it would be difficult to guess at the time we spent wandering through those black corridors climbing steep ascents feeling our way along the edges of bottomless pits never knowing at what moment we might be plunged into some abyss and always haunted by the everpresent terror of death by starvation and thirst  as difficult as it was i still realized that it might have been infinitely worse had i had another companion than ajorcourageous uncomplaining loyal little ajor  she was tired and hungry and thirsty and she must have been discouraged but she never faltered in her cheerfulness  i asked her if she was afraid and she replied that here the wieroo could not get her and that if she died of hunger she would at least die with me and she was quite content that such should be her end  at the time i attributed her attitude to something akin to a doglike devotion to a new master who had been kind to her  i can take oath to the fact that i did not think it was anything more  whether we had been imprisoned in the cliff for a day or a week i could not say nor even now do i know  we became very tired and hungry the hours dragged we slept at least twice and then we rose and stumbled on always weaker and weaker  there were ages during which the trend of the corridors was always upward  it was heartbreaking work for people in the state of exhaustion in which we then were but we clung tenaciously to it  we stumbled and fell we sank through pure physical inability to retain our feet but always we managed to rise at last and go on  at first wherever it had been possible we had walked hand in hand lest we become separated and later when i saw that ajor was weakening rapidly we went side by side i supporting her with an arm about her waist  i still retained the heavy burden of my armament but with the rifle slung to my back my hands were free  when i too showed indisputable evidences of exhaustion ajor suggested that i lay aside my arms and ammunition but i told her that as it would mean certain death for me to traverse caspak without them i might as well take the chance of dying here in the cave with them for there was the other chance that we might find our way to liberty  there came a time when ajor could no longer walk and then it was that i picked her up in my arms and carried her  she begged me to leave her saying that after i found an exit i could come back and get her but she knew and she knew that i knew that if ever i did leave her i could never find her again  yet she insisted  barely had i sufficient strength to take a score of steps at a time then i would have to sink down and rest for five to ten minutes  i dont know what force urged me on and kept me going in the face of an absolute conviction that my efforts were utterly futile  i counted us already as good as dead but still i dragged myself along until the time came that i could no longer rise but could only crawl along a few inches at a time dragging ajor beside me  her sweet voice now almost inaudible from weakness implored me to abandon her and save myselfshe seemed to think only of me  of course i couldnt have left her there alone no matter how much i might have desired to do so but the fact of the matter was that i didnt desire to leave her  what i said to her then came very simply and naturally to my lips  it couldnt very well have been otherwise i imagine for with death so close i doubt if people are much inclined to heroics  i would rather not get out at all ajor i said to her than to get out without you  we were resting against a rocky wall and ajor was leaning against me her head on my breast  i could feel her press closer to me and one hand stroked my arm in a weak caress but she didnt say anything nor were words necessary  after a few minutes more rest we started on again upon our utterly hopeless way but i soon realized that i was weakening rapidly and presently i was forced to admit that i was through  its no use ajor i said ive come as far as i can  it may be that if i sleep i can go on again after but i knew that that was not true and that the end was near  yes sleep said ajor  we will sleep togetherforever  she crept close to me as i lay on the hard floor and pillowed her head upon my arm  with the little strength which remained to me i drew her up until our lips touched and then i whispered goodbye  i must have lost consciousness almost immediately for i recall nothing more until i suddenly awoke out of a troubled sleep during which i dreamed that i was drowning to find the cave lighted by what appeared to be diffused daylight and a tiny trickle of water running down the corridor and forming a puddle in the little depression in which it chanced that ajor and i lay  i turned my eyes quickly upon ajor fearful for what the light might disclose but she still breathed though very faintly  then i searched about for an explanation of the light and soon discovered that it came from about a bend in the corridor just ahead of us and at the top of a steep incline and instantly i realized that ajor and i had stumbled by night almost to the portal of salvation  had chance taken us a few yards further up either of the corridors which diverged from ours just ahead of us we might have been irrevocably lost we might still be lost but at least we could die in the light of day out of the horrid blackness of this terrible cave  i tried to rise and found that sleep had given me back a portion of my strength and then i tasted the water and was further refreshed  i shook ajor gently by the shoulder but she did not open her eyes and then i gathered a few drops of water in my cupped palm and let them trickle between her lips  this revived her so that she raised her lids and when she saw me she smiled  what happened she asked  where are we  we are at the end of the corridor i replied and daylight is coming in from the outside world just ahead  we are saved ajor  she sat up then and looked about and then quite womanlike she burst into tears  it was the reaction of course and then too she was very weak  i took her in my arms and quieted her as best i could and finally with my help she got to her feet for she as well as i had found some slight recuperation in sleep  together we staggered upward toward the light and at the first turn we saw an opening a few yards ahead of us and a leaden sky beyonda leaden sky from which was falling a drizzling rain the author of our little trickling stream which had given us drink when we were most in need of it  the cave had been damp and cold but as we crawled through the aperture the muggy warmth of the caspakian air caressed and confronted us even the rain was warmer than the atmosphere of those dark corridors  we had water now and warmth and i was sure that caspak would soon offer us meat or fruit but as we came to where we could look about we saw that we were upon the summit of the cliffs where there seemed little reason to expect game  however there were trees and among them we soon descried edible fruits with which we broke our long fast    chapter 4  we spent two days upon the clifftop resting and recuperating  there was some small game which gave us meat and the little pools of rainwater were sufficient to quench our thirst  the sun came out a few hours after we emerged from the cave and in its warmth we soon cast off the gloom which our recent experiences had saddled upon us  upon the morning of the third day we set out to search for a path down to the valley  below us to the north we saw a large pool lying at the foot of the cliffs and in it we could discern the women of the bandlu lying in the shallow waters while beyond and close to the base of the mighty barriercliffs there was a large party of bandlu warriors going north to hunt  we had a splendid view from our lofty clifftop  dimly to the west we could see the farther shore of the inland sea and southwest the large southern island loomed distinctly before us  a little east of north was the northern island which ajor shuddering whispered was the home of the wieroothe land of oooh it lay at the far end of the lake and was barely visible to us being fully sixty miles away  from our elevation and in a clearer atmosphere it would have stood out distinctly but the air of caspak is heavy with moisture with the result that distant objects are blurred and indistinct  ajor also told me that the mainland east of oooh was her landthe land of the galu she pointed out the cliffs at its southern boundary which mark the frontier south of which lies the country of kroluthe archers  we now had but to pass through the balance of the bandlu territory and that of the krolu to be within the confines of her own land but that meant traversing thirtyfive miles of hostile country filled with every imaginable terror and possibly many beyond the powers of imagination i would certainly have given a lot for my plane at that moment for with it twenty minutes would have landed us within the confines of ajors country  we finally found a place where we could slip over the edge of the cliff onto a narrow ledge which seemed to give evidence of being something of a gamepath to the valley though it apparently had not been used for some time  i lowered ajor at the end of my rifle and then slid over myself and i am free to admit that my hair stood on end during the process for the drop was considerable and the ledge appallingly narrow with a frightful drop sheer below down to the rocks at the base of the cliff but with ajor there to catch and steady me i made it all right and then we set off down the trail toward the valley  there were two or three more bad places but for the most part it was an easy descent and we came to the highest of the bandlu caves without further trouble  here we went more slowly lest we should be set upon by some member of the tribe  we must have passed about half the bandlu cavelevels before we were accosted and then a huge fellow stepped out in front of me barring our further progress  who are you he asked and he recognized me and i him for he had been one of those who had led me back into the cave and bound me the night that i had been captured  from me his gaze went to ajor  he was a finelooking man with clear intelligent eyes a good forehead and superb physiqueby far the highest type of caspakian i had yet seen barring ajor of course  you are a true galu he said to ajor but this man is of a different mold  he has the face of a galu but his weapons and the strange skins he wears upon his body are not of the galus nor of caspak  who is he  he is tom replied ajor succinctly  there is no such people asserted the bandlu quite truthfully toying with his spear in a most suggestive manner  my name is tom i explained and i am from a country beyond caspak i thought it best to propitiate him if possible because of the necessity of conserving ammunition as well as to avoid the loud alarm of a shot which might bring other bandlu warriors upon us  i am from america a land of which you never heard and i am seeking others of my countrymen who are in caspak and from whom i am lost i have no quarrel with you or your people  let us go our way in peace  you are going there he asked and pointed toward the north  i am i replied  he was silent for several minutes apparently weighing some thought in his mind  at last he spoke  what is that he asked  and what is that  he pointed first at my rifle and then to my pistol  they are weapons i replied weapons which kill at a great distance i pointed to the women in the pool beneath us  with this i said tapping my pistol i could kill as many of those women as i cared to without moving a step from where we now stand  he looked his incredulity but i went on  and with thisi weighed my rifle at the balance in the palm of my right handi could slay one of those distant warriors  and i waved my left hand toward the tiny figures of the hunters far to the north  the fellow laughed  do it he cried derisively and then it may be that i shall believe the balance of your strange story  but i do not wish to kill any of them i replied  why should i  why not he insisted  they would have killed you when they had you prisoner  they would kill you now if they could get their hands on you and they would eat you into the bargain  but i know why you do not try itit is because you have spoken lies your weapon will not kill at a great distance  it is only a queerly wrought club  for all i know you are nothing more than a lowly bolu  why should you wish me to kill your own people i asked  they are no longer my people he replied proudly  last night in the very middle of the night the call came to me  like that it came into my headand he struck his hands together smartly oncethat i had risen  i have been waiting for it and expecting it for a long time today i am a krolu  today i go into the coslupak unpeopled country or literally no mans land between the bandlu and the krolu and there i fashion my bow and my arrows and my shield there i hunt the red deer for the leathern jerkin which is the badge of my new estate  when these things are done i can go to the chief of the krolu and he dare not refuse me  that is why you may kill those low bandlu if you wish to live for i am in a hurry  but why do you wish to kill me i asked  he looked puzzled and finally gave it up  i do not know he admitted  it is the way in caspak  if we do not kill we shall be killed therefore it is wise to kill first whomever does not belong to ones own people  this morning i hid in my cave till the others were gone upon the hunt for i knew that they would know at once that i had become a krolu and would kill me  they will kill me if they find me in the coslupak so will the krolu if they come upon me before i have won my krolu weapons and jerkin  you would kill me if you could and that is the reason i know that you speak lies when you say that your weapons will kill at a great distance  would they you would long since have killed me  come  i have no more time to waste in words  i will spare the woman and take her with me to the krolu for she is comely  and with that he advanced upon me with raised spear  my rifle was at my hip at the ready  he was so close that i did not need to raise it to my shoulder having but to pull the trigger to send him into kingdom come whenever i chose but yet i hesitated  it was difficult to bring myself to take a human life  i could feel no enmity toward this savage barbarian who acted almost as wholly upon instinct as might a wild beast and to the last moment i was determined to seek some way to avoid what now seemed inevitable  ajor stood at my shoulder her knife ready in her hand and a sneer on her lips at his suggestion that he would take her with him  just as i thought i should have to fire a chorus of screams broke from the women beneath us  i saw the man halt and glance downward and following his example my eyes took in the panic and its cause  the women had evidently been quitting the pool and slowly returning toward the caves when they were confronted by a monstrous cavelion which stood directly between them and their cliffs in the center of the narrow path that led down to the pool among the tumbled rocks screaming the women were rushing madly back to the pool  it will do them no good remarked the man a trace of excitement in his voice  it will do them no good for the lion will wait until they come out and take as many as he can carry away and there is one there he added a trace of sadness in his tone whom i hoped would soon follow me to the krolu  together have we come up from the beginning  he raised his spear above his head and poised it ready to hurl downward at the lion  she is nearest to him he muttered  he will get her and she will never come to me among the krolu or ever thereafter  it is useless  no warrior lives who could hurl a weapon so great a distance  but even as he spoke i was leveling my rifle upon the great brute below and as he ceased speaking i squeezed the trigger  my bullet must have struck to a hair the point at which i had aimed for it smashed the brutes spine back of his shoulders and tore on through his heart dropping him dead in his tracks  for a moment the women were as terrified by the report of the rifle as they had been by the menace of the lion but when they saw that the loud noise had evidently destroyed their enemy they came creeping cautiously back to examine the carcass  the man toward whom i had immediately turned after firing lest he should pursue his threatened attack stood staring at me in amazement and admiration  why he asked if you could do that did you not kill me long before  i told you i replied that i had no quarrel with you  i do not care to kill men with whom i have no quarrel  but he could not seem to get the idea through his head  i can believe now that you are not of caspak he admitted for no caspakian would have permitted such an opportunity to escape him this however i found later to be an exaggeration as the tribes of the west coast and even the krolu of the east coast are far less bloodthirsty than he would have had me believe  and your weapon he continued  you spoke true words when i thought you spoke lies  and then suddenly let us be friends  i turned to ajor  can i trust him i asked  yes she replied  why not  has he not asked to be friends  i was not at the time well enough acquainted with caspakian ways to know that truthfulness and loyalty are two of the strongest characteristics of these primitive people  they are not sufficiently cultured to have become adept in hypocrisy treason and dissimulation there are of course a few exceptions  we can go north together continued the warrior  i will fight for you and you can fight for me  until death will i serve you for you have saved soal whom i had given up as dead  he threw down his spear and covered both his eyes with the palms of his two hands  i looked inquiringly toward ajor who explained as best she could that this was the form of the caspakian oath of allegiance  you need never fear him after this she concluded  what should i do i asked  take his hands down from before his eyes and return his spear to him she explained  i did as she bade and the man seemed very pleased  i then asked what i should have done had i not wished to accept his friendship  they told me that had i walked away the moment that i was out of sight of the warrior we would have become deadly enemies again  but i could so easily have killed him as he stood there defenseless i exclaimed  yes replied the warrior but no man with good sense blinds his eyes before one whom he does not trust  it was rather a decent compliment and it taught me just how much i might rely on the loyalty of my new friend  i was glad to have him with us for he knew the country and was evidently a fearless warrior i wished that i might have recruited a battalion like him  as the women were now approaching the cliffs tomar the warrior suggested that we make our way to the valley before they could intercept us as they might attempt to detain us and were almost certain to set upon ajor  so we hastened down the narrow path reaching the foot of the cliffs but a short distance ahead of the women  they called after us to stop but we kept on at a rapid walk not wishing to have any trouble with them which could only result in the death of some of them  we had proceeded about a mile when we heard some one behind us calling tomar by name and when we stopped and looked around we saw a woman running rapidly toward us  as she approached nearer i could see that she was a very comely creature and like all her sex that i had seen in caspak apparently young  it is soal exclaimed tomar  is she mad that she follows me thus  in another moment the young woman stopped panting before us  she paid not the slightest attention to ajor or me but devouring tomar with her sparkling eyes she cried  i have risen  i have risen  soal was all that the man could say  yes she went on the call came to me just before i quit the pool but i did not know that it had come to you  i can see it in your eyes tomar my tomar  we shall go on together  and she threw herself into his arms  it was a very affecting sight for it was evident that these two had been mates for a long time and that they had each thought that they were about to be separated by that strange law of evolution which holds good in caspak and which was slowly unfolding before my incredulous mind  i did not then comprehend even a tithe of the wondrous process which goes on eternally within the confines of capronas barrier cliffs nor am i any too sure that i do even now  tomar explained to soal that it was i who had killed the cavelion and saved her life and that ajor was my woman and thus entitled to the same loyalty which was my due  at first ajor and soal were like a couple of stranger cats on a back fence but soon they began to accept each other under something of an armed truce and later became fast friends  soal was a mighty finelooking girl built like a tigress as to strength and sinuosity but withal sweet and womanly  ajor and i came to be very fond of her and she was i think equally fond of us  tomar was very much of a mana savage if you will but none the less a man  finding that traveling in company with tomar made our journey both easier and safer ajor and i did not continue on our way alone while the novitiates delayed their approach to the krolu country in order that they might properly fit themselves in the matter of arms and apparel but remained with them  thus we became well acquaintedto such an extent that we looked forward with regret to the day when they took their places among their new comrades and we should be forced to continue upon our way alone  it was a matter of much concern to tomar that the krolu would undoubtedly not receive ajor and me in a friendly manner and that consequently we should have to avoid these people  it would have been very helpful to us could we have made friends with them as their country abutted directly upon that of the galus  their friendship would have meant that ajors dangers were practically passed and that i had accomplished fully onehalf of my long journey in view of what i had passed through i often wondered what chance i had to complete that journey in search of my friends  the further south i should travel on the west side of the island the more frightful would the dangers become as i neared the stampinggrounds of the more hideous reptilia and the haunts of the alus and the holu all of which were at the southern half of the island and then if i should not find the members of my party what was to become of me  i could not live for long in any portion of caspak with which i was familiar the moment my ammunition was exhausted i should be as good as dead  there was a chance that the galus would receive me but even ajor could not say definitely whether they would or not and even provided that they would could i retrace my steps from the beginning after failing to find my own people and return to the far northern land of galus  i doubted it  however i was learning from ajor who was more or less of a fatalist a philosophy which was as necessary in caspak to peace of mind as is faith to the devout christian of the outer world    chapter 5  we were sitting before a little fire inside a safe grotto one night shortly after we had quit the cliffdwellings of the bandlu when soal raised a question which it had never occurred to me to propound to ajor  she asked her why she had left her own people and how she had come so far south as the country of the alus where i had found her  at first ajor hesitated to explain but at last she consented and for the first time i heard the complete story of her origin and experiences  for my benefit she entered into greater detail of explanation than would have been necessary had i been a native caspakian  i am a cosatalo commenced ajor and then she turned toward me  a cosatalo my tom is a woman lo who did not come from an egg and thus on up from the beginning  cor sva jo  i was a babe at my mothers breast  only among the galus are such and then but infrequently  the wieroo get most of us but my mother hid me until i had attained such size that the wieroo could not readily distinguish me from one who had come up from the beginning  i knew both my mother and my father as only such as i may  my father is high chief among the galus  his name is jor and both he and my mother came up from the beginning but one of them probably my mother had completed the seven cycles approximately seven hundred years with the result that their offspring might be cosatalo or born as are all the children of your race my tom as you tell me is the fact  i was therefore apart from my fellows in that my children would probably be as i of a higher state of evolution and so i was sought by the men of my people but none of them appealed to me  i cared for none  the most persistent was duseen a huge warrior of whom my father stood in considerable fear since it was quite possible that duseen could wrest from him his chieftainship of the galus  he has a large following of the newer galus those most recently come up from the krolu and as this class is usually much more powerful numerically than the older galus and as duseens ambition knows no bounds we have for a long time been expecting him to find some excuse for a break with jor the high chief my father  a further complication lay in the fact that duseen wanted me while i would have none of him and then came evidence to my fathers ears that he was in league with the wieroo a hunter returning late at night came trembling to my father saying that he had seen duseen talking with a wieroo in a lonely spot far from the village and that plainly he had heard the words  if you will help me i will help youi will deliver into your hands all cosatalo among the galus now and hereafter but for that service you must slay jor the high chief and bring terror and confusion to his followers  now when my father heard this he was angry but he was also afraidafraid for me who am cosatalo  he called me to him and told me what he had heard pointing out two ways in which we might frustrate duseen  the first was that i go to duseen as his mate after which he would be loath to give me into the hands of the wieroo or to further abide by the wicked compact he had madea compact which would doom his own offspring who would doubtless be as am i their mother  the alternative was flight until duseen should have been overcome and punished  i chose the latter and fled toward the south  beyond the confines of the galu country is little danger from the wieroo who seek ordinarily only galus of the highest orders  there are two excellent reasons for this  one is that from the beginning of time jealousy had existed between the wieroo and the galus as to which would eventually dominate the world  it seems generally conceded that that race which first reaches a point of evolution which permits them to produce young of their own species and of both sexes must dominate all other creatures  the wieroo first began to produce their own kindafter which evolution from galu to wieroo ceased gradually until now it is unknown but the wieroo produce only maleswhich is why they steal our female young and by stealing cosatalo they increase their own chances of eventually reproducing both sexes and at the same time lessen ours  already the galus produce both male and female but so carefully do the wieroo watch us that few of the males ever grow to manhood while even fewer are the females that are not stolen away  it is indeed a strange condition for while our greatest enemies hate and fear us they dare not exterminate us knowing that they too would become extinct but for us  ah but could we once get a start i am sure that when all were true cosatalo there would have been evolved at last the true dominant race before which all the world would be forced to bow  ajor always spoke of the world as though nothing existed beyond caspak she could not seem to grasp the truth of my origin or the fact that there were countless other peoples outside her stern barriercliffs she apparently felt that i came from an entirely different world where it was and how i came to caspak from it were matters quite beyond her with which she refused to trouble her pretty head  well she continued and so i ran away to hide intending to pass the cliffs to the south of galu and find a retreat in the krolu country  it would be dangerous but there seemed no other way  the third night i took refuge in a large cave in the cliffs at the edge of my own country upon the following day i would cross over into the krolu country where i felt that i should be reasonably safe from the wieroo though menaced by countless other dangers  however to a cosatalo any fate is preferable to that of falling into the clutches of the frightful wieroo from whose land none returns  i had been sleeping peacefully for several hours when i was awakened by a slight noise within the cavern  the moon was shining brightly illumining the entrance against which i saw silhouetted the dread figure of a wieroo  there was no escape  the cave was shallow the entrance narrow  i lay very still hoping against hope that the creature had but paused here to rest and might soon depart without discovering me yet all the while i knew that he came seeking me  i waited scarce breathing watching the thing creep stealthily toward me its great eyes luminous in the darkness of the caves interior and at last i knew that those eyes were directed upon me for the wieroo can see in the darkness better than even the lion or the tiger  but a few feet separated us when i sprang to my feet and dashed madly toward my menacer in a vain effort to dodge past him and reach the outside world  it was madness of course for even had i succeeded temporarily the wieroo would have but followed and swooped down upon me from above as it was he reached forth and seized me and though i struggled he overpowered me  in the duel his long white robe was nearly torn from him and he became very angry so that he trembled and beat his wings together in his rage  he asked me my name but i would not answer him and that angered him still more  at last he dragged me to the entrance of the cave lifted me in his arms spread his great wings and leaping into the air flapped dismally through the night  i saw the moonlit landscape sliding away beneath me and then we were out above the sea and on our way to oooh the country of the wieroo  the dim outlines of oooh were unfolding below us when there came from above a loud whirring of giant wings  the wieroo and i glanced up simultaneously to see a pair of huge jooos flying reptilespterodactyls swooping down upon us  the wieroo wheeled and dropped almost to sealevel and then raced southward in an effort to outdistance our pursuers  the great creatures notwithstanding their enormous weight are swift on their wings but the wieroo are swifter even with my added weight the creature that bore me maintained his lead though he could not increase it  faster than the fastest wind we raced through the night southward along the coast  sometimes we rose to great heights where the air was chill and the world below but a blur of dim outlines but always the jooos stuck behind us  i knew that we had covered a great distance for the rush of the wind by my face attested the speed of our progress but i had no idea where we were when at last i realized that the wieroo was weakening  one of the jooos gained on us and succeeded in heading us so that my captor had to turn in toward the coast  further and further they forced him to the left lower and lower he sank  more labored was his breathing and weaker the stroke of his once powerful wings  we were not ten feet above the ground when they overtook us and at the edge of a forest one of them seized the wieroo by his right wing and in an effort to free himself he loosed his grasp upon me dropping me to earth  like a frightened ecca i leaped to my feet and raced for the sheltering sanctuary of the forest where i knew neither could follow or seize me then i turned and looked back to see two great reptiles tear my abductor asunder and devour him on the spot  i was saved yet i felt that i was lost  how far i was from the country of the galus i could not guess nor did it seem probable that i ever could make my way in safety to my native land  day was breaking soon the carnivora would stalk forth for their first kill i was armed only with my knife  about me was a strange landscapethe flowers the trees the grasses even were different from those of my northern world and presently there appeared before me a creature fully as hideous as the wierooa hairy manthing that barely walked erect  i shuddered and then i fled  through the hideous dangers that my forebears had endured in the earlier stages of their human evolution i fled and always pursuing was the hairy monster that had discovered me  later he was joined by others of his kind  they were the speechless men the alus from whom you rescued me my tom from then on you know the story of my adventures and from the first i would endure them all again because they led me to you  it was very nice of her to say that and i appreciated it  i felt that she was a mighty nice little girl whose friendship anyone might be glad to have but i wished that when she touched me those peculiar thrills would not run through me  it was most discomforting because it reminded me of love and i knew that i never could love this halfbaked little barbarian  i was very much interested in her account of the wieroo which up to this time i had considered a purely mythological creature but ajor shuddered so at even the veriest mention of the name that i was loath to press the subject upon her and so the wieroo still remained a mystery to me  while the wieroo interested me greatly i had little time to think about them as our waking hours were filled with the necessities of existencethe constant battle for survival which is the chief occupation of caspakians  tomar and soal were now about fitted for their advent into krolu society and must therefore leave us as we could not accompany them without incurring great danger ourselves and running the chance of endangering them but each swore to be always our friend and assured us that should we need their aid at any time we had but to ask it nor could i doubt their sincerity since we had been so instrumental in bringing them safely upon their journey toward the krolu village  this was our last day together  in the afternoon we should separate tomar and soal going directly to the krolu village while ajor and i made a detour to avoid a conflict with the archers  the former both showed evidence of nervous apprehension as the time approached for them to make their entry into the village of their new people and yet both were very proud and happy  they told us that they would be well received as additions to a tribe always are welcomed and the more so as the distance from the beginning increased the higher tribes or races being far weaker numerically than the lower  the southern end of the island fairly swarms with the holu or apes next above these are the alus who are slightly fewer in number than the holu and again there are fewer bolu than alus and fewer stolu than bolu  thus it goes until the krolu are fewer in number than any of the others and here the law reverses for the galus outnumber the krolu  as ajor explained it to me the reason for this is that as evolution practically ceases with the galus there is no less among them on this score for even the cosatalo are still considered galus and remain with them  and galus come up both from the west and east coasts there are too fewer carnivorous reptiles at the north end of the island and not so many of the great and ferocious members of the cat family as take their hideous toll of life among the races further south  by now i was obtaining some idea of the caspakian scheme of evolution which partly accounted for the lack of young among the races i had so far seen  coming up from the beginning the caspakian passes during a single existence through the various stages of evolution or at least many of them through which the human race has passed during the countless ages since life first stirred upon a new world but the question which continued to puzzle me was what creates life at the beginning cor sva jo  i had noticed that as we traveled northward from the alus country the land had gradually risen until we were now several hundred feet above the level of the inland sea  ajor told me that the galus country was still higher and considerably colder which accounted for the scarcity of reptiles  the change in form and kinds of the lower animals was even more marked than the evolutionary stages of man  the diminutive ecca or small horse became a roughcoated and sturdy little pony in the krolu country  i saw a greater number of small lions and tigers though many of the huge ones still persisted while the woolly mammoth was more in evidence as were several varieties of the labyrinthadonta these creatures from which god save me i should have expected to find further south but for some unaccountable reason they gain their greatest bulk in the krolu and galu countries though fortunately they are rare  i rather imagine that they are a very early life which is rapidly nearing extinction in caspak though wherever they are found they constitute a menace to all forms of life  it was midafternoon when tomar and soal bade us goodbye  we were not far from krolu village in fact we had approached it much closer than we had intended and now ajor and i were to make a detour toward the sea while our companions went directly in search of the krolu chief  ajor and i had gone perhaps a mile or two and were just about to emerge from a dense wood when i saw that ahead of us which caused me to draw back into concealment at the same time pushing ajor behind me  what i saw was a party of bandlu warriorslarge fierceappearing men  from the direction of their march i saw that they were returning to their caves and that if we remained where we were they would pass without discovering us  presently ajor nudged me  they have a prisoner she whispered  he is a krolu  and then i saw him the first fully developed krolu i had seen  he was a finelooking savage tall and straight with a regal carriage  tomar was a handsome fellow but this krolu showed plainly in his every physical attribute a higher plane of evolution  while tomar was just entering the krolu sphere this man it seemed to me must be close indeed to the next stage of his development which would see him an envied galu  they will kill him i whispered to ajor  the dance of death she replied and i shuddered so recently had i escaped the same fate  it seemed cruel that one who must have passed safely up through all the frightful stages of human evolution within caspak should die at the very foot of his goal  i raised my rifle to my shoulder and took careful aim at one of the bandlu  if i hit him i would hit two for another was directly behind the first  ajor touched my arm  what would you do she asked  they are all our enemies  i am going to save him from the dance of death i replied enemy or no enemy and i squeezed the trigger  at the report the two bandlu lunged forward upon their faces  i handed my rifle to ajor and drawing my pistol stepped out in full view of the startled party  the bandlu did not run away as had some of the lower orders of caspakians at the sound of the rifle  instead the moment they saw me they let out a series of demoniac warcries and raising their spears above their heads charged me  the krolu stood silent and statuesque watching the proceedings  he made no attempt to escape though his feet were not bound and none of the warriors remained to guard him  there were ten of the bandlu coming for me  i dropped three of them with my pistol as rapidly as a man might count by three and then my rifle spoke close to my left shoulder and another of them stumbled and rolled over and over upon the ground  plucky little ajor  she had never fired a shot before in all her life though i had taught her to sight and aim and how to squeeze the trigger instead of pulling it  she had practiced these new accomplishments often but little had i thought they would make a marksman of her so quickly  with six of their fellows put out of the fight so easily the remaining six sought cover behind some low bushes and commenced a council of war i wished that they would go away as i had no ammunition to waste and i was fearful that should they institute another charge some of them would reach us for they were already quite close  suddenly one of them rose and launched his spear  it was the most marvelous exhibition of speed i have ever witnessed  it seemed to me that he had scarce gained an upright position when the weapon was halfway upon its journey speeding like an arrow toward ajor  and then it was with that little life in danger that i made the best shot i have ever made in my life  i took no conscious aim it was as though my subconscious mind impelled by a stronger power even than that of selfpreservation directed my hand  ajor was in danger  simultaneously with the thought my pistol flew to position a streak of incandescent powder marked the path of the bullet from its muzzle and the spear its point shattered was deflected from its path  with a howl of dismay the six bandlu rose from their shelter and raced away toward the south  i turned toward ajor  she was very white and wideeyed for the clutching fingers of death had all but seized her but a little smile came to her lips and an expression of great pride to her eyes  my tom she said and took my hand in hers  that was allmy tom and a pressure of the hand  her tom  something stirred within my bosom was it exaltation or was it consternation  impossible  i turned away almost brusquely  come i said and strode off toward the krolu prisoner  the krolu stood watching us with stolid indifference  i presume that he expected to be killed but if he did he showed no outward sign of fear  his eyes indicating his greatest interest were fixed upon my pistol or the rifle which ajor still carried  i cut his bonds with my knife  as i did so an expression of surprise tinged and animated the haughty reserve of his countenance  he eyed me quizzically  what are you going to do with me he asked  you are free i replied  go home if you wish  why dont you kill me he inquired  i am defenseless  why should i kill you i have risked my life and that of this young lady to save your life  why therefore should i now take it  of course i didnt say young lady as there is no caspakian equivalent for that term but i have to allow myself considerable latitude in the translation of caspakian conversations  to speak always of a beautiful young girl as a she may be literal but it seems far from gallant  the krolu concentrated his steady level gaze upon me for at least a full minute  then he spoke again  who are you man of strange skins he asked  your she is galu but you are neither galu nor krolu nor bandlu nor any other sort of man which i have seen before  tell me from whence comes so mighty a warrior and so generous a foe  it is a long story i replied but suffice it to say that i am not of caspak  i am a stranger here andlet this sink ini am not a foe  i have no wish to be an enemy of any man in caspak with the possible exception of the galu warrior duseen  duseen he exclaimed  you are an enemy of duseen  and why  because he would harm ajor i replied  you know him  he cannot know him said ajor  duseen rose from the krolu long ago taking a new name as all do when they enter a new sphere  he cannot know him as there is no intercourse between the krolu and the galu  the warrior smiled  duseen rose not so long ago he said that i do not recall him well and recently he has taken it upon himself to abrogate the ancient laws of caspak he had had intercourse with the krolu  duseen would be chief of the galus and he has come to the krolu for help  ajor was aghast  the thing was incredible  never had krolu and galu had friendly relations by the savage laws of caspak they were deadly enemies for only so can the several races maintain their individuality  will the krolu join him asked ajor  will they invade the country of jor my father  the younger krolu favor the plan replied the warrior since they believe they will thus become galus immediately  they hope to span the long years of change through which they must pass in the ordinary course of events and at a single stride become galus  we of the older krolu tell them that though they occupy the land of the galu and wear the skins and ornaments of the golden people still they will not be galus till the time arrives that they are ripe to rise  we also tell them that even then they will never become a true galu race since there will still be those among them who can never rise  it is all right to raid the galu country occasionally for plunder as our people do but to attempt to conquer it and hold it is madness  for my part i have been content to wait until the call came to me  i feel that it cannot now be long  what is your name asked ajor  chalaz replied the man  you are chief of the krolu ajor continued  no it is altan who is chief of the krolu of the east answered chalaz  and he is against this plan to invade my fathers country  unfortunately he is rather in favor of it replied the man since he has about come to the conclusion that he is batu  he has been chief ever since before i came up from the bandlu and i can see no change in him in all those years  in fact he still appears to be more bandlu than krolu  however he is a good chief and a mighty warrior and if duseen persuades him to his cause the galus may find themselves under a krolu chieftain before longduseen as well as the others for altan would never consent to occupy a subordinate position and once he plants a victorious foot in galu he will not withdraw it without a struggle  i asked them what batu meant as i had not before heard the word literally translated it is equivalent to through finished donefor as applied to an individuals evolutionary progress in caspak and with this information was developed the interesting fact that not every individual is capable of rising through every stage to that of galu some never progress beyond the alu stage others stop as bolu as stolu as bandlu or as krolu  the holu of the first generation may rise to become alus the alus of the second generation may become bolu while it requires three generations of bolu to become bandlu and so on until krolus parent on one side must be of the sixth generation  it was not entirely plain to me even with this explanation since i couldnt understand how there could be different generations of peoples who apparently had no offspring  yet i was commencing to get a slight glimmer of the strange laws which govern propagation and evolution in this weird land  already i knew that the warm pools which always lie close to every tribal abidingplace were closely linked with the caspakian scheme of evolution and that the daily immersion of the females in the greenish slimy water was in response to some natural law since neither pleasure nor cleanliness could be derived from what seemed almost a religious rite  yet i was still at sea nor seemingly could ajor enlighten me since she was compelled to use words which i could not understand and which it was impossible for her to explain the meanings of  as we stood talking we were suddenly startled by a commotion in the bushes and among the boles of the trees surrounding us and simultaneously a hundred krolu warriors appeared in a rough circle about us  they greeted chalaz with a volley of questions as they approached slowly from all sides their heavy bows fitted with long sharp arrows  upon ajor and me they looked with covetousness in the one instance and suspicion in the other but after they had heard chalazs story their attitude was more friendly  a huge savage did all the talking  he was a mountain of a man yet perfectly proportioned  this is altan the chief said chalaz by way of introduction  then he told something of my story and altan asked me many questions of the land from which i came  the warriors crowded around close to hear my replies and there were many expressions of incredulity as i spoke of what was to them another world of the yacht which had brought me over vast waters and of the plane that had borne me jooolike over the summit of the barriercliffs  it was the mention of the hydroaeroplane which precipitated the first outspoken skepticism and then ajor came to my defense  i saw it with my own eyes she exclaimed  i saw him flying through the air in battle with a jooo  the alus were chasing me and they saw and ran away  whose is this she demanded altan suddenly his eyes fixed fiercely upon ajor  for a moment there was silence  ajor looked up at me a hurt and questioning expression on her face  whose she is this repeated altan  she is mine i replied though what force it was that impelled me to say it i could not have told but an instant later i was glad that i had spoken the words for the reward of ajors proud and happy face was reward indeed  altan eyed her for several minutes and then turned to me  can you keep her he asked just the tinge of a sneer upon his face  i laid my palm upon the grip of my pistol and answered that i could he saw the move glanced at the butt of the automatic where it protruded from its holster and smiled  then he turned and raising his great bow fitted an arrow and drew the shaft far back  his warriors supercilious smiles upon their faces stood silently watching him  his bow was the longest and the heaviest among them all  a mighty man indeed must he be to bend it yet altan drew the shaft back until the stone point touched his left forefinger and he did it with consummate ease  then he raised the shaft to the level of his right eye held it there for an instant and released it  when the arrow stopped half its length protruded from the opposite side of a sixinch tree fifty feet away  altan and his warriors turned toward me with expressions of immense satisfaction upon their faces and then apparently for ajors benefit the chieftain swaggered to and fro a couple of times swinging his great arms and his bulky shoulders for all the world like a drunken prizefighter at a beach dancehall  i saw that some reply was necessary and so in a single motion i drew my gun dropped it on the still quivering arrow and pulled the trigger at the sound of the report the krolu leaped back and raised their weapons but as i was smiling they took heart and lowered them again following my eyes to the tree the shaft of their chief was gone and through the bole was a little round hole marking the path of my bullet it was a good shot if i do say it myself as shouldnt but necessity must have guided that bullet i simply had to make a good shot that i might immediately establish my position among those savage and warlike caspakians of the sixth sphere  that it had its effect was immediately noticeable but i am none too sure that it helped my cause with altan whereas he might have condescended to tolerate me as a harmless and interesting curiosity he now by the change in his expression appeared to consider me in a new and unfavorable light  nor can i wonder knowing this type as i did for had i not made him ridiculous in the eyes of his warriors beating him at his own game  what king savage or civilized could condone such impudence  seeing his black scowls i deemed it expedient especially on ajors account to terminate the interview and continue upon our way but when i would have done so altan detained us with a gesture and his warriors pressed around us  what is the meaning of this i demanded and before altan could reply chalaz raised his voice in our behalf  is this the gratitude of a krolu chieftain altan he asked to one who has served you by saving one of your warriors from the enemysaving him from the death dance of the bandlu  altan was silent for a moment and then his brow cleared and the faint imitation of a pleasant expression struggled for existence as he said  the stranger will not be harmed  i wished only to detain him that he may be feasted tonight in the village of altan the krolu  in the morning he may go his way  altan will not hinder him  i was not entirely reassured but i wanted to see the interior of the krolu village and anyway i knew that if altan intended treachery i would be no more in his power in the morning than i now wasin fact during the night i might find opportunity to escape with ajor while at the instant neither of us could hope to escape unscathed from the encircling warriors  therefore in order to disarm him of any thought that i might entertain suspicion as to his sincerity i promptly and courteously accepted his invitation  his satisfaction was evident and as we set off toward his village he walked beside me asking many questions as to the country from which i came its peoples and their customs  he seemed much mystified by the fact that we could walk abroad by day or night without fear of being devoured by wild beasts or savage reptiles and when i told him of the great armies which we maintained his simple mind could not grasp the fact that they existed solely for the slaughtering of human beings  i am glad he said that i do not dwell in your country among such savage peoples  here in caspak men fight with men when they meetmen of different racesbut their weapons are first for the slaying of beasts in the chase and in defense  we do not fashion weapons solely for the killing of man as do your peoples  your country must indeed be a savage country from which you are fortunate to have escaped to the peace and security of caspak  here was a new and refreshing viewpoint nor could i take exception to it after what i had told altan of the great war which had been raging in europe for over two years before i left home  on the march to the krolu village we were continually stalked by innumerable beasts of prey and three times we were attacked by frightful creatures but altan took it all as a matter of course rushing forward with raised spear or sending a heavy shaft into the body of the attacker and then returning to our conversation as though no interruption had occurred  twice were members of his band mauled and one was killed by a huge and bellicose rhinoceros but the instant the action was over it was as though it never had occurred  the dead man was stripped of his belongings and left where he had died the carnivora would take care of his burial  the trophies that these krolu left to the meateaters would have turned an english biggame hunter green with envy  they did it is true cut all the edible parts from the rhino and carry them home but already they were pretty well weighted down with the spoils of the chase and only the fact that they are particularly fond of rhinomeat caused them to do so  they left the hide on the pieces they selected as they use it for sandals shieldcovers the hilts of their knives and various other purposes where tough hide is desirable  i was much interested in their shields especially after i saw one used in defense against the attack of a sabertooth tiger  the huge creature had charged us without warning from a clump of dense bushes where it was lying up after eating  it was met with an avalanche of spears some of which passed entirely through its body with such force were they hurled  the charge was from a very short distance requiring the use of the spear rather than the bow and arrow but after the launching of the spears the men not directly in the path of the charge sent bolt after bolt into the great carcass with almost incredible rapidity  the beast screaming with pain and rage bore down upon chalaz while i stood helpless with my rifle for fear of hitting one of the warriors who were closing in upon it  but chalaz was ready  throwing aside his bow he crouched behind his large oval shield in the center of which was a hole about six inches in diameter  the shield was held by tight loops to his left arm while in his right hand he grasped his heavy knife bristling with spears and arrows the great cat hurled itself upon the shield and down went chalaz upon his back with the shield entirely covering him  the tiger clawed and bit at the heavy rhinoceros hide with which the shield was faced while chalaz through the round hole in the shields center plunged his blade repeatedly into the vitals of the savage animal  doubtless the battle would have gone to chalaz even though i had not interfered but the moment that i saw a clean opening with no krolu beyond i raised my rifle and killed the beast  when chalaz arose he glanced at the sky and remarked that it looked like rain  the others already had resumed the march toward the village  the incident was closed  for some unaccountable reason the whole thing reminded me of a friend who once shot a cat in his backyard  for three weeks he talked of nothing else  it was almost dark when we reached the villagea large palisaded enclosure of several hundred leafthatched huts set in groups of from two to seven  the huts were hexagonal in form and where grouped were joined so that they resembled the cells of a beehive  one hut meant a warrior and his mate and each additional hut in a group indicated an additional female  the palisade which surrounded the village was of logs set close together and woven into a solid wall with tough creepers which were planted at their base and trained to weave in and out to bind the logs together  the logs slanted outward at an angle of about thirty degrees in which position they were held by shorter logs embedded in the ground at right angles to them and with their upper ends supporting the longer pieces a trifle above their centers of equilibrium  along the top of the palisade sharpened stakes had been driven at all sorts of angles  the only opening into the inclosure was through a small aperture three feet wide and three feet high which was closed from the inside by logs about six feet long laid horizontally one upon another between the inside face of the palisade and two other braced logs which paralleled the face of the wall upon the inside  as we entered the village we were greeted by a not unfriendly crowd of curious warriors and women to whom chalaz generously explained the service we had rendered him whereupon they showered us with the most wellmeant attentions for chalaz it seemed was a most popular member of the tribe  necklaces of lion and tigerteeth bits of dried meat finely tanned hides and earthen pots beautifully decorated they thrust upon us until we were loaded down and all the while altan glared balefully upon us seemingly jealous of the attentions heaped upon us because we had served chalaz  at last we reached a hut that they set apart for us and there we cooked our meat and some vegetables the women brought us and had milk from cowsthe first i had had in caspakand cheese from the milk of wild goats with honey and thin bread made from wheat flour of their own grinding and grapes and the fermented juice of grapes  it was quite the most wonderful meal i had eaten since i quit the toreador and bowen j  tylers colored chef who could make porkchops taste like chicken and chicken taste like heaven    chapter 6  after dinner i rolled a cigaret and stretched myself at ease upon a pile of furs before the doorway with ajors head pillowed in my lap and a feeling of great content pervading me  it was the first time since my plane had topped the barriercliffs of caspak that i had felt any sense of peace or security  my hand wandered to the velvet cheek of the girl i had claimed as mine and to her luxuriant hair and the golden fillet which bound it close to her shapely head  her slender fingers groping upward sought mine and drew them to her lips and then i gathered her in my arms and crushed her to me smothering her mouth with a long long kiss  it was the first time that passion had tinged my intercourse with ajor  we were alone and the hut was ours until morning  but now from beyond the palisade in the direction of the main gate came the hallooing of men and the answering calls and queries of the guard we listened  returning hunters no doubt  we heard them enter the village amidst the barking dogs  i have forgotten to mention the dogs of krolu  the village swarmed with them gaunt wolflike creatures that guarded the herd by day when it grazed without the palisade ten dogs to a cow  by night the cows were herded in an outer inclosure roofed against the onslaughts of the carnivorous cats and the dogs with the exception of a few were brought into the village these few welltested brutes remained with the herd  during the day they fed plentifully upon the beasts of prey which they killed in protection of the herd so that their keep amounted to nothing at all  shortly after the commotion at the gate had subsided ajor and i arose to enter the hut and at the same time a warrior appeared from one of the twisted alleys which lying between the irregularly placed huts and groups of huts form the streets of the krolu village  the fellow halted before us and addressed me saying that altan desired my presence at his hut  the wording of the invitation and the manner of the messenger threw me entirely off my guard so cordial was the one and respectful the other and the result was that i went willingly telling ajor that i would return presently  i had laid my arms and ammunition aside as soon as we had taken over the hut and i left them with ajor now as i had noticed that aside from their huntingknives the men of krolu bore no weapons about the village streets  there was an atmosphere of peace and security within that village that i had not hoped to experience within caspak and after what i had passed through it must have cast a numbing spell over my faculties of judgment and reason  i had eaten of the lotusflower of safety dangers no longer threatened for they had ceased to be  the messenger led me through the labyrinthine alleys to an open plaza near the center of the village  at one end of this plaza was a long hut much the largest that i had yet seen before the door of which were many warriors  i could see that the interior was lighted and that a great number of men were gathered within  the dogs about the plaza were as thick as fleas and those i approached closely evinced a strong desire to devour me their noses evidently apprising them of the fact that i was of an alien race since they paid no attention whatever to my companion  once inside the councilhut for such it appeared to be i found a large concourse of warriors seated or rather squatted around the floor  at one end of the oval space which the warriors left down the center of the room stood altan and another warrior whom i immediately recognized as a galu and then i saw that there were many galus present  about the walls were a number of flaming torches stuck in holes in a clay plaster which evidently served the purpose of preventing the inflammable wood and grasses of which the hut was composed from being ignited by the flames  lying about among the warriors or wandering restlessly to and fro were a number of savage dogs  the warriors eyed me curiously as i entered especially the galus and then i was conducted into the center of the group and led forward toward altan  as i advanced i felt one of the dogs sniffing at my heels and of a sudden a great brute leaped upon my back  as i turned to thrust it aside before its fangs found a hold upon me i beheld a huge airedale leaping frantically about me  the grinning jaws the halfclosed eyes the backlaid ears spoke to me louder than might the words of man that here was no savage enemy but a joyous friend and then i recognized him and fell to one knee and put my arms about his neck while he whined and cried with joy  it was nobs dear old nobs bowen tylers nobs who had loved me next to his master  where is the master of this dog i asked turning toward altan  the chieftain inclined his head toward the galu standing at his side he belongs to duseen the galu he replied  he belongs to bowen j tyler jr of santa monica i retorted and i want to know where his master is  the galu shrugged  the dog is mine he said  he came to me corsvajo and he is unlike any dog in caspak being kind and docile and yet a killer when aroused  i would not part with him  i do not know the man of whom you speak  so this was duseen  this was the man from whom ajor had fled  i wondered if he knew that she was here  i wondered if they had sent for me because of her but after they had commenced to question me my mind was relieved they did not mention ajor  their interest seemed centered upon the strange world from which i had come my journey to caspak and my intentions now that i had arrived  i answered them frankly as i had nothing to conceal and assured them that my only wish was to find my friends and return to my own country  in the galu duseen and his warriors i saw something of the explanation of the term golden race which is applied to them for their ornaments and weapons were either wholly of beaten gold or heavily decorated with the precious metal  they were a very imposing set of mentall and straight and handsome  about their heads were bands of gold like that which ajor wore and from their left shoulders depended the leopardtails of the galus  in addition to the deerskin tunic which constituted the major portion of their apparel each carried a light blanket of barbaric yet beautiful designthe first evidence of weaving i had seen in caspak  ajor had had no blanket having lost it during her flight from the attentions of duseen nor was she so heavily incrusted with gold as these male members of her tribe  the audience must have lasted fully an hour when altan signified that i might return to my hut  all the time nobs had lain quietly at my feet but the instant that i turned to leave he was up and after me duseen called to him but the terrier never even so much as looked in his direction  i had almost reached the doorway leading from the councilhall when altan rose and called after me  stop he shouted stop stranger the beast of duseen the galu follows you  the dog is not duseens i replied  he belongs to my friend as i told you and he prefers to stay with me until his master is found and i turned again to resume my way  i had taken but a few steps when i heard a commotion behind me and at the same moment a man leaned close and whispered kazar close to my earkazar the caspakian equivalent of beware  it was tomar  as he spoke he turned quickly away as though loath to have others see that he knew me and at the same instant i wheeled to discover duseen striding rapidly after me altan followed him and it was evident that both were angry  duseen a weapon half drawn approached truculently  the beast is mine he reiterated  would you steal him  he is not yours nor mine i replied and i am not stealing him  if he wishes to follow you he may i will not interfere but if he wishes to follow me he shall nor shall you prevent i turned to altan is not that fair i demanded  let the dog choose his master  duseen without waiting for altans reply reached for nobs and grasped him by the scruff of the neck  i did not interfere for i guessed what would happen and it did  with a savage growl nobs turned like lightning upon the galu wrenched loose from his hold and leaped for his throat  the man stepped back and warded off the first attack with a heavy blow of his fist immediately drawing his knife with which to meet the airedales return  and nobs would have returned all right had not i spoken to him  in a low voice i called him to heel for just an instant he hesitated standing there trembling and with bared fangs glaring at his foe but he was well trained and had been out with me quite as much as he had with bowenin fact i had had most to do with his early training then he walked slowly and very stifflegged to his place behind me  duseen red with rage would have had it out with the two of us had not altan drawn him to one side and whispered in his earupon which with a grunt the galu walked straight back to the opposite end of the hall while nobs and i continued upon our way toward the hut and ajor as we passed out into the village plaza i saw chalazwe were so close to one another that i could have reached out and touched himand our eyes met but though i greeted him pleasantly and paused to speak to him he brushed past me without a sign of recognition  i was puzzled at his behavior and then i recalled that tomar though he had warned me had appeared not to wish to seem friendly with me  i could not understand their attitude and was trying to puzzle out some sort of explanation when the matter was suddenly driven from my mind by the report of a firearm  instantly i broke into a run my brain in a whirl of forebodings for the only firearms in the krolu country were those i had left in the hut with ajor  that she was in danger i could not but fear as she was now something of an adept in the handling of both the pistol and rifle a fact which largely eliminated the chance that the shot had come from an accidentally discharged firearm  when i left the hut i had felt that she and i were safe among friends no thought of danger was in my mind but since my audience with altan the presence and bearing of duseen and the strange attitude of both tomar and chalaz had each contributed toward arousing my suspicions and now i ran along the narrow winding alleys of the krolu village with my heart fairly in my mouth  i am endowed with an excellent sense of direction which has been greatly perfected by the years i have spent in the mountains and upon the plains and deserts of my native state so that it was with little or no difficulty that i found my way back to the hut in which i had left ajor  as i entered the doorway i called her name aloud  there was no response  i drew a box of matches from my pocket and struck a light and as the flame flared up a halfdozen brawny warriors leaped upon me from as many directions but even in the brief instant that the flare lasted i saw that ajor was not within the hut and that my arms and ammunition had been removed  as the six men leaped upon me an angry growl burst from behind them i had forgotten nobs  like a demon of hate he sprang among those krolu fightingmen tearing rending ripping with his long tusks and his mighty jaws  they had me down in an instant and it goes without saying that the six of them could have kept me there had it not been for nobs but while i was struggling to throw them off nobs was springing first upon one and then upon another of them until they were so put to it to preserve their hides and their lives from him that they could give me only a small part of their attention  one of them was assiduously attempting to strike me on the head with his stone hatchet but i caught his arm and at the same time turned over upon my belly after which it took but an instant to get my feet under me and rise suddenly  as i did so i kept a grip upon the mans arm carrying it over one shoulder  then i leaned suddenly forward and hurled my antagonist over my head to a hasty fall at the opposite side of the hut  in the dim light of the interior i saw that nobs had already accounted for one of the othersone who lay very quiet upon the floorwhile the four remaining upon their feet were striking at him with knives and hatchets  running to one side of the man i had just put out of the fighting i seized his hatchet and knife and in another moment was in the thick of the argument  i was no match for these savage warriors with their own weapons and would soon have gone down to ignominious defeat and death had it not been for nobs who alone was a match for the four of them i never saw any creature so quick upon its feet as was that great airedale nor such frightful ferocity as he manifested in his attacks it was as much the latter as the former which contributed to the undoing of our enemies who accustomed though they were to the ferocity of terrible creatures seemed awed by the sight of this strange beast from another world battling at the side of his equally strange master  yet they were no cowards and only by teamwork did nobs and i overcome them at last  we would rush for a man simultaneously and as nobs leaped for him upon one side i would strike at his head with the stone hatchet from the other  as the last man went down i heard the running of many feet approaching us from the direction of the plaza  to be captured now would mean death yet i could not attempt to leave the village without first ascertaining the whereabouts of ajor and releasing her if she were held a captive  that i could escape the village i was not at all sure but of one thing i was positive that it would do neither ajor nor myself any service to remain where i was and be captured so with nobs bloody but happy following at heel i turned down the first alley and slunk away in the direction of the northern end of the village  friendless and alone hunted through the dark labyrinths of this savage community i seldom have felt more helpless than at that moment yet far transcending any fear which i may have felt for my own safety was my concern for that of ajor  what fate had befallen her  where was she and in whose power  that i should live to learn the answers to these queries i doubted but that i should face death gladly in the attemptof that i was certain  and why  with all my concern for the welfare of my friends who had accompanied me to caprona and of my best friend of all bowen j tyler jr i never yet had experienced the almost paralyzing fear for the safety of any other creature which now threw me alternately into a fever of despair and into a cold sweat of apprehension as my mind dwelt upon the fate on one bit of halfsavage femininity of whose very existence even i had not dreamed a few short weeks before  what was this hold she had upon me  was i bewitched that my mind refused to function sanely and that judgment and reason were dethroned by some mad sentiment which i steadfastly refused to believe was love i had never been in love  i was not in love nowthe very thought was preposterous  how could i thomas billings the righthand man of the late bowen j  tyler sr one of americas foremost captains of industry and the greatest man in california be in love with aathe word stuck in my throat yet by my own american standards ajor could be nothing else at home for all her beauty for all her delicately tinted skin little ajor by her apparel by the habits and customs and manners of her people by her life would have been classed a squaw tom billings in love with a squaw i shuddered at the thought  and then there came to my mind in a sudden brilliant flash upon the screen of recollection the picture of ajor as i had last seen her and i lived again the delicious moment in which we had clung to one another lips smothering lips as i left her to go to the council hall of altan and i could have kicked myself for the snob and the cad that my thoughts had proven meme who had always prided myself that i was neither the one nor the other  these things ran through my mind as nobs and i made our way through the dark village the voices and footsteps of those who sought us still in our ears  these and many other things nor could i escape the incontrovertible fact that the little figure round which my recollections and my hopes entwined themselves was that of ajorbeloved barbarian  my reveries were broken in upon by a hoarse whisper from the black interior of a hut past which we were making our way  my name was called in a low voice and a man stepped out beside me as i halted with raised knife  it was chalaz  quick he warned  in here  it is my hut and they will not search it  i hesitated recalled his attitude of a few minutes before and as though he had read my thoughts he said quickly  i could not speak to you in the plaza without danger of arousing suspicions which would prevent me aiding you later for word had gone out that altan had turned against you and would destroy youthis was after duseen the galu arrived  i followed him into the hut and with nobs at our heels we passed through several chambers into a remote and windowless apartment where a small lamp sputtered in its unequal battle with the inky darkness  a hole in the roof permitted the smoke from burning oil egress yet the atmosphere was far from lucid  here chalaz motioned me to a seat upon a furry hide spread upon the earthen floor  i am your friend he said  you saved my life and i am no ingrate as is the batu altan  i will serve you and there are others here who will serve you against altan and this renegade galu duseen  but where is ajor i asked for i cared little for my own safety while she was in danger  ajor is safe too he answered  we learned the designs of altan and duseen  the latter learning that ajor was here demanded her and altan promised that he should have her but when the warriors went to get her tomar went with them  ajor tried to defend herself  she killed one of the warriors and then tomar picked her up in his arms when the others had taken her weapons from her  he told the others to look after the wounded man who was really already dead and to seize you upon your return and that he tomar would bear ajor to altan but instead of bearing her to altan he took her to his own hut where she now is with soal tomars she  it all happened very quickly tomar and i were in the councilhut when duseen attempted to take the dog from you  i was seeking tomar for this work  he ran out immediately and accompanied the warriors to your hut while i remained to watch what went on within the councilhut and to aid you if you needed aid  what has happened since you know  i thanked him for his loyalty and then asked him to take me to ajor but he said that it could not be done as the village streets were filled with searchers  in fact we could hear them passing to and fro among the huts making inquiries and at last chalaz thought it best to go to the doorway of his dwelling which consisted of many huts joined together lest they enter and search  chalaz was absent for a long timeseveral hours which seemed an eternity to me  all sounds of pursuit had long since ceased and i was becoming uneasy because of his protracted absence when i heard him returning through the other apartments of his dwelling  he was perturbed when he entered that in which i awaited him and i saw a worried expression upon his face  what is wrong i asked  have they found ajor  no he replied but ajor has gone  she learned that you had escaped them and was told that you had left the village believing that she had escaped too  soal could not detain her  she made her way out over the top of the palisade armed with only her knife  then i must go i said rising  nobs rose and shook himself  he had been dead asleep when i spoke  yes agreed chalaz you must go at once  it is almost dawn duseen leaves at daylight to search for her he leaned close to my ear and whispered  there are many to follow and help you  altan has agreed to aid duseen against the galus of jor but there are many of us who have combined to rise against altan and prevent this ruthless desecration of the laws and customs of the krolu and of caspak  we will rise as luata has ordained that we shall rise and only thus  no batu may win to the estate of a galu by treachery and force of arms while chalaz lives and may wield a heavy blow and a sharp spear with true krolus at his back  i hope that i may live to aid you i replied  if i had my weapons and my ammunition i could do much  do you know where they are no he said they have disappeared  and then  wait  you cannot go forth half armed and garbed as you are  you are going into the galu country and you must go as a galu  come  and without waiting for a reply he led me into another apartment or to be more explicit another of the several huts which formed his cellular dwelling  here was a pile of skins weapons and ornaments  remove your strange apparel said chalaz and i will fit you out as a true galu  i have slain several of them in the raids of my early days as a krolu and here are their trappings  i saw the wisdom of his suggestion and as my clothes were by now so ragged as to but half conceal my nakedness i had no regrets in laying them aside  stripped to the skin i donned the reddeerskin tunic the leopardtail the golden fillet armlets and legornaments of a galu with the belt scabbard and knife the shield spear bow and arrow and the long rope which i learned now for the first time is the distinctive weapon of the galu warrior  it is a rawhide rope not dissimilar to those of the western plains and cowcamps of my youth  the honda is a golden oval and accurate weight for the throwing of the noose  this heavy honda chalaz explained is used as a weapon being thrown with great force and accuracy at an enemy and then coiled in for another cast  in hunting and in battle they use both the noose and the honda if several warriors surround a single foeman or quarry they rope it with the noose from several sides but a single warrior against a lone antagonist will attempt to brain his foe with the metal oval  i could not have been more pleased with any weapon short of a rifle which he could have found for me since i have been adept with the rope from early childhood but i must confess that i was less favorably inclined toward my apparel  in so far as the sensation was concerned i might as well have been entirely naked so short and light was the tunic  when i asked chalaz for the caspakian name for rope he told me ga and for the first time i understood the derivation of the word galu which means ropeman  entirely outfitted i would not have known myself so strange was my garb and my armament  upon my back were slung my bow arrows shield and short spear from the center of my girdle depended my knife at my right hip was my stone hatchet and at my left hung the coils of my long rope  by reaching my right hand over my left shoulder i could seize the spear or arrows my left hand could find my bow over my right shoulder while a veritable contortionistact was necessary to place my shield in front of me and upon my left arm  the shield long and oval is utilized more as backarmor than as a defense against frontal attack for the closeset armlets of gold upon the left forearm are principally depended upon to ward off knife spear hatchet or arrow from in front but against the greater carnivora and the attacks of several human antagonists the shield is utilized to its best advantage and carried by loops upon the left arm  fully equipped except for a blanket i followed chalaz from his domicile into the dark and deserted alleys of krolu  silently we crept along nobs silent at heel toward the nearest portion of the palisade  here chalaz bade me farewell telling me that he hoped to see me soon among the galus as he felt that the call soon would come to him  i thanked him for his loyal assistance and promised that whether i reached the galu country or not i should always stand ready to repay his kindness to me and that he could count on me in the revolution against altan    chapter 7  to run up the inclined surface of the palisade and drop to the ground outside was the work of but a moment or would have been but for nobs i had to put my rope about him after we reached the top lift him over the sharpened stakes and lower him upon the outside  to find ajor in the unknown country to the north seemed rather hopeless yet i could do no less than try praying in the meanwhile that she would come through unscathed and in safety to her father  as nobs and i swung along in the growing light of the coming day i was impressed by the lessening numbers of savage beasts the farther north i traveled  with the decrease among the carnivora the herbivora increased in quantity though anywhere in caspak they are sufficiently plentiful to furnish ample food for the meateaters of each locality the wild cattle antelope deer and horses i passed showed changes in evolution from their cousins farther south  the kine were smaller and less shaggy the horses larger  north of the krolu village i saw a small band of the latter of about the size of those of our old western plainssuch as the indians bred in former days and to a lesser extent even now  they were fat and sleek and i looked upon them with covetous eyes and with thoughts that any old cowpuncher may well imagine i might entertain after having hoofed it for weeks but they were wary scarce permitting me to approach within bowandarrow range much less within ropingdistance yet i still had hopes which i never discarded  twice before noon we were stalked and charged by maneaters but even though i was without firearms i still had ample protection in nobs who evidently had learned something of caspakian hunt rules under the tutelage of duseen or some other galu and of course a great deal more by experience  he always was on the alert for dangerous foes invariably warning me by low growls of the approach of a large carnivorous animal long before i could either see or hear it and then when the thing appeared he would run snapping at its heels drawing the charge away from me until i found safety in some tree yet never did the wily nobs take an unnecessary chance of a mauling  he would dart in and away so quickly that not even the lightninglike movements of the great cats could reach him  i have seen him tantalize them thus until they fairly screamed in rage  the greatest inconvenience the hunters caused me was the delay for they have a nasty habit of keeping one treed for an hour or more if balked in their designs but at last we came in sight of a line of cliffs running east and west across our path as far as the eye could see in either direction and i knew that we reached the natural boundary which marks the line between the krolu and galu countries the southern face of these cliffs loomed high and forbidding rising to an altitude of some two hundred feet sheer and precipitous without a break that the eye could perceive  how i was to find a crossing i could not guess  whether to search to the east toward the still loftier barriercliffs fronting upon the ocean or westward in the direction of the inland sea was a question which baffled me  were there many passes or only one  i had no way of knowing  i could but trust to chance  it never occurred to me that nobs had made the crossing at least once possibly a greater number of times and that he might lead me to the pass and so it was with no idea of assistance that i appealed to him as a man alone with a dumb brute so often does  nobs i said how the devil are we going to cross those cliffs  i do not say that he understood me even though i realize that an airedale is a mighty intelligent dog but i do swear that he seemed to understand me for he wheeled about barking joyously and trotted off toward the west and when i didnt follow him he ran back to me barking furiously and at last taking hold of the calf of my leg in an effort to pull me along in the direction he wished me to go  now as my legs were naked and nobs jaws are much more powerful than he realizes i gave in and followed him for i knew that i might as well go west as east as far as any knowledge i had of the correct direction went  we followed the base of the cliffs for a considerable distance  the ground was rolling and treedotted and covered with grazing animals alone in pairs and in herdsa motley aggregation of the modern and extinct herbivore of the world  a huge woolly mastodon stood swaying to and fro in the shade of a giant ferna mighty bull with enormous upcurving tusks  near him grazed an aurochs bull with a cow and a calf close beside a lone rhinoceros asleep in a dusthole  deer antelope bison horses sheep and goats were all in sight at the same time and at a little distance a great megatherium reared up on its huge tail and massive hind feet to tear the leaves from a tall tree the forgotten past rubbed flanks with the presentwhile tom billings modern of the moderns passed in the garb of preglacial man and before him trotted a creature of a breed scarce sixty years old  nobs was a parvenu but it failed to worry him  as we neared the inland sea we saw more flying reptiles and several great amphibians but none of them attacked us  as we were topping a rise in the middle of the afternoon i saw something that brought me to a sudden stop  calling nobs in a whisper i cautioned him to silence and kept him at heel while i threw myself flat and watched from behind a sheltering shrub a body of warriors approaching the cliff from the south  i could see that they were galus and i guessed that duseen led them  they had taken a shorter route to the pass and so had overhauled me  i could see them plainly for they were no great distance away and saw with relief that ajor was not with them  the cliffs before them were broken and ragged those coming from the east overlapping the cliffs from the west  into the defile formed by this overlapping the party filed  i could see them climbing upward for a few minutes and then they disappeared from view  when the last of them had passed from sight i rose and bent my steps in the direction of the passthe same pass toward which nobs had evidently been leading me  i went warily as i approached it for fear the party might have halted to rest  if they hadnt halted i had no fear of being discovered for i had seen that the galus marched without point flankers or rear guard and when i reached the pass and saw a narrow oneman trail leading upward at a stiff angle i wished that i were chief of the galus for a few weeks  a dozen men could hold off forever in that narrow pass all the hordes which might be brought up from the south yet there it lay entirely unguarded  the galus might be a great people in caspak but they were pitifully inefficient in even the simpler forms of military tactics  i was surprised that even a man of the stone age should be so lacking in military perspicacity  duseen dropped far below par in my estimation as i saw the slovenly formation of his troop as it passed through an enemy country and entered the domain of the chief against whom he had risen in revolt but duseen must have known jor the chief and known that jor would not be waiting for him at the pass  nevertheless he took unwarranted chances  with one squad of a homeguard company i could have conquered caspak  nobs and i followed to the summit of the pass and there we saw the party defiling into the galu country the level of which was not on an average over fifty feet below the summit of the cliffs and about a hundred and fifty feet above the adjacent krolu domain  immediately the landscape changed  the trees the flowers and the shrubs were of a hardier type and i realized that at night the galu blanket might be almost a necessity  acacia and eucalyptus predominated among the trees yet there were ash and oak and even pine and fir and hemlock the treelife was riotous  the forests were dense and peopled by enormous trees  from the summit of the cliff i could see forests rising hundreds of feet above the level upon which i stood and even at the distance they were from me i realized that the boles were of gigantic size  at last i had come to the galu country  though not conceived in caspak i had indeed come up corsva jofrom the beginning i had come up through the hideous horrors of the lower caspakian spheres of evolution and i could not but feel something of the elation and pride which had filled tomar and soal when they realized that the call had come to them and they were about to rise from the estate of bandlus to that of krolus  i was glad that i was not batu  but where was ajor  though my eyes searched the wide landscape before me i saw nothing other than the warriors of duseen and the beasts of the fields and the forests  surrounded by forests i could see wide plains dotting the country as far as the eye could reach but nowhere was a sign of a small galu shethe beloved she whom i would have given my right hand to see  nobs and i were hungry we had not eaten since the preceding night and below us was gamedeer sheep anything that a hungry hunter might crave so down the steep trail we made our way and then upon my belly with nobs crouching low behind me i crawled toward a small herd of red deer feeding at the edge of a plain close beside a forest  there was ample cover what with solitary trees and dotting bushes so that i found no difficulty in stalking up wind to within fifty feet of my quarrya large sleek doe unaccompanied by a fawn  greatly then did i regret my rifle  never in my life had i shot an arrow but i knew how it was done and fitting the shaft to my string i aimed carefully and let drive  at the same instant i called to nobs and leaped to me feet  the arrow caught the doe full in the side and in the same moment nobs was after her  she turned to flee with the two of us pursuing her nobs with his great fangs bared and i with my short spear poised for a cast  the balance of the herd sprang quickly away but the hurt doe lagged and in a moment nobs was beside her and had leaped at her throat  he had her down when i came up and i finished her with my spear  it didnt take me long to have a fire going and a steak broiling and while i was preparing for my own feast nobs was filling himself with raw venison  never have i enjoyed a meal so heartily  for two days i searched fruitlessly back and forth from the inland sea almost to the barrier cliffs for some trace of ajor and always i trended northward but i saw no sign of any human being not even the band of galu warriors under duseen and then i commenced to have misgivings  had chalaz spoken the truth to me when he said that ajor had quit the village of the krolu  might he not have been acting upon the orders of altan in whose savage bosom might have lurked some small spark of shame that he had attempted to do to death one who had befriended a krolu warriora guest who had brought no harm upon the krolu raceand thus have sent me out upon a fruitless mission in the hope that the wild beasts would do what altan hesitated to do  i did not know but the more i thought upon it the more convinced i became that ajor had not quitted the krolu village but if not what had brought duseen forth without her  there was a puzzler and once again i was all at sea  on the second day of my experience of the galu country i came upon a bunch of as magnificent horses as it has ever been my lot to see  they were dark bays with blazed faces and perfect surcingles of white about their barrels  their forelegs were white to the knees  in height they stood almost sixteen hands the mares being a trifle smaller than the stallions of which there were three or four in this band of a hundred which comprised many colts and halfgrown horses  their markings were almost identical indicating a purity of strain that might have persisted since long ages ago  if i had coveted one of the little ponies of the krolu country imagine my state of mind when i came upon these magnificent creatures  no sooner had i espied them than i determined to possess one of them nor did it take me long to select a beautiful young stalliona fouryearold i guessed him  the horses were grazing close to the edge of the forest in which nobs and i were concealed while the ground between us and them was dotted with clumps of flowering brush which offered perfect concealment  the stallion of my choice grazed with a filly and two yearlings a little apart from the balance of the herd and nearest to the forest and to me at my whispered charge  nobs flattened himself to the ground and i knew that he would not again move until i called him unless danger threatened me from the rear  carefully i crept forward toward my unsuspecting quarry coming undetected to the concealment of a bush not more than twenty feet from him  here i quietly arranged my noose spreading it flat and open upon the ground  to step to one side of the bush and throw directly from the ground which is the style i am best in would take but an instant and in that instant the stallion would doubtless be under way at top speed in the opposite direction  then he would have to wheel about when i surprised him and in doing so he would most certainly rise slightly upon his hind feet and throw up his head presenting a perfect target for my noose as he pivoted  yes i had it beautifully worked out and i waited until he should turn in my direction  at last it became evident that he was doing so when apparently without cause the filly raised her head neighed and started off at a trot in the opposite direction immediately followed of course by the colts and my stallion  it looked for a moment as though my last hope was blasted but presently their fright if fright it was passed and they resumed grazing again a hundred yards farther on  this time there was no bush within fifty feet of them and i was at a loss as to how to get within safe ropingdistance  anywhere under forty feet i am an excellent roper at fifty feet i am fair but over that i knew it would be a matter of luck if i succeeded in getting my noose about that beautiful arched neck  as i stood debating the question in my mind i was almost upon the point of making the attempt at the long throw  i had plenty of rope this galu weapon being fully sixty feet long  how i wished for the collies from the ranch  at a word they would have circled this little bunch and driven it straight down to me and then it flashed into my mind that nobs had run with those collies all one summer that he had gone down to the pasture with them after the cows every evening and done his part in driving them back to the milkingbarn and had done it intelligently but nobs had never done the thing alone and it had been a year since he had done it at all  however the chances were more in favor of my foozling the long throw than that nobs would fall down in his part if i gave him the chance  having come to a decision i had to creep back to nobs and get him and then with him at my heels return to a large bush near the four horses here we could see directly through the bush and pointing the animals out to nobs i whispered  fetch em boy  in an instant he was gone circling wide toward the rear of the quarry they caught sight of him almost immediately and broke into a trot away from him but when they saw that he was apparently giving them a wide berth they stopped again though they stood watching him with highheld heads and quivering nostrils  it was a beautiful sight  and then nobs turned in behind them and trotted slowly back toward me  he did not bark nor come rushing down upon them and when he had come closer to them he proceeded at a walk  the splendid creatures seemed more curious than fearful making no effort to escape until nobs was quite close to them then they trotted slowly away but at right angles  and now the fun and trouble commenced  nobs of course attempted to turn them and he seemed to have selected the stallion to work upon for he paid no attention to the others having intelligence enough to know that a lone dog could run his legs off before he could round up four horses that didnt wish to be rounded up  the stallion however had notions of his own about being headed and the result was as pretty a race as one would care to see  gad how that horse could run  he seemed to flatten out and shoot through the air with the very minimum of exertion and at his forefoot ran nobs doing his best to turn him he was barking now and twice he leaped high against the stallions flank but this cost too much effort and always lost him ground as each time he was hurled heels over head by the impact yet before they disappeared over a rise in the ground i was sure that nobs persistence was bearing fruit it seemed to me that the horse was giving way a trifle to the right  nobs was between him and the main herd to which the yearling and filly had already fled  as i stood waiting for nobs return i could not but speculate upon my chances should i be attacked by some formidable beast  i was some distance from the forest and armed with weapons in the use of which i was quite untrained though i had practiced some with the spear since leaving the krolu country  i must admit that my thoughts were not pleasant ones verging almost upon cowardice until i chanced to think of little ajor alone in this same land and armed only with a knife  i was immediately filled with shame but in thinking the matter over since i have come to the conclusion that my state of mind was influenced largely by my approximate nakedness  if you have never wandered about in broad daylight garbed in a bit of reddeer skin in inadequate length you can have no conception of the sensation of futility that overwhelms one  clothes to a man accustomed to wearing clothes impart a certain selfconfidence lack of them induces panic  but no beast attacked me though i saw several menacing forms passing through the dark aisles of the forest  at last i commenced to worry over nobs protracted absence and to fear that something had befallen him  i was coiling my rope to start out in search of him when i saw the stallion leap into view at almost the same spot behind which he had disappeared and at his heels ran nobs  neither was running so fast or furiously as when last i had seen them  the horse as he approached me i could see was laboring hard yet he kept gamely to his task and nobs too  the splendid fellow was driving the quarry straight toward me  i crouched behind my bush and laid my noose in readiness to throw  as the two approached my hidingplace nobs reduced his speed and the stallion evidently only too glad of the respite dropped into a trot  it was at this gait that he passed me my ropehand flew forward the honda well down held the noose open and the beautiful bay fairly ran his head into it  instantly he wheeled to dash off at right angles  i braced myself with the rope around my hip and brought him to a sudden stand  rearing and struggling he fought for his liberty while nobs panting and with lolling tongue came and threw himself down near me  he seemed to know that his work was done and that he had earned his rest  the stallion was pretty well spent and after a few minutes of struggling he stood with feet far spread nostrils dilated and eyes wide watching me as i edged toward him taking in the slack of the rope as i advanced  a dozen times he reared and tried to break away but always i spoke soothingly to him and after an hour of effort i succeeded in reaching his head and stroking his muzzle  then i gathered a handful of grass and offered it to him and always i talked to him in a quiet and reassuring voice  i had expected a battle royal but on the contrary i found his taming a matter of comparative ease  though wild he was gentle to a degree and of such remarkable intelligence that he soon discovered that i had no intention of harming him  after that all was easy  before that day was done i had taught him to lead and to stand while i stroked his head and flanks and to eat from my hand and had the satisfaction of seeing the light of fear die in his large intelligent eyes  the following day i fashioned a hackamore from a piece which i cut from the end of my long galu rope and then i mounted him fully prepared for a struggle of titanic proportions in which i was none too sure that he would not come off victor but he never made the slightest effort to unseat me and from then on his education was rapid  no horse ever learned more quickly the meaning of the rein and the pressure of the knees  i think he soon learned to love me and i know that i loved him while he and nobs were the best of pals  i called him ace  i had a friend who was once in the french flyingcorps and when ace let himself out he certainly flew  i cannot explain to you nor can you understand unless you too are a horseman the exhilarating feeling of wellbeing which pervaded me from the moment that i commenced riding ace  i was a new man imbued with a sense of superiority that led me to feel that i could go forth and conquer all caspak singlehanded  now when i needed meat i ran it down on ace and roped it and when some great beast with which we could not cope threatened us we galloped away to safety but for the most part the creatures we met looked upon us in terror for ace and i in combination presented a new and unusual beast beyond their experience and ken  for five days i rode back and forth across the southern end of the galu country without seeing a human being yet all the time i was working slowly toward the north for i had determined to comb the territory thoroughly in search of ajor but on the fifth day as i emerged from a forest i saw some distance ahead of me a single small figure pursued by many others  instantly i recognized the quarry as ajor  the entire party was fully a mile away from me and they were crossing my path at right angles  ajor a few hundred yards in advance of those who followed her  one of her pursuers was far in advance of the others and was gaining upon her rapidly  with a word and a pressure of the knees i sent ace leaping out into the open and with nobs running close alongside we raced toward her  at first none of them saw us but as we neared ajor the pack behind the foremost pursuer discovered us and set up such a howl as i never before have heard  they were all galus and i soon recognized the foremost as duseen  he was almost upon ajor now and with a sense of terror such as i had never before experienced i saw that he ran with his knife in his hand and that his intention was to slay rather than capture  i could not understand it but i could only urge ace to greater speed and most nobly did the wondrous creature respond to my demands  if ever a fourfooted creature approximated flying it was ace that day  duseen intent upon his brutal design had as yet not noticed us  he was within a pace of ajor when ace and i dashed between them and i leaning down to the left swept my little barbarian into the hollow of an arm and up on the withers of my glorious ace  we had snatched her from the very clutches of duseen who halted mystified and raging ajor too was mystified as we had come up from diagonally behind her so that she had no idea that we were near until she was swung to aces back  the little savage turned with drawn knife to stab me thinking that i was some new enemy when her eyes found my face and she recognized me  with a little sob she threw her arms about my neck gasping  my tom  my tom  and then ace sank suddenly into thick mud to his belly and ajor and i were thrown far over his head  he had run into one of those numerous springs which cover caspak  sometimes they are little lakes again but tiny pools and often mere quagmires of mud as was this one overgrown with lush grasses which effectually hid its treacherous identity  it is a wonder that ace did not break a leg so fast he was going when he fell but he didnt though with four good legs he was unable to wallow from the mire  ajor and i had sprawled face down in the covering grasses and so had not sunk deeply but when we tried to rise we found that there was not footing and presently we saw that duseen and his followers were coming down upon us  there was no escape  it was evident that we were doomed  slay me begged ajor  let me die at thy loved hands rather than beneath the knife of this hateful thing for he will kill me  he has sworn to kill me  last night he captured me and when later he would have his way with me i struck him with my fists and with my knife i stabbed him and then i escaped leaving him raging in pain and thwarted desire  today they searched for me and found me and as i fled duseen ran after me crying that he would slay me  kill me my tom and then fall upon thine own spear for they will kill you horribly if they take you alive  i couldnt kill hernot at least until the last moment and i told her so and that i loved her and that until death came i would live and fight for her  nobs had followed us into the bog and had done fairly well at first but when he neared us he too sank to his belly and could only flounder about  we were in this predicament when duseen and his followers approached the edge of the horrible swamp  i saw that altan was with him and many other krolu warriors  the alliance against jor the chief had therefore been consummated and this horde was already marching upon the galu city  i sighed as i thought how close i had been to saving not only ajor but her father and his people from defeat and death  beyond the swamp was a dense wood  could we have reached this we would have been safe but it might as well have been a hundred miles away as a hundred yards across that hidden lake of sticky mud  upon the edge of the swamp duseen and his horde halted to revile us  they could not reach us with their hands but at a command from duseen they fitted arrows to their bows and i saw that the end had come  ajor huddled close to me and i took her in my arms  i love you tom she said only you  tears came to my eyes then not tears of selfpity for my predicament but tears from a heart filled with a great lovea heart that sees the sun of its life and its love setting even as it rises  the renegade galus and their krolu allies stood waiting for the word from duseen that would launch that barbed avalanche of death upon us when there broke from the wood beyond the swamp the sweetest music that ever fell upon the ears of manthe sharp staccato of at least two score rifles fired rapidly at will  down went the galu and krolu warriors like tenpins before that deadly fusillade  what could it mean  to me it meant but one thing and that was that hollis and short and the others had scaled the cliffs and made their way north to the galu country upon the opposite side of the island in time to save ajor and me from almost certain death  i didnt have to have an introduction to them to know that the men who held those rifles were the men of my own party and when a few minutes later they came forth from their concealment my eyes verified my hopes  there they were every manjack of them and with them were a thousand straight sleek warriors of the galu race and ahead of the others came two men in the garb of galus  each was tall and straight and wonderfully muscled yet they differed as ace might differ from a perfect specimen of another species  as they approached the mire ajor held forth her arms and cried jor my chief  my father and the elder of the two rushed in kneedeep to rescue her and then the other came close and looked into my face and his eyes went wide and mine too and i cried bowen  for heavens sake bowen tyler  it was he  my search was ended  around me were all my company and the man we had searched a new world to find  they cut saplings from the forest and laid a road into the swamp before they could get us all out and then we marched back to the city of jor the galu chief and there was great rejoicing when ajor came home again mounted upon the glossy back of the stallion ace  tyler and hollis and short and all the rest of us americans nearly worked our jaws loose on the march back to the village and for days afterward we kept it up they told me how they had crossed the barrier cliffs in five days working twentyfour hours a day in three eighthour shifts with two reliefs to each shift alternating halfhourly  two men with electric drills driven from the dynamos aboard the toreador drilled two holes four feet apart in the face of the cliff and in the same horizontal planes  the holes slanted slightly downward  into these holes the iron rods brought as a part of our equipment and for just this purpose were inserted extending about a foot beyond the face of the rock across these two rods a plank was laid and then the next shift mounting to the new level bored two more holes five feet above the new platform and so on  during the nights the searchlights from the toreador were kept playing upon the cliff at the point where the drills were working and at the rate of ten feet an hour the summit was reached upon the fifth day ropes were lowered blocks lashed to trees at the top and crude elevators rigged so that by the night of the fifth day the entire party with the exception of the few men needed to man the toreador were within caspak with an abundance of arms ammunition and equipment  from then on they fought their way north in search of me after a vain and perilous effort to enter the hideous reptileinfested country to the south  owing to the number of guns among them they had not lost a man but their path was strewn with the dead creatures they had been forced to slay to win their way to the north end of the island where they had found bowen and his bride among the galus of jor  the reunion between bowen and nobs was marked by a frantic display upon nobs part which almost stripped bowen of the scanty attire that the galu custom had vouchsafed him  when we arrived at the galu city lys la rue was waiting to welcome us  she was mrs tyler now as the master of the toreador had married them the very day that the searchparty had found them though neither lys nor bowen would admit that any civil or religious ceremony could have rendered more sacred the bonds with which god had united them  neither bowen nor the party from the toreador had seen any sign of bradley and his party  they had been so long lost now that any hopes for them must be definitely abandoned  the galus had heard rumors of them as had the western krolu and bandlu but none had seen aught of them since they had left fort dinosaur months since  we rested in jors village for a fortnight while we prepared for the southward journey to the point where the toreador was to lie off shore in wait for us  during these two weeks chalaz came up from the krolu country now a fullfledged galu  he told us that the remnants of altans party had been slain when they attempted to reenter krolu chalaz had been made chief and when he rose had left the tribe under a new leader whom all respected  nobs stuck close to bowen but ace and ajor and i went out upon many long rides through the beautiful north galu country  chalaz had brought my arms and ammunition up from krolu with him but my clothes were gone nor did i miss them once i became accustomed to the free attire of the galu  at last came the time for our departure upon the following morning we were to set out toward the south and the toreador and dear old california  i had asked ajor to go with us but jor her father had refused to listen to the suggestion  no pleas could swerve him from his decision  ajor the cosatalo from whom might spring a new and greater caspakian race could not be spared  i might have any other she among the galus but ajorno  the poor child was heartbroken and as for me i was slowly realizing the hold that ajor had upon my heart and wondered how i should get along without her  as i held her in my arms that last night i tried to imagine what life would be like without her for at last there had come to me the realization that i loved herloved my little barbarian and as i finally tore myself away and went to my own hut to snatch a few hours sleep before we set off upon our long journey on the morrow i consoled myself with the thought that time would heal the wound and that back in my native land i should find a mate who would be all and more to me than little ajor could ever bea woman of my own race and my own culture  morning came more quickly than i could have wished  i rose and breakfasted but saw nothing of ajor  it was best i thought that i go thus without the harrowing pangs of a last farewell  the party formed for the march an escort of galu warriors ready to accompany us i could not even bear to go to aces corral and bid him farewell  the night before i had given him to ajor and now in my mind the two seemed inseparable  and so we marched away down the street flanked with its stone houses and out through the wide gateway in the stone wall which surrounds the city and on across the clearing toward the forest through which we must pass to reach the northern boundary of galu beyond which we would turn south  at the edge of the forest i cast a backward glance at the city which held my heart and beside the massive gateway i saw that which brought me to a sudden halt  it was a little figure leaning against one of the great upright posts upon which the gates swinga crumpled little figure and even at this distance i could see its shoulders heave to the sobs that racked it  it was the last straw  bowen was near me  goodbye old man i said  im going back  he looked at me in surprise  goodbye old man he said and grasped my hand  i thought youd do it in the end  and then i went back and took ajor in my arms and kissed the tears from her eyes and a smile to her lips while together we watched the last of the americans disappear into the forest
