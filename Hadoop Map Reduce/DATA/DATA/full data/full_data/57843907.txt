them at waterloodon juan    trieste jan 31 1875 my dear sir george  our paths in life have been separated by a long interval whilst inclination led you to explore and tosurvey the wild wastes of the north the arctic shores and the polar seas with all their hardships and horrors my lot was cast in the torrid regions of sind and arabia in the luxuriant deserts of africa and in the gorgeous tropical forests of the brazil but the true traveller can always appreciate the record of anothers experience and perhaps the force of contrast makes him most enjoy the adventures differing the most from his own to whom then more appropriately than to yourself a discoverer of no ordinary note a recorder of explorations and finally an earnest labourer in the cause of geography can i inscribe this plain unvarnished tale of a soldiertraveller kindly accept the trifle as a token of the warmest esteem an earnest of my thankfulness for the interest ever shown by you in forwarding my plans and projects of adventure and in the heartfelt hope that allah may prolong your days permit me to subscribe myself  your sincere admirer and grateful friend richard f burton  admiral sir george back dcl frs vicepres rgs c      preface    the notes which form the groundwork of these volumes have long been kept in the obscurity of manuscript my studies of south america of syria and palestine of iceland and of istria left me scant time for the labour of preparation leisure and opportunity have now offered themselves and i avail myself of them in the hope that the publication will be found useful to more than one class of readers the many who take an interest in the life of barbarous peoples may not be displeased to hear more about the fán and the few who would try a fall with mister gorilla can learn from me how to equip themselves whence to set out and whither to go for the best chance travelling with m paul b du chaillus first expedition in my hand i jealously looked into every statement and his numerous friends will be pleased to see how many of his assertions are confirmed by my experience  the second part is devoted to the nzadi or lower congo river from the mouth to the yellala or main rapids the gate by which the mighty stream emerging from the plateau of inner africa goes to its long home the atlantic some time must elapse before the second expedition which left ambriz early in 1873 under lieutenant grandy r n can submit its labours to the public meanwhile these pages will i trust form a suitable introduction to the gallant explorers travel in the interior it would be preposterous to publish descriptions of any european country from information gathered ten years ago but africa moves slowly and thus we see that the results of an abyssinian journey m antoine dabbadies géodésic dethiopie which took place about 1845 are not considered obsolete in 1873  after a languid conviction during the last half century of owning some ground upon the west coast of africa england has been rudely aroused by a little war which will have large consequences the causes that led to the ashantee campaign a negro copy of the negroid abyssinian may be broadly laid down as general incuriousness local mismanagement and the operation of unprincipled journalism  it is not a little amusing to hear the complaints of the public that plain truth about the african has not been told i could cite more than one name that has done so but what was the result we were all soundly abused by the negrophile the multitude cared little about reading unpopular opinions and then when the fulness of time came it turned upon us and rent us and asked why we had not spoken freely concerning ashanti and fanti and all the herd my wanderings in west africa is a case in point so little has it been read that a president of the royal geographical society african section of the society of arts journal feb 6 1874 could state if fantees are cowardly and lazy krumen are brave the latter being the most notorious poltroons on the west african seaboard  the hostilities on the gold coast might have been averted with honour to ourselves at any time between 1863 and 1870 by a colonial office mission and a couple of thousand pounds i need hardly say what has been the case now the first steps were taken with needless disasters and the effect has been far different from what we intended or what was advisable for a score of years we travellers have been advising the english statesman not to despise the cunning of barbarous tribes never to attempt finessing with asiatic or african to treat these races with perfect sincerity and truthfulness i have insisted and it is now seen with what reason that every attempt at deception at asserting the thing which is not will presently meet with the reward it deserves i can only regret that my counsels have not made themselves heard  yet this ignoble war between barbarous tribes whom it has long been the fashion to pet this poor scuffle between the breechloader and the birmingham trade musket may yet in one sense do good it must perforce draw public attention to the west coast of africa and raise the question what shall we do with it my humble opinion expressed early in 1865 to the right honourable mr adderley has ever been this if we are determined not to follow the example of the french the dutch the portuguese and the spaniards and not to use the country as a convict station resolving to consume as it were our crime at home we should also resolve to retain only a few ports and forts without territory at points commanding commerce after the fashion of the lusitanians in the old heroic days the export slavetrade is now dead and buried the want of demand must prevent its revival and free emigration has yet to be created as mr bright rightly teaches strong places and garrisons are not necessary to foster trade and to promote the success of missions the best proof on the west african coast is to be found in the socalled oil rivers where we have never held a mile of ground and where our commerce prospers most the great tribune will forgive my agreeing in opinion with him when he finds that we differ upon one most important point it is the merchant not the garrison that causes african wars if the home authorities would avoid a campaign let them commit their difficulty to a soldier not to a civilian  the chronic discontent of the socalled civilized african the contempt of the rulers if not of the rule and the bitter hatred between the three races white black and blackwhite fomented by many an unprincipled print which fills its pocket with coin of cant and christian charity will end in even greater scandals than the last disreputable war if the damnosa licentia be not suppressedand where are the strong hands to suppress itwe may expect to see the scenes of jamaica revived with improvements at sierra leone however unwilling i am to cut off any part of our great and extended empire to renew anywhere even in africa the process of dismembermentthe policy which cast off corfuit is evident to me that english occupation of the west african coast has but slightly forwarded the cause of humanity and that upon the whole it has proved a remarkable failure  we can be wise in time  richard f burton  pssince these pages were written a name which frequently occurs in them has become a memory to his friendsi allude to w winwood reade and i deplore his loss the highest type of englishman brave and fearless as he was gentle and loving his short life of thirtyseven years shows how much may be done by the honest thorough worker he had emphatically the courage of his opinions and he towered a cubit above the crowd by telling not only the truth as most of us do but the whole truth which so few can afford to do his personal courage in battle during the ashanti campaign where the author of savage africa became correspondent of the times is a matter of history his noble candour in publishing the martyrdom of man is an example and a model to us who survive him and he died calmly and courageously as he lived died in harness died as he had

dwarfed the features of either shore as we rattled past cape santa clara a venerable name verted to joinville the bold northern head though not very high land makes some display because we see it in a better light and its environs are set off by a line of scattered villages the visavis of louis philippe peninsula on the starboard bow zuidhoeck sandy point or sandhoeck by the natives called pongára and by the french péninsule de marie amélie shows a mere fringe of dark bristle which is tree based upon a broad redyellow streak which is land as we pass through the slightly overhung mouth we can hardly complain with a late traveller of the gaboons sluggish waters during the ebb they run like a mild millrace and when the current setting to the northwest meets a strong seabreeze from the west there is a crisscross a tiderip contemptible enough to a cruizer but quite capable of filling cockboats and nearing the end of our voyage we rejoice to see that the dull downpourings and the sharp storms of fernando po have apparently not yet migrated so far south dancing blue wavelets under the soft azure sky plash and cream upon the pure clean sand that projects here and there black lines of porous ironstone waiting to become piers and the waterline is backed by swelling ridges here open and green grassed there spotted with islets of close and shady trees mangrove that horror of the african voyager shines by its absence and the soil is not mud but humus based on gravels or on ruddy clays stiff and retentive the formation in fact is everywhere that of eyo or yoruba the goodly region lying west of the lower niger and its fertility must result from the abundant water supply of the equatorial belt  the charts are fearful to look upon the embouchure well known to old traders

year it was again revised by m charles floix of the french navy and with additions by the officers of her britannic majestys service it becomes our no 1877 the surface is a labyrinth of banks rocks and shoals ely nisus alligator and caraibe in such surroundings as these when the water shallows apace the pilot must not be despised  her majestys steamship griffon commander perry found herself at 2 pm on monday march 17 1862 in a snug berth opposite le plateau as the capital of the french colony is called and amongst the shipping of its chief port aumale road the river at this neck is about five miles broad and the scene was characteristically french hardly a merchant vessel lay there we had no less than four naval consorts la caravane guardship storeship and hospitalhulk a fine transport la riège bound for goree la recherche a wretched old sailing corvette which plies to assini and grand basam on the gold coast and lastly la junon chef de division baron didelot then one of the finest frigates in the french navy armed with fifty rifled sixtyeight pounders it is curious that whilst our neighbours build such splendid craft and look so neat and natty in naval uniform they pay so little regard to the order and cleanliness of their floating homes  after visiting every english colony on the west coast of africa i resolved curiously to examine my first specimen of our rivals the principal centre of trade in western equatorial africa the earliest visitin uniform of coursewas to baron didelot whose official title is commandant supérieur des Établissements de la côte dor et du gabon the following was to m h s laulnois lieutenant de vaisseau et commandant particulier du comptoir de gabon these gentlemen have neat bungalows and gardens they may spend their days ashore but they are very careful to sleep on board all the official whites appear to have a morbid horror of the climate when attacked by fever they cave in at once and recovery can hardly be expected this year also owing to scanty rains sickness has been rife and many cases which began with normal mildness have ended suddenly and fatally besides fear of fever they are victims to ennui and nostalgia and expecting the comptoir to pay large profits they are greatly disappointed by the reverse being the case  but how can they look for it to be otherwise the modern french appear fit to manage only garrisons and military posts they will make everything official and they will not remember the protest against governing too much offered by the burgesses of paris to louis le grand they are always on duty they are never out of uniform mentally and metaphorically as well as bodily and literally nothing is done without delay even in the matter of signing a ships papers a long procèsverbal takes the place of our summary punishment and the gros canon is dragged into use on every occasion even to enforce the payment of native debts  in the gaboon also there is a complication of national jealousy suggesting the mastiff and the poodle a perpetual war rages about flags english craft may carry their colours as far up stream as coniquet island beyond this point they must either hoist a french ensign or sail without buntingshould the commodore permit otherwise they will be detained by the commander of the hulk loise stationed at anengenenge some thirtyeight to forty miles above le plateau lately a captain gordon employed by mr francis wookey of taunton was ordered to pull down his flag those who know the mariner of england will appreciate his feelings on the occasion small vessels belonging to foreigners and employed in cabotage must not sail with their own papers and even a change of name is effected under difficulties about a week before my arrival a certain pan teutonic hamburgher herr b amused himself after a copious breakfast with hoisting and saluting the union jack in honour of a distinguished guest major l  report was at once spread that the tricolor had been hauled down with extreme indignity and the commodore took the trouble to reprimand the white and to imprison tom case the black in whose town the outrage had been allowed  this by way of parenthesis my next step was to request the pleasure of a visit from messrs hogg and kirkwood who were in charge of the english factories at glass town and olomi they came down stream at once and kindly acted as ciceroni around le plateau the landing is good a reef has been converted into a jetty and little breakwater behind this segment of a circle we disembarked without any danger of being washed out of the boat as at sa leone cape coast castle and accra unfortunately just above this pier there is a dutchlike jardin détébeds of dirty weeds bordering a foul and stagnant swamp while below the settlement appears a huge coalshed the expensive mineral is always dangerous when exposed in the tropics and some thirty per cent would be saved by sending out a hulk the next point is the hotel and restaurant fischerpronounced ficherre belonging to an energetic germanswiss widow who during six years exile had amassed some 65000 francs in an evil hour she sent a thieving servant before the commissaire de police the negress escaped punishment but the verandah with its appurtenances caught fire and everything even the unpacked billiardtable was burnt to ashes still madame the brave never lost heart she applied herself valiantly as a white ant to repairing her broken home and wonderful to relate in this land of no labour ruled by the maxim festina lente all had been restored within six months we shall dine at her table dhôte  our guide led up and along the river bank where there is almost a kilometre of road facing six or seven kilometres of natures highwaythe stream the swampy jungle is not cleared off from about the comptoir and presently the perfume of the fat rank weeds and the wretched bridges a few planks spanning black and fetid mud drove us northwards or inland towards the neat house and grounds of the commandant particulier the outside walls built in grades with the porous darkred lateritelike stone dredged from the river are whitewashed with burnt coralline and look clean whilst the house one of the best in the place is french that is to say pretty near it is a cluster of native huts mostly with walls of corded bamboo some dabbed with clay and lime and all roofed with the ever shabbylooking palmleaf none are as neat as those of the bushmen in the interior where they are regularly and carefully made like baskets or panniers the people appeared friendly the men touched their hats and the women dropped unmistakably significant curtsies  after admiring the picturesque bush and the natural avenues behind le plateau we diverged towards the local pèrelachaise the new cemetery surrounded by a tall stone wall and approached by a large locked gate contains only four tombs the old burial ground opposite is unwalled open and painfully crowded the trees have run wild the crosses cumber the ground the gravestones are tilted up and down in fact the foul golgotha of santos são paulo the brazil is not more ragged shabby and neglected we were shown the last restingplace of m du chaillu pere agent to messrs oppenheim the old parisian house he died here in 1856  resuming our way parallel with but distant from the river we passed a brannew military storehouse bright with whitewash outside the compound lay the lines of the zouaves some forty negroes whom goree has supplied to the gaboon they were accompanied by a number of intelligent mechanics who loudly complained of having been kidnapped cooliefashion we then debouched upon fort aumale from the anchorage it appears a whitewashed square whose feet are dipped in bright green vegetation and its head wears a dingy brown roofthatch a nearer view shows a pair of semidetached houses built upon arches and separated by a thoroughfare the cleaner of the two is a hospital the dingier which is decorated with the brown green stains the normal complexion of tropical masonry lodges the station commandant and the medical officers fronting the former and by the side of an avenue that runs towards the sea is an unfinished magazine of stone and to the right as you front the sun lies the garden of the commandant du comptoir choked with tropical weeds altogether there is a scattered look about the metropolis of the gabon which numbers one foot of house to a thousand of compound  suddenly a bonnet like a pair of white gulls wings and a blue serge gown fled from us despite the weight of years like a young gazelle the wearer was a sister of charity one of five bonnes surs their bungalow is roomy and comfortable near a little chapel and a largish school whence issue towards sunset the wellknown sounds of the angelus at some distance down stream and on the right or northern bank lies a convent and a house superintended by the original establisher of the mission in 1844 the bishop mgr bessieux who died in 1872 aged 70 there are extensive plantations but the people are too lazy to take example from them  before we hear the loud cry à table we may shortly describe the civilized career of the gaboon in 1842 when french and english rivalry burning hot on both sides of the channel extended deep into the tropics and spurned the equator and when every naval officer high and low went mad about concluding treaties and conquering territory on paper france was persuaded to set up a naval station in gorillaland the northern and the southern shore each had a king whose consent after a careless fashion was considered decorous his majesty of the north was old king glassfn1 and his chief tradesman that is his premier was the late toko a shrewd and farseeing statesman his majesty of the south was rapwensembo known to the english as king william to the french as roi denis  matters being in this state m le comte bouëtwillaumez then capitaine de vaisseau and governor of senegal resolved coûte que coûte to have his fortified comptoir evidently the northern shore was preferable it was more populous and more healthy facing the fresh southerly winds during the preliminary negotiations toko partial to the english whose language he spoke fluently and with whom the glass family had ever been friendly thwarted the design with all his might and despite threats and bribes honestly kept up his opposition to the last roi denis on the other hand who had been decorated with the légion dhonneur for saving certain shipwrecked sailors who knew french well and who hoped to be made king of the whole country favoured to the utmost gallic views taking especial care however to place the broad river between himself and his white friends m de moleon capitaine de frégate and commanding the brig le zèbre occupied the place mr wilsonfn2western africa p 254 says by force of arms but that is probably an exaggeration to bring our history to an end the sons of japheth overcame the children of ham and as the natives said toko he muss love frenchman all but out of anglicè in his heart  as in the streets of paris so in every french city at home and abroad    verborum vetus interit ætas  and an old colonial chart often reads like a lesson in modern history here we still find under the empire the constitutional monarchy of 18423 mount bouët leads to fort aumale point joinville at the north jaw of the river faces cap montagnies parrot has become adelaide and coniquet orleans island indeed the love of louisphilippes family has lingered in many a corner where one would least expect to meet it and in 1869 i found port saeed a hotbed of orleanism  the hotel verandah was crowded with the minor officials the surgeons and the clerks of the comptoir drinking absinthe and colicky vermouth smoking veritable weeds playing at dominoes and contending who could talk longest and loudest at 7 pm the word was given to fall to the room was small and exceedingly close the social board was big and very rickety the clientèle rushed in like backwoodsmen on board a mississippi floating palace stripped off their coats tucked up their sleeves and knife in one hand and bread in the other advanced gallantly to the fray they began by quarrelling about carving one made a sporting offer to découper la soupe but he would go no farther and madame as the head of the table ended by asking my factotum selim agha to have the kindness the din the heat the flare of composition candles which gave 45 per cent less of light than they ought the blunders of the slaves the objurgations of the hostess and the spectacled face opposite me were as much as i could bear and a trifle more no wonder that the resident english merchants avoid the tabledhôte  provisions are dear and scarce at the gaboon where as in other parts of west africa the negro will not part with his animals unless paid at the rate of some twentytwo or twentythree shillings for a lean goat or sheep yet the dinner is copious the employés contribute their rations and thus the table shows beef twice a week black cattle are imported from various parts of the coast north and south perhaps those of the kru country stand the climate best the government yard is well stocked and the polite commodore readily allows our cruizers to buy bullocks madame also is not a bird with a long bill the dinner including piquette alias vin ordinaire coffee and the petit verre costs five francs to the stranger and one franc less pays the déjeuner a la fourchettemost men here eat two dinners the soidisant médoc forty francs per dozen is tolerable and the cassis thirty francs is drinkable i am talking in the present of things twelve years past what a shadowy ghostly table dhôte it has now become to me  after dinner appeared cigar and pipe which were enjoyed in the verandah i sat up late admiring the intense brilliancy of the white and blue lightning but auguring badly for the future natives will not hunt during the rains a strong wind was blowing from the northeast which with the northnortheast is here as at fernando po and camaronen the stormy quarter a dry tornado however was the only result that night  my trip to gorillaland was limited by the cruise upon which hmss griffon had been ordered namely to and from the south coast with mailbags many of those whom i had wished to see were absent but mr hogg set to work in the most business like style he borrowed a boat from the rev william walker of the gaboon mission who kindly wrote that i should have something less cranky if i could wait awhile he manned it with three of his own krumen and he collected the necessary stores and supplies of cloth pipes and tobacco rum white wine and absinthe for the natives  my private stores cost some 200 francs they consisted of candles sugar bread cocoa desiccated milk and potatoes cognac and médoc ham sausages soups and preserved meats the latter french and as usual very good and very dear the total expenditure for twelve days was 300 francs  my indispensables were reduced to three loads and i had four pullaboys one a mpongwe mwáká alias captain merrick a model sluggard and messrs smoke

wore to capsize a canoe grebo from the monkey gre or gle and many others bo became boy even as sipahi sepoy became sea pie and sukhani steersman seaconey  gaboon is french with a purely english trade gambia is english with a purely french trade the latter is the result of many causes but especially of the large neighbouring establishments at goree saint louis de sénégal and saint joseph de galam exchanging the two was long held the soundest of policy the french hoped by it to secure their darling objectexclusive possession of the maritime regions as well as the interior leading to the gold mines of the mandengas mandingas and allowing overland connection with their algerine colony the english also seemed willing enough to swop an effete and dilapidated settlement surrounded by more powerful rivalsa hotbed of dysentery and yellow fever a blot upon the fair face of earth even african earthfor a new and fresh country with a comparatively good climate in which the thermometer ranges between 65° fahr and 90° with a barometer as high as the heat allows and where being at home and unwatched they could subject a lingering slavetrade to a regular british putting down but when matters came to the point in 187071 the proposed bargain excited a storm of sentimental wrath which was as queer as unexpected the french object to part with the gaboon as the germans appear inclined to settle upon the ogobe river in england cotton civilization and even christianity were thrust forward by halfadozen merchants and by a few venal colonial prints the question assumed the angriest aspect and lastly the prussianfrench war underwrote the negotiations with a finis pro temp i hope to see them renewed and i hope still more ardently to see the day when we shall either put our so called colonies on the west coast of africa to their only proper use convict stations or when if we are determined upon consuming our own crime at home we shall make up our minds to restore them to the negro and the hyaena their old inhabitants  at the time of my visit the gaboon river had four english traders viz  1 messrs laughland and co provisionmerchants fernando po and glasgow their resident agent was mr kirkwood  2 messrs hatton and cookson general merchants liverpool their chief agent mr rbn walker who had known the river for eleven years 1865 had left a few days before my arrival his successor mr rb knight had also sailed for cape palmas to engage krumen and mr hogg had been left in charge  3 messrs wookey and dyer general merchants liverpool agents messrs gordon and bryant  4 messrs bruford and townsend of bristol agent captain townsend  the resident agents for the hamburg houses were messrs henert and bremer  the english traders in the gaboon are nominally protected by the consulate of sao paulo de loanda but the distance appears too great for consul or cruizer they are naturally anxious for some support and they agitate for an unpaid consular agent at present they have in african parlance no back a kruman offended by a ration of plantains when he prefers rice runs to the plateau and lays some fictitious complaint before the commandant monsieur summons the merchant condemns him to pay a fine and dismisses the affair without even permitting a protest hence impudent robbery occurs every day the discontent of the white reacts upon his clients the black men of late les gabons as the french call the natives have gone so far as to declare that foreigners have no right to the upper river which is all private property the line drawn by them is at fetish rock off pointe française near the native village of mpíra about half a mile above the plateau and they would hail with pleasure a transfer to masters who are not so uncommonly ready with their gros canons

soil shedding filmy shade upon the surrounding underwood and at all times ready like a certain chestnut to shelter a hundred horses  between the plateau and santa clara beginning some two miles below the former are those hated and hating rivals louis town qua ben and prince krinje the french settlements the latter is named after a venerable villain who took in every white man with whom he had dealings till the new colony abolished that exclusive agency that monopoly so sacred in negro eyes which here corresponded with the abbánat of the somal mr wilson p 252 recounts with zest a notable trick played by this little old greyheaded humpback man upon captain bouëtwillaumez and mr w winwood reade chap xi has ably dramatized krinji king george and the commandant on another occasion the whole population of the gaboon was compelled by a french manowar to pay prince cringys debts and he fell into disfavour only when he attempted to wreck a frigate by way of turning an honest penny  but soon we had something to think of besides the view the tumultuous assemblage of dark dense clouds resting upon the riversurface in our rear formed line or rather lines step upon step and tier on tier while the sun shone treacherously gay a dismal livid gloom palled the eastern sky descending to the watery horizon and the estuary beneath the sable hangings which began to depend from the cloud canopy gleamed with a ghastly whitish green distant thunders rumbled and muttered and flashes of the broadest sheets inclosed fork and chain lightning the liftfire zigzagged in tangled skeins here of chalkwhite threads there of violet wires to the surface of earth and sea presently nimbusstep tier and canopy gradually breaking up formed a low arch regular as the bifröst bridge which odin treads spanning a space between the horizon ninety degrees broad and more the sharply cut soffit which was thrown out in darkest relief by the dim and sallow light of the underlying sky waxed pendent and ragged as though broken by a torrent of storm what is technically called the oxeye the egg of the tornado appeared in a fragment of space glistening below the gloomy rainarch the wind ceased to blow every sound was hushed as though nature were nerving herself silent for the throe and our looks said in five minutes it will be down upon us and now it comes a cold blast smelling of rain and a few drops or rather splashes big as gooseberries and striking with a blow are followed by a howling squall sharp and sudden puffs pulsations and gusts at length a steady gush like a rush of steam issues from that awful arch which after darkening the heavens like an eclipse collapses in fragmentary torrents of blinding rain in the midst of the spoondrift we see or we think we see la junon gliding like a phantomship towards the river mouth the lightning seems to work its way into our eyes the airshaking thunder rolls and roars around our very ears the oars are taken in utterly useless the stormwind sweeps the boat before it at full speed as though it had been a bit of straw selim and i sat with a large mackintosh sheet over our hunched backs thus offering a breakwater to the waves happily for us the billowheads were partly cut off and carried away bodily by the raging wind and the opened fountains of the firmament beat down the breakers before they could grow to their full growth otherwise we were lost men the southern shore was still two miles distant and as it was the danger was not despicable these tornadoes are harmless enough to a cruiser and under a good roof men bless them but hms heron was sunk by one and the venture of a cranky gig laden à fleur deau is what some call tempting providence  stunned with thunder dazzled by the vivid flashes of white lightning dizzy with the drive of the boat and drenched by the torrents and washings from above and below we were not a little pleased to feel the stormwind slowly lulling as it had cooled the heated regions ahead and to see the sky steadily clearing up behind as the blackness of the cloud rushing with racer speed passed over and beyond us the increasing stillness of the sea raised our spirits            for nature only loud when she destroys                is silent when she fashions  but the stormdemons name is tornado cyclone it will probably veer round to the south where meeting the dry clouds that are gathering and massing there it will involve us in another fray meanwhile we are safe and as the mist clears off we sight the southern shore the humbler elevation notably different from the northern bank is dotted with villages and clearings the péninsula de marieamélie alias round corner the innermost southern point visible from the mouth projects to the northnortheast in a line of scattered islets at high tides ending in le bois fétiche a clump of tall trees somewhat extensively used for picnics it has served for worse purposes as the name shows  a total of two hours landed me from the comte de paris roads upon the open sandy strip that supports denistown the single broad street runs at right angles from the river the better to catch the seabreeze and most of the huts have open gables a practice strongly to be recommended le roi would not expose himself to the damp air the consul was not so particular his majestys levée took place in the verandah of a poor bamboo hut one of the dozen which compose his capital seated in a chair and ready for business he was surrounded by a crowd of courtiers who listened attentively to every word especially when he affected to whisper and some pretty women collected to peep round the corners at the utangáni white man fn4  mr wilson described roi denis in 1856 as a man of middle stature with compact frame and wellmade of great muscular power about sixty years old very black by contrast with the snowwhite beard veiling his brown face he has a mild and expressive eye a gentle and persuasive voice equally affable and dignified and taken altogether he is one of the most king like looking men i have ever met in africa says the reverend gentleman the account reminded me of kimwere the lion of usumbara drawn by dr krapf perhaps six years had exercised a degeneratory effect upon roi denis or perchance i have more realism than sentiment my eyes could see nothing but a petit vieux vieux nearer sixty than seventy with a dark wrinkled face and an uncommonly crafty eye one of those african organs which is always occupied in taking your measure not for your good  i read out the introductory letter from baron didelotthe king speaks a little french and english but of course his education ends there after listening to my projects and to my offers of dollars liquor and cloth roi denis replied with due gravity that his chasseurs were all in the plantations but that for a somewhat increased consideration he would attach to my service his own son ogodembe alias paul it was sometime before i found out the real meaning of this crafty move the sharp prince sent to do me honour intended me to recommend him to mr hogg as an especially worthy recipient of trust roi denis added an abundance of sweet mouf and the compact ended he condescendingly walked down with me to the beach shook hands and exchanged a civilized au revoir i reentered the boat and we pushed off once more  prince paul a youth of the picaresque school a hungry as well as a thirsty soul and vain with knowledge which we know puffeth up having the true african eye on present gain as well as to future trust proceeded papa has at least a hundred sons enough to make dan dinmont blush and say he was not sure a hundred and fifty daughters father rules all the southern shore the french have no power beyond the brack and there are no african rivalsthe prince evidently thought that the newcomer had never heard of king george like most juniors here the youth knew french or rather gaboonfrench it was somewhat startling to hear clearly and tolerably pronounced msieur veuxtu des macacques but the jargon is not our sa leone and westcoast english the superior facility of pronouncing the neolatin tongues became at once apparent it is evident that european languages have been a mistake in africa the natives learn a smattering sufficient for business purposes and foreigners remain without the key to knowledge hence our small progress in understanding negro human nature had we so acted in british india we should probably have held the proud position which now contents us in china as in western africa with factories and hulks at bombay calcutta karachi and madras  from comte de paris roads the southern gaboon shore is called in charts le paletuvier the mangrove bank the rhizophora is the growth of shallow brackish water and at the projections there are fringings of reefs and diabolitos dangerous to boats after two hours we crossed the mombe mombay creekmouth with its outlying rocks and passed the fishing village of nengaoga whence supplies are sent daily to the plateau then doubling a point of leekgreen grass based upon comparatively poor soil sand and clay and backed by noble trees we entered the mbátá river the toutiay of the chart and the batta creek of m du chaillus map it comes from the southwest and it heads much nearer the coast than is shown on paper  presently the bloodred sun sank like a fireballoon into the west flushing with its last fierce beams the higher clouds of the eastern sky and lighting the white and black plume of the soaring fisheagle this gypohierax angolensis is a very wild bird flushed at 200 yards i heard of but i never saw the gwanyoni which m du chaillu chapter xvi calls guanionian an eagle or a vulture said to kill deer rain fell at times thunder anything but sweet thunder again rolled in the distance and lightning flashed and forked before and behind us becoming painfully vivid in the shades darkening apace we could see nothing of the channel but a steelgrey streak like a damascus blade in a sable sheathing of tall mangrove avenue in places however treeclumps suggested delusive hopes that we were approaching a region where man can live on our return we found many signs of population which had escaped our sight during the fastgrowing obscurity the first two reaches were long and bulging the next became shorter and prince paul assured us that after one to the right and another to the left we should fall into the direct channel roi denis had promised us arrival at sunset his son gradually protracted sunset till midnight still the distance grew and grew i now learned for the first time that the boat was too large for the channel and that oars were perfectly useless ahead  at 8 pm we entered what seemed a cul de sac it looked like charging a black wall except where a gleam of grey light suggested the further end of the box tunnel and cheered our poor hearts for a short minute whilst in the distance we heard the tantalizing song of the wild waves the boughs on both sides brushed the boat we held our hands before our faces to avoid the sharp stubs threatening ugly stabs and to fend off the low branches ready to sweep us and our belongings into the deep swirling water the shades closed in like the walls of the italians dungeon until our eyes grew to it the blackness of erebus weighed upon our spirits perspiration poured from our brows and in this watery mangrovelane the pabulum vitæ seemed to be wanting after forcing a passage through three vile gates the sheetlightning announced a second tornado we sighed for more vivid flashes but after twenty minutes they dimmed and died away still showing the bushsilhouette on either side the tide rushed out in strength under the amphibious forestall who know the west coast will appreciate the position it was impossible to advance or to remain in this devils den the gig bumped at every minute and the early flood would probably crush her against the trees so we dropped down to the nearest open which we reached at 930 pm  after enduring a third tornado we grounded and the crew sprang ashore saying that they were going to boil plantains on the bank i made snug for the night with a wet waterproof and a strip of muslin to be fastened round the mouth after the fashion of outrams fever guard and shut my lips to save my life by the particular advice of dr catlin the first mosquito piped his io pæan at 8 pm another hour brought legions and then began the battle for our blood i had resolved not to sleep in the fetid air of the jungle time however moved on wings of lead a dull remembrance of a watery moon stars dimly visible a southerly breeze and heavy drops falling from the trees long haunted me about midnight prince paul who had bewailed the hardship of passing a night sans mostiquaire in the bush and whose violent plungings showed that he failed to manage un somme proposed to land and to fetch fire from lhabitation  what habitation  oh a little village belonging to papa  and why the didnt you mention it  ah this is mponbinda and you know were bound for mbátá  nothing negrotic now astonishes us there is nought new to me in africa we landed upon a natural pier of rock ledge and after some 400 yards of good path we entered a neat little village and found our crew snoring snugly asleep we exhorted them refreshed the fire and generously recruited exhausted nature with quinine julienne and tea potatoes and potted meats pipes and cigars so sped my annual unlucky day and thus was spent my first junglenight almost exactly under the african line  at 5 a m the new morning dawned the young tide flowed the crabs disappeared and the gig before high and dry on the hard mud once more became buoyant forward again the channel was a labyrinthine ditch an interminable complication of overarching roots and of fallen trees forming gateways the threshold was a maze of slimy stumps stems and forks in every stage of growth and decay dense enough to exclude the air of heaven in parts there were ugly snags and everywhere the turns were so puzzling that i marvelled how a human being could attempt the passage by night the best time for ascending is halfflood for descending halfebb if the water be too high the bush chokes the way if too low the craft grounds at the gaboon mouth the tide rises three feet at the head of the mbátá creek where it arrests the sweet water rivulet it is of course higher  and now the scene improved the hatpalm a brab or wild date the spinepalm phnix spinosa and the okumeh or cottontree disputed the ground with the foul rhizophora then clearings appeared at ejéné the second of two landingplaces evidently leading to farms we transferred ourselves to canoes our boat being arrested by a fallen tree advancing a few yards all disembarked upon trampled mud and ascending the bank left the creek which supplies baths and drinking water to our destination striking a fair pathway we passed westward over a low wave of ground sandy and mouldy and traversed a fern field surrounded by a forest of secular trees some parasitegrown from twig to root others blanched and scathed by the fires of heaven these roped and corded with runners and llianas those naked and clothed in motley patches at 630 am after an hours work probably representing a mile and a total of 7 h 30 m or six miles in a southsouthwest direction from le plateau we left the ugly cul de sac of a creek and entered mbátá which the french call la plantation  women and children fled in terror at our approachand no wonder eyes like hunted boars haggard faces yellow as the sails at the cape verdes and beards two days long act very unlike cosmetics a house was cleared for us by hotaloya alias andrew of the baráka mission the lord of the village who poor fellow has only two wives he is much ashamed of himself but his excuse is i be boy now meaning about twentytwo after breakfast we prepared for a sleep but the popular excitement forbade it the villagers had heard that a white greenhorn was coming to bag and to buy gorillas and they resolved to make hay whilst the sun shone  prince paul at once gathered together a goodly crowd of fathers and mothers uncles and aunts brothers and sisters cousins and connections a large and loudvoiced dame gozeli swore that she was his proper ngwe being one of his numerous step mas and she would not move without a head or three leaves of tobacco hotaloya was his brother mesdames azízeh and asúnye declared themselves his sisters and so all my little stock of goods began visibly to shrink when i informed the greedy applicants that nothing beyond a leaf of tobacco and a demi verre of tafia would be given until i had seen my way to work presently appeared the chief huntsman appointed by roi denis to take charge of me he was named fortuna a spanish name corrupted to forteune a dash was then prepared for his majesty and for prince paul i regret to say that this young nobleman ended his leavetaking by introducing a pretty woman with very neat hands and ankles and a most mutine physiognomy as his sister informing me that she was also my wife pro temp she did not seem likely to coiffer sainte cathérine and here she is  the last thing the prince did was to carry off without a word of leave the mission boat and the three kruboys whom he kept two days i was uneasy about these fellows who hating and fearing the gaboon bush are ever ready to bolt  forteune and hotaloya personally knew mpolo paul du chaillu and often spoke to me of his prowess as a chasseur and his knowledge of their tongue but reputation as a linguist is easily made in these regions by speaking a few common sentences the gorillahunter evidently had only a colloquial acquaintance with the halfdozen various idioms of the mpongwe and mpángwe fán bakele shekyani and cape lopez people yet despite verbal inaccuracies his facility of talking gave him immense advantages over other whites chiefly in this that the natives would deem it useless to try the usual tricks upon travellers  forteune is black short and trapu curls of the jettiest lanugo invest all his outward man bunches of muscle stand out from his frame like the statues of crotonian milo his legs are bandy his hands and feet are large and patulous and he wants only a hunch to make an admirable quasimodo he has the frank and open countenance of a sportsmani had been particularly warned by the plateau folk about his skill in cheating and lying formerly a cook at the gaboon he is a man of note in his tribe as the hunter always is he holds the position of a country gentleman who can afford to write himself mfh he is looked upon as a man of valour he is admired by the people and he is adored by his wivesone of them at once took up her station upon the marital knee perhaps the nimrod of mbátá is just a little henpeckedthe mpongwe mostly areand i soon found out that soigner les femmes is the royal road to getting on with the men he supplies the village with beef here meaning not the roast of old england but any meat from a fieldrat to a hippopotamus he boasts that he has slain with his own hand upwards of a hundred gorillas and anthropoid apes and since the demand arose in europe he has supplied mr rbn walker and others with an average of one per month including a live youngster probably most if not all of them were killed by his bushmen of whom he can command about a dozen  forteune began by receiving his dash six fathoms of satin cloth tobacco and pipes after inspecting my battery he particularly approved of a smoothbored doublebarrel beattie of regent street carrying six to the pound like all these people he uses an old and rickety trademusket and when lead is wanting he loads it with a bit of tile as many gorillas are killed with tools which would hardly bring down a wild cat it is evident that their vital power cannot be great he owned to preferring a charge of twenty buckshot to a single ball and he received with joy a little fine gunpowder which he compared complimentarily with the blasting article half charcoal withal to which he was accustomed  presently a decently dressed whitebearded man of light complexion announced himself with a flourish and a loud call for a chair as prince koyálá alias young prince father to forteune and hotaloya and brother to roi denishere all tribesmen are of course brethren this being equivalent to asking for more it drove me to the limits of my patience it was evidently now necessary to assume wrath and to raise my voice to a roar  my hands dey be empty i see nuffin i hear nuffin what for i make more dash  allow me parenthetically to observe that the african like the scotch highlander will interpose the personal or demonstrative pronoun between noun and verb sun he go down means the sun sets and as genders do not exist you must be careful to say this woman he cry too much  the justice of my remark was owned by all had it been the height of tyranny the supple knaves would have agreed with me quite as politely they only replied that young prince being a man of years and dignity would be dishonoured by dismissal empty handed and they represented him as my future host when we moved nearer the bush  now lookee here this he be bad plábbá palaver this he be bob i come up for white man you come up for black man all white man he no be fool cos he no got black face  ensued a chorus of complimentary palaver touching the infinite superiority of the aryan over the semite but the point was in no wise yielded at last young prince subsided into a request for a glass of rum which being given cut the palaver ie ended the business i soon resolved to show my hosts by threatening to leave them the difference between traders and travellers barbot relates that the mpongwe of olden time demanded his dassy before he consented to liquor up and boldly asked if he was expected to drink gratis the impertinence was humoured otherwise not an ivory would have found its way to the factory but the traveller is not bound to endure these whimsywhamsies and the sooner he declares his independence the better many monkeys skins were brought to me for sale but i refused to buy lest the people might think it my object to make money moreover all were spoilt for specimens by the points being snipped off  i happened during the first afternoon to show my hosts a picture of the baldheaded chimpanzee nchígo mbúwwe troglodytes calvus here more generally called nchígo mpolo large chimpanzee or nchígo njúe whitehaired chimpanzee they recognized it at once but when i turned over to the cottage adventures c p 423 with its neat parachutelike roof all burst out laughing  you want to look him nágo house asked hotaloya  yes for sure i replied  forteune set out at once carrying my gun selim followed me and the rear was brought up by a couple of little prickeared curs with a dash of the pointer probably from st helena the people will pay as much as ten dollars for a good dog they are never used in hunting apes as they start the game on this occasion they nearly ran down a small antelope  the path led through a new clearing a field of fern and some patches of grass breaking the forest which almost clear of thicket and undergrowth was a charming place for deer the soil thin sand overlying humus suggested rich crops of groundnuts its surface was everywhere cut by nullahs now dry and by brooks running crystal streams these when deep are crossed by treetrunks the brazilian pingela after twenty minutes or so we left the picada footpath and struck into a thin bush till we had walked about a mile  look him house nchígo house said hotaloya standing under a tall tree  i saw to my surprise two heaps of dry sticks which a schoolboy might have taken for birds nests the rude beds boughs torn off from the tree not gathered were built in forks one ten and the other twenty feet above ground and both were canopied by the tufted tops every hunter consulted upon the subject ridiculed the branchy roof tied with vines and declared that the nchigos industry is confined to a place for sitting not for shelter that he fashions no other dwelling that a couple generally occupies the same or some neighbouring tree each sitting upon its own nest that the nchígo is not a hermit nor a rare nor even a very timid animal that it dwells as i saw near villages and that its cry aoo aoo aoo is often heard by them in the mornings and evenings during my subsequent wanderings in gorilla land i often observed tall and mushroom shaped trees standing singly and wearing the semblance of the umbrella roof what most puzzles me is that m du chaillu second expedition chap iii had two of the bowers cut down and sent to the british museum he adds they are formed at a height of twenty to thirty feet in the trees by the animals bending over and intertwining a number of the weaker boughs so as to form bowers under which they can sit protected from the rains by the masses of foliage thus entangled together some of the boughs being so bent that they form convenient seats surely m du chaillu must have been deceived by some vagary of nature  the gorillahunters sketch had always reminded me of the rev mr moffats account of the hylobian bakones the aborigines of the matabele country mr thompson a missionary to sherbro the palm land chap xiii has however these wordsit is said of the chimpanzees that they build a kind of rude house of sticks in their wild state and fill it with leaves and i doubt it not for when domesticated they always want some good bed and make it up regularly  thus i come to the conclusion that the nchígo mpolo is a vulgar nestbuilding ape the bushmen and the villagers all assured me that neither the common chimpanzee nor the gorilla proper troglodytes gorilla make im house on the other hand mr w winwood reade writing to the athenæum from loanda sept 7 1862 assertswhen the female is pregnant he the gorilla builds a nest as do also the kulukamba and the chimpanzee where she is delivered and which is then abandoned and he thus confirms what was told to dr thomas savage 1847 in the wild state their ie the gorillas habits are in general like those of the troglodytes niger building their nests loosely in trees                                chapter iii                      geography of the gaboon    before going further afield i may be allowed a few observations topographical and ethnological about this highly interesting section of the west african coast  the gaboon country to retain the now familiar term although no one knows much about its derivation is placed by old travellers in south guinea the tract lying along the ethiopic or south atlantic ocean limited by the camarones mountainblock in north latitude 4° and by cabo negro in south latitude 15° 40 7 a sealine of nearly 1200 miles the gaboon proper is included between the camarones mountains to the north and the mayumbaproperly the yumba country southwards in south latitude 3° 22a shore upwards of 400 miles long the inland depth is undetermined geographically we should limit it to the western ghats which rarely recede more than 60 miles from the sea and ethnologically no line can yet be drawn the country is almost bisected by the equator and by the rio de gabão which discharges in north latitude 0° 21 25 and east longitude 9° 21 23 and it corresponds in parallel with the somaligalla country and the juba river on the east coast  the general aspect of the region is prepossessing it is a rolling surface sinking towards the atlantic in parts broken by hills and dwarf chains either detached or pushed out by the ghats a land of short and abnormally broad rivers which cannot like the congo break through the ridges flanking the central african basin and which therefore are mere surface drains of the main ranges the soil is mostly sandy but a thin coat of rich vegetable humus quickened by heavy rains and fiery suns produces a luxuriant vegetation whilst the proportion of area actually cultivated is nothing compared with the expanse of bush in the tall forests which abound in wild fruits there are beautiful tracts of clear grassy land and the woods clear of undergrowth resemble an english grove more than a tropical jungle horses which die of the tsetse glossina morsitans in the interior of north guinea and of damp heat at fernando po thrive on its downs and savannahs the elais palm is rare sufficing only for home use the southern parts about cape lopez and beyond it resemble the oil river country in the biafran bight the land is a mass of mangrove swamps and the climate is unfit for white men  the eastern ghats were early known to the iberians as shown by the sierra del crystal del sal del sal nitro and other names probably so called from the abundance of quartz in blocks and veins that seam the granite as we shall see in the congo country and possibly because they contain rock crystal although in many places they may be descried subtending the shore in lumpy lines like detached vertebræ and are supposed to represent the aranga mons of ptolemy they are not noticed by barbot between the camarones river and cape st john corisco bay blue rounded and discontinuous masses apparently wooded rise before the mariner and form as will be seen the western subranges of the great basinrim to the north they probably anastomose with the camarones the rumbi the kwa the fumbina northeast and the nigerkong mountainsfn5  they are not wanting who declare them to be rich in precious metals some thirty years ago an american supercargo ascended the rembwe river the southeastern line of the gaboon fork and is said to have collected dirt which tested at new york produced 16 dollars per bushel all the old residents in the gaboon know the story of the gold dust the prospector was the late captain richard e lawlin of new york who was employed by messrs bishop of philadelphia the same house that commissioned the chasseur de gorilles to collect rubber for them and who was so eminently useful to the young french traveller that the scant notice of his name is considered curious  great would be my wonder if the west african as well as the east african ghats did not prove auriferous both fulfil all the required conditions and both await actual discovery the mountains of the moon so frequently mentioned by m du chaillu and the gaboon mission are doubtless the versants between the valleys of the niger and the congo lately dr schweinfurth found an equatorial range which stretching northwards towards the bahr el ghazal was seen to trend westward according to mr consul hutchinson ten years wanderings among the ethiopians p 250 the rev messrs mackey and clemens of the corisco mission explored more than a hundred miles of country across the sierra del crystal range of mountains i am inclined to believe that a hundred miles from the coast was their furthest point we shall presently travel towards this mysterious range and there is no difficulty in passing it except the utter want of a commercial road and the wildness of tribes that have never sighted a traveller nor a civilized man  the rivers of our region are of three kinds little surface drains principally in the north broad estuaries like the mersey and many streams of eastern scotland in the central parts and a single bed the ogobe breaking through the subtending ghats and forming a huge lagoondelta beginning at camarones are the boroa and borba waters with the rio de campo fifteen leagues further south of these little is known except that they fall into the bight of panari or pannaria  according to barbot iv 9 the english charts give the name of point pan to a large deep bight in which lies the harbourbay porto de garapo garápa sugarcane juice and he calls the two rounded hillocks extending inland from point pan to the northern banks of the rio de campo navia the unafrican word panari or pannaria is probably a corruption of páo de nao the bay north of garapo and navia  these small features are followed by the rio de são bento improperly called in our charts the st benito bonito bonita and boneto the native name is lobei and it traverses the kombi country such is the extent of our information the next is the wellknown muni the ntambounay of m du chaillu generally called the danger river in old charts rio de são joão and rio da angra of the bight an estuary which like most of its kind bifurcates above and receiving a number of little tributaries from the sierra forms a broad bed and empties itself through a mass of mangroves into the innermost northeastern corner of corisco bay this sag in the coast is formed by ninje nenge the island or the cabo de são joão cape st john to the north fronted south by a large squareheaded block of land whose point is called cabo das esteirasof matting barbots estyras an article of trade in the olden time the southern part receives the munda moondah river a foul and unimportant stream which has been occupied by the american missionaries  we shall ascend the gaboon estuary to its sources south of it a number of sweet little watercourses break the shoreline as far as the nazareth river which debouches north of urungu or cape lopez cabo de lopo gonsalvez and which forms by anastomosing with a southern river the ogobe ogowai of m du chaillu a complicated delta whose seafront extends from north to south at least eighty miles beyond cape lopez is an outfall known to europeans as the rio mexias it is apparently a mesh in the net work of the nazarethogobe the same may be said of the rio fernão vaz about 110 miles south of the gaboon and of yet another stream which running lagoonlike some forty miles along the shore has received in our maps the somewhat vague name of r rembo or river river orembo simpongwe being the generic term for a stream or river is applied emphatically to the nkomo branch of the gaboon and to the fernão vaz  the ogobe is the only river between the niger and the congo which escapes through favouring depressions from the highlands flanking the great watery plateau of inner africa by its plainly marked double seasons of flood at the equinoxes and by the time of its low water we prove that it drains the belt of calms and the region immediately upon the equator the explorations of lieutenant serval and others in le pionnier riversteamer give it an average breadth of 8200 feet though broken by sand banks and islands the depth in the main channel which at times is narrow and difficult to find averages between sixteen and fortyeight feet and in the dry season of 1862 the vessel ran up sixty english miles  before m du chaillus expeditions the rivers known to europeans he tells us in his preface first journey p iv as the nazareth mexias and fernam vaz were supposed to be three distinct streams in 1817 bowdich identified the ogoowai with the congo and the rev mr wilson p 284 shows us the small amount of knowledge that existed even amongst experts five years before the gorilla book appeared from cape lopez where the nazareth debouches there is a narrow lagoon running along the seacoast and very near to it all the way to mayumba this lagoon is much traversed by boats and canoes and when the slavetrade was in vigorous operation it afforded the portuguese traders great facilities for eluding the vigilance of british cruizers by shifting their slaves from point to point and embarking them according to a preconcerted plan  m du chaillu first proved that the ogobe was formed by two forks the northern or rembo okanda and the southern or rembo nguye the former is the more important mr rsn walker found this stream above the confluence to be from 1800 to 2100 feet wide though half the bed was occupied by bare sandbanks higher up where rocks and rapids interfered with the boatvoyage the current was considerable but the breadth diminished to 600 feet the southern branch also written ngunië was found in apono land s lat 2° about the breadth of the thames at london bridge 700 feet in june the depth was ten to fifteen feet to which the rainy season added ten  m du chaillu also established the facts that the nazareth river was the northern arm of the delta and that the fernão vaz anastomosed with the deltas southern arm  the only pelagic islands off the gaboon coast are the brancas great and little corisco island which we shall presently visit great and little elobi called by old travellers mosquito islands probably for moucheron a dutchman who lost his ship there in 1600 the land about the mouths of the ogobe is a mass of mangrove swamps like the nigerian delta which high tides convert into insular ground these however must be considered terra firma in its infancy the riverine islands of the gaboon proper will be noticed as we ascend the bed  pongoland ignores all such artificial partitions as districts or parishes the only divisions are the countries occupied by the several tribes  the gaboon lies in africaontheline and a description of the year at zanzibar island applies to it in many pointsfn6 the characteristic of this equatorial belt is uniformity of temperature whilst the arabian and the australian deserts often show a variation of 50° fahr in a single day the yearly range of the mercury at singapore is about 10° the four seasons of the temperates are utterly unknown to the heart of the tropicseven in hindostan the poet who would sing for instance the charms of

rains or no dries or no tornadoes or one or all in excess till at last he comes to the conclusion that the clerk of the weather must have mislaid his ledger contrary to the popular idea which has descended to us from the classics the climate under the line is not of that torrid heat which a vertical sun suggests the burning zone of the old world begins in the northern hemisphere where the regular rains do not extend beyond the tenth as far as the twentyfifth degree the equatorial climate is essentially temperate for instance the heat of sumatra lying almost under the line rarely exceeds 24° r 86° fahr in the gaboon the thermometer ranges from 65° to 90° fahr a degree of heat says dr ford less than in many salubrious localities in other parts of the world  upon the gaboon the wet seasons are synchronous with the vertical suns at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes the rainy season of a place within the tropics always begins when the sun has reached the zenith of that place then the tradewinds blowing regularly at other seasons become gradually weaker and at length cease and give way to variable winds and calms the tradewind no longer brings its regular supply of cooler drier air the rising heats and calms favour an ascending current in the seadepths i may add as well as on land which bears the damp air into the upper regions of the atmosphere there to be cooled and to occasion the heavy downpour of each afternoon the nights and mornings are for the most part bright and clear when the sun moves away from the zenith the tradewinds again begin to be felt and bring with them the dry season of the year during which hardly ever a cloud disturbs the serenity of the skies  between the tropical limits and the equator however the sun comes twice to the zenith of each place if now between the going and coming of the sun from the line to its furthest range a sufficient pause intervenes or if the suns temporary distance from the zenith is great enough the rainy season is divided into two portions separated by a lesser dry season closer to the tropical lines where the sun remains but once in the zenith the rainy season is a continuous one  such is the theory of the allgemeine erdkunde hahn hochstetter and pokorny prague 1872 an explanation should be added of the reason why the cool wind ceases to blow at the time when the air heated and raised by a perpendicular sun might be expected to cause a greater indraught we at once i have said recognize its correctness at sea the gaboon in the belt of calms with rain during the whole year has two distinctly marked dry seasons at the vernal and the autumnal equinoxes the former or early rains nchangyá are expected to begin in february with violent tornadoes and storms especially at the full and change and to end in april the heavy downfalls are mostly at night possibly an effect of the sierra del crystal i found march 28th 1862 very like damp weather at the end of an english may april 6th was equally exceptional raining from dawn to evening during my trip to sángatánga and back march 25th to 29th we had frequent fogs locally called smokes and almost daily tornadoes sometimes from the southeast whilst the lightning was dangerous as upon the western prairies after an interval of fiery sun with occasional rain torrents and discharges of electricity begin the enomo enun the middle or long dries which last four months to september the enomo is the angolan cacimbo meaning cool and cloudy weather when no umbrella is required and when the invariably grey sky rarely rains travellers are told that june and july are the cream of the year the healthiest time for seasoned europeans and this phantom of a winter renders the climate more supportable to the northern constitution  during the middle dries when the sun retiring to the summer solstice is most distant land winds and sea breezes are strong and regular and the people suffer severely from cold in the gaboon heavy showers sometimes fall july being the least subject to them and the fiery sun when it can disperse the clouds turns the soil to dust at the end of september appear the latter rains which are the more copious as they seldom last more than six hours at a time it is erroneous to assert that the tract nearest the equator on both sides has the longest rainy season the measure chiefly depends upon altitude and other local conditions  the rainy seasons are healthier for the natives than the cold seasons and the explorer is often urged to take advantage of them he must however consult local experience whilst ascending rivers in november for instance he may find the many feet of flood a boon or a bane and his marching journeys are nearly sure to end in ulcerated feet as was the case with poor dr livingstone the rains drench the country till the latter end of december when the nángá or little dries set in for two months the latter also are not unbroken by storms and showers and they end with tornadoes which this year 1862 have been unusually frequent and violent thus we may distribute the twelve months into six of rains vernal and autumnal and six of dry weather æstival and hibernal the following table will show the subsections  early december to early february the little dries february to early april the former early or spring rains may to early june the variable weather june to early september the cacimbo enomo long or middle dries september to early december the latter rains  under such media the disease par excellence of the gaboon is the paroxysm which is variously called coast african guinea and bullom fever dr ford who has written a useful treatise upon the subjectfn7 finds hebdomadal periodicity in the attacks and lays great stress upon this point of chronothermalism he recognizes the normal stages preparatory invasional reactionary and resolutionary like drs livingstone and hutchinson he holds fever and quinine incompatibles and he highly approves of the prophylactic adhibition of chinchona used by the unfortunate douville in 1828 experience in his own person and in numerous patients proves all theoretical objections to the use of six grains an hour or fifty and sixty grains of quinine in one day or remission to be absolutely imaginary he is convinced that it is not a stimulant and with many apologies he cautiously sanctions alcohol which should often be the physicians mainstay as he advocated tengrain doses of calomel by way of preliminary cathartic the american missionaries stationed on the river have adopted a treatment still more severequinine till deafness ensues and half a handful of mercury often continued till a passage opens through the palate placing mouth and nose in directer communication dr ford also recommends during the invasion or period of chills external friction of mustard or of fresh red pepper either in tincture or in powder a good alleviator always procurable and the internal use of peppertea to bring on the stages of reaction and resolution few will agree with him that gruels and farinaceous articles are advisable during intermissions when the patient craves for port essence of beef and consomme nor can we readily admit the dictum that in the tropics the most wholesome diet without doubt is chiefly vegetable despite jacquemont and all the riceeaters i cry beef and beer for ever and everywhere many can testify personally to the value of the unofficinal prescription which he offers in cases of severe lichen prickly heat leading to impetigo it is as follows and it is valuable  cold cream          3j glycerine           3j chloroform         3ij oil of bitter almonds   gtt x                                chapter iv                 the minor tribes and the mpongwe    the tribes occupying the gaboon country may roughly be divided into two according to habitatthe maritime and those of the interior who are quasimountaineers upon the seaboard dwell the banôkô banaka bapuka and batanga the kombe the benga and mbiko or people about corisco the shekyani who extend far into the interior the urungu and aloa clans of cape lopez the nkommi commi camma or cama and the mayumba races beyond the southern frontier the inner hordes are the dibwe m du chaillus ibouay the mbúsha the numerous and once powerful bákele the cannibal fán mpongwe the osheba or sheba their congeners and a variety of bushfolk of whom little is known beyond the names linguistically we may distribute them into three namely 1 the banôkô and batanga 2 the mpongwe including the minor ethnical divisions of benga and shekyani the urungu the nkommi the dongas or ndiva and the mbúsha and 3 the mpongwe and the tribes of the interior lastly there are only three peoples of any importance namely the mpongwe the bákele and the fán  the mpongwe whom the french call les gabons are the aristocracy of the coast the benga being the second and the banôkô and bapuka ranking third they are variously estimated at 5000 to 7000 head serviles included they inhabit both sides of the gaboon extending about thirtyfive miles along its banks chiefly on the right on the left only seawards of the shekyani but it is a wandering race and many a mercator vagus finds his way to corisco cape lopez batanga and even fernando po the two great families on the northern river bank are the quabens and the glass who style themselves kings and princes the southern side lodges king william roi denis near the mouth and the powerful king george about twentyfive miles higher up stream there are also settlements scattered at various distances from the great highway of commerce to which they naturally cling and upon the coniquet and parrot islands  barbot iv 9 describes the gaboon blacks as commonly tall robust and wellshaped they appeared to me rather below the average of west coast size and weight both sexes even when running to polysarcia have delicate limbs and extremities and the features though negroid are not the negro of the tobacconists shop i noticed several pyramidal and brachycephalic heads contrary to the rule for african man and simiad in the remarkable paper read 1861 by professor busk before the ethnological society that eminent physiologist proved that the asiatic apes typified by the ourangoutang are brachycephalic like the mongolians amongst whom they live or who live amongst them whilst the gorillas and the african anthropoids are dolichocephalic as the negroes the gaboon men are often almost black whilst the women range between dark brown and cafe au lait the beard usually scanty is sometimes bien fournie especially amongst the seniors but whenever i saw a lightcoloured and wellbearded man the suspicion of mixed blood invariably obtruded itself it is said that during the last thirty years they have greatly diminished yet their habitat is still that laid down half a century ago by bowdich and all admit that the population of the river has not been materially affected  the mpongwe women have the reputation of being the prettiest and the most facile upon the west african coast it is easy to distinguish two types one is largeboned and heavylimbed hoarsevoiced and masculine like the ibos of bonny and new calabar who equal the men in weight and stature strength and endurance suggesting a mixture of the male and female temperaments some of the gaboon giantesses have unlike their northern sisters regular and handsome features the other type is quasihindú in its delicacy of form with small heads oval faces noses à la roxolane lips subtumid but without prognathism and fine almondshaped eyes with remarkably thick and silky lashes the throat is thin the bosom is high and well carried or as the admiring arab says nejdá the limbs are statuesque and the hands and feet are norman rather than saxon many europeans greatly admire these minois mutins et chiffonésfn8  early in the present century the mpongwe braided whiskers and side curls tipping the ends with small beads and they plaited the front locks to project like horns after the fashion of the present fán and other wild tribes a custom noticed by barbot but apparently obsolete in the days of bowdich was to bore the upper lip and to insert a small ivory pin extending from nose to mouth the painting and tattooing were fantastic and elaborate and there was a hideous habit of splitting either lip so as to thrust the tongue through on ceremonial occasions a curious reason is given for this practice they are subject to a certain distemper very common there which on a sudden seizes them and casts them into fits of so long a continuance that they would inevitably be suffocated if by means of the split at their upper lip they did not pour into their mouths some of the juice of a certain medicinal herb which has the virtue of easing and curing the diseased person in a very short time  all these things fits included are now obsolete the men shave a line in the hair like a fillet round the skull and what is left is coiffe au coup de vent the headdress is a cap a straw hat a billy cock or a tall silk chimney pot the latter denoting a chief he also sports in full dress a broad coat ending in a loin cloth of satin stripe or some finer stuff about six feet long by four and a half broad it is secured by a kerchief or an elastic waist belt during work it is tucked up but on ceremonial occasions it must trail upon the ground the lieges wear european shirts stuffed into a waistcloth of cheaper material calico or domestics this tángá or kilt is in fact an article of general wear and it would be an airy comfortable and wholesome travelling costume if the material were flannel the ornaments are necklaces of venetian beads the white pound and the black and yellow seed canutille or bugles of various patterns are preferred and all are loaded with mengo grígrís which old travellers call gregories or talismans chiefly leopards teeth rude bells and horns the monda are hunting prophylacteries antelope horns filled with fetish medicines leopards hair burnt and powdered heart mixed with leaves and filth the mouths are stopped with some viscid black stuff probably gum they are often attached to rude bells of iron or brass igelenga ngenge nkendo or wonga like the chingufu of the congo regions and the metal cones which are struck for signals upon the tanganyika lake  a great man is known by his making himself a marvellous guy wearing for instance a dingily laced cocked hat stuck athwart ships upon an unwashed nightcap and a naval or military uniform fifty years old swearing with the loincloth and the feet which are always bare  the coiffure of the greek                is peculiar and elaborate as that of the gold coast these ladies seem to have chosen for their model the touraco or cockatoothey have never heard of kikerikiand the effect is at first wondrously grotesque presently the eye learns to admire pretty fannys ways perhaps the pleureuse the old english corkscrew ringlet might strike the stranger as equally natural in a spaniel and unnatural in a human still a style so peculiar requires a toilette in keeping the king in uniform is less ridiculous than the gaboon ladys chignon contrasting with a tightbodied and narrowskirted gown of pink calico  the national tirevaliant is a galeated crest not unlike the cuirassiers helmet and the hair trained from the sides into a high ridge running along the cranium not unfrequently projects far beyond the forehead taste and caprice produce endless modifications sometimes the crest is double disposed in parallel ridges with a deep hollow between or it is treble when the two lines of parting running along the mastoids make it remarkably like bears ears the central prism rises high and the side hair is plaited into little pigtails others again train four parallel lines from nape to forehead forming two cushions along the parietals the crest is heightened by padding and the whole of the hair is devoted to magnifying itat a distance some of the bushwomen look as if they wore cocked hats when dreaded baldness appears rosettes of false hair patch the temples and plaits of purchased wigs are interwoven to increase the bulk the last resources of all are wigs and toupets of stained pineapple fibre the comb is unknown its succedaneum being a huge bodkin like that which the trasteverina has so often used as a stiletto this instrument of castigation is made of ivory or metal with a lozenge often neatly carved and ornamented at the handle the hair always somewhat kinky is anointed every morning with palmoil or the tallowlike produce of a junglenut and in full dress it is copiously powdered with light red or bright yellow dust of pounded camwood redwood and various barks  the ears are adorned with broad rings of native make and near the trading stations with french imitation jewellery the neck supports many strings of beads long and short with the indispensable talismans the body dress is a tobe or loincloth like that of the men but under the námbá or outer wrapper which hangs down the feet there is a siri or petticoat reaching only to the knees both are gathered in front like the shukkah of the eastern coast and the bosom is left bare few except the bushfolk now wear the ibongo ipepe or ndengi the woven fibres and grasscloths of their ancestry amongst the hunters however a tángá or grasskilt may still be seen the exposure of the upper person shows the size and tumidity of the areola even in young girls being unsupported the mammae soon become flaccid  the legs which are peculiarly neat and well turned are made by art a fitting setoff to the head it is the pride of a mpongwe wife to cover the lower limb between knee and ankle with an armour of metal rings which are also worn upon the wrists the custom is not modern and travellers of the seventeenth century allude to them the rich affect copper bought in wires two feet and a half long and in two sizes of the larger four of the smaller eight go to the dollar the brass are cheaper as 5 4 and i did not see iron or tin the native smiths make the circles and the weight of a full set of forty varies from fifteen to nineteen pounds they are separate rings not a single coil like that used by the wagogo and other east african tribes they press tightly on the limb often causing painful chafes and sores the ankle is generally occupied by a brass or iron chain with small links girls may wear these rings of which the husband is expected to present a considerable number to his bride and the consequence is that when in full dress she waddles like a duck  commerce and intercourse with whites has made the mpongwe once the rudest now one of the most civilized of african tribes and upon the whole there is an improvement the exact barbot iv 9 tells us the gaboon blacks are barbarous wild bloody and treacherous very thievish and crafty especially towards strangers the women on the contrary are as civil and courteous to them and will use all possible means to enjoy their company but both sexes are the most wretchedly poor and miserable of any in guinea and yet so very haughty that they are perfectly ridiculous  they are all excessively fond of brandy and other strong liquors of europe and america  if they fancy one has got a mouthful more than another and they are half drunk they will soon fall afighting even with their own princes or priests  their exceeding greediness for strong liquors renders them so little nice and curious in the choice of them that though mixed with half water and sometimes a little spanish soap put into it to give it a froth to appear of proof by the scum it makes they like it and praise it as much as the best and purest brandy captain boteler remarks in 1827 the women do not speak english though for the sake of what trifles they can procure for their husbands they are in the habit of flocking on board the different vessels which visit the river and will permit them to remain and the wives are generally maintained in clothing by the proceeds of their intercourse with the whites he further assures us that mulatto girls thus born are not allowed to marry although there is no such restriction for the males and elsewhere he concludes that never having seen an infant or an adult offspring of mixed blood abortion is practised as at delagoa and old calabar where in 1862 i found only one child of mixed blood if so the mpongwe have changed for the better halfcastes are now not uncommon there are several nice yaller gals well known on the river and the number of old and sick speaks well for the humanity of the tribe  devoted to trade and become a people of brokers of gobetweens of middlemen the mpongwe have now acquired an ease and propriety a polish and urbanity of manner which contrasts strongly with the krumen and other tribes who despite generations of intercourse with europeans are rough and barbarous as their forefathers the youths used to learn english which they spoke fluently and with tolerable accent but always barbarously they are more successful with the easier neolatin tongues their one aim in life is not happiness but trust an african practice unwisely encouraged by europeans so old calabar but a few years ago was not a trustriver and consequently the consul and the gunboat had little to do there many of them have received advances of dollars by thousands but the european merchant has generally suffered from his credulity or rapacity in low cunning the native is more than a match for the stranger moreover he has the pull in the allimportant matter of time he can spend a fortnight haggling over the price of a tooth when the unhappy capitalist is eating his heart like all the african aristocracy they hold agriculture beneath the dignity of man and fit only for their women and slaves the ladies also refuse to work at the plantations especially when young and pretty leaving them to the bushfolk male and female m du chaillu repeatedly asserts chap xix there is no property in land but this is a mistake often made in africa labourers are hired at the rate of two to three dollars per mensem and gangs would easily be collected if one of the chiefs were placed in command no sum of money will buy a freeborn mpongwe and the sale is forbidden by the laws of the land a halfcaste would fetch one hundred dollars a wild nigger near the river costs from thirty to thirtyfive dollars the same may be bought in the apinji country for four dollars worth of assorted goods the bundle trade as it is called but there is the imminent risk of the chattels running away a mans only attendants being now his wives and serviles it is evident that plurality and domestic servitude will extend    far into summers which we shall not see  in fact till some violent revolution of society shall have introduced a servant class  the three grades of mpongwe may be considered as rude beginnings of caste the first are the sons of the soil the ongwá ntye contracted from onwana wi ntye mpongwes of pure blood the second are the mbámbá children of freemen by serviles and lastly nsháká in bákele nsháká represents the slaves m du chaillus distribution chap iii into five orders namely pure mixed with other tribes half free children of serviles and chattels is somewhat overartificial at any rate now it is not generally recognized like the highcaste hindu the nobler race will marry women of lower classes for instance king njogonis mother was a benga but the inverse proceeding is a disgrace to the woman apparently an instinctive feeling on the part of the reproducer still lingering in the most advanced societies old travellers record a belief that unlike all other guinea races the mpongwe marries his mother sister or daughter and they compare the practice with that of the polished persians and the peruvian incas who thus kept pure the solar and lunar blood if this breedingin ever existed no trace of it now remains on the contrary every care is taken to avoid marriages of consanguinity bowdich indeed assures us that a man may not look at nor converse with his motherinlaw on pain of a heavy perhaps a ruinous fine this singular law is founded on the tradition of an incest  marriage amongst the mpongwe is a purely civil contract as in africa generally and so perhaps it will some day be in europe asia and america clebs pays a certain sum for the bride who where marriage by capture is unknown has no voice in the matter many promises of future dash are made to the girls parents and drinking drumming and dancing form the ceremony the following is or rather i should say was a fair list of articles paid for a virgin bride one fine silk hat one cap one coat five to twenty pieces of various cottons plain and ornamental two to twenty silk kerchiefs three to thirty jars of rum twenty pounds of trade tobacco two hatchets two cutlasses plates and dishes mugs and glasses five each six knives one kettle one brass pan two to three neptunes caldrons the old term being neptunes pots a dozen bars of iron copper and brass rings chains with small links and minor articles ad libitum the settlement is the same in kind but has increased during the last forty years and specie has become much more commonfn10  after marriage there is a mutual accommodation system suggesting the cicisbeo or mariage à trois school hence we read that wives like the muchmaligned xantippe were borrowed and lent and that not fulfilling the promise of a loan is punishable by heavy damages where the husband acts adjutor or cavaliere to his friends omantwefemale person or wifeand the friend is equally complaisant wedlock may hardly be called permanent and there can be no tie save children the old immorality endures it is as if the command were reversed by accepting that misprint which so scandalized the star chamber thou shalt commit adultery yet unpermitted the offence is one against property and moechus may be cast in damages ranging from 100 to 200 what is known in low civilization as the panel dodge is an infamy familiar to almost all the maritime tribes of africa he must indeed be a solomon of a son who sur les bords du gabon can guess at his own sire a question so impertinent is never put by the exofficio father the son succeeds by inheritance to his fathers relict who being generally in years is condemned to be useful when she has ceased to be an ornament and if there are several they are equally divided amongst the heirs  trading tribes rarely affect the pundonor which characterizes the pastoral and the predatory these people traffic in all things even in the chastity of their women what with prenuptial excesses with early unions often infructuous with a virtual system of community and with universal drunkenness it is not to be wondered at if the maritime tribes of africa degenerate and die out such apparently is the modus operandi by which nature rids herself of the effete races which have served to clear the ground and to pave the way for higher successors wealth and luxury so generally inveighed against by poets and divines injure humanity only when they injuriously affect reproduction and poverty is praised only because it breeds more men the true tests of the physical prosperity of a race and of its position in the world are bodily strength and the excess of births over deaths  separation after marriage can hardly be dignified on the gaboon by the name of divorce whenever a woman has or fancies she has a grievance she leaves her husband returns to the paternal and marries again quarrels about the sex are very common yet in cases of adultery the old murderous assaults are now rare except amongst the backwoodsmen the habit was simply to shoot some man belonging to the seducers or to the ravishers village the latter shot somebody in the nearest settlement and so on till the affair was decided in these days violent retaliation for personal jealousy always belittles a man in the eyes of an african community perhaps also he unconsciously recognizes the sentiment ascribed to mohammed laysa bizányatin ilia bi záni there is no adulteress without an adulterer meaning that the husband has set the example  polygamy is of course the order of the day it is a necessity to the men and even the women disdain to marry a onewifer as amongst all pluralists from moslem to mormon the senior or first married is no 1 here called best wife she is the goodmans viceroy and she rules the homekingdom with absolute sway yet the mpongwe do not like other tribes on the west coast practise that separation of the sexes during gestation and lactation which is enjoined to the hebrews recommended by catholicism and commanded by mormonisma system which partly justifies polygamy in portuguese guinea the enceinte is claimed by her relatives especially by the women for three years that she may give undivided attention to her offspring who is rightly believed to be benefited by the separation and that she may return to her husband with renewed vigour meanwhile custom allows the man to cohabit with a slave girl  polygamy also in africa is rather a political than a domestic or social institution a judicious culture of the marriage tie is necessary amongst savages and barbarians whose only friends and supporters are blood relations and nuptial connections besides which a multitude of wives ministers to the great mans pride and influence as well as to his pleasures and to his efficiency when the head wife ages she takes charge of the girlish brides committed to her guardianship by the husband i should try vainly to persuade the english woman that there can be peace in households so constituted still such is the case messrs wilson and du chaillu both assert that the wives rarely disagree amongst themselves the sentimental part of love is modified the common husband becomes the patriarch not the paterfamilias the wife is not the mistress but the mère de famille the alliance rises or sinks to one of interest and affection instead of being amorous or uxorious whilst the underlying idea the more the merrier especially in lands where free service is unknown seems to stifle envy and jealousy everywhere moreover amongst polygamists the husband is strictly forbidden by popular opinion to show preference for a favourite wife if he do so he is a bad man  but polygamy here has not rendered the women as theoretically it should a downtrodden moiety of society on the contrary their position is comparatively high the marriage connection is not one of master and slave a link between freedom and serfdom the weaker vessel does not suffer from collision with the pot de fer generally the fair but frail ones appear to be as amongst the israelites generally the better halves despite the okosunguu or cowhide peacemaker they have conquered a considerable latitude of conducting their own affairs when poor and slaveless and naturally when no longer young they must work in the house and in the field but this lot is not singular in journeys they carry the load yet it is rarely heavier than the weapons borne by the man on the other hand after feeding their husbands what remains out of the fruits of their labours is their own wholly out of his reacha boon not always granted by civilization as in unyamwezi they guard their rights with a truly feminine touchiness and jealousy there is always in the african mind a preference for descent and inheritance through the mother the surer sidean unmistakable sign by the by of barbarism the socalled royal races in the eight great despotisms of pagan africaashanti dahome and benin karagwah uganda and unyoro the mwátá yá nvo and the mwátá cazembe allow the greatest liberty even to the kings sisters they are expected only to choose handsome lovers that the race may maintain its physical superiority and hence doubtless the stalwart forms and the good looks remarked by every traveller as a rule the husband cannot sell his wifes children whilst her brother may dispose of them as he pleasesthe vox populi exclaims what is the man to go hungry when he can trade off his sisters brats  the strongminded of london and new york have not yet succeeded in thoroughly organizing and popularizing their clubs the belles sauvages of the gaboon have there is a secret order called njembe a rights of woman association intended mainly to counterbalance the nda of the lords of creation which will presently be described dropped a few years ago by the men it was taken up by their wives and it now numbers a host of initiated limited only by heavy entrance fees this form of freemasonry deals largely in processions whose preliminaries and proceedings are kept profoundly secret at certain times an old woman strikes a stick upon an orega or crescentshaped drum hollowed out of a block of wood hearing this signal the worshipful sisterhood bedaubed by way of insignia with red and white chalk or clay follow her from the village to some remote nook in the jungle where the lodge is tiled sentinels are stationed around whilst business is transacted before a vestal fire which must burn for a fortnight or three weeks in the awe compelling presence of a brass pipkin filled with herbs and a basin both zebrad like the human limbs the rev william walker was once detected playing peeping tom by sixty or seventy viragos who attempted to exact a fine of forty dollars and who would have handled him severely had he not managed to escape the french officers never standing upon ceremony in such matters have often insisted upon being present  circumcision between the fourth and eighth year is universal in pongoland and without it a youth could not be married the operation is performed generally by the chief often by some old man who receives a fee from the parents the thumb nails are long and are used after the jewish fashionfn10 neat rum with red pepper is spirted from the mouth to kill wound it is purely hygienic and not balanced by the excisio judaica some physiologists consider the latter a necessary complement of the male rite such however is not the case the hebrews who almost everywhere retained circumcision have in europe at least long abandoned excision i regret that the delicacy of the age does not allow me to be more explicit  the mpongwe practise a rite so resembling infant baptism that the missionaries have derived it from a corruption of abyssinian christianity which like the flora of the camarones and fernandian highlands might have travelled across the dark continent where it has now been superseded by el islam i purpose at some period of more leisure to prove an ancient intercourse and rapprochement of all the african tribes ranging between the parallels of north latitude 20° and south latitude 30° it will best be established not by the single great family of language but by the similarity of manners customs and belief of arts and crafts of utensils and industry the baptism of pongoland is as follows when the babe is born a crier announcing the event promises to it in the peoples name participation in the rights of the living it is placed upon a banana leaf for which reason the plantain is never used to stop the waterpots and the chief or the nearest of kin sprinkles it from a basin gives it a name and pronounces a benediction his example being followed by all present the manchild is exhorted to be truthful and the girl to tell plenty lie in order to lead a happy life truly a new form of the regenerative rite  a curious prepossession of the african mind curious and yet general in a land where population is the one want and where issue is held the greatest blessing is the imaginary necessity of limiting the family perhaps this form of infanticide is a policy derived from ancestors who found it necessary in the kingdom of apollonia guinea the tenth child was always buried alive never a decimus was allowed to stand in the way of the nine seniors the birth of twins is an evil portent to the mpongwes as it is in many parts of central africa and even in the new world it also involves the idea of moral turpitude as if the woman were one of the lower animals capable of superfetation there is no greater insult to a man than to point at him with two fingers meaning that he is a twin of course he is not one or he would have been killed at birth albinos are allowed to live as in dahome in ashanti and among some east african tribes where i have been chaffed about a brother white who proved to be an exceptional negro without pigmentum nigrum  there is no novelty in the mpongwe funeral rites the same system prevails from the oil rivers to congoland and extends even to the wild races of the interior the corpse being still sentient is accompanied by stores of raiment pots and goats flesh a bottle is placed in one hand and a glass in the other and if the deceased has been fond of play his draughtboard and other materials are buried with him the system has been well defined as one in which the ghost of a man eats the ghost of a yam boiled in the ghost of a pot over the ghost of a fire the body after being stretched out in a box is carried to a lonely place some are buried deep others close to the surface there is an immense show of grief with keening and crocodiles tears perhaps to benefit the living by averting a charge of witchcraft which would inevitably lead to sassy or poisonwater the wake continues for five days when they pull the cry that is to say end mourning if these pious rites be neglected the children incur the terrible reproach your father he be hungry the widow may remarry immediately after living for cry and if young and lusty she looks out for another consort within the week the slave is thrown out into the bushno one will take the trouble to dig a hole for him  the industry of the mpongwe is that of the african generally every man is a host in himself he builds and furnishes his house he makes his weapons and pipes and he ignores division of labour except in the smith and the carpenter in the potter who works without a wheel and in the dyer who knows barks and who fixes his colours with clay the men especially pride themselves upon canoemaking the favourite wood is the buoyant okumeh or bombax that monarch of the african forest i have seen a boat 45 feet 10 inches by 5 feet 11 inches in beam cut out of a single tree with the mpáno or little adze a lineal descendant of the silex implement and i have heard of others measuring 70 feet these craft easily carry 10 tons and travel 200 to 300 miles which as mr wilson remarks would land them under favourable circumstances in south america captain boteler found that the mpongwe boat combined symmetry of form strength and solidity with safeness and swiftness either in pulling or sailing and of late years the people have succeeded in launching large and fast craft built after european models  the favourite pleasures of the mpongwe are gross and gorging feeds drinking and smoking they recall to mind the old woman who told monk lewis that if a glass of gin were at one end of the table and her immortal soul at the other she would choose the gin they soak with palmwine every day they indulge in rum and absinthe and the wealthy affect socalled cognac with champagne and bordeaux which however they pronounce to be cold i have seen master boro a boy five years old drain without winking a wineglassful of brandy it is not wonderful that the adults can stand but little and that a few mouthfuls of wellwatered spirit make their voices thick and paralyze their weak brains as well as their tongues the persians who commence drinking late in life can swallow strong waters by the tumbler  men women and children when hardly cremnobatic have always the pipe in mouth the favourite article is a dudheen a well culotté clay used and worn till the bowl touches the nose the poor are driven to a kondukwe a yard of plantain leaf hollowed with a wire and charged at the thicker end the holy herb would of course grow in the country and grow well but it is imported from the states without trouble and perhaps with less expense some tribes make a decent snuff of the common trade article but i never saw either sex chewperhaps the most wholesome and certainly the most efficacious form the smoking of lyámbá called dyámbá in the southern regions is confined to debauchees m du chaillu asserts that this cannabis sativa is not found wild and the people confirm his statement possibly it has extended from hindostan to zanzibar and thence across the continent intoxicating hemp is now grown everywhere especially in the nkommi country and little packages neatly bound with banana leaves sell on the river for ten sous each it is smoked either in the kondukwe or in the ojo the latter literally meaning a torch is a polished cowhorn closed at the thick end with wood and banded with metal a wooden stem projecting from the upper or concave side bears a neat chillam bowl either of clay or of brown steatite brought from the upper gaboon river this rude hookah is half filled with water the dried hemp in the bowl is covered with what syrians call a kurs a bit of metal about the size of halfacrown and upon it rests the fire i at once recognized the implement in the brazil where many slave holders simply supposed it to be a servile and african form of tobaccopipe after a few puffs the eyes redden a violent cough is caused by the acrid fumes tickling the throat the brain whirls with a pleasant swimming like that of chloroform and the smoker finds himself in gloriâ my spanish friends at po tried but did not like it i can answer for the hemp being stronger than the egyptian hashísh or the bhang of hindostan it rather resembled the fasúkh of northern africa the dakha and motukwane of the southern regions and the wild variety called in sind bang i jabalí  the religion of african races is ever interesting to those of a maturer faith it is somewhat like the study of childhood to an old man the jew the highcaste hindú and the guebre the christian and the moslem have their holy writs their fixed forms of thought and worship in fact their grooves in which belief runs they no longer see through a glass darkly nothing with them is left vague or undetermined continuation resurrection eternity are hereditary and habitual ideas they have become almost inseparable and congenital parts of the mental system this condition renders it nearly as difficult for us to understand the vagueness and mistiness of savage and unwritten creeds as to penetrate into the modus agendi of animal instinct and there is yet another obstacle in dealing with such people their intense and childish sensitiveness and secretiveness they are not as some have foolishly supposed ashamed of their tenets or their practices but they are unwilling to speak about them they fear the intentions of the crossquestioner and they hold themselves safest behind a crooked answer moreover every mpongwe is his own pontifex maximus and the want or rather the scarcity of a regular priesthood must promote independence and discrepancy of belief  whilst noticing the fetishism of the gaboon i cannot help observing by the way how rapidly the civilization of the nineteenth century is redeveloping together with the religion of humanity the old faith not of paganism but of cosmos of nature how directly it is in fact going back to its oldergods the unknowable of our day is the brahm the akaranazaman the gaboon anyambía of which nothing can be predicated but an existence utterly unintelligible to the brain of man a something free from the accidents of personality of volition of intelligence of design of providence a something which cannot be addressed by veneration or worship whose sole effects are subjective that is upon the worshipper not upon the worshipped nothing also can be more illogical than the awe and respect claimed by mr herbert spencer for a being of which the very essence is that nothing can be known of it and as the idea grows the several modes and forms of the unknowable the hormuzd and ahriman of the dualist those personifications of good and evil the brahma vishnu and shiva creation preservation and destruction the beginning the middle and the end of all things the triad adored by all triadists under some modification as that of osiris isis and horus father mother and son type of the family or jupiter neptune and pluto the three great elements these outward and visible expressions lose force and significance making place for that law of which they are the rude exponents the marvellous spread of spiritualism whose god is the unknowable and whose prophet was swedenborg is but the polished form of the mpongwe ibambo and ilogo the beneficent phantasms have succeeded to the malevolent ghosts the shadowy deities of mans childhood as the god of love formerly took the place of the god of fear the future of spiritualism which may be defined as hades with progress is making serious inroads upon the coarse belief worthy of the barbarous and the middle ages in an eternity of punishment easily expressed by everlasting fire and in ineffable joys which no one has ever successfully expressed the ghosts of our childhood have now become bonâ fide objective beings who rap raise tables display fireworks rain flowers and brew tea we explain by levitation the riding of the witch upon the broomstick to the sabbath we can no longer refuse credence to canidia and all her spells and the very vagueness of the modern faith serves to assimilate it the more to its most ancient forms one of which we are studying upon the gaboon river  the missionary returning from africa is often asked what is the religion of the people if an exact man he will answer i dont know and how can he know when the people themselves even the princes and priests are ignorant of it a missionary of twenty years standing in west africa an able and conscientious student withal assured me that during the early part of his career he had given much time to collecting and collating under intelligent native superintendence negro traditions and religion he presently found that no two men thought alike upon any single subject i need hardly say that he gave up in despair a work hopeless as psychology the mere study of the individual  fetishism i believe is held by the orthodox to be a degradation of the pure and primitive adamical dispensation even as the negro has been supposed to represent the accursed and degraded descendants of ham and canaan i cannot but look upon it as the first dawn of a faith in things not seen and it must be studied by casting off all our preconceived ideas for instance africans believe not in soul nor in spirit but in ghost when they called m du chaillu a mbwiri they meant that the white man had been bleached by the grave as dante had been darkened by his visit below and consequently he was a subject of fear and awe they have a material evanescent intelligible future not an immaterial incomprehensible eternity the ghost endures only for awhile and perishes like the memory of the littlegreat name hence the ignoble dread in east and west africa of a death which leads to a shadowy world and eventually to utter annihilation seeing nought beyond the presentfuture there is no hope for them in the grave they wail and sorrow with a burden of despair amekwishahe is finishedis the east africans last word concerning kinsman and friend all is done for ever sing the west africans any allusion to loss of life turns their black skins blue yes they exclaim it is bad to die to leave house and home wife and children no more to wear soft cloth nor eat meat nor drink tobacco and rum never speak of that the moribund will exclaim with a shudder such is the ever present horror of their dreadful and dreary times of sickness always aggravated by suspicions of witchcraft the only cause which their imperfect knowledge of physics can assign to death even van helmont asserted deus non fecit mortem the peoples who like those of dahome have a distinct future world have borrowed it i cannot help thinking from egypt and when an african chief said in my presence to a yahoolike naval officer when so be i die i come up for white man when so be you die you come up for monkey my suspicion is that he had distorted the doctrine of some missionary man would hardly have a future without a distinct priestly class whose interest it is to teach another and a betteror a worse  certain missionaries in the gaboon river have detected evidences of judaism amongst the mpongwe which deserve notice but which hardly require detailed refutation 1 circumcision even on the eighth day as amongst the efik of the old calabar river but this is a familiar custom borrowed from egypt by the semites it is done in a multitude of ways which are limited only by necessity the resemblance of the mpongwe rite to that of the jews though remarkable is purely accidental 2 the division of tribes into separate families and frequently into the number twelve but this again appears fortuitous almost all the west african people have some such division and they range upwards from three as amongst the krumen the gallas the wakwafiand the wanyikafn11 3 exogamy or the rigid interdiction of marriage between clans and families nearly related here again the hindu and the somal observe the custom rigidly whilst the jews and arabs have ever taken to wife their first cousins 4 sacrifices with blood sprinkling upon altars and doorposts a superstition almost universal found in peru and mexico as in palestine preserved in ashanti and probably borrowed by the hebrews from the african egyptians 5 the formal and ceremonial observance of new moons but the wanyamwezi and other tribes also hail the appearance of the lesser light like the moslems who when they sight the hilal crescent ejaculate a short prayer for blessings throughout the month which it ushers in 6 a specified time of mourning for the dead common to all barbarians as to civilized races during which their survivors wear soiled clothes an instinctive sign of grief as fine dresses are of joy and shave their heads doubtless done to make some difference from every day times accompanied with ceremonial purifications what ancient people has not had some such whim 7 the system of runda or forbidden meats but every traveller has found this practice in south as in east africa and i noticed it among the somal who even when starving will not touch fish nor fowl briefly external resemblances and coincidences like these could be made to establish cousinhood between a cockney and a cockatoo possibly such discovery of judaism dates from the days about 1840 when men were mad to find the lost tribes as if they had not quite enough to do with the two which remain to them  the mpongwe and their neighbours have advanced a long step beyond their black brethren in eastern africa no longer contented with mere fetishes the egyptian charms in which the dreaded ghost sitsfn12 meaning is bound they have invented idols a manifest advance toward that polytheism and pantheism which lead through a triad and duad of deities to monotheism the finial of the spiritual edifice in eastern africa i know but one people the wanyika near mombasah who have certain images called kisukas they declare that this great medicine never shown to europeans came from the west and andrew battel 1600 found idols amongst the people whom he calls giagas or jagas meaning congoese chiefs moreover the gaboon pagans lodge their idols behind each larger establishment there is a dwarf hut the miniature of a dwellingplace carefully closed i thought these were offices but hotaloya andrews taught me otherwise he called them in his broken english compasshouses a literal translation of nágo mbwiri and sturdily refusing me admittance left me as wise as before the reason afterwards proved to be that ologo he kill man too much  i presently found out that he called my pocket compass mbwiri a very vague and comprehensive word it represents in the highest signification the columbian manitou and thus men talk of the mbwiri of a tree or a river as will presently be seen it is also applied to a tutelar god and i have shown how it means a ghost in nágo mbwiri the sense is an idol an object of worship a medicine as the northamerican indians say in contradistinction to munda a grigri talisman or charm every mpongwe woman as well as man has some mbwiri to which offerings are made in times of misfortune sickness or danger i afterwards managed to enter one of these rude and embryonal temples so carefully shut behind the little door of matting is a tall threshold of board a bench lines the far end and in the centre stands ologo a rude imitation of a human figure with a gumtorch planted in the ground before it ready for burnt offerings to the walls are suspended sundry mystic implements especially basins smeared with red and white chalkmixture and wooden crescents decorated with beads and ribbons  during worship certain objects are placed before the joss the suppliant at the same time jangling and shaking the ncheke a rude beginning of the bell the gong the rattle and the instruments played before idols by more advanced peoples it is a piece of wood hourglassshaped but flat and some six inches and a half long the girth of the waist is five inches and about three more round the ends the wood is cut away leaving rude and uneven raised bands horizontally striped with white black and red two brass wires are stretched across the upper and lower breadth and each is provided with a ring or hinge holding four or five strips of wire acting as clappers  this wickerwork rattle to drive the devil out m du chaillu chap xxvi is called by the mpongwe soke and serves only like that of the dahomans and the ashantis bowdich 364 for dancing and merriment the south american maraca was the sole object of worship known to the tupi or brazilian indians fn13  the beliefs and superstitions popularly attributed to the mpongwe are these they are not without that which we call a first cause and they name it anyambia which missionary philologists consider a contraction of aninla spirit  and mbia good m du chaillu everywhere confounds anyambía or as he writes the word aniambié with inyemba a witch to bewitch being punga inyemba mr w winwood reade seems to make anyambía a mysterious word as was jehovah after the date of the moabite stone like the brahm of the hindus the god of epicurus and confucius and the akáranazaman or endless time of the guebres anyambia is a vague being a vox et præterea nihil without personality too high and too remote for interference in human affairs therefore not addressed in prayer never represented by the human form never lodged in temples under this unknown god are two chief agencies working partners who manage the business of the world and who effect what the civilized call providence mbwírí here becomes the osiris jove hormuzd or good god the vishnu or preserver a tutelar deity a lar a guardian onyámbe is the bad god typhon vejovis the ahriman or semitic devil shiva the destroyer the third person of the aryan triad and his name is never mentioned but with bated breath they have not only fear of but also a higher respect for him than for the giver of good so difficult is it for the child mans mind to connect the ideas of benignity and power he would harm if he could ergo so would his god i once hesitated to believe that these rude people had arrived at the notion of duality at the manichaeanism which caused mr mill sen surprise that no one had revived it in his time at an idea so philosophical which leads directly to the ne plus ultra of faith el wahdaníyyeh or monotheism nor should i have credited them with so logical an apparatus for the regimen of the universe or so stouthearted an attempt to solve the eternal riddle of good and evil but the same belief also exists amongst the congoese tribes and even in the debased races of the niger captain william alien niger expedition i 227 thus records the effect when at the request of the commissioners herr schon the missionary began stating to king obi the difference between the christian religion and heathenism  herr schön there is but one god  king obi i always understood there were two c  the mpongwe mwetye is a branch of male freemasonry into which women and strangers are never initiated the bakele and shekyani according to western africa wilson pp 3912 consider it a great spirit nothing is more common amongst adjoining negro tribes than to annex one anothers superstitions completely changing withal their significance ovengwá is a vampire the apparition of a dead man tall as a tree always winking and clearly seen which is not the case with the ibámbo and ilogo plurals of obambo and ologo these are vulgar ghosts of the departed the causes of possession disease and death they are propitiated by various rites and everywhere they are worshipped in private mr wilson opines that the obambo are the spirits of the ancestors of the people and inlâgâ are the spirits of strangers and have come from a distance but this was probably an individual tenet the mumbojumbo of the mandengas the semo of the súsús the tassau or purrahdevil of the mendis the egugun of the egbas the egbo of the duallas and the mwetye and ukukwe of the bakele is represented in pongoland by the ndá which is an order of the young men ndá dwells in the woods and comes forth only by night bundled up in dry plantain leavesfn14 and treading on tall stilts he precedes free adult males who parade the streets with dance and song the women and children fly at the approach of this devil on two sticks and with reason every peccadillo is punished with a merciless thrashing the institution is intended to keep in order the weaker sex the young and the chattels ndá has tried visiting white men and missionaries but his visits have not been a success  the civilized man would be apt to imagine that these wild african fetishists are easily converted to a purer creed the contrary is everywhere and absolutely the case their faith is a web woven with threads of iron the negro finds it almost impossible to rid himself of his belief the spiritual despotism is the expression of his organization a part of himself progressive races on the other hand can throw off or exchange every part of their religion except perhaps the remnant of original and natural belief in things unseenin fact the fetishist portion such as ghostexistence and veneration of material objects places and things i might instance the protestant missionary who while deriding the holy places at jerusalem considers the cedars of lebanon sacred things and sternly forbids travellers to gather the cones  the stereotyped african answer to europeans ridiculing these institutions including wizardspearing and witchburning is there may be no magic though i see there is among you whites but we blacks have known many men who have been bewitched and died even in asia whenever i spoke contemptuously to a moslem of his jinns or to a hindu of his rákshasa the rejoinder invariably was you white men are by nature so hot that even our devils fear you  witchcraft which has by no means thoroughly disappeared from europe maintains firm hold upon the african brain the idea is found amongst christians for instance the reduced indians of the amazonas river and it is evidently at the bottom of that widely spread superstition the evil eye which remains throughout southern europe as strong as it was in the days of pliny as amongst barbarians generally no misfortune happens no accident occurs no illness nor death can take place without the agency of wizard or witch there is nothing more odious than this crime it is hostile to god and man and it must be expiated by death in the most terrible tortures metamorphosis is a common art amongst mpongwe magicians this vulgar materialism of which ovid sang must not be confounded with the poetical hindu metempsychosis or transmigration of souls which explains empirically certain physiological mysteries here the adept naturally becomes a gorilla or a leopard as he would be a lion in south africa a hyena in abyssinia and the somali country and a loupgarou in brittanyfn15  the poison ordeal is a necessary corollary to witchcraft the plant most used by the oganga medicine man is a small red rooted shrub not unlike a hazel bush and called ikázyá or ikájá mr wilson p 225 writes nkazya battel loc cit 334 terms the root imbando a corruption of mbundú m du chaillu chap xv gives an illustration of the mboundou leaf half size professor john torrey believes the active principle to be a vegetoalkali of the strychnos group but the symptoms do not seem to bear out the conjecture the mpongwe told me that the poison was named either mbundú or olondá nut werereperhaps this was what is popularly called a sell mbundú is the decoction of the scraped bark which corresponds with the sassy water of the northern maritime tribes the accused after drinking the potion is ordered to step over sticks of the same plant which are placed a pace apart if the man be affected he raises his foot like a horse with stringhalt and this convicts him of the foul crime of course there is some antidote as the medicineman himself drinks large draughts of his own stuff in old calabar river for instance mithridates boils the poisonnut but europeans could not and natives would not tell me what the gaboon dodge is according to vulgar africans all testpoisons are sentient and reasoning beings who search the criminals stomach that is his heart and who find out the deep hidden sin hence the people shout if they are wizards let it kill them if they are innocent let it go forth moreover the detected murderer is considered a bungler who has fallen into the pit dug for his brother doubtless many innocent lives have been lost by this superstition but there is reason in the order thou shalt not suffer a witch to live without having recourse to the supernaturalisms and preternaturalisms which have unobligingly disappeared when science most wants them sorcery and poison are as closely united as the black nightingales and it evidently differs little whether i slay a man with my sword or i destroy him by the slow and certain torture of a mind diseased  the mpongwe have also some peculiarities in their notions of justice if a man murder another the criminal is put to death not by the nearest of kin as amongst the arabs and almost all wild people but by the whole community this already shows an advanced appreciation of the act and its bearings the penalty is either drowning or burning alive except in the case of a chief or a very rich man little or no difference is made between wilful murder justifiable homicide and accidental manslaughter the reason of this say their jurists is to make people more careful here again we find a sense of the sanctity of life the reverse of barbarous cutting and maiming are punished by the fine of a slave  and now briefly to resume the character of the mpongwe a nervous and excitable race of negroes the men are deficient in courage as the women are in chastity and neither sex has a tincture of what we call morality to commercial shrewdness and eagerness they add exceptional greed of gain and rascality foreign rum and tobacco dress and ornaments arms and ammunition have been necessaries to them they will have them and unless they can supply themselves by licit they naturally fly to illicit means yet despite threats of poison and charges of witchcraft they have arrived at an inkling of the dogma that honesty is the best policy the east african has never dreamed it in the moments of his wildest imagination preeminent liars they are curious to say often deceived by the falsehoods of others and they fairly illustrate the somewhat paradoxical proverb     he who hates truth shall be the dupe of lies  unblushing mendicants cunning and calculating their obstinacy is remarkable yet as we often find the african they are at the same time irresolute in the extreme their virtues are vivacity mental activity acute observation sociability politeness and hospitality the fact that a white man can wander singlehanded through the country shows a kindly nature the brightest spot in their character is an abnormal development of adhesiveness popularly called affection it is somewhat tempered by capricious ruffianism as in children yet it entitles them to the gratítude of travellers  the language of the mpongwe has been fairly studied t edward bowdich mission from cape coast castle to ashantee london murray 1819 when leaving the west coast for england touched at the gaboon in a trading vessel and visited naango king georges town on abaaga creek which he places fifty miles up stream he first gave appendix vi a list of the mpongwe numerals in 1847 the missionaries of the a b c f m gaboon mission western africa printed a grammar of the mpongwe language with vocabularies new yorksnowden and pratt vesey street perhaps a little prematurely it is the first of the four dialects on this part of the coast reduced to system by the american missionaries especially by the rev mr leighton wilson the others being bakele benga and fán  in 1856 the same gentleman who had taken the chief part in the first publication made an able abstract and a comparison with the grebo and mandenga tongues western africa part iv chap iv m du chaillu further abridged this abridgement in his appendix without owning his authority and in changing the examples he did all possible damage in the transactions of the ethnological society of london part ii vol i new series he also gave an abstract in which he repeats himself a vocabulaire de la langue ponga was printed in the mémoires de la société ethnologique tome ii by m p h delaporte  the other publications known to me are  1 the book of proverbs translated into the mpongwe language at the mission of the a b c f m gaboon west africa new york american bible society instituted in the year mdcccxvi 1859  2 the books of genesis part of exodus proverbs and acts by the same printed at the same place and in the same year  the missionary explorers of the language if i may so call them at once saw that it belongs to the great south african family sichwáná zulu kisawahíli mbundo congoese fiote and others whose characteristics are polysyllabism inflection by systematic prefixes and an alliteration the mystery of whose reciprocal letters is theoretically explained by a euphony in many cases unintelligible like the modes of hindú music to the european earfn16 but they naturally fell into the universally accepted error of asserting it has no known affinities to any of the languages north of the mountains of the moon meaning the equatorial chain which divides the niger and nile valleys from the basin of the congo  this branch has its peculiarities like italianthe coquette who grants her smiles to many her favours to fewone of the easiest to understand and to speak a little it is very difficult to master whilst every native child can thread its way safely through its intricate elaborate and apparently arbitrary variations the people comprehend a stranger who blunders over every sentence mr wilson thus limits the use of the accent whilst the mandenga a grammar of the mandenga language by the rev r maxwell macbriar london john mason and the grebo grammar by the right rev john payne dd 150 nassau street new york 1864 distinguish between similar words especially monosyllables by a certain pitch of voice the mpongwe repel accent and rely solely upon the clear and distinct vowel sounds but i found the negative past present and future forms of verbs wholly dependent upon a change of accent or rather of intonation or voicepitch which the strangers ear unless acute will fail to detect for instance mi taund  would mean i love mi taundá i do not love the reverend linguist also asserts that it is almost entirely free from guttural and nasal sounds the latter appeared to me as numerous and complicated as in the sanskrit mr wilson could hardly have had a nice ear or he would not have written nchígo ntyege or njína engena which gives a thoroughly unafrican distinctness to the initial consonant  the adjectival form is archaically expressed by a second and abstract substantive this peculiarity is common in the south african family as in ashanti but as bowdich observes we also find it in greek eg greek                  heresies of destruction for destructive another notable characteristic is the mpongwes fondness for the passive voice never using if possible the active for instance instead of saying he was born thus he prefers the birth that was thus borned by him the dialect changes the final as well as the initial syllable a process unknown to the purest types of the south african family as we advance north we find this phenomenon ever increasing for instance in fernando po but the mpongwe limits the change to verbs  another distinguishing point of these three gaboon tongues as the rev mr mackey observes is the surprizing flexibility of the verb the almost endless variety of parts regularly derived from a single root there are perhaps no other languages in the world that approach them in the variety and extent of the inflections of the verb possessing at the same time such rigid regularity of conjugation and precision of the meaning attached to each part it is calculated that the whole number of tenses or shades of meaning which a mpongwe radical verb may be made to express with the aid of its auxiliary particles augmentatives and negativesprefixes infixes and suffixesis between twelve and fifteen hundred worse than an arabic triliteral  liquid and eminently harmonious concise and capable of contraction the mpongwe tongue does not deserve to die out the genius of the language is such that new terms may be introduced in relation to ethics metaphysics and science even to the great truths of the christian religion  the main defect is that of the south african languages generally a deficiency of syntax of gender and case a want of vigour in sound a too great precision of expression rendering it clumsy and unwieldy and an absence of exceptions which give beauty and variety to speech the people have never invented any form of alphabet yet the abundance of tale legend and proverb which their dialect contains might repay the trouble of acquiring it                                 chapter v                      to sángatánga and back    my objects in visiting mbátá the reader will have understood were to shoot a specimen or specimens of the gorilla and if possible to buy or catch a youngster even before landing the pilot had assured me that a baby was on sale at the comptoir but on inquiry it proved to have died i was by no means sanguine of successwhen the fight is against time the old man usually wins the day the short limits of my trip would not allow me to wander beyond the coast and the nearer riverine regions where frequent villages and the constant firing of muskets have taught all wild animals that flight is their only defence thus besides being rare they must be shy and timid wary and knowing like an old hedgehog hunted for his grease the first glance at the bush suggested surely it is impossible to find big game in such a land of farms and plantations  those who have shot under such circumstances will readily understand that everything depends upon luck one man may beat the forest assiduously and vainly for five or six weeks another will be successful on the first day thus whilst i without any fault of my own utterly failed in shooting a gorilla although i saw him and heard him and came upon his trail and found his mortal spoils another traveller had hardly landed in the gaboon before he was so fortunate as to bring down a fine anthropoid  however as man cannot command success i was obliged to content myself with doing all in my power to deserve it i offered five dollars equalling the same number of sovereigns in england to every huntsman for every fair shot and ten dollars for each live ape i implicitly obeyed all words of command and my factotum selim agha was indefatigable in his zeal indeed luck was dead against us during the whole of my stay in gorillaland we ran a fair risk of drowning in the first days voyage on the next march we were knocked down by lightning and on the last trip i had a narrow escape from the fall of a giant branch that grazed my hammock  my first bush evening was spent in palmwine rum and wassail one must begin by humouring africans under pain of being considered a churl but the inevitable result is that next day they will by some pretext or other shirk work to enjoy the headache that old villain young prince becoming very fou hospitably offered me his daughterinlaw azizeh forteunes second wife and he was vigorously supported by the nimrod himself who had

sturdy personage of twentyfive with thick wrists and ankles a very dark skin and a face rendered pleasing by good humour and azízeh was childless a sad reproach in these lands where progeny forms a mans wealth and a womans honour  the next day was perforce a halt as had been expected moreover rains and tornadoes were a reasonable pretext for nursing the headache the 21st was also wet and stormy so nimrod hid himself and was not to be found then the balivernes began one asini a mpongwe from the plateau offered to show me a huge gorilla near his village in the afternoon he was confronted with young prince and he would have blushed scarlet if he could but he assured me plaintively that he must lie to live and after all la prudence des souris nest pas celle des chats before dark forteune

early hour we passed ndagola a fresh clearing and newly built huts and then we skirted a deep and forested depression upon whose further side lay our bourne it promised sandflies the prime pest of

complained of fatigue after a two hours walk and then busied themselves ostentatiously in cleaning their muskets in collecting provisions and in appointing certain bushmen to meet us on the morrow

found ourselves deep in the dewdripping forest the leaves no longer crackled crisp under foot and the late rains had made the swamps somewhat odorous after an hour of cautious walking listening as we went we saw evident signs of mister gorilla boughs three inches in diameter strewed the ground the husks of ntondo or ibere wild cardamom had been scattered about and a huge hares form of leaves lay some five yards from the tree where forteune declared that mistress and master gorilla had passed the night paterfamilias keeping watch below a little beyond we were shown a spot where two males had been fighting a duel or where a couple had been indulging in dalliance sweet the prints were 8 inches long and 6 across the huge round toes whilst the hinder hand appeared almost bifurcate the thumb forming nearly a half this is explained in the gorilla book chap xx only the ball of the foot and that thumb which answers to our great toe seem to touch the ground  presently we came upon the five bushmen who had been appointed to meet us they were a queerlooking lot with wild unsteady eyes receding brows horizontal noses and projecting muzzles the cranium and the features seemed disposed nearly at a right angle giving them a peculiar baboonlike semblance each had his water gourd and his flintgun the lock protected by a cover of monkeys skin or wild cows hide whilst gibècieres and ammunitionbags of grasscloth hung from their shoulders there were also two boys with native axes small iron triangles whose points passed through knobsticks these were to fell the trees in which our game might take refuge and possibly they might have done so in a week a few minutes with this party convinced me that i was wilfully wasting time they would not separate and they talked so loud that game would be startled a mile off i proposed that they should station me in a likely place form a circle and drive up what was in itthey were far above acting beaters after that fashion so we dismissed them and dispersed about the bush my factotum shot a fine mboko siurus eborivorus 2 ft 2 in total length the people declare that this squirrel gnaws ivory whence its name i had heard of it in east and central africa but the tale appeared fabulous here it is very common half a dozen will be seen during the day it has great vitality and it will escape after severe wounds the bushmen also brought a shoke colubus satanas a small black monkey remarkably large limbed the little unfortunate was timid but not vicious it worried itself to death on the next day they also showed me the head of the njíwo antelope which m du chaillu chap xii describes as a singular animal of the size of a donkey with shorter legs no horns and black with a yellow spot on the backfn17  in the afternoon selim went to fetch my arsenical soap from mbátá where i had left it en fitiché as long as that bad medicine was within hotaloyas ben no one would dare to meddle with my goods forteune walked in very tired about sunset he had now added streaks of red to the white chalk upon his face arms and breast for he suspected we were assured witchcraft i told him to get ready for a march on the morrow to the shekyáni country lying southeast but he begged so hard and he seemed so assured of showing sport that the design was deferred and again perdidi diem  monday the 24th was a black monday sultry and thundery we went to the bush and once more we returned disgusted by the chattering of the wild men as we discussed our plans for moving forteune threw cold water upon every proposal this puzzled me and the difficulty was to draw his secret at last kángá a black youth who being one of the family had attached himself uninvited to the party blurted out in bad french that the shekyáni chief to whose settlement we were bound had left for the interior and that the village women would not or rather could not give us chop this was a settler to my mpongwe friends nimrod however declared that some bushmen had lately seen several gorillas in the direction of sángatánga two marches down coast from mbátá and about halfway to cape lopez i did not believe a word of his intelligence the direction is southwest instead of southeast towards the sea instead of into the forest but it was evidently hopeless to seek for the ole man in these parts and i had long been anxious to see sánga tánga we therefore agreed nem con to set out before dawn on the next day  but the next day dawned and the sun rose high and the world was well heated and aired before the bushmen condescended to appear after a two hours battle with the sandflies we set off at 735 am forteune hotaloya and kángá at the head of the musketeers one of them also carrying an axe sixteen guns form a strong party for these regions the viol nchámbí was not allowed to hang mute in mbatas halls this instrument or the drum must never be neglected in african travel its melody at the halt and the campfire are to the negro what private theatricals are to the european sailor half fossilized in the frozen seas our specimen was strung with thin cords made from the fibre of a lliana i was shown this growth which looked much like a convolvulus the people have a long list of instruments and their music though monotonous is soft and plaintive bowdich gives a specimen of it sketch of gaboon p 449 and of a bard who seems to have been somewhat more frenzied than most poets captain allen iii 398 speaks of a harp at bimbia camarones tightly strung with the hard fibre of some creeping plant the bákele harp m du chaillu chap xvi is called ngombi the handle opposite the bow often has a carved face and it might be a beginning of the article used by civilized europe wales for instance  the path plunged westward into the bush spanned a dirty and grassgrown plantation of bananas dived under thorn tunnels and arches of bush and crossed six nullahs neropotamoi then dry but full of water on our return the antnests were those of yoruba and the mendi country not the tall steepled edifices built by the termites with yellow clay as in eastern africa but an eruption of blueblack harddried mud and mucus resembling the miniature pagodas policemans lanterns mushrooms or umbrellas one or two feet high here single there double common in ashanti and congoland like most of their congeners the animals die when exposed to the sun the bashikouay and nchounou nchuu of m du chaillu are the common driverant of west africa termes bellicosa it is little feared in the gaboon when its armies attack the missionhouses they are easily stopped by lighting spirits of turpentine or by a strew of quicklime which combines with the formic acid the different species are described in palm land and western africa pp 369373 from which even the account of the tubular bridge is takenmr wilson less sensationally calls it what it is a live raft the most common are the nkázeze a large reddish and fetid ant which is harmless to man the njenge a smaller red species and the ibimbízí whose bite is painful  we passed the mortal remains of a gorilla lashed to a pole the most interesting parts had been sold to mr r b n walker and were on their way to england i was shown for the first time the ndámbo or ndambié bowdich olamboo which gives the india rubber of commerce it is not a fatleaved figtree ficus elastica of asia nor aeuphorbia siphonia elastica as in south america but a large climbing ficus a cable thick as a mans leg crossing the path and swarming up to the top of the tallest boles the yellow fruit is tart and pleasant to the taste in 1817 the style of collecting the gum olamboo was to spread with a knife the glutinous milk as it oozed from the tree over the shaved breast and arms like a plaister it was then taken off rolled up in balls to play with or stretched over drums no other use being known the rev mr wilson declares chap ii that he first discovered the gum elastic which has been procured as yet only at corisco gabun and kama in 1854 mr thompson p 112 found it in the mendi country near sherbro he describes it as a vine with dense bark which yields the gum when hacked and which becomes soft and porous when old the juice is milkwhite thick and glutinous soon stiffening darkening and hardening without aid of art i should like to see the raw material tried for making waterproofs in the tropics where the best vulcanized articles never last the ndámbo tree has been traced a hundred miles inland from the liberian coast that of the gallinas and sherbro is the best at st pauls river it is not bad but on the junk river it is sticky and little prized the difficulty everywhere is to make the negro collect it and when he does to sell it unadulterated in east africa he uses the small branches of the ficus for flogging canes but will not take the trouble even to hack the mpira tree   at a brook of the sweetest water purling over the cleanest and brightest of golden sands we filled the canteens this being the last opportunity for some time forest walks are thirsty work during the hot season the air is close fetid and damp with mire the seabreeze has no power to enter and perspiration streams from every pore after heavy rains it is still worse the surface of the land is changed and paths become lines of dark puddles the nullahs before dry roll muddy darkbrown streams and their mouths streak the sea with froth and scum hardly a living object meets the eye and only the loud whirring flight of some large bird breaks the dreary silence the music of the surf now sounded like the song of the seashell as we crossed another rough prism of stone and bush whose counterslope fell gently into a sandflat overgrown with ipomaa and other bright flowering plants after walking about an hour equal to 250 miles between south and southwest we saluted the pleasant aspect of greek         with a general cheer northwards lay point ipizarala southways nyonye both looking like treeclumps rising from the waves i could not sufficiently admire and i shall never forget the exquisite loveliness of land and sea the graceful curve of the beach a hundred feet broad fining imperceptibly away till lost in the convexity of waters the morning sun half way to the zenith burned bright in a cloudless sky whilst in the east and west distant banks of purple mist coloured the liquid plain with a cool greenblue a celadon tint that reposed the eye and the brain the porpoise raised in sport his dark glistening back to the light of day and plunged into the cool depths as if playing off the amate sponde of the mediterranean and sandpipers and curlews the latter wild as ever paced the smooth pure floor the shoreline was backed by a dark vegetable wall here and there broken and fronted by single trees white mangroves tightly corded down and raised on stilted roots high above the tide between wood and wave lay powdered sandstone of lively yellow mixed with bright white quartz and débris of pink shells upon the classic shores of greece i should have thought of poseidon and the nereids but the lovely scene was in unromantic africa which breeds no such visions of       the fair humanities of old religion  resuming our road we passed the ruins of an olako the khámbí of east africa a temporary encampment whose few poles were still standing under a shady tree we then came upon a blockaded lagoon the seawater had been imprisoned by a high bank which the waves had washed up and it will presently be released by storms from the southwest near the water even at halfebb we find the floor firm and pleasant it becomes loose walking at high tide and the ribbed banks are fatiguing to ascend and descend under a hot sun and in reeking air a seine would have supplied a manofwar in a few hours large turtle is often turned in places young ones about the size of a dollar scuttled towards the sea and hotaloya brought a nest of eggs which however were too high in flavour for the european palate the host of crabs lining the water stood alert watching our approach and when we came within a hundred yards they hurried sideways into the safer seathe scene reminded me of the days when after tiffin we used to már kankrás on the clifton sands in the unhappy valley  presently we came to a remarkable feature of this coast the first specimen of which was seen at point ovindo in the gaboon river the iberian explorers called them sernas fields or downs opposed to corôas sanddunes or hills they are clearings in the jungle made by natures hand fenced round everywhere save on the sea side by tall walls of dark vegetation averaging perhaps a mile long by 200 yards broad and broken by mounds and terraces regular as if worked by art these prairies bear a green sward seldom taller than three feet and now ready for the firehere and there the verdure is dotted by a tree or two it is universally asserted that they cannot be cultivated and if this be true the cause would be worth investigating in some places they are perfectly level and almost flush with the sea in others they swell gently to perhaps 100 feet in other parts again they look like scarps and earthworks remarkably resembling the lower parasitic craters of a huge volcano and here and there they are pitted with sinks like the seaboard of loango these savannahs savánas add an indescribable charm to the gaboon coast especially when the morning and evening suns strike them with slanting rays and compel them to stand out distinct from the setting of eternal emerald the aspect of the downs is civilized as the banks of the solent and the coast wants nothing to complete the fine quiet oldcountry picture in the wilds of africa but herds of kine grazing upon leas shining with a golden glory or a country seat backed by the noble virgin forest such a bosquet as europe never knew  after another hours walk which carried us about three miles we sighted in one of these prairillons a clump of seventeen huts a negro in european clothes after prospecting the party through a ships glass probably the gift of some slaver came down to meet us and led the way to his town finding his guest an englishman the host who spoke a few words of french and portuguese at once began to talk of his summer gîte where pirogues were cut out and boats were built there were indeed some signs of this industrie but all things wore the true barracoon aspect two very fine girls were hid behind the huts but did not escape my factotums sharp eyes and several of the doors were carefully padlocked the pretty faces had been removed when he returned this coast does an active retail business with são thomé and the ilha do principeabout cape lopez the ebony trade still i hear flourishes on a small scale  during our halt for breakfast at the barracoon we were visited by petit denis a son of the old king his village is marked upon the charts some four miles southsoutheast of his fathers but at this season all the royalties we are assured affect the sea shore he was dressed in the usual loinwrap under a broadcloth coat with the french official buttons leading me mysteriously aside he showed certificates from the officials at le plateau dating from 1859 recommending him strongly as a shipbroker for collecting émigrants libres and significantly adding les nègres ne manquent pas petit deniss face was a study when i told him that being an englishman a dozen negroes were not worth to me a single njína slave cargoes of some eight to ten head are easily canoed down the rivers and embarked in schooners for the islands the latter sadly want hands and should be assisted in setting on foot a system of temporary immigration  at 1045 am we resumed our march the fiery sun had sublimated black clouds the northeast quarter looked ugly and i wished to be housed before the storm burst the coast appeared populous we met many bushmen who were perfectly civil and showed no fear although some of them had probably never seen a white face all were armed with muskets and carried the usual hunting talismans horns and iron or brass bells hanging from the neck before and behind we crossed four sweetwater brooks which draining the high banks flowed fast and clear down cuts of loose stratified sand sometimes five feet deep the mouths opened to the north west owing to the set of the current from the southwest part of the great atlantic circulation running from the antarctic to the equator those which are not bridged with fallen trees must be swum during the rains as the water is often waistdeep many streamlets shown by their feathery fringes of bright green palm run along the shore before finding an outlet they are excellent bathing places where the salt water can be washed off the skin the sea is delightfully tepid but it is not without riskit becomes deep within biscuittoss there is a strong undertow and occasionally an ugly triangular fin may be seen cruizing about in unpleasant proximity as our naked feet began to blister we suddenly turned to the left away from the sea and after crossing about 100 yards of prairillon one of the prettiest of its kind we found ourselves at bwámánge the village of king lángobúmo it was then noon and we had walked about three hours and a half in a general southsouthwest direction  his majestys hut was at the entrance of the village which numbered five scattered and unwalled sheds he at once led us to his house a large bamboo hall with several inner sleeping rooms for the harím placed couch chair and table the civilization of the slavetrade brought wife no 1 to shake hands directed a fowl to be killed and sitting down asked us the news in french as a return for our information he told us that the gorilla was everywhere to be found even in the bush behind his town the rain coming down heavily i was persuaded to pass the night there the king offering to beat the bush with us to engage hunters and to find a canoe which would carry the party to sángatánga landing us at all the likely places i agreed the more willingly to the suggestion of a cruize as my mpongwe fashionables like the congoese and unlike the yorubans proved to be bad and untrained walkers they complained of sore feet and they were always anticipating attacks of fever  when the delicious seabreeze had tempered the heat we set out for the forest and passed the afternoon in acquiring a certainty that we had again been done however we saw the new guides and supplied them with ammunition for the next day the evening was still and close the ifúrú sandflies and the nchúná a red gadfly were troublesome as usual and at night the mosquitoes phlebotomized us till we hailed the dawnfn18 a delightful bath of salt followed by fresh water effectually quenched the fiery irritation of these immundicities  wednesday as we might have expected was wasted although the cool and cloudy weather was perfection for a cruize as we sat waiting for a boat a youth rushed in breathless reporting that he had just seen an ole man gorilla sitting in a tree hard by i followed him incredulously at first but presently the crashing of boughs and distant grunts somewhat like huhh huhh huhh caused immense excitement after half a days hard work which resulted in nothing i returned to bwámánge and met the boat king whose capital was an adjacent settlement of three huts he was in rags and my diary might have recorded reçu un roi dans un très fichu état he was accompanied by a young wife with a huge toupel and a gang of slaves who sat down and stared till their eyes blinked and watered for the loan of his old canoe he asked the moderate sum of fifteen dollars per diem which finally fell to two dollars but there was a suspicious reservation anent oars paddles and rudder mast and sail  meanwhile the sanguine selim compelled his guide to keep moving in the direction of the gorillas grunt and explaining his reluctance to advance by the fear of meeting the brute in the dark savage africa however had as usual the better of the game and showed his cuteness by planting my factotum in mud thighdeep after dark forteune returned he had fired at a huge njína but this time the cap had snapped as the monster was close and had shown signs of wrath we were expected to congratulate nimrod on his escape kindly observe the neat gradations the artistic sorites of mpongwe lies  at 730 am on the next day the loads were placed upon the crews heads and we made for the village where the boat was still drawn up the monoxyle was full of greenbrown rain water the oarpins were represented by bits of stick and all the furniture was wanting after a time the owner duly summoned stalked down from his hut and began remarking that there was still a palaver on the stocks i replied by paying him his money and ordering the craft to be baled and launched it was a spectacle to see the bushmen lying upon their bellies kicking their heels in the air and yepyepyeping uproariously when forteune their master begged of them to bear a hand dean presto might have borrowed from them a hint for his yahoos the threat to empty the alugu rum upon the sand was efficacious one by one they rose to work and in the slowest possible way were produced five oars of which one was sprung a ricketty rudder a huge mast and a sail composed half of matting and half of holes at the last moment the men found that they had no chop a franc produced two bundles of sweet manioc good travelling food as it can be eaten raw but about as nutritious as norwegian bark at the last last moment lángobúmo who was to accompany us remembered that he had neither fine coat nor umbrellaindispensable for dignity and highly necessary for the delicacy of his complexion which was that of an elderly buffalo a lad was started to fetch these articles and he set off at a handgallop making me certain that behind the first corner he would subside into a saunter and lie down to rest on reaching the huts  briefly it was 9 am before we doubled point nyonye which had now been so long in sight with wind tide and current dead against us we hugged the shore where the water is deep the surf was breaking in heavy sheets upon a reef or shoal outside and giving ample occupation to a hovering flock of fisheating birds whilst returning over water smooth as glass i observed the curious effect of the current suddenly a huge billow would rear like a horse assume the shape of a giant cobras head fall forward in a mass of foam and subside gently rippling into the calm surface beyond the shadowy hollow of the breakers made them appear to impinge upon a black rock but when they disappeared the sea was placid and unbroken as before this is in fact the typical roller of the gaboon coasta happy hunting ground for slavers and a dangerous place for cruizers to attempt as the seabreeze came up strong the swell would have swamped a european boat but our conveyance shaped like a ships gig but dalmatian or dutchmanlike in the bows topped the waves with the buoyancy of a cork and answered her helm as the arab obeys the bit to compact grain she added small specific gravity and though stout and thick she advanced at a speed of which i could hardly believe her capable  past nyonye the coast forms another shallow bay with about ten miles of chord in every way a copy of its northern neighbour the same scene of placid beauty the sea rimmed with opalline air pink by contrast with the ultramarine blue the limpid ether overhead the golden sands and the emerald verdurea circe however whose caress is the kiss of death the curve is bounded south by point dyánye which appeared to retreat as we advanced at 2 pm when the marvellous clearness of the sky was troubled by a tornado forming in the northeast we turned towards a little inlet and despite the heavy surf we disembarked without a ducking a creek supplied us with pure cold water a spreading tree with a roof and the soft clean shore with the most luxurious of couchesat 3 pm i could hardly persuade myself that an hour had flown  as we approached dyánye at last a village hoisted the usual big flag on the normal tall pole and with loud cries ordered us to land lángobúmo who was at the helm began obeying when i relieved him of his charge seeing that our course was unaltered a large and wellmanned canoe put off and the rest of the population walked down shore i made signs for the stranger not to approach when the head man angílah asked me in english what he had done to offend me and peremptorily insisted upon my sleeping at his village all these places are looking forward to the blessed day when a trader especially a white trader shall come to dwell amongst the sons of the soil and shall fill their pockets with trust money on every baylet and roadstead stands the casa grande a large empty bungalow a factory in embryo awaiting the avatar but instead of attracting their merchant by collecting wax and honey rubber and ivory the people will not work till he appears consequently here as in angola and in the lowlands of the brazil it is a slight to pass by without a visit and jealousy a ruling passion amongst africans suggests that the stranger is bound for another and rival village they wish at any rate to hear the news to gossip half the night to drink the utangánis rum and to claim a cloth for escorting him will he nill he to the next settlement but what could i do to indulge native prejudice would have stretched my cruize to a fortnight and i had neither time supplies nor stomach for the task so lángobúmo was directed to declare that they had a wicked white man on board who een would gang his ane gait who had no goods but weapons and who wanted only to shoot a njína and to visit sángatánga where his brother mpolo had been all this was said in a sneaking deprecating tone and the crew though compelled to ply their oars looked their regrets at the exceedingly rude and unseemly conduct of their utangáni angílah followed chattering till he had learned all the novelties at last he dropped aft growling much and promising to receive me at sángatánga next morningnot as a friend on our return however he prospected us from afar with the greatest indifference we were empty handed there has been change since the days when lieutenant boteler passing along this shore was addressed by the canoe men i say you mate you no big rogue ship no big rogue  at 5 p m we weathered point dyánye garnished like nyonye with a threatening line of breakers the boatpassage along shore was about 400 yards wide darkness came on shortly after six oclock and the sultry weather began to look ominous with a huge angry black nimbus discharging itself into the glassy livid sea northwards i suggested landing but lángobúmo was positive that the storm had passed westwards and he objected with some reason that in the outer gloom the boat might be dashed to pieces as we had not even a stone for an anchor the plea proved valid we guided ourselves by the fitful flashes of forked and sheet lightning combined towards a ghostly point whose deeper blackness silhouetted it against the shades suddenly the boats head was turned inland a huge breaker foaming along our gunwales drove us forwards like the downwards motion of a swingswong and before we knew where we were an ugly little bar had been crossed on the top of the curling scud we could see the forest on both sides but there was not light enough to trace the river line i told hotaloya to tumble out plenty shark here masr was the only answer we lost nearly half an hour of most valuable time in pottering and groping before all had landed   at that moment the rainclouds burst and in five minutes after the first spatter all were wet to the skin selim and i stood close together trying to light a match when a sheet of white fire seemed to be let down from the black sky passing between us with a simultaneous thundering crash and rattle and a sulphurous smell as if a battery had been discharged i saw my factotum struck down whilst in the act of staggering and falling myself we lay still for a few moments when a mutual inquiry showed that both were alive only a little shaken and stunned the sensation was simply the shock of an electrical machine and the discharge of a woolwich infant greatly exaggerated  we then gave up the partie it was useless to contend against jupiter tonans as well as pluvialis i opened my bedding drank a stiffener of raw cognac wrapped myself well and at once fell asleep in the heavy rain whilst the crew gathered under the sail the gentlemen who stay at home at ease may think damp sheets dangerous but malvern had long ago taught me the perfect safety of the wettest bivouac provided that the body remains warm at fernando po as at zanzibar a drunken sailor after a night in the gutter will catch fever and will probably die but he has exposed himself to the inevitable chill after midnight he is unacclimatized and both places are exceptionally deadlyto say nothing of the liquor the experienced african traveller awaking with a chilly skin swallows a tumbler of cold water and rolls himself in a blanket till he perspires there is only one alternative  next day i arose at 4 am somewhat cramped and stiff but with nothing that would not yield to half a handful of quinine a cup of coffee well laced a pipe and a roaring fire some country people presently came up and rated us for sleeping in the bush we retorted in kind telling them that they should have been more wideawake whilst the boat was being baled i walked to the shore and prospected our days work the forest showed a novel feature flocks of cottony mistclouds curling amongst the trees like opals scattered upon a bed of emeralds a purple haze banked up the western horizon whilst milkwhite foam drew a delicate line between the deep yellow sand and the still deeper blue far to the south lay the serna or prairillon of sángatánga a rolling patch or on a field vert backed by the usual dark belt of the same and fronted by straggling dots that emerged from the wavethey proved to be a thin line of trees along shore we were lying inside the mouth of the habanyaá alias the shark river which flows along the south of a high grassy dome streaked here and there with rows of palms and broken into the semblance of a verdureclad crater according to the people the nkonje squalus here is not a dangerous seatiger unless a man wear red or carry copper bracelets it is caught with hooks and eaten as by the chinese and the suri arabs the streamlet is a favourite haunt of the hippopotamus a small one dived when it sighted us and did not reappear it was the only specimen that i saw during my three years upon the west african coasta great contrast to that of zanzibar where half a dozen may be shot in a single day the musket has made all the difference  at 6 am on friday march 28 the boat was safely carried over the bar of shark river and we found ourselves once more hugging the shore southwards the day was exceptional for west africa and much like damp weather at the end of an english may the grey air at times indulged us with a slow drizzle after two hours we passed another maritime village where the farce of yesterday evening was reacted but this time with more vigour ignorant of my mornings private work hotaloya swore that it was sánga tánga i complimented him upon his proficiency in lying and poor lángobúmo almost in tears confessed that he had pointed out to me the real place whereupon hotaloya began pathetically to reproach him for being thus prodigal of the truth núrya the head trader coming down to the beach with dignity and in force told me in english that i must land and was chaffed accordingly he then blustered and threatened instant death at which it was easy to laugh about 10 am we lay off our destination some ten miles south of dyánye point it was a beautiful site the end of a grassy dune declining gradually toward the treefringed sea the yellow slopes cut by avenues and broken by dwarf tablelands were long afterwards recalled to my memory when sighting the fair but desolate scenery south of paraguayan asuncion these downs appear to be a seacoast raised by secular upheaval and much older than the flat tracts which encroach upon the atlantic we could now understand the position of the town which figures so largely in the squadronannals of the equatorial shore it was set upon a hillock whence the eye could catch the approaching sail of the slaver and where the flag could be raised conspicuously in token of no cruiser being near  but the glory had departed from sángatánga peelwhite strip white not a trace of the town remained the barracoons had disappeared and all was innocent as upon the day of its creation a deep silence reigned where the song of joy and the shrieks of torture had so often been answered by the voice of the forest and eternal nature had ceased to be disturbed by the follies and crimes of man  sángatánga was burned down after the fashion of these people when mbango whom europeans called passall king of the urungu who extend up the right bank of the ogobe passed away from the sublunary world king passall had completed his education in portugal a negro never attains his highest potential point of villany without a tour through europe and thus he rose to be the greatest slavedealer in this slave dealing scrap of the coast in early life he protected the spanish pirates who fled to cape lopez after plundering the american brig mexico they were at last forcibly captured by captain the late admiral trotter rn passed over to the united states and finally hanged at boston during the presidency of general jackson towards the end of his life he became paralytic like king pepple of bonny and dangerous to the whites as well as to the blacks under his rule the people however still speak highly of him generosity being a gift which everywhere covers a multitude of sins he was succeeded by one of his sons who is favourably mentioned but who soon followed him to the grave i saw another a boy apparently a slave to a mpongwe on the coast and the rest of the family is scattered far and wide since passalls death the peddlers in human flesh and blood have gone farther south men spoke of a great depot at the mpembe village on the banks of the nazareth river where a certain ndábúliya is aided and abetted by two utangáni now that longsea exportation has been completely suppressed their only markets must be the two opposite islands  south of sángatánga lay a thin line of deeper blue fetish point the eastern projection of cape lopez bay from mbangos town it is easy to see the western headland cape lopez whose low outliers of sand and trees gain slowly but surely upon the waters of the atlantic i deferred a visit until a more favourable time andthat time never came  cape lopez is said to have considerable advantages for developing trade but the climate appears adverse a large catholic mission described by barbot was established here by the portuguese as in the congo nothing physical of it remains but mr wilson is rather hard when he asserts that all traces have disappeared they survive in superior cuteness of the native  little need be said about our return which was merrier than the outward bound trip wind tide and current were now in our favour and we followed the chords not the arcs of the several bays at 930 pm we gave a wide berth to the rollers off point nyonye and two hours afterwards we groped through the outer darkness into bwámánge where the good azízeh and asúnye who came to receive us shouted with joy on the next day another gorilla palaver when a large male was reported to have been shot without a shadow of truth detained me it was the last straw which broke the patient camels back after dashing to old king lángobómo one cloth one bottle of absinthe two heads of tobacco and a clay pipe we set out betimes for the fifteen miles walk to mbátá various obstacles delayed us on the way and the shades of evening began to close in rapidly night already reigned over the forest progress under such circumstances requires the greatest care as in the streets of damascus one must ever look fixedly at the ground under penalty of a shaking stumble over crossbars of roots or fallen branches hidden by grass and mud and the worst of these wet walks is that sooner or later they bring on swollen feet which the least scratch causes to ulcerate and which may lame the traveller for weeks they are often caused by walking and sitting in wet shoes and stockings it is so troublesome to pull off and pull on again after wading and fording repeated during every few hundred yards that most men tramp through the brooks and suffer in consequence constant care of the feet is necessary in african travel and the ease with which they are hurtsluggish circulation poor food and insufficient stimulants being the causesis one of its deplaisirs the people wash and anoint these wounds with palm oil a hot bath with pepperwater if there be no rum gives more relief and caustic must sometimes be used  we reached mbátá at 615 pm and all agreed that two hours of such forestwalking do more damage than five days along the sands  since my departure from the coast french naval officers travellers and traders have not been idle the marquis de compiègne who returned to france in 1874 suffering from ulcerated legs had travelled up the fernão vaz and its tributary the highly irregular ogobai ogowaï or ogowé ogobe yet curious to remark all his discoveries arc omitted by herr kiepert his furthest point was 213 kilometres east of san quita sankwita a village sixtyone kilometres north  of pointe fétiche near cape lopez but wars and receding waters prevented his reaching the confluence where the ivindo fork enters the north bank of the ogobe he made observations amongst the kamma tribe which differs from the bakele and other neighbours m guirold commanding a cruiser was also sent to the estuary of the rembo or fernão vaz into which the mpungule npoulounay of m du chaillu ascended only by m aymès discharges the explorers found many shoals and shifting sands before entering the estuary in the evening they stopped at the ogobe confluence where a french seaman was employed in custom house duties m de compiègne after attending many palavers was duly upset when returning to the ship  on the fernão vaz there are now 1873 five factories each named after some french town paris factory however had fallen to ruins the traders having migrated 150 miles higher up the kamma river here a certain drunken kinglet rampano breaks everything he finds in the house and pays damages when he returns to his senses on march 31st there was a violent quarrel between the women of two settlements and the reguli embarked with all their host to fight it out rampano was the victor and after the usual palaver the vanquished was compelled to pay a heavy fine m du chaillus descriptions of the country a park land dotted with treemottes are confirmed but the sport excepting hippopotamus was poor and the negroes were found eating a whitefaced monkeymere cannibalism amongst the coast tribes the fauna and flora of the ogobe are those of the gaboon and the variety of beautiful parrots is especially remarked  on january 9 1874 m de compiègne passed from the fernão vaz through the obango canal into the ogobe which bordered by fetish rocks flows through vast forests his object was to study the manners and customs of the kammas a more important tribe than is generally supposed far outnumbering the urungus of the coast their country is large and contains many factories the traders securing allies by marrying native women the principal items of import are dry goods guns common spirits and american tobacco profits must be large as what costs in france one franc eighty cents here sells for ten francs worth of goods the exports are almost entirely comprised in gum mastic and ivory at the factory of mr watkins the traveller secured certain figures which he calls idolsthey are by no means fitted for the drawingroom table he also noticed the peace of the household a strip of manatus nerve at times used by paterfamilias  mr r b n walker who made sundry excursions between 1866 and 1873 also wrote from elobe that he had left the french explorers mm de compiègne and marche on the okanda river which m du chaillu believes to be the northern fork of the ogobe their letters feb 12 1874 were dated from osse in the okanda country where they had made arrangements with the kinglet for a journey to the otjebos probably the moshebo or moshobo cannibals of the gorilla book the rocks shoals and stony bottom of the ogobe reduced their rate of progress to three miles a day and after four wearisome stages they reached a village of bákele here they saw the slavedriving tribe okota whose appearance did not prepossess them and whose chief attempted unsuccessfully to stop the expedition they did not leave before collecting specimens of the language  further eastward going towards the country of the yalimbongo tribe they found the okanda river which they make the southern fork the okono being the northern descending from the mountains here food was plentiful compared with okotaland the active volcano reported by mr r b n walker 1873 was found to bear a lake upon the summitwhich in plutonic formations would suggest an extinct crater east of the yalimbongo they came upon the apingis whom m du chaillu after two visits also placed upon the southern fork of the ogobe the tribe is described as small in stature of mild habits and fond of commerce hence their plantations on the north or right bank of the river are plundered with impunity by the truculent oshieba moshebo or moshobo further east the river after being obstructed by rapids broadens to a mile and becomes navigable they were probably above the ghats it is supposed to arise south in a lakelet called tem or ndua a bákele village was seen near ochunga a large riverine island and thence they passed into the country of the mountaineer okandas they are described as fine men but terrible sorcerers their plantations of banana and maize are often plundered by the oshieba the latter being now recognized as a kindred tribe of the pahouin fán                                 chapter vi                    village life in pongoland    the next day was perforce a halt forteune and his wives did not appear till 9 am when it was dead low water i had lent nimrod a doublebarrelled gun during the march and he was evidently anxious to found a claim upon the protracted usufruct dashes also had to be settled and loads made up the two women to whose unvarying kindness all my comfort had been owing were made happy with satinstripe cassis and the inevitable nicotiana in an unguarded moment my soft heart was betrayed into giving a bottle of absinthe to the large old person who claimed to be forteunes mamma expecting nothing had nothing been offered she would not have complained the present acted upon her violently and deleteriously she was like the cabman who makes mauvais sang because he has asked and received only twice his fare briefly next morning she was too surly to bid us adieu  when giving forteune his dash i was curious to hear how he could explain the report about the dead gorilla shot the night before last the truth of the old saying a black man is never fast for an excuse was at once illustrated the beast had been badly wounded but it had dragged itself off to die and where was the blood the rain had washed the blood away  nimrod seemed chagrined at the poor end of so much trouble but there was something in his look and voice suggesting a suppressed thoughtthese people like the english and the somal show their innermost secrets in their faces at last i asked him if he was now willing to try the shekyani country he answered flatly no and why  some bushmen had bewitched him he knew the fellow and would quickly make bob come up his side already two whites had visited him with a view of shooting gorillas both had failed it was shame palaver  this might have been true but it certainly was not the whole truth i can hardly accept m du chaillus explanation that the mpongwe who attack the beasts with trade muskets and pebbles will not venture into the anthropoids haunts unless certain of their white employers staunchness what could that matter when our nimrod had an excellent weapon in his hand and a strong party to back him very likely forteune was tired with walking and five dollars per shot made the game not worth the candle again perhaps the black diplomatist feared to overstock the market with njinas or to offend some regular customer for the sake of an interloper in these african lands they waste over a monkeys skin or a bottle of rum as much intrigue as is devoted to a contested election in england  i then asked the guide if my staying longer would be of any use he answered with a simple negative whilst the utángáni remained the mbunji spell would still work but it would at once be broken by our departure and he would prove it by sending down the firstfruits this appeared to me to be mere mpongwe blague but curious to say the sequel completely justified both assertions he threw out a hint however about certain enemies and my medicine the arsenical soap i need hardly say that it was refused  when the palaver ended and the tide served a fierce tornado broke upon us and the sky looked grisly in the critical direction northeast having no wish to recross the gaboon river during a storm blowing a head wind i resolved to delay my departure till the morrow and amused myself with drawing from the nude a picture of the village and villagelife in pongoland  the mpongwe settlements on the gaboon river are neatly built but without any attempt at fortification for the most part each contains one family or rather a chief and his dependants in the larger plantation towns the abodes form a single street ranging from 100 to 1000 yards in length sometimes but rarely there are cross streets the direction is made to front the sea breeze and if possible to present a corner to stormbearing eurus an invariable feature like the arcaded loggie of old venetian towns is the námpolo or palaverhouse which may be described as the clubroom of the village an open hangar like the ikongolo or caskhouse of the trading places it is known by a fire always kept burning the houses are cubes or oblong squares varying from 10 to 100 feet in length according to the wealth and dignity of the owner all are onestoried and a few are raised on switch foundations most of them have a verandah facing the street and a compound or cleared space in the rear for cooking and other domestic purposes the walls are built by planting double and parallel rows of posts the material being either bamboo or the midrib of a winegiving palm raphia vinifera to these uprights horizontal slats of cane are neatly lashed by means of the neverfailing tietie bastslips runners or llianas for the more solid buildings thin mpávo or bark slabs are fitted in between the double posts when coolness is required their place is taken by mats woven with the pinnated leaves of sundry palms this is a favourite industry with the women who make two kinds one coarse the other a neat and close article of rattantint until it becomes smokestained the material is so cheap and comfortable that many of the missionaries prefer it for walls to brick or boarding the windows are mere holes in the mats to admit light and the doors are cut with a mpáno adze from a single tree trunk which would be wilful waste if timber were ever wanting the floor is sometimes sandy but generally of hard and level tamped clay to which the european would prefer boarding and as a rule it is cleanno fear of pythogenie from here the pentshaped roof of rafters and thatch is watertight except when the host of rats disturb it by their nocturnal gambols  rich men affect five or six rooms of which the principal occupies the centre the very poor must be contented with one the majority have two the but combines the functions of hall diningroom saloon and bachelors sleeping quarters the ben contains a broad bed for the married a standing frame of split bamboo with mats for mattresses it is usually mounted on props to defend it from the nchuu or white ants and each has its mosquito bar an oblong square large enough to cover the whole couch and to reach the ground the material is either fine grass cloth from the ashira country a light stuff called mbongo or calico and blue baft from which the stiffening has been washed out it is far superior to the flimsy muslin affairs supplied in an angloindian outfit or to the coarse matting used in yoruba provided with this solid defence which may be bought in any shop one can indulge ones self by sleeping in the verandah without risk of ague or rheumatism the ben always displays a pile of chests and boxes which though possibly empty testify to the respectability of the household in hotaloyas i remarked a leather hatcase he owned to me that he had already invested in a silk tile the sign of chieftainship but that being a boy he must grow older before he could wear it the inner room can be closed with a strong door and a padlock as even the windowhole is not admitted the burglar would at once be detected except where goods are concerned the mpongwe have little respect for privacy the women in the presence of their husbands never failed to preside at my simple toilette and the girls of the villages would sit upon the bedside where lay an utangání in almost the last stage of déshabillé  the furniture of course varies a rich man near the river will have tables and chairs sofas lookingglasses and as many clocks especially sam slicks as love or money can procure even the poorest affect a standing bedstead in the ben plank benches acting as couches in the but a sufficiency of mats and pots for water and cooking a free man never condescends to sit upon the ground the low stool cut out of a single block and fancifully carved is exactly that of the old egyptians preserved by the modern east africans it dates from ages immemorial the look of comparative civilization about these domiciles doubtless the effect of the portuguese and the slave trade distinguishes them from the barbarous circular huts of the krumen the rude clay walls of the gold coast and the tattered comfortless sheds of the fernandian bube they have not however that bandboxlike neatness which surprises the african traveller on the camerones river  the only domestic animals about these villages are dogs poultry and pigeons fine blue rocks i never saw in pongoland the goats mentioned by m du chaillu the bush however supplies an abundance of beef and as most south africans they have a word isángú amongst the mpongwes or ingwámbá of the cape lopez people to express that inordinate longing and yearning for the stimulus of meat diet caused by the damp and depressing equatorial climate of which dr livingstone so pathetically complains the settlements are sometimes provided with little plots of vegetables usually however the plantations are distant to preserve them from the depredations of bipeds and quadrupeds they are guarded by bushmen who live on the spot and shortly before the rains all the owners flock to their farms where for a fortnight or so they and their women do something like work new grounds are preferred because it is easier to clear them than to remove the tangled aftergrowth of ferns and guinea grass moreover they yield of course better crops the plough has not yet reached pongoland the only tools are the erem little axe for felling the matchet a rude cutlass for clearing the hoe and a succedaneum for the dibble after the bush has been burned as manure and the seed has been sown no one will take the trouble of weeding and half the surface is wild growth  maize zea mays has become common and the people enjoy bútás or roasted ears barbot says that the soil is unfit for corn and indian wheat it is so for the former certainly not for the latter rice has extended little beyond the model farms on the north bank of the river as everywhere upon the west african coast it is coarser more nutritious and fuller flavoured than the indian the cereals however are supplanted by plantains and manioc cassava the plantains are cooked in various ways roast and boiled mashed and broiled in paste and in balls when unripe they are held medicinal against dysentery the manioc is of the white variety fatropha aypim seu utilissima and as at lagos the root may be called the country bread i never saw the poisonous or black manioc fatropha manihot either in east or in west africa and i heard of it only once in unyamwezi central africa yet it is mentioned by all old travellers and the sweet harmless variety gives very poor farinha anglicè wood meal  the vegetables are mbongwe yams koko or colocasia esculenta occras hibiscus esculentus squashes pumpkins cucumbers beans of several sorts and the sweet potato an esculent disliked by englishmen but far more nutritious than the miserable irish tuber the groundnut or peanut arachis hypogaea the pindar of the united states a word derived from loango is eaten roasted and as a rule the people have not learned to express its oil proyart pinkerton xvi 551 gives probably by misprint pinda which we call pistachio bird peppers as the small red species is called grow wild in every bush they are wholesome and the people use them extensively tomatoes flourish almost spontaneously and there is a bulbless native onion whose tops make excellent seasoning sugarcane will thrive in the swamps coffee on the hillslopes i heard of but never saw ginger  the common fruits are limes and oranges mangoes papaws and pineapples the gift of the new world now run wild and appreciated chiefly by apes the forest however supplies a multitude of wild growths which seem to distinguish this section of the coast and which are eaten with relish by the people amongst them are the sángo and nefu with pleasant acid berries the ntábá described as a red grape which will presently make wine the olivelike azyigo ozigo the filbertlike kula the koolanut of m du chaillu second expedition chap viii a hardshelled nux not to be confounded with the softshelled kola sterculia and the aba or wild mango mango gabonensis a pale yellow pome small and tasting painfully of turpentine it is chiefly prized for its kernels in february and march all repair to the bush for their mangovendange eat the fruit and collect the stones the insides after being sundried are roasted like coffee in a neptune or in an earthern pot when burnt chocolate colour they are pounded to the consistency of thick honey poured into a mould a basket lined with banana leaves and set for three days to dry in the sun after this the cake which in appearance resembles guava cheese will keep through the year  for use the loaf is scraped and a sufficiency is added to the halfboiled or stewed flesh the two being then cooked together it is equally prized in meat broths or with fish dry and fresh and it is the favoured kitchen for rice and the insipid banana odika the ndika of the bákele tribes is universally used like our worcester and it may be called the one sauce of gorillaland the local equivalent for curry pepperpot or palmoil chop it can be eaten thick or thin according to taste but it must always be as hot as possible the mould sells for half a dollar at the factories and many are exported to adulterate chocolate and cocoa which it resembles in smell and oily flavour i regret to say that travellers have treated this national relish disrespectfully as continentals do our plomb boudin mr w winwood reade has chaffed it and another briton has compared it with greaves  at cockerapeak or to speak less unpoetically when alectryon sings his hymn to the dawn the working bees of the little hive must be up and stirring whilst the master and mistress enjoy the beautysleep early to bed and early to rise is held only fit to make a man surly and give him red eyes by all wild peoples who have little work and who justly hold labour an evil less only than death amongst the bedawin it is a sign of shaykhdom not to retire before dawn and i have often heard the somal palavering after midnight as a rule the barbarian enjoys his night chat and smoke round the fire all the more because he drinks or dozes through the better part of the day there is a physical reason for the preference the absence of light stimulus and the changes which follow sunset seem to develope in him a kind of nightfever as in the nervous temperament of europe hence so many students choose the lamp in preference to the sun and children mostly clamour when told at 8 oclock to go to bed  shortly after sunrise the young ones are bathed in the verandah here also the mistress smooths her locks rumpled by the night tittivates her macawcrest with the bodkin and anoints her hair and skin with a tantinet of grease and palm oil some but by no means all proceed for ablution to the streamside and the girls fetch water in heavy earthen jars containing perhaps two gallons they are strung after the kru fashion behind the back by a band passing across the forehead when we meet them they gently say mbolo good morning or oresa are you well at this hour however all are not so civil the seniors are often uncommonly cross and surly and the mollia tempora fandi may not set in till after the first meali have seen something of the kind in england the sex impolitely said to have one fibre more in the heart and one cell less in the brain often engages in a violent wordy war the tornado of wrath will presently pass over and leave clear weather for the day in the evening when the electric fluid again gathers heavily there will be another storm meanwhile superintended by the mistress all are occupied with the important duty of preparing the morning meal it is surprising how skilful are these heavenborn cooks the excellent dishes they make out of halfnothing i preferred the cuisine of forteunes wives to that of the plateau and after finding that money was current in the village i never failed to secure their good offices  the mpongwe breakfast is eaten by the women in their respective verandahs with their children and friends the men also gather together and prefer the open air this feed would not only astonish those who talk about a free breakfasttable with its silly slops and breadstuffs it would satisfy a sharpset highlander in addition to yams and sweet potatoes plantains and perhaps rice there will be cooked mangroveoysters fresh from the tree a fry or an excellent bouillabaisse of fish succulent palaver sauce or palmoil chop poultry and meat the domestic fowl is a favourite but curious to say neither here nor in any part of tropical africa known to me have the people tamed the only gallinaceous bird which the black continent has contributed to civilization the guinea fowl like the african elephant remains wild we know it to be an old importation in europe although there are traditions about its appearing in the fourteenth century when moslems sold it to christians as the jerusalem cock and christians to moslems as the bird of meccah it must be the greek meleagris so called says Ælian from the sisters who wept a brother untimely slain hence the tears upon its plume suggesting the german perlhuhn and its frequent cries which the brazilians who are great in the language of birds translate sto fraca sto fraca sto fraca im weak the hausa moslems make the guinea fowl cry kilkal kilkal grammar by the rev f j schön london salisbury square 1862 it is curious to compare the difference of ear with which nations hear the cries of animals and form their onomatopoetic or bowwow imitations for instance the north americans express by whippoorwill what the brazilians call joãocortapáo the guinea fowl may have been the afraa avisbut that was a dear luxury amongst the romans though the greek meleagris was cheap the last crotchet about it is that of an african traveller who holds it to be the peacock of solomons navies completely ignoring the absolute certainty which the southindian word tukkiim carries with it  the mpongwe will not eat ape on account of its likeness to themselves but they greatly enjoy game the porcupine the groundhog an echymys the white flesh of the bush pig cricetomys and the beef of the nyáre bos brachyceros this is the buffalo or bushcow of the regions south of sierra leone and the empacassa of the congoportuguese whose empacasseirs or native archers rural police and auxiliaries

older brazil now they wear the tánga or pagne a waist cloth falling to the knee and they are armed with trade muskets and cartridgeboxes fastened to broad belts barbot calls the nyare a buffalo and tells us that it was commonly shot at sandy point where in his day elephants also abounded captain boteler ii 379 well describes a specimen which was killed by dr guland rn as exactly resembling the common cow of england excepting that its proportions are far more elegant  this hearty breakfast is washed down with long drinks of palm wine and followed by sundry pipes of tobacco after which happy souls all enjoy a siesta long and deep as that of andine mendoza and they kill time as well as they can till evening the men assemble in the club round the námpolofire where they chat and smoke drink and doze those who are agriophagi or xylobian Æthiopians briefly called hunters spend their days much like the race which byron declared                  merely born     to hunt and vote and raise the price of corn  the pongo venator is up with the sun and if not on horseback at least he is on the traces of game sometimes he returns home during the hours of heat when he knows that the beasts seek the shady shelter of the deepest forests and after again enjoying the pleasures of the chase he disposes of a heavy dinner and ends the day sleep weighing down his eyelids and his brains singing with liquor what he did yesterday that he does today and what he does today that he shall do tomorrow his intellectual life is varied only by a visit to town where he sells his choice skins drinks a great deal too much rum and makes the purchases ammunition and so forth which are necessary for the full enjoyment of home and country life at times also he joins a party of friends and seeks some happier hunting ground farther from his campagne  meanwhile the women dawdle through the day superintending their domestic work look after their childrens and their own toilette tend the fire attend to the cooking and smoke consumedly the idle sit with the men at the doors of their huts those industriously disposed weave mats and whether lazy or not they never allow their tongues and lungs a moments rest the slaves male and female draw water cut fuel or go to the distant plantations for yams and bananas whilst the youngsters romp play and tease the village idiotthere is one in almost every settlement briefly the day is spent in idleness except as has been said for a short time preceding the rains  when the sun nears the western horizon the hunter and the slaves return home and the housewife who has been enjoying the coolth squatting on her dwarf stool at her hutdoor and puffing the preparatory pipegirds her loins for the evening meal and makes every one look alive when the last rays are shedding their rich red glow over the tall black trees which hem in the village all torpidity disappears from it the fires are trimmed and the singing and harping which were languid during the hot hours begin with renewed vigour the following is a specimen of a boatingsong   solo come my sweetheart        chorus haste haste  solo how many things gives the white man      chorus chants

the evening meal is eaten at 6 pm with the setting of the sun whose regular hours contrast pleasantly with his vagaries in the northern temperates and hesperus brings wine as he did of old drinking sets in seriously after dark and is known by the violent merriment of the men and the no less violent quarrelling and flyting of the sex which delights in the harmony of tongues all then retire to their huts and with chat and song and peals of uproarious laughter and abundant horseplay such as throwing minor articles at one anothers heads smoke and drink till 11 pm the scene is dovercourt all speakers and no hearers the night is still as the grave and the mewing of a cat if there were one would sound like a tigers scream  the mornings and evenings in these plantationvillages would be delightful were it not for what the brazilians call immundicies sandflies always swarm in places where underwood and tall grasses exclude the draughts and the only remedy is clearing the land thus at st isabel or clarence fernando po where the landwind or the seabreeze ever blows the vicious little wretches are hardly known on the forested background of mountain they are troublesome as at nigerian nufe the bite burns severely and presently the skin rises in bosses lasting for days with a severe itching which if unduly resented may end in inflammatory ulcerationsi can easily understand a man being laid up by their attacks the animalcules act differently upon different constitutions while mosquitoes hardly take effect sand flies have often blinded me for hours by biting the circumorbital parts the numbers and minuteness of this insect make it formidable the people flap their naked shoulders with cloths or bushy twigs nigerian travellers have tried palm oil but with scant success and spirits of wine applied to the skin somewhat alleviate the itching but has no prophylactic effect sandflies do not venture into the dark huts and a smudge keeps them aloof but the disease is more tolerable than the remedy of inflaming the eyes with acrid smoke and of sitting in a close box by courtesy termed a room when the fine pure air makes one pine to be beyond walls after long endurance in hopes of becoming inoculated with the virus i was compelled to defend myself with thick gloves stockings and a muslin veil made fast to the hat and tucked in under the shirt after sunset the sandflies retire and the mosquito sounds her hideous trump as has been said however pongoland knows how to receive her                                chapter vii                        return to the

words would have been vain he promised hard to get leave from his papa and grandpap and to join me after a last farewell at the plateau his face gave the lie direct to his speech and his little manuvre for keeping the earnestmoney failed ignobly  the swift brown stream carried us at full speed captain merrick pointed out sundry short cuts but my brain now refused to admit as truth a word coming from a mpongwe we passed some bateaux pecheurs saw sundry shoals of fish furrowing the water and after two hours we were bumping on the rocks outlying mombe creek and nenga oga village the passage of the estuary was now a pleasure and though we grounded upon the shallows of voileliay bay the krumen soon lifted the heavy boat the wind was fair the tide was ebbing and the strong current was in our favour we reached glass town before midday and after five hours covering some twentytwo direct geographical miles i found myself with pleasure under the grateful shade of the factory it need hardly be described as it is the usual bungalow of the west african shore  twelve days had been expended upon 120 miles but i did not regret the loss a beautiful bit of country had been added to my mental pinacothek and i had satisfied my mind to a certain extent upon that quæstio then vexata the gorilla book even before my trip the ethnological part appeared to me trustworthy and if not original at any rate borrowed from the best sources my journey assured me from the specimen narrowly scrutinized that both country and people are on the whole correctly described the dates however are all in confusion in the preface to the second edition october 1859 became october 1858 and we are told that the excursions were transposed for the simple purpose of taking the reader from north to south as in the case of most african travels when instruments are not used the distances must be reduced in chapter xii the shekyani villages are placed sixty miles due east of sángatánga whereas the map shows twenty mr w wimvood reade declares that the apingi country the ultima thule of the explorer is distant from ngumbi four footdays journey as mm de compiègne and marche have shown the tribe in question extends far and wide others have asserted that seventyfive miles formed the maximum distance but many of m du chaillus disputed distances have been proved tolerably correct by mm serval and griffon du bellay who were sent by the french government in 1862 to survey the ogobe a second french expedition followed shortly afterwards under the charge of mm labigot and touchard and finally that of 1873 like all preceding it failed to find any serious deviation from fact  the german exploring expedition july 25 1873 confirms the existence of m du chaillus dwarfs the obongo tribe scoffed at in england because they dwell close to a fierce people of patagonian proportions the germans report that they are called babongo vambuta and more commonly bari or bali they dwell fourteen days march from the mouth of the luena or river of chinxoxo i have not seen it remarked that these pygmies are mentioned by andrew battel plinian at the end of the sixteenth century to the northeast of mani kesoch he tells us are a kind of little people called matimbas who are no bigger than boys twelve years old but are very thick and live only upon flesh which they kill in the woods with bows and darts of the aykas south of the welle river discovered by dr schweinfurth i need hardly speak it is not a little curious to find these confirmations of herodotean reports about dwarfish tribes in the far interior the dokos and the wabilikimo so long current at zanzibar island and so long looked upon as mere fables  our departure from mbátá had broken the spell and forteune did keep his word i was compelled in simple justice to cry peccavi on the very evening of our arrival at glass town the youth kángá brought me a noble specimen of what he called a nchígo mpolo sent by forteunes bushmen an old male with brown eyes and dark pupils when placed in an armchair he ludicrously suggested a potbellied and patriarchal negro considerably the worse for liquor from crown to sole he measured 4 feet 10 34 inches and from fingertip to fingertip 6 feet 1 inch the girth of the head round ears and eyebrows was 1 foot 11 inches of the chest 3 feet 2 inches above the hip joints 2 feet 4 inches of the arms below the shoulder 2 feet 5 inches and of the legs 2 feet 5 inches evidently these are very handsome proportions considering what he was and there was a suggestion of ear lobe which gave his countenance a peculiarly human look he had not undergone the inhuman hebrewabyssinian operation to which m du chaillus gorillas had been exposed and the proportions rendered him exceedingly remarkable  that interesting anthropoids career after death was one series of misfortunes ending with being stuffed for the british museum my factotum sat up half the night skinning but it was his first coup dessai in a climate like the gaboon especially during the rains we should have turned the pelt hairy side in filled it with cotton to prevent shrinking and after painting on arsenic have exposed it to the sun better still we should have placed it on a scaffolding like a defunct congoman over a slow and smoky fire and thus the fatty matter which abounds in the integuments would have been removed the phalanges of the hands and feet after being cleanscraped were restored to their places and wrapped with thin layers of arsenicated cotton as is done to small animals yet on the seventh day decomposition set in it was found necessary to unsew the skin and again to turn it inside out the bones ought to have been removed and not replaced till the coat was thoroughly dry the skinned spoils were placed upon an anthill a practice which recalls to mind the skeleton deer prepared by the emmets of the hartz forest which taught oken that the skull is expanded vertebræ we did not know that halfstarved dogs and drivers will not respect even arsenical soap the consequence of exposing the skeleton upon an anthill where it ought to have been neatly cleaned during a night was that the pariah curs carried off sundry ribs and the parva magni formica laboris took the trouble to devour the skin of a foot worse still the skull the brain and the delicate members had been headed up in a breaker of trade rum which was not changed till the seventh day it was directed to an eminent member of the old anthropological society and the most interesting parts arrived i believe soft pulpy and utterly useless the subject seems to have been too sore for mentioning at least i never heard of it again  the late dr john edward gray of the british museum called this nchígo mpolo from its bearlike masses of breastpile the hairy chimpanzee troglodytes vellerosus after my return home i paid it a visit and could only think that the hirsute one was considerably mutatus ab illo the colour had changed and the broadchested squareframed potbellied and portly old bully boy of the woods had become a wretched pigeonbreasted lean flanked shrunklinibed hungrylooking beggar it is a lesson to fill out the skin even with bran or straw if there be nothing betteranything in fact is preferable to allowing the shrinkage which ends in this wretched caricature  during my stay at glass town i was fortunate enough to make the acquaintance of the rev messrs walker and preston of the baraka mission the headquarter station of the american board of foreign presbyterian missions was established on the gaboon river in 1842 by the rev j leighton wilson afterwards one of the secretaries to the society in new york he had left the best of memories in the river and there were tales of his having manumitted in the southern united states a small fortune of slaves without a shade of compulsion his volume on west africa to which allusion has so often been made contains a good birds eye of the intertropical coast and might with order arrangement and correction of a host of minor inaccuracies become a standard work  i have already expressed my opinion founded upon a sufficiently long experience that the united states missionary is by far the best man for the western coast and indeed for dangerous tropical countries generally physically he is spare and hard the nervous temperament being more strongly developed in him than in the bulbous and more bilious or sanguine european he is better born and blood never fails to tell again he generally adopts the profession from taste not because il faut vivre he is better bred he knows the negro from his childhood and his education is more practical more generally useful than that of his rivals moreover i never yet heard him exclaim capting them heggs is igh lastly he is more temperate and moderate in his diet hitherto it has not been my fate to assist in carrying him to bed  perhaps the american missionary carries sobriety too far in dangerous tropical regions where there is little appetite and less nutritious diet where exertion of mind and body easily exhaust vitality and where diffusible stimulants must often take the place of solids he dies first who drinks water the second is the man who begins with an eyeopener of brandy pawnee and who keeps up excitement by the same means through the day the third is the hygienic sciolist who drinks on principle poor gladstone and thin french wines cheap and nasty and the survivor is the man who enjoys a quantum suff of humming scotch and burton ales sherry madeira and port with a modicum of cognac this has been my plan in the tropics from the beginning when it was suggested to me by the simplest exercise of the reasoning faculties a dozen of good port will soon set you up said the surgeon to me after fever then why not drink port before the fever  i have said something upon this subject in zanzibar city island and coast i p 180 it will bear repetition joseph dupuis justly remarks i am satisfied from my own experience that many fall victims from the adoption of a course of training improperly termed prudential viz a sudden change of diet from ships fare to a scanty sustenance of vegetable matter rejecting even a moderate proportion of wine and seclusion in their apartments from the sun and atmosphere  an immense mass of nonsense copied in one authority from another was thrown before the public by books upon diet until the physiology of common life george henry lewes discussed liebigs brilliant error in considering food chemically and not physiologically the rest assume his classification without reserve and work from the axiom that heatmaking carbonaceous and nonnitrogenous foods eg fat and sugars necessary to support life in the arctic and polar regions must be exchanged for the tissuemaking plastic or nitrogenous vegetables as we approach the equator they are right as far as the southern temperates their sole field of observation they greatly err in all except the hot dry parts of the tropics why a hindoo will drink at a sitting a tumbler of glí clarified butter and the european who would train for wrestling after the fashion of hindostan as i attempted in my youth on native sweetmeats and sugared milk will be blind with melancholia in a week the diet of the negro is the greasiest possible witness his palm oil chop and palaver sauce his craving for meat especially fat meat is a feeling unknown to europe and how simple the reason damp heat demands almost as much carbon as damp or dry cold  return we to the baraka mission the name is a corruption of barracoon in the palmy days of the trade slavepens occupied the ground now covered by the chapel the schoolroom and the dwellinghouse and extended over the site of the factory to the riverbank the place is well chosen immediately beyond the shore the land swells up to a little rounded hill clean and grassy like that about sángatánga the soil appears poor and yet around the missionhouse there are some fine wild figs one a huge tree although not a score of years old the bamboo clump is magnificent and the cocoas oranges and mangoes are surrounded by thick fragrant and luxuriant quickset hedges of welltrimmed lime  a few words concerning the banana of this coast which we find so flourishing at baraka an immense godsend to the gaboon it is well known to be the most productive of all food 100 square yards of it giving annually nearly 2000 kilogrammes of food far more nutritious than the potato here it is the musa sapientum the banana de soâ thomé which has crossed over to the brazil and which is there known by its sharper leaves and fruit softer and shorter than the indigenous growth the plant everywhere is most vigorous in constant moist heat the atmosphere of a conservatory and the ground must be low and wet but not swampy the best way of planting the sprouts is so to dispose them that four may form the corners of a square measuring twelve feet each side the common style is some five feet apart the raceme which appears about the sixth to the tenth month will take sixty days more to ripen good stocks produce three and more bunches a year each weighing from twenty to eighty pounds the stem after fruiting should be cut down in order to let the others enjoy light and air and the oftener the plants are removed to fresh ground the better  the banana when unripe is white and insipid it is then baked under ashes till it takes a golden colour and like a cereal it can be eaten as bread a little later it is boiled and becomes a fair vegetable tasting somewhat like chestnuts and certainly better than carrots or turnips lastly when softer than a pear it is a fruit eaten with milk or made into beignets i have described the plantaincider in lake regions of central africa ii 287 the fruit contains sugar gum and acids malic and gallic the rind which is easily detached when ripe stains cloth with ruddy grey rusty colour by its tannin gallic and acetic acids  the baraka mission has had several outstations one was at a ruined village of fán which we shall presently pass on the right bank of the river the second was at ikoi a hamlet distant about fifteen not twentyfive miles upon a creek of the same name which enters the gaboon behind point ovindo and almost opposite konig island a third is at anengenenge vulgò inengenenge nenge in mpongwe and anenge in bákele meaning island situated forty not 100 miles up the main stream here a native teacher still resides the baraka school now 1862 numbers thirty scholars and there are twelve to fifteen communicants the missionaries are our white labourers but two of them the revs jacob best and a bushnell are absent in the united states for the benefit of their health  my first visit to the rev william walker made me regret my precipitate trip to mbátá he told me what i now knew that it was the wrong line and that i should have run two or three days up the rembwe the first large influent on the southern bank of the gaboon he had come out to the river in 1842 and had spent twenty years of his life in africa with occasional furloughs home he greatly interested me by a work which he was preparing the gaboon mission had begun its studies of the many native dialects by the usual preparatory process of writing grammars and vocabularies after this they had published sundry fragmentary translations of the scriptures and now they aimed at something higher after spending years in building and decorating the porticoes of language they were ambitious of raising the edifice to which it is only an approach in other words of explaining the scholarship of the tongue the spirit of the speech  language says the lamented dr oe vidal then bishop designate of sierra leonefn19 is designed to give expression to thought hence by examining the particular class of compositionand i may add the grammatical and syntactical niceties characterizing that compositionto which any given dialect has been especially devoted we may trace the direction in which the current of thought is wont to flow amongst the tribe or nations in which it is vernacular and so investigate the principal psychical peculiarities if such there be of that tribe or nation and again he remarks dr krap was unable to find any word expressing the idea of gratitude in the language of all the suaheli wásawahílí tribes a fact significant enough as to the total absence of the moral feeling denoted by that name similarly the mpongwe cannot express our honesty they must paraphrase it by good man dont steal in time they possibly may adopt the word bodily like pús a cat amog mug kapinde carpenter krus a cross and ilepot pot  such a task is difficult as it is interesting the main obstacle to success being the almost insuperable difficulty of throwing off european ideas and modes of thought which lifelong habit has made a second nature take the instance borrowed from dr krap and noticed by a hundred writers namely the absence of a synonym for gratitude amongst the people of the nearer east i have explained the truth of the case in my pilgrimage and it will bear explanation again the wásawahíli are moslems and the moslem view everywhere is that the donors maker not the donor gives the gift the arab therefore expresses his thank you by mamnúni am under an obligation to your hand which has passed on the donation he generally prefers however a short blessing as kassir khayr ak may allah increase thy weal the persians may thy shadow never be less simply refers to the shade which you the towering tree extend over him the humble shrub  another instance of deduction distorted by current european ideas is where casalis etudes sur la langue séchuana par eugène casalis part ii p 84 speaking of the sisuto proverbs makes them display the vestiges of that universal conscience to which the creator has committed the guidance of every intelligent creature surely it is time to face the fact that conscience is a purely geographical and chronological accident where may we ask can be that innate and universal monitor in the case of a people the somal for instance who rob like spartans holding theft a virtue who lie like trojans without a vestige of appreciation for truth and who hold the treacherous and cowardly murder of a sleeping guest to be the height of human honour and what easier than to prove that there is no sin however infamous no crime however abominable which at some time or in some part of the world has been or is still held in the highest esteem the utmost we can say is that conscience the accident flows directly from an essential all races now known to the world have a something which they call right and a something which they term wrong the underlying instinctive idea being evidently that everything which benefits me is good and all which harms me is evil their good and their evil are not those of more advanced nations still the idea is there and progress or tradition works it out in a thousand different ways  my visits to mr walker first gave me the idea of making the negro describe his own character in a collection of purely hamitic proverbs and idioms it appeared to me that if ever a book aspires to the title of lafricain peint par luimême it must be one in which he is the medium to his own spirit the interpreter to his own thoughts hence wit and wisdom from west africa london tinsleys 1856 which i still hold to be a step in the right direction although critics who possibly knew more of cornhill than of yoruba assured me that it was rather a heavy compilation nor can i yet see how the light fantastic toe can show its agility in the sabots of african proverbs                               chapter viii                        up the gaboon river    detestable weather detained me long at the hospitable factory tornadoes were of almost daily occurrence not pleasant with 200 barrels of gunpowder under a thatched roof they were useful chiefly to the mpongwe servants of the establishment these model thieves broke open under cover of the storms a strong iron safe in an inner room which had been carefully closed they stole my mboko skin and bottles were not safe from them even in our bedrooms  my next step was to ascend the olo mpongwe or gaboon river which bowdich sketch of gaboon calls oroöngo and its main point ohlombopolo the object was to visit the fán of whose cannibalism such curious tales had been told it was not easy to find a conveyance the factory greatly wanted a flatbottom iron steamer a sternwheeler with sliding keel and furnaces fit for burning halfdried wooda craft of fourteen tons costing perhaps £14 per ton would be ample in point of size and would save not a little money to the trader i was at last fortunate in securing the eliza belonging to messrs hatton and cookson she was a foreandaft schooner of twenty tons measuring 42 feet 6 inches over all and put up at bonny town by captain birkett she had two masts and oars in case of calms her crew was of six hands including one fernando a congoese who could actually box the compass no outfit was this time necessary beyond a letter to mr tippet who had charge of the highest establishments up stream his business consisted chiefly of importing arms ammunition and beads of different sorts especially the red porcelain locally called loangos  on april 10 a little before noon i set out despite thunder and lightning rain sun torrential showers and the vehemently expressed distaste of my crew the view of the right bank was no longer from afar it differs in shape and material from the southern but the distinction appears to me superficial not extending to the interiors off konig island we found nine fathoms of water and wanted them during a bad storm from the southeast it prevented my landing and inspecting the old dutch guns which bowdich says are remains of the portuguese both this and parrot island lying some five miles south by west are masses of cocoas fringed with mangroves a great contrast with the prairillon of the neighbouring point ovindo at last worn out by a fourknot current and a squall in our teeth we anchored in four fathoms about five miles southeast of konig  from this point we could easily see the wide gape of the rembwe the southeastern influent or rather fork of the gaboon which rises in the southwestern versant of some meridional chain and which i was assured can be ascended in three tides the people told me when too late of a great cavity or sink which they called wongawonga bowdich represents it to be an uninhabited savannah of three days extent between empoöngwa and adjoomba mayumba i saw nothing of the glittering diamond mountains lying eastward of wongawonga concerning which the old traveller was compelled to admit that when there was no moon a pale but distinct light was invariably reflected from a mountain in that quarter and from no other it has now died outthis superstition which corresponds with the carbuncle of hoy and others of our scotoscandinavian islands  resuming our cruize on the next day we passed on the right a village of bad bákele which had been blown down by the french during the last year in this little business the king and two lieges had been killed the tribe is large and important scattered over several degrees north and south of the equator as is proved by their slaves being collected from distances of several weeks and even months in 1854 mr wilson numbered them at 100000 according to local experts they began to press down stream about 1830 driven à tergo by their neighbours the mpángwe fán even as they themselves are driving the mpongwes but they are evidently the kaylee or kalay of bowdich p 427 whose capital samashialee was the residence of the king ohmbay he places them in their present habitat and makes them the worst of cannibals whilst the sheekans shekyani buried their dead under the bed within the house these detestable kaylees ate not only their prisoners but their defunct friends whose bodies were bid for directly the breath was out of them indeed fathers were frequently seen to devour their own children bowdich evidently speaks from hearsay but the brazil has preserved the old traditions of cannibalism amongst the gabões  the bákele appeared to me very like the coast tribes only somewhat lightercoloured and wilder in look whilst they again are darkerskinned than their eastern neighbours from the inner highlands their women are not so well dressed as the ladies of the mpongwe the chignon is smaller and there are fewer brass rings the men who still cling to the old habit of hunting cultivate the soil practise the ruder mechanical arts and trade with the usual readiness and greed they asked us a leaf of tobacco for an egg and four leaves for a bunch of bananas missionaries who like messrs preston and best resided amongst them for years have observed that though a mild and timid people they are ever involved in quarrels with their neighbours i can hardly understand how they bear some resemblance to the dwarfish dokos of the eastern coast seeing that the latter do not exist  the dikele grammar proves the language which is most closely allied to the benga dialect to be one of the great south african family variously called kafir because first studied amongst these people ethiopic very vague and nilotic because its great fluvial basin is the zambezi not the nile as might be expected amongst isolated races the tongue though clearly related to that of the mpongwe and the mpangwe has many salient points of difference for instance the liquid r is wholly wanting according to mr t leighton wilson perhaps one word in two is the same or obviously from the same root consequently verbal resemblances are by no means striking the orthography of the two differs materially and in this respect dikele more resembles the languages of the eastern coast than its western neighbour at the same time less than the fiote or the congoese it has a larger number of declensions and its adjectives and pronouns are more flexible and complicated on the other hand it possesses few of the conjugations which form so conspicuous a feature in the tongues of the lower river and reversing the usage of the mpongwe it makes very little use of the passive  running the gauntlet of cheer and chaff from the noisy inmates of the many bákele villages and worried by mangroveflies we held our way up the muddy and rapidly narrowing stream whose avenues of rhizophoras and palms acted as windsails when the breeze failed the sensation was stifling lyámbá cannabis sativa grew in patches upon the banks now apparently wild like that about lagos and badagry not till evening did the tide serve enabling us to send our papers for visa on board the guardship loise where a party of young frenchmen were preparing for la chasse a little higher up stream are two islets nenge mbwendi so called from its owner and nenge sika or the isle of gold the mpongwe all know this name for the precious metal and the bakele appear to ignore it curious to say it is the fante and mandenga word probably derived from the arabic sikkah which gave rise to the italian zecca mint and zecchino it may have been introduced by the laptots or lascar sailors of the senegal m du chaillu second expedition chap iii mentions the island nengué shika on the lower fernão vaz river and bowdich turns the two into ompoongu and soombea the third is anenganenga not ninga ninga about one mile long from north to south and well wooded with bush and palms here the gaboon mission has a neat building on piles the senior native employé was at glass town and his junior a youth about nineteen stood à la napoléon in the doorway evidently monarch of all he surveyed i found there one of the ndiva the old tribe of pongoland which by this time has probably died out we anchored off wosuku a village of some fifty houses forming one main street disposed northeast southwest or nearly at right angles with the river the entrance was guarded by a sentinel and gun and the king imondo lay right royally on his belly a fine plantation of bananas divides the settlement and the background is dense bush in which they say nyáre and deer abound the bákele supply sheep and fowls to the plateau and their main industry consists in dressing plantainfibre for thread and nets  we now reach the confluence of the nkonio or northeastern with the mbokwe or eastern branch which anastomose to form the gaboon the latter being apparently the larger of the two preserves the title mpolo both still require exploration my friend m braouezzec lieutenant de vaisseau who made charts of the lower bed utterly failed to make the sources and the rev mr preston who lived seven months in the interior could not ascend far mr w winwood reade reached in may 1862 the rapids of the nkomo river but sore feet prevented his climbing the mountain which he estimates at 2000 feet or of tracing the stream to its fountain mr rbn walker also ascended the nkomo for some thirty miles and found it still a large bed with two fathoms of water in the cacimbo or middle dries in m du chaillus map the upper nkomo is a dotted line according to all authorities upon the higher and the lower river his direction is too far to the northeast the good tippet declares that he once canoed three miles up the mbokwe and then marched eastward for five days covering a hundred mileswhich is impossible he found a line of detached hills and an elevation where the dews were exceedingly cold looking towards the utterly unknown orient he could see nothing but a thick forest unbroken by streams he heard from the country people traditions of a great lake which may be that placed by tuckey in north latitude 2°3° the best seasons for travel are said to be march and november before and after the rains which swell the water twelve feet  about anengenenge we could easily see the subranges of the great eastern ghats some twenty miles to the northeast here the shallows and the banks projecting from different points made the channel dangerous entering the mbokwe branch we were compelled to use sweeps or the schooner would have been dashed against the sides as we learned by the trees the tides raise the surface two to three feet high after the third hour we passed the fán komba vina or village of king vina it stood in a pretty little bay and the river some 400 feet broad was fronted as is often the case by the palaver tree a glorious ceiba or bombax all the people flocked out to enjoy the sight and my unpractised eye could not distinguish them from bákele above it also on the right bank is the nowdeserted site where messrs adams and preston nearly came to grief for bewitching the population with bad book  five slow hours from anengenenge finally placed us about sunset at mayyán or tippet town the depôt lies a little above the confluence of the mbokwe and the londo or southeastern fork of the latter a drunken pilot and a dark and moonless night with the tide still running in delayed us till i could hardly distinguish the sable human masses which gathered upon the styx like stream to welcome their new matyemmerchant or white man before landing all the guns on board the steamer were double loaded and discharged at the instance of our host who very properly insisted upon this act of african courtesyit would be shame not to fire salute we were answered by the loudest howls and by the town muskets which must have carried the charges of old chambers mr tippet an intelligent coloured man from the states who has been living thirteen years on the gaboon since the age of fourteen and who acts as native trader to mr rbn walker for ivory ebony rubber and other produce escorted me to his extensive establishment at length i am amongst the man eaters                                chapter ix               a specimen day with the fán cannibals    at 5 am on the next day after a night with the gnats and rats i sallied forth in the thick smokes and cast a nearer look upon my cannibal hosts and first of the tribal name the mpongwe call their wild neighbours mpángwe the europeans affect such corruptions as fánwe panwe the f and p being very similar phaouin and paouen pawen they call themselves fán meaning man in the plural bafan the n is highly nasalized the missionaries proposed to express it by nh which however wrongly conveys the idea of aspiration and fan pronounced after the english fashion would be unintelligible to them  the village contains some 400 souls and throughout the country the maximum would be about 500 spears or 4000 of both sexes whilst the minimum is a couple of dozen it is pleasantly situated on the left bank of the mbokwe river a streamlet here some 50 feet broad whose water rises 6 feet 10 inches under the tidal influence the single street about half a mile long is formed by two parallel rows of huts looking upon a cleared line of yellow clay and provided with three larger shedsthe palaver houses the fán houses resemble those of the mpongwe in fact the tribes beginning at the camarones river build in much the same style but all are by no means so neat and clean as those of the seaboard a thatch whose projecting eaves form deep shady verandahs surmounts walls of split bamboo supported by raised platforms of tamped earth windows being absent and chimneys unknown the ceiling is painted like coal tar by oily soot and two opposite doors make the home a passage through which no one hesitates to pass the walls are garnished with weapons and nets both skilfully made and the furniture consists of cooking utensils and waterpots mats for bedding logs of wood for seats and pillows and lumps of timber or dwarf stools neatly cut out of a single block their only nightlightthat grand test of civilizationis the mpongwe torch a yard of hard black gum mixed with and tightly bound up in dried banana leaves according to some it is acacia others declare it to be the blood of the bombax which is also used for caulking they gather it in the forest especially during the dries collect it in hollow bamboos and prepare it by heating in the neptune or brass pan the odour is pleasant but fragments of falling fire endanger the hut and trimming must be repeated every ten minutes the sexes are not separated as throughout intertropical africa the men are fond of idling at their clubs and the women who must fetch water and cook clean the hut and nurse the baby are seldom allowed to waste time they are naturally a more prolific race than those inhabiting the damp unhealthy lowlands and the number of the children contrasts pleasantly with the bleak house of the debauched mpongwe who puts no question when his wife presents him with issue  in the cool of the morning fitevanga king of mayyán lectured me upon the short and simple annals of the fán in 1842 the first stragglers who had crossed the sierra del crystal are said to have been seen upon the head waters of the gaboon i cannot however but suspect that they are the paämways of whom bowdich sketch of gaboon p 429 wrote in the beginning of the century all the natives on this route are said to be cannibals the paämways not so voraciously as the others because they cultivate a large breed of dogs for their eating mr w winwood reade suspects them to be an offshoot of the great fulah race and there is nothing in point of dialect to disprove what we must at present consider a pure conjecture the fulah pronouns have striking analogies with those of the yoruba accra ashantee and timmanee and even of the great kaffir class of dialects which reaches from the equator to the cape wrote the late learned e norris in his introduction to the grammar of the fulah language london harrison 1854  according to the people of the upper river the fán were expelled by the bati or battinot bari as it has been writtenfrom their ancient seats and they are still pushing them seawards the bushmen are said to live seven to ten short marches seventy to a hundred miles to the east and are described by mr tippet whom they have visited as a fine tall slender and light skinned people who dress like the fán but without so much clothing and who sharped the teeth of both sexes dr barth heard of the bati and herr petermanns map describes themfn20 as pagans reported to be of a white colour and of beautiful shape to live in houses made of clay to wear cloth of their own making and to hold a country from which a mountain is visible to the southwest and close to the sea the range in question may be the long qua kwa which continues the camarones block to the northeast and the batis may have passed southwestward from southern adamáwa  the fán were accompanied in their seaward movement by the osheba or sheba the moshebo and moshobo of m du chaillus map they are said to be a tribe of kindred blood and warlike tastes speaking a remarkably guttural tongue but intelligible to the mpángwe they too were doubtless pressed forward by the inner bati who arealso affected by the okáná the yefá and the sensobá the latter are the innermost known to my negro informants and their sheep and goats have found their way to the gaboon they are doughty elephanthunters and they attack the njína although they have no firearms the mpangwe deride the savagery of these races who have never heard of a man riding a horse or an ass which the mpongwes call cavala and buro burro the names of these three races which are described as brave warlike and hospitable to strangers will not be found on any map indeed the regions east of the gaboon belong to the great white blot of intertropical africa extending from north latitude 7 degrees to south latitude 5 degrees major de ruvignes heard also of a tribe called lachaize osheba which excels the fán in strength and courage as much as the latter do the coast tribes a detachment of them had settled near one of the chief mpángwe towns mboma some days after his arrival he saw several of these people and describes them as giants compared with the negro races to which his eye was accustomed the general stature varied from six feet to six feet four inches their complexion was a light café au lait their hair was ornamented with cowries strung so thickly as to suggest a skullcup whilst long streamers of elephants tails threaded with the cypraea and brass rings hung down from the head behind the ears covering the nape of the neck all these we may observe are congo customs in their manufacture of iron dug by themselves they resemble the cannibals  the fán have now lodged themselves amongst the less warlike maritime and submaritime tribes as the ashantis asiante lately did in fanteland now they visit the factories on the estuary and wander as far as the ogobe in course of time they will infallibly eat up the bákele as the latter are eating up the mpongwe and shekyani they have their own names for neighbouring tribes the mpongwe according to bowdich called the shekyani and the inner tribes boolas a synonym of dunko in ashantee hence probably the bulous of mr hutchinson p 253 a tribe on the guergay creek who speak a different language from the mpongwes the fán call the mpongwes báyok the bákele ngon the shekyani besek and the gaboon river aboka the subtribes of cannibals living near my line of march were named to me as follows1 the lálá oshebas whose chief settlement sánkwí is up the mbokwe river 2 their neighbours the esánvímá 3 the sánikiya a bush tribe 4 the sákulá near mayyán 5 the esobá about fakanjok 6 the esonzel of the ute or autá village 7 the okola whose chief settlement is esámási and 8 the ashemvon with asya for a capital  from m du chaillus illustrations pp 74 77 i fully expected to see a largelimbed blackskinned and ferociouslooking race with huge mustachios and plaited beards a finely made light coloured people of regular features and decidedly mild aspect met my sight  the complexion is as a rule chocolate the distinctive colour of the african mountaineer and of the inner tribes there are dark men as there would be in england but the very black are of servile origin few had any signs of skindisease i saw only one hand spotted with white like the incipient morphetico leper of the brazil many if bleached might pass for europeans so caucasian are their features few are negro in type as the mpongwe and none are purely nigger like the blacks of maritime guinea and the lower congoese and they bear the aspect of a people fresh from the bush the backwoods their teeth are pointed and there is generally a look of grotesqueness and surprise when i drank tea they asked what was the good of putting sugar in tobacco water the hair is not kinky peppercornlike and crisply woolly like that of the coast tribes in men as well as in women it falls in a thick curtain nearly to the shoulders and it is finer than the usual elliptical fuzz the variety of their perruquerie can be rivalled only by that of the dress and ornament the males affect plaits knobs and horns stiff twists and upright tufts suddenly projecting some two inches from the scalp and that analogies with europe might not be wanting one gentleman wore a queue zopf or pigtail bound at the shoulders not by a ribbon but by the neck of a claret bottle other heads are adorned with single feathers or bunches and circles of plumes especially the red tailplumes of the parrot and the crimson coat of the touraco corythrix an african jay these bloodcoloured spoils are a sign of war the brazilian traveller will be surprised to find the coronals of feathers the kennitare acangátara of the tupí guarani race which one always associates with the new world the skullcaps of plaited and blackened palm leaf though common in the interior are here rare an imitation is produced by tressing the hair longitudinally from occiput to sinciput making the head a system of ridges divided by scalplines and a fanshaped tuft of scarletstained palm frond surmounts the poll i noticed a fashion of crinal decoration quite new to me  a few hairs either from the temples the sides or the back of the head are lengthened with treefibres and threaded with red and white poundbeads so called by europeans because the lb fetches a dollar these decorations fall upon the breast or back the same is done to the thin beard which sprouts tufty from both rami of the chin as in the purely nervous temperament of europe and doubtless the mustachios if the latter were not mostly wanting would be similarly treated whatever absurdity in hair may be demanded by the trichotomists and philopogons of europe i can at once supply it to any extent from africagratis gentlemen remarkable by a raie which as in the scotch terrier begins above the eyes and runs down the back should be grateful to me for this sporting offer  nothing simpler than the fán toilette thongs and plaits of goat wild cat or leopard skin gird the waist and cloth which is rare is supplied by the spoils of the black monkey or some other beef the main part of the national costume and certainly the most remarkable is a fan of palm frond redolent of grease and ruddled with ochre thrust through the waist belt while new and stiff the upper half stands bolt upright and depends only when old it suggests the enduap rondache of ostrichplumes worn by the tupiguarani barbarians of the brazil the bunchy caudal appendages which made the missionaries compare them with pigeons the fore part of the body is here decked with a similar fan the outspread portion worn the wrong way like that behind the ornaments are seedbeads green or white and loangos red porcelain the bunch here contains 100 to 120 strings and up country 200 worth one dollar each will weigh from one to three and a wealthy fán may carry fifteen to fortyfive pounds the seedbead was till lately unknown fifteen to twenty strings make the bunch there is not much tattooing amongst the men except on the shoulders whilst the women prefer the stomach the gandin however disfigures himself with powdered camwood mixed with butternut grease or palm oila custom evidently derived from the coasttribes each has his ndese garters and armlets of plaited palm fibre and tightened by little crossbars of brass they are the hibás which the bedawin wear under their lower articulations as preservatives against cramp lastly a fetish horn hangs from the breast and heavy copper rings encumber the wrists and ankles though unskilful in managing canoesan art to be learned like riding and dancing only in childhoodmany villagers affect to walk about with a paddle like the semiaquatic krumen up country it is said they make rafts which are towed across the stream by ropes when the swiftness of the current demands a ferry the women are still afraid of the canoe  all adult males carry arms and would be held womanish if they were seen unweaponed these are generally battleaxes spears cruelly and fantastically jagged hooked and barbed and curious leafshaped knives of archaic aspect some of the latter have blades broader than they are long a shape also preserved by the mpongwe the sheaths of fibre or leather are elaborately decorated and it is chic for the scabbard to fit so tight that the weapon cannot be drawn for five minutes i have seen the same amongst the somal there are some trademuskets but the hot mouthed weapon has not become the national weapon of the fán bows and arrows are unknown the náyin or crossbow peculiar to this people and probably a native invention not borrowed as might be supposed from europe is carried only when hunting or fighting a specimen was exhibited in london with the gorillas the people are said sometimes to bend it with the foot or feet like the tupí guaranís the jivaros and other south americans suffice it to remark of this weapon with which by the by i never saw a decent shot made that the détente is simple and ingenious and that the ebe or dwarf bolt is always poisoned with the boiled root of a wild shrub it is believed that a graze is fatal and that the death is exceedingly painful i doubt both assertions most men also carry a pliable basket full of bamboo caltrops thin splints pointed and poisoned placed upon the path of a barefooted enemy this rude contrivance combined with the scratching of the thorns and the gashing cuts of the grass must somewhat discourage pursuit the shields of elephant hide are large square and ponderous the terrible waraxe is the usual poor little tomahawk more like a toy than a tool  after a bathe in the muddy mbokwe i returned to the village and found it in a state of ferment the fán like all inner african tribes with whom fighting is our foxhunting live in a chronic state of ten days war and can never hold themselves safe this is the case especially where the slave trade has never been heard of similarly the ghazwah razzia of the bedawin is for plunder not for captives surprises are rare because they will not march in the dark battles are not bloody after two or three warriors have fallen their corpses are dragged away to be devoured their friends save themselves by flight and the weaker side secures peace by paying sheep and goats on this occasion the sister of a young brave had just now been killed and chopped by the king of sánkwí a neighbouring settlement of oshebas and the bereaved brother was urging his comrades with vociferous speeches to up and arm usually when a man wants war he rushes naked through his own village cursing it as he goes moreover during the last war mayyán lost five men to three of the enemy which is not fair said the women who appeared most eager for the fray all the youths seized their weapons the huge wardrums the hollowed bole of a tree fringed with nyáre hide was set up in the middle of the street preparations for the week of singing and dancing which precedes a campaign were already in hand and one warman gave earnest of bloodshed by spearing a goat the property of mr tippet it being our interest that the peace should be kept till after my proposed trip into the interior i repaired to the palaverhouse and lent weight to the advice of my host who urged the heroes to collect ivory ebony and rubber and not to fight till his stores were filled we concluded by carrying off the goat after great excitement the warriors subsided to a calm it was broken however two days afterwards by the murder of a villager the suspected lover of a woman whose house was higher up the mbokwe river he went to visit her and was incontinently speared in the breast by the injured husband if he die and no fine be paid there will be another war  i made careful inquiry about anthropophagy amongst the fán and my account must differ greatly from that of m du chaillu the reader however will remember that mayyán is held by a comparatively civilized race who have probably learned to conceal a custom so distasteful to all their neighbours white and black in the remoter districts cannibalism may yet assume far more hideous proportions since the fán have encouraged traders to settle amongst them the interest as well as the terrors of the coast tribes who would deter foreigners from direct dealings has added new horrors to the tale and yet nothing can exceed the reports of older travellers  during my peregrinations i did not see a single skull the chiefs stretched at full length and wrapped in mats are buried secretly the object being to prevent some strong fetish medicine being made by enemies from various parts of the body in some villages the head men of the same tribe are interred near one another the commonalty are put singly and decently under ground and only the slave máká is thrown as usual into the bush mr tippet who had lived three years with this people knew only three cases of cannibalism and the rev mr walker agreed with other excellent authorities that it is a rare incident even in the wildest partsperhaps opportunity only is wanted as will appear from the fáns bill of fare anthropophagy can hardly be caused by necessity and the way in which it is conducted shows that it is a quasireligious rite practised upon foes slain in battle evidently an equivalent of human sacrifice if the whole body cannot be carried off a limb or two is removed for the purpose of a roast the corpse is carried to a hut built expressly on the outskirts of the settlement it is eaten secretly by the warriors women and children not being allowed to be present or even to look upon mans flesh and the cooking pots used for the banquet must all be broken a joint of black brother is never seen in the villages smoked human flesh does not hang from the rafters and the leather knifesheaths are of wild cow tanned mans skin suggests only the tannerie de meudon an advanced institution yet dr schweinfurths valuable travels on the western nile prove that public anthropophagy can coexist with a considerable amount of comfort and so to speak civilizationwitness the nyamnyam and mombattu mimbuttoo the sick and the dead are uneaten by the fán and the people shouted with laughter when i asked a certain question  the unnatural practice which by the by has at different ages extended over the whole world now continues to be most prevalent in places where as in new zealand animal food is wanting and everywhere pork readily takes the place of long pig the damp and depressing atmosphere of equatorial africa renders the stimulus of flesh diet necessary the isángú or ingwánba the craving felt after a short abstinence from animal food does not spare the white traveller more than it does his dark guides and though the moral courage of the former may resist the gastronomic practice of breaking fast upon a fat young slave one does not expect so much from the untutored appetite of the noble savage on the eastern parts of the continent there are two cannibal tribes the wadoe and the wabembe and it is curious to find the former occupying the position assigned by ptolemy iv 8 to his anthropophagi of the barbaricus sinus according to their own account however the practice is modern when weakened by the attacks of their wákámbá neighbours they began to roast and eat slices from the bodies of the slain in presence of the foe the latter as often happens amongst barbarians and even amongst civilized men could dare to die but were unable to face the horrors of becoming food after death the great cortez knew this feeling when he made his soldiers pretend anthropophagy many of the wadoe negroids are tall well made and light complexioned though inhabiting the low and humid coast regions a proof if any were wanted that there is nothing unwholesome in mans flesh some of our old accounts of shipwrecked seamen driven to the dire necessity of eating one another insinuate that the impious food causes raging insanity the wabembe tribe occupying a strip of land on the western shore of the tanganyika lake are menschenfresser as they were rightly called by the authors of the mombas mission map these miserables have abandoned to wild growth a most prolific soil too lazy and unenergetic to hunt or to fish they devour all manner of carrion grubs insects and even the corpses of their deceased friends the midgán or slavecaste of the semisemitic somal are sometimes reduced to the same extremity but they are ever held like the wendigo or maneaters amongst the north american indians impure and detestable on the other hand the tupi guaranís of the brazil a country abounding in game fish wild fruits and vegetables ate one another with a surprising relish this subject is too extensive even to be outlined here the reader is referred to the translation of hans stade old travellers attribute the cannibalism of the brazilian races to gulosity rather than superstition moreover these barbarians had certain abominable practices supposed to be known only to the most advanced races  anthropophagy without apparent cause was not unknown in southern africa mr layland found a tribe of cave cannibals amongst the mountains beyond thaba bosigo in the transgariep countryfn21 he remarks with some surprise horrible as all this may appear there might be some excuse made for savages driven by famine to extreme hunger for capturing and devouring their enemies but with these people it was totally different for they were inhabiting a fine agricultural tract of country which also abounded in game notwithstanding this they were not contented with hunting and feeding upon their enemies but preyed much upon each other also for many of their captures were made from amongst the people of their own tribe and even worse than this in times of scarcity many of their own wives and children became the victims of this horrible practice  anthropophagy either as a necessity a sentiment or a superstition is known to sundry though by no means to all the tribes dwelling between the nun niger and the congo rivers how much farther south it extends i cannot at present say on the lower niger and its branch the brass river the people hardly take the trouble to conceal it on the bonny and new calabar perhaps the most advanced of the socalled oil rivers cannibalism based upon a desire of revenge and perhaps its sentimental side the object of imbibing the valour of an enemy slain in battle has caused many scandals of late years the practice on the other hand is execrated by the efiks of old calabar who punish any attempts of the kind with extreme severity during 1862 the slaves of creektown attempted it and were killed at duketown an ibo woman also cut up a man sun dried the flesh and sold it for monkeys meatshe took sanctuary at the mission house yet it is in full vigour amongst their ibo neighbours to the northwest and the duallas of the camarones river also number it amongst their country customs the mpongwe as has been said will not eat a chimpanzee the fán devour their dead enemies  the fán character has its ferocious side or it would not be african prisoners are tortured with all the horrible barbarity of that human wild beast which is happily being extirpated the north american indian and children may be seen greedily licking the blood from the ground it is a curious ethnological study this peculiar development of destructiveness in the african brain cruelty seems to be with him a necessary of life and all his highest enjoyments are connected with causing pain and inflicting death his religious ritesa strong contrast to those of the modern hindooare ever causelessly bloody take as an instance the efik race or people of old calabar some 6000 wretched remnants of a oncepowerful tribe for 200 years they have had intercourse with europeans who though slavers would certainly neither enjoy nor encourage these profitless horrors yet no savages show more brutality in torture more frenzied delight in bloodshed than they do a few of their pleasant practices are  the administration of esere or poisonbean  egbo floggings of the utmost severity equalling the knout  substitution of an innocent pauper for a rich criminal  infanticide of twins and  vivisepulture  and it must be remembered that this tribe has had the benefit of a resident mission for the last generation i can hardly believe this abnormal cruelty to be the mere result of uncivilization it appears to me the effect of an arrested development which leaves to the man all the ferocity of the carnivor the unreflecting cruelty of the child  the dietary of these wild men of the woods would astonish the starveling sons of civilization when will the poor man realize the fact that his comfort and happiness will result not from workhouses and almshouses hospitals and private charities but from that organized and efficient emigration so long advocated by the seer carlyle only the crassest ignorance and the listlessness born of misery and want prevent the ablebodied pauper the frozenout mechanic or the weary and illclad the overworked and underfed agricultural labourer from quitting the scenes of his purgatory and from finding scattered over earths surface spots where he may enjoy a comparative paradise heightened by the memory of privations endured in the wretched hole which he pleases to call his home but nostalgia is a more common disease than men suppose and it affects none more severely than those that are remarkable for their physical powers a national system of emigration to be perfect must not be confined to solitary and individual hands who however numerous are ever pining for the past the future will organize the exodus of whole villages which like those of the hebrides in the last century will bear with them to new worlds their lares and penates their wives families and friends who will lay out the church and the churchyard after the old fashion familiar to their youth and who will not forget the palaver house vulgarly called pothouse or pub  few of these lestrigons lack fish which they catch in weirs fowl flesh of dogs goats or sheep cattle is a luxury yet unknown but the woods supply an abundance of nyáre and other bushbeef they also have their special word for the meat yearning still in the seminomadic stage they till the ground and yet depend greatly upon the chase they break their fast kidiashe at 6 am eat a midday meal amos and sup gogáshe at sunset besides snacks all through the day when they can find material they are good huntsmen who fear neither the elephant nyok the hippopotamus nyok á mádzim frequent in the rivers of the interior the crocodile nor the gorilla njí it is generally assertedand the unfortunate douville re echoed the assertionthat the riverhorse and the crocodile will not live together the reason is simply that upon the seaboard where these animals were first observed the crocodile prefers the fresh water of the river the hippopotamus the brackish water at its mouth in the interior of course they dwell together in amity because there is nothing for them to quarrel about  the banana planted with a careless hand supplies the staff of life besides thatch fuel and fibre for nets and lines when they want cereals maize holcus and panicum will grow almost spontaneously the various palmtrees give building materials oil wine and other requisites too numerous to mention the five products of the cow are ignored as in the western hemisphere of yore one of the most useful however is produced by the nje or njeve a towering butyraceous tree differing from that which bears the shea butternut its produce is sundried toasted over a fire pounded and pressed in a bag between two boards when it is ready for use the bush cut at the end is fired before the beginning of the rains leaving the land ready for yams and sweet potatoes almost without using the hoe in the middle dries from june to september the villagers sally forth en masse for a battue of elephants whose spoils bring various luxuries from the coast lately before my arrival they had turned out to gather the aba or wild mango for odika sauce and during this season they will do nothing else the fán plant their own tobacco which is described as a low spreading plant and despise the imported weed they neither snuff nor chew all manufacture their own pipebowls and they are not ignorant of the use of lyamba or hashish they care little for sugar contrary to the rule of africa in general but they oversalt all their food and they will suck the condiment as children do lollipops their palm oil is very poor as if they had only just learned the art of making it  after the daily siesta which lasted till 3 p m mr tippet asked me to put in an appearance at a solemn dance which led by the kings eldest daughter was being performed in honour of the white visitor a chair was placed in the verandah the street being the ballroom received with the usual salutation mboláne to which the reply is an i proceeded to the external study of fán womanhood whilst the men are tall and élancés their partners are usually short and stout and  her stature tall i hate a dumpy woman  is a matter of taste upon which most of us agree with his lordship this peculiar breadth of face and person probably result from hard work and good fare developing adipose tissue i could not bring myself to admire gondebiza the princess royal what is grotesque in one sex becomes unsightly in the other fat thirty and perhaps once fair her charms had seen their prime and the system of circles and circlets which composed her personnel had assumed a tremulous and gravitating tendency she was habited in the height of fán fashion her body was modestly invested in a thin pattern of tattoo and a gauzework of oil and camwood the rest of the toilette was a dwarf pigeontail of fan palm like that of the men and a manner of apron white beads and tree bark greasy and reddened the latter was tucked under and over the five lines of cowries which acted as cestus to the portly middle big as a budget the horns of hair not unlike the rays of light in michael angelos moses were covered with a cap of leaves and they were balanced behind by a pigtail lashed with brass wire her ornaments were sundry necklaces of various beads large red and white and small blue and pink porcelains a leaf probably by way of amulet was bound to a string round the upper arm and wrists and ankles were laden with heavy rings of brass and copper the parure of the great in fán land the other ballerine were of course less brilliantly attired but all had rings on their arms legs and ankles fingers and toes a common decoration was a bunch of seven or eight long ringlets not unlike the queues de rat still affected by the oldfashioned englishwoman these however as in the men were prolonged to the bosom by strings of alternate red and white beads others limited the decoration to two rats tails depending from the temples where phrenologists localize our causality many had faces of sufficient piquancy the figures though full wanted firmness and i noticed only one wellformed bosom the men wore red feathers but none carried arms  the form of saltation suggested mr catlins drawings a circular procession of children as well as adults first promenaded round the princess who danced with all her might in the centre her countenance preserving the grand sérieux the performers in this gingaring then clapped hands with prolonged ejaculations of ooooh stamped and shuffled forwards moving the body from the hips downwards whilst h r h alone stood stationary and smileless as a french demoiselle of the last century who came to the ball not to causer but to danser at times when king fitevanga condescended to show his agility the uproar of applause became deafening the orchestra consisted of two men sitting opposite each otherone performed on a caisson a log of hollowed wood four feet high skincovered and fancifully carved the other on the national anjyá a rude marimba the prototype of the pianoforte it is made of seven or eight hard wood slats pinned with bamboo tacks to transverse banana trunks lying on the ground like the grande caisse it is played upon with sticks plectra like tentpegs mr w winwood reade savage africa chap xiii says the instrument is also described by froebel as being used by the indians of central america where which is still more curious it is known by the same namemarimba of course they borrowed the article and the name from the negroes most tribes in africa have their own terms for this universal instrument but it is everywhere recognized by the african who knows europeans as marimba thus owen tells us p 308 that at the mouth of the zambesi it is called tabbelah evidently the arabic tablah another favourite instrument is a clapper made of two bamboos some five feet long and thick as capstan barsit is truly the castanet en grand  highly gratified by the honour but somewhat overpowered by the presence and by that vile scourge the sandfly i retired after the first review leaving the song the drum and the dance to continue till midnight accustomed to the frantic noises of african villagelife in general my ears here recognized an excess of bawl and shout and subsequent experience did not efface the impression but in the savage and the barbarian noise like curiosity is a healthy sign the lowest tribes are moping and apathetic as sick children they will hardly look at anything however strange to them  the rest of my day and week was devoted to the study of this quaint people and the following are the results those who have dealings with the fán universally prefer them in point of honesty and manliness to the mpongwe and coast races they have not had time to become thoroughly corrupt to lose all the lesser without gaining anything of the greater virtues they boast like john tod that they neer feared the french and have scant respect for white persons indeed their independence sometimes takes the form of insolence we were obliged to release by force the boy nyongo and two of mr tippets women who had been put in loganglicè in the stocks they were wanted as hostages during the coming war and this rude contrivance was adopted to insure their presence  chastity is still known amongst the fán the marriage tie has some significance the women will not go astray except with the husbands leave which is not often granted the men wax wroth if their mothers be abused it is an insult to call one of them a liar or a coward the coasttribes would merely smile at the soft impeachment and assure you that none but foolsyourself included by implicationare anything else their bravery is the bravery of the savage whose first object in battle is to preserve his only good his life to the civilized man therefore they appear but moderately courageous they are fond of intoxication but are not yet broken to ardent spirits i have seen a single glass of trade rum cause a man to roll upon the ground and convulsively bite the yellow clay like one in the agonies of the deaththirst they would do wisely to decline intercourse with europeans but this of course is impossible there is a manifest destiny for them as for their predecessors the vile practice of the white or west coast is to supply savages with alcohol arms and ammunition to live upon the lives of those they serve the more honourable moslems of the eastern shores do not disgrace themselves by such greed of gain  the fán are cunning workers in iron which is their wealth their money is composed of ikíá dwarf bars shaped like horsefleams a coinage familiar to old travellers in west africa and of this spartan currency a bundle of ten represents sixpence white mans ikíá would be silver for which the more advanced mpongwe have corrupted the english to solove an idea exists on the lower river that our hardware is broken up for the purpose of being made into spearheads and other weapons such is not generally the case the wamasai the somal and the cape kafirs indeed all the metalworking african barbarianscall our best sheffield blades rotten iron they despise a material that chips and snaps and they prefer with ample cause their native produce charcoalsmelted and tempered by many successive heatings and hammerings without quenching in water nor will they readily part with it when worked the usual trade medium is a metal rod two of these are worth a franc if of brass while three of copper represent two francs there is a great demand for beads and salt the latter especially throughout the interior  thus ended my first impressions amongst the fán cannibals                                 chapter x  to the mbíka hill  the sources of the gaboonreturn to the                             plateau    not yet despairing of a shot at or of capturing a poor relation i persuaded mr tippet to assemble the lieges and offer them double what was proposed at mbátá no one however appeared sanguine of success the anthropoid keeps his distance from the fán a trip to the interior was suggested first up the mbokwe and finally arranged for the londo river information about the country was as usual vague one man made the stream head two days off the other a few hours and mr tippets mind fluctuated between fifty and one hundred miles  the party was easily assembled and we set out at 7 am on april 14th i and selim had the dignity of a dingy to ourselves mr tippet out of a little harem of twentyfive had chosen two wives and sundry abigails his canoe laden with some fifteen souls was nearly flush with the water the beauties were somewhat surly they complained like the sluggard of too early waking and swore that they would do nothing in the way of work industry being essentially servile anne coombe ankombe daughter of qua ben was a short stout good humoured lass lizer eliza i regret to say would not make the least exertion and when called always turned her back  after dropping three miles down the mbokwe river we entered the londo influent some three miles further on it fines down from a width of eighty feet to a mere ditch barred with trees which stop navigation we landed on the left bank and walked into the palaverhouse of fakanjok or pakanjok the village of a fán head man called by mr tippet john matoko it was old dirty and tattered showing signs of approaching removal out of the crowd of men and women who nearly sat upon us i had no difficulty in hiring eight porters thereby increasing our party to twentyfive souls these people carry on the shoulder not as africans always should do on the head they even cross the fallen trunks which act as rickety bridges with one side of the body thus heavier than the other  the bushpath began by wheeling westward as though we were returning to anengenenge thence it struck southeastwards a rhumb from which it rarely deviated though we were approaching the subranges of the sierra del crystal the country was very like that about mbátá streamlets flowing to the mbokwe wet yellow soil forming slippery muds unhealthy as unpleasant in the morning sunshine old and new clearings and plantations mostly of bananas mere spots in the wide expanse of bush and deserted or halfinhabited villages shortly after noon we came to a battlefield where the heroes of tippettown had chanced to fall in with their foes of autá a settlement distant eight or nine miles both armies at once treed themselves behind trunks and worked at long bowls the bushmen having only one gun and two charges lost four of their men and the victors who had no time to carry off the slain contented themselves with an arm or two by way of gigot  probably the memory of this affair which is still to be settled unfavourably impressed my escort after a total of some two hours six miles we arrived at a large oláko or breakwind a half face of leafy branches and all insisted upon a long rest i objected and then palaver came up we were at last frankly told that the villages ahead were hostile that we could not proceed further in this direction and that the people of fakanjok had thought my only object was to sight from afar a golden prairie and a blue range beyond the latter is known to the french as tem from a hillock crowned with a huge red trunked tree of that name  opposition was useless so we turned back some twenty minutes to a junction and took the southeastern instead of the eastern line here the country was higher and drier more hilly and gravelly the aneroid showing some 900 feet 2911 it would be exceptionally healthy in any but the rainy season before the afternoon had well set in a camping ground had been chosen in the tall thin forest near the confluence of two dwarf streams whose vitreous waters flowing over fine sand and quartz pebbles were no small recommendation as the cooking proceeded frowning brows relaxed and huge fires put to flight ill temper and the sandfly i had proposed lashing my hammock to one of the tree stumps which are here some ten feet tall the people who swing themselves for the purpose of felling declare the upper wood to be softer than below public opinion however overruled me and made it fast to two old trunks the night was a succession of violent tornadoes and during one of the most outrageous the upper half of a triste lignum falling alongside of and grazing my hammock awoke me with its crash  next morning when the rain had somewhat abated i set out by a path whose makers were probably the ape and the squirrelhunter in the direction of a rise which the people called mbika the hill after a total of some two miles and a half we found a clearing upon the summit but although i climbed up a tree the bush was dense enough to conceal most of the surroundings according to the fán the nkomo rises on the seaward or western face of this mbíká whilst the mbokwe springing from its eastern counterslope runs southwest of the massif and joins the former the onetree hill known as tem appeared a little to the north of west to the northeast we could see a riverfork but none knew its name  our return was enlivened by the inspection of an elephantkraal where a herd had been trapped drugged and shot during the last season as the walls were very flimsy i asked why the animals did not break loose the answer was that the ngán mganga or fetishman ran a line of poison vine along its crest and that the beasts however wild would not attempt to pass through it the natives showed me the liana which they described still lying on the poles of the broken corral mr preston of the gaboon mission who first noticed it and mr wilson who gives an illustration of the scene p 363 declares that the creeper is drawn around the herd when browsing that as long as the animals are unmolested they will not dash through the magic circle and that the fence of uprights is constructed outside it the same tale is told of all the wild elephanthunters in the interior the báti the okáná the yefá and the sensobá  arrived at tippettown i gave my dashes chiefly brass and copper rods bade an affectionate farewell and then dropped down stream without further ceremony i had been disappointed a second time in re gorilla and nothing now remained but a retreat which time rendered necessary the downstream voyage was an easy matter and it need hardly be said far less unpleasant than the painful toil up from the sanjika village on the gaboon the tem hill was seen bearing due east mag and the mbíká 92° behind them were glimpses of blue highland rising in lumpy and detached masses to the east these are evidently subranges of the western ghats the sierra del crystal which native travellers described to me as a serrated broken line of rocky and barren acicular mountains tall gravelly waterless and lying about three days journey beyond the screen of wooded hill it is probably sheltered to some extent from the damp seabreeze and thus to the east there would be a leeland dry healthy and elevated which corresponding with ugogo on the zanzibar tanganyika line would account for the light complexions of the people early on the morning of thursday april 17th the eliza was lying off mr r b n walkers factory and i was again received with customary hospitality by mr hogg  these two short trips gave me a just measure of the comparative difficulties in travelling through eastern and western africa and to a certain extent accounted for the huge vacuum which disfigures the latter a few miles behind the seaboard the road to unyamwezi for instance has been trodden for centuries the people have become trained porters they look forward annually to visiting the coast and they are accustomed to the sight of strangers arabs and others if war or bloodfeud chance to close one line the general interests of the interior open another but in this section of africa there is no way except from village to village and a bloodfeud may shut it for months the people have not the habit of dealing with the foreigner whom they look upon as a portent a walking ghost an illomened apparition porterage is in embryo no scale of payment exists and no dread of cutting off a communication profitable to both importer and exporter prevents the greedy barbarian plundering the stranger captain speke and i were fortunate in being the first whites who seriously attempted the lake region our only obstacles were the european merchants at zanzibar the murder of m maizan although a bad example to the people had been so punished as to render an immediate repetition of the outrage improbable i say immediate for shortly after our return the unfortunate herr roscher was killed at the hisonguni village near the rufuma river without apparent reason fn22  but m du chaillu had a very different task and as far as he went he did it well his second expedition in which an accidental death raised the country against him was fortunately undertaken by a man in the prime of youth and strength otherwise he must have succumbed to a nine hours run wounded withal in east africa when one of lieutenant camerons pagazis happened to kill a native the white man was mulcted only in half his cloth  on the other hand i see no reason why these untrodden lines should be pronounced impossible as a writer in the pall mall has lately done deterring the explorer from work which every day would cover new ground the gaboon is by no means a bad point de départ whence the resolute traveller with perseverance anglicè time a knowledge of the coast language and good luck might penetrate into the heart proper of africa and abolish the white blot which still affronts us his main difficulty would be the heavy outlay impecuniosity to him would represent the scurvy and potted cat of the old arctic voyager but if he can afford to travel regardless of delays and expense and to place depots of cloth beads and other countrymoney at every hundred miles mpongweland would be one of the gateways to the unknown regions of the dark continent moreover every year we hear some new account of travellers coming from the east unfortunately men with £5000 to £20000 a year do not plant the lance in africa the old heroic days of the spanish and portuguese exploring hidalgos have yet to dawn anew we must now look forward to subsidies from economical governments and whilst the germans and italians especially the former are so liberally supported and adequately rewarded englishmen as in the case of the gallant lieutenant cameron run the risk of being repudiated left penniless in the depths of negroland                                chapter xi                   mr mrs and master gorilla    the reader will kindly bear in mind when perusing my notes upon the gorilla that as in the the case of the fán cannibalism described by the young french traveller my knowledge of the anthropoid is confined to the maritime region moreover that it is hearsay fate having prevented my nearer acquaintance with the ape of contention  the discovery must be assigned to admiral hanno of carthage who about b c 500 first in the historical period slew the troglodytes and carried home their spoils  the next traveller who described the great troglodytes of equatorial africa was the wellknown andrew battel of leigh essex 1589 to 1600 and his description deserves quoting here mayombo are two kinds of monsters common to these woods the largest of them is called pongo in their language and the other engeco in the older editions encêgo evidently nchigo whilst engeco may have given rise to our jocko the pongo is in all his proportions like a man except the legs which have no calves but are of a gigantic size their faces hands and ears are without hair their bodies are covered but not very thick with hair of a dunnish colour when they walk on the ground it is upright with their hands on the nape of the neck they sleep in trees and make a covering over their heads to shelter them from the rain they eat no flesh but feed on nuts and other fruits they cannot speak nor have they any understanding beyond instinct  when the people of the country travel through the woods they make fires in the night and in the morning when they are gone the pongos will come and sit round it till it goes out for they do not possess sagacity enough to lay more wood on they go in bodies and kill many negroes who travel in the woods when elephants happen to come and feed where they are they will fall on them and so beat them with their clubbed fists sticks that they are forced to run away roaring the grown pongos are never taken alive owing to their strength which is so great that ten men cannot hold one of them the young pongos hang upon their mothers belly with their hands clasped about her many of the young ones are taken by means of shooting the mothers with poisoned arrows and the young ones hanging to their mothers are easily taken  i have italicized the passages which show that the traditions still preserved on the coast about the pongo and the chimpanzee date from old surely m du chaillu does grave injustice to this good old briton who was not a literary man by declaring his stories to be mere travellers tales untrue of any of the great apes of africa battel had evidently not seen the animal and with his negro informants he confounds the gorilla and the bushman yet he possibly alludes to a species which has escaped m du chaillu and other modern observers  mr w winwood reade savage africa chap xix has done good service by reprinting the letter of a bristol trader on the west coast of africa first published by lord monboddo origin and progress of language vol i p 281 1774 to 1792 here we find distinct mention of three anthropoid apes the first is the impungu or pongo which walks upright and is from seven to nine feet high the second is the itsena evidently the njína njí nguyla or gorilla and thirdly is the chimpenza our chimpanzee a word corrupted from the congoese kampenzy including the nchígo the kulukamba and other troglodytes i have heard of this uprightwalking mpongo at loango and other places on the west coast of africa where the njína is familiarly spoken of and it is not methinks impossible that an ape even larger than the gorilla may yet be found  james barbot a voyage to congo river churchill vol v p 512 tells us in 1700 that the kingdom of angola or dongo produces many such extraordinary apes in the woods they are called by the blacks quojas morrow and by the indians orang outang that is satyrs or woodmen    this creature seems to be the very satyr of the ancients written of by pliny and others and is said to set upon women in the woods and sometimes upon armed men amongst these animals he evidently includes the chimpanzee as may be seen by his reference to the royal exchange london  in 1776 the philosophical abbé proyart in his excellent history of loango tells us vide the chapter upon animals that there are in the forests baboons four feet high the negroes affirm that when they are hard pushed they come down from the trees with sticks in their hands to defend themselves against those who are hunting them and that very often they chase their pursuers the missionaries never witnessed this singularity according to the people gorillas five or six feet tall have been seen as lately as 1840 at looboo wood a wellknown spot which we shall presently sight about three miles inland from the centre of loango bay  and now the long intervals between travellers accounts wax shorter the wellknown writer bowdich before quoted published in 1819 his hearsay description of the ingena garnished with the usual native tales i had the honour of receiving an account of his discovery from his widow the late mrs lee who was held the mother of african travellers and whose energy and intelligence endured to the lastif memory serves me she referred to some paper upon the subject written by herself about 1825 towards the end of 1846 the rev mr wilson founder of the gaboon mission and protogrammarian of its language obtained two skulls which were followed by skeletons fragmentary and perfect he sent no 1 measuring when alive 5 ½ feet in height and 4 feet across the shoulders to the natural history society of boston he evidently has a right to boast that he was the first to call the attention of naturalists to the njena his colleague dr thomas savage and professor jeffries wyman called the new animal by the old name of gorilla suffixing it to the troglodytes which geoffrey de sainthilaire reviving linnaeus had proposed in 1812 in 1847 dr savage published in the journal of natural history boston the result of his careful inquiries about the engéena and the encheeko in 1852 this information was supplemented by dr ford also of the gaboon mission with a paper on the gorilla published in the transactions of the philadelphian academy of sciences  m du chaillu first had the honour of slaying the gorilla in its native wilds i saw his trophies in the united states in 1859 and the sensation which they subsequently created in london 18611862 is too recent to require notice unfortunately the specimens were mutilated and imperfect mr r b n walker agent of messrs hatton and cookson at the gaboon river was the first to send home a young specimen bodily stowed away in spirits two boiled skeletons of large grey animals whose skins i saw at the factory and rumpreserved brains intestines and other interesting parts which had vainly been desired by naturalists mr w winwood reade spent five active months in the gorilla country in 1862 major levison also visited the river but their hunting was as unsuccessful as mine whilst in 1863 major now colonel de ruvignes is reported to have been more fortunate since that time gorillas have been killed by the french chasseur  the young troglodyte has often been captured the usual mode is to fell the tree and during the confusion to throw a cloth over its head the hands are then pinioned behind and a forked stick is fastened under the chin to prevent the child biting i should prefer for trapping old as well as young the way in which bears are caught by the north american backwoodsmana hollowed log with some fruit plantains for instance floating in a quant suff of sugar well sugared and narcotized  concerning the temper of these little captives there are heroic differences of opinion mr ford records the implacable desperation of a juvenile which was brought to the mission it was taken very young and kept four months and many means were used to tame it but it was so incorrigible that it bit me an hour before it died yet in face of this and other evidence mr w winwood reade writing to the athenaeum september 7 1862 asserts that the young gorilla in captivity is not savage joe gorilla m du chaillus brat was notoriously fierce and unmanageable the rev mr walker of baraka had a specimen which he describes as a very tractable pupil and my excellent friend major noeliy white better known as governor white of corisco island brought to fernando po a baby njina which in its ways and manners much resembled an old woman mr r b n walker became the happy godfather of two youngsters who were different in disposition as valentine and orson one which measured 18 inches high and died in 1861 was so savage and morose that it was always kept chained the other seraphino was of angelic nature a general favourite at the factory it survives in a photograph taken by the french commandant of the comptoir as it sat after breakfast on godpapas lap at first it was confined but it soon became so tame and playful that the cage was required only at night it never bit unless when teased and its only fault was not being able to avoid the temptation of eating what disagreed with itin fact it was sub human in some points and very human in others all died in direct consequence of dysentery which even a milk diet could not prevent perhaps the best way to send home so delicate an animal would be to keep it for a time in its native forest to accustom it to boiled plantains rice and messes of grain and to ship it during the fine season having previously fitted up a cabin near the engineroom where the mercury should never fall below 70 °fahr in order to escape nostalgia and melancholy which are sure to be fatal the emigrant should be valeted by a faithful and attached native  the habitat of the gorilla has been unduly limited to the left banks of the gaboon and fernao vaz rivers and to the lands lying between north latitude 2° and south latitude 2°in fact to the immediate vicinity of the equator the late count lavradio informed me that he had heard of it on the banks of the lower congo river south latitude 9° and the soko which dr livingstone identifies with the gorilla extends to the lualaba or upper congo in the regions immediately west of the tanganyika lake his friends have suggested that the soko might have been a chimpanzee but the old traveller was methinks far above making the mistake the yorubans at once recognize the picture they call the anthropoid nákí and they declare that when it seizes a man it tears the fingers asunder so m du chaillu chapter vi mentions in the mpongwe report that the njina tears off the toenails and the fingernails of his human captives we should not believe so scandalous an assertion without detailed proof it is hardly fair to make the innocent biped as needlessly cruel as man it is well known to the natives of the old calabar river by the name of onion in 1860 the brothers jules and ambroise poncet travelled with dr peney to ab kúka the last of their stations near the head of the luta nzige albert nyanza lake and dr peney brought back the hand of the first gorilla which had been heard of ocean highways p 482 february 1874 the german expedition 1873 reports chicambo to be a gorilla country that the anthropoid is found one days journey from the coast and that the agent of that station has killed five with his own hand mr thompson of sherbro palm land chap xiii says of the chimpanzee some have been seen as tall as a man from five to seven feet high and very powerful this is evidently the njína the only known anthropoid that attains tall human stature and from the rest of the passagefn23 it is clear that he has confounded the chimpanzee with the nchigompolo  the strip of gorillacountry visited by me was an elevated line of clayey and sandy soil cut by sweetwater streams and by mangrovelined swamps backed inland by thin forest here the comparative absence of matted undergrowth makes the landscape subeuropean at least by the side of the foul tropical jungle it is exceptionally rich in the wild fruits required by the huge anthropoid the clearings also supply bananas pineapple leaves and sugarcane and there is an abundance of honey in which like the nchígo the gorilla delights the villages and the frequent plantations which it visits to plunder limit its reproduction near the sea and make it exceedingly wary and keen of eye if not of smell even when roosting by night it is readily frightened by a footstep and the crash caused by the mighty bound from branch to branch makes the traveller think that a tree has fallen  the gorilla breeds about december a cool and dry month according to my bushmen the period of gestation is between five and six months the babe begins to walk some ten days after birth chops milk for three months and at the end of that time may reach eighteen inches in height m du chaillu makes his child joe gorilla 2 feet 6 inches when under the third year assuming the average height of the adult male at 5 feet to 5 feet 6 inches this measurement suggests that according to the law of flourens the life would exceed thirty years i saw two fragmentary skins thoroughly pepper and salt and the natives assured me that the gorilla turns silverwhite with age  it is still a disputed point whether the weight is supported by the knuckles of the forehand like the chimpanzee or whether the palm is the proper fulcrum m du chaillu says first expedition chap xx the fingers are only lightly marked on the ground yet a few pages afterwards we are told the most usual mode of progression of the animal is on allfours and resting on the knuckles in the second expedition chap ii we read the tracks of the feet never showed the marks of toes only the heels and the track of the hands showed simply the impressions of the knuckles  the attack of the gorilla is that of the apes and the monkeys generally the bigbellied satyr advances to the assault as it travels shuffling on allfours rocking not traversing bristling the crest chattering mowing and displaying the fearful teeth and tusks like all the simiads this troglodyte sways the body to and fro and springs from side to side for the purpose of avoiding the weapon at times quasimodo raises himself slightly upon the dwarfed asthenogenic and almost deformed hind limbs which look those of a child terminating the body of a dan lambert the same action may be seen in its congeners great and small the wild huntsmen almost cried with laughter when they saw the sketches in the gorilla bookfn24 the mighty pugilist standing stiff and upright as the late mr benjamin caunt beating the breast with huge fists till it sounded like an immense bass drum and preparing to deal a buffet worthy of friar tuck they asked me if i thought mortal man would ever attempt to face such a thing as that with respect to drumming with both forehands upon the chest some asserted that such is the brutes practice when calling mrs gorilla or during the excitement of a scuffle but the accounts of the bushmen differ greatly on this point in a handtohand struggle it puts forth one of the giant feet sometimes the hinder as joe gorilla was wont to do and having once got a hold with its prehensile toes it bites and worries like any other ape baboon or monkey from this grapple doubtless arose the old native legend about the gorilla drawing travellers up trees and quietly choking them it can have little vitality as it is easily killed with a bit of stone propelled out of a trade musket by the vilest gunpowder and the timid bushmen when failing to shoot it unawares do not fear to attack it openly as a rule the larger the simiad the less sprightly it becomes and those most approaching man are usually the tamest and the most melancholyperhaps their spirits are permanently affected by their narrow escape the elderly male for anthropoids like anthropoi wax fierce and surly with increasing years will fight but only from fear when suddenly startled or with rage when slightly wounded moreover there must be roguegorillas like rogueelephants lions hippopotami rhinoceros and even stags vieux grognards who expelled house and home and debarred by the promising young scions from the softening influence of feminine society become in their enforced widowerhood the crustiest of old bachelors at certain seasons they may charge in defence of the wife and family but the practice is exceptional mr wilson saw a man who had lost the calf of his leg in an encounter and one etia a huntsman whose left hand had been severely crippled informed mr w winwood reade that the gorilla seized his wrist with his hind foot and dragged his hand into his mouth as he would have done a bunch of plantains no one however could give me an authentic instance of manslaughter by our big brother  the modifications with which we must read the picturesque pages of the gorilla book are chiefly the following the gorilla is a poor devil ape not a hellish dreamcreature half man half beast he is not king of the african forest he fears the njego or leopard and as lions will not live in these wet wooded and gameless lands he can hardly have expelled king leo he does not choose the darkest gloomiest forests but prefers the thin woods where he finds wild fruits for himself and family his tremendous roar does not shake the jungle it is a hollow apish cry a loudish huhh huhh huhh explosive like the puff of a steamengine which in rage becomes a sharp and snappish bark  any hunter can imitate it doubtless in some exceptional cases when an aged mixture of lablache and dan lambert delivers his voce di petto the voice may be heard for some distance in the still african shades but it will hardly compare with the howling monkeys of the brazil which make the forest hideous the eye is not a light grey but the brown common to all the tribe the gorilla cannot stand straight upon his rear quarter when attacking or otherwise engaged without holding on to a trunk he does not run on his hind legs he is essentially a tree ape as every stuffed specimen will prove he never gives a tremendous blow with his immense open paw doubtless a native legend found in battel and bowdich nor does he attack with the arms however old and male he may be he runs away with peculiar alacrity though powerfully weaponed with tigerish teeth with bunches of muscular fibre and with the limbs of goliah the gorilla on the seaboard at least is essentially a coward nor can we be surprised at his want of pluck considering the troubles and circumstances under which he spends his harassed days finally whilst a hen will defend her chicks mrs gorilla will fly leaving son or daughter in the hunters hands                                chapter xii                  coriscohome to fernando po    on april 22nd after some five weeks in the gaboon river i found myself once more in her majestys steamship griffon which had returned from the south coast bound for corisco gorilla island and fernando po it was goingaway day when proverbially the world looks prettier than usual and we enjoyed the suggestive view of the beaded line which seen from the sea represents the sierra del crystal the distance from le plateau to the isle of lightning was only thirtyfive miles from the nearest continent ten and before the evening tornado broke from the southeast here the normal direction we were lying in the roads about two miles from the landingplace the anchorage is known by bringing mbánya little corisco the smaller and southern outlier in a line between laval islet and the main island  the frequent coruscations gave a name to corisco which the natives know as mange it was called says barbot ilha do corisco from the portuguese because of the violent horrid lightnings and claps of thunder the first discoverers there saw and heard there at the time of their discovery there is still something to be done in investigating the cause of these electrical discharges why should lofty fernando po and lowlying corisco suffer so much when zanzibar island similarly situated suffers so rarely again why is damascus generally free from thunderstorms when brazilian sâo paul whose site is of the same altitude and otherwise so like can hardly keep the lightning out of doors the immunity of zanzibar island can hardly be explained by the popular theory neither it nor fernando po which suffers greatly from thunderstorms lies near the embouchure of a great river where salt and fresh water may disturb electrical equilibrium i shall say more upon this point when in the congo regions chap xii  the position of great corisco north latitude 0° 55 0 is at the mouth of a wellwooded bay which barbot iv 9 calls bay of angra ie bight of bight he terms the southern or munda stream rio de angrta or angex whilst the equally important muni danger becomes only a little river without name the modern charts prefer corisco bay it measures some forty miles from north to south by half that depth and its position causes the rains which are synchronous with those of the gaboon to be much more copious and continuous they last nine months out of twelve and in march 1862 the fall was 25 inches the heaviest remembered it had filled the little island valleys and made the paths lines of canal  next morning we were visited by the rev mr mackey the senior of the eight white men who inhabit this piece of landa proper site for robinson crusoewhere as the yankee said of great britain you can hardly stretch yourself without fear of falling overboard he kindly undertook to be our guide over the interior and we landed on the hard sand of the open western beach here at times a tremendous surf must roll in we struck into the bush and bent towards the southwest of the islet where stands the monarch of cliffs 80 feet high the maximum length is three miles by about the same breadth and the circumference including the indentations may be fifteen the surface is rolling composed of humus and clay corallines and shelly conglomerates based on tertiary limestone and perhaps sandstone dwarf clearings alternate with tracts of bush grass and with a bushy second growth lacking large trees the only important wild productions pointed out to us were cardamoms the oil palm elais guincensis and an unknown species of butternut the centre of the island was a mass of perennial pools fed they say by springs as well as rains one puddle adorned with water lilies and full of dwarf leeches which relish mans life extended about a hundred yards long in fact the general semblance of corisco was that of a filled up atoll a circular reef still growing to a habitable land here only could i find on the west coast of africa a trace of the features which distinguished the gorilla island of 2300 years ago  at south bay we came upon a grassy clearing larger than usual near a bright stream its pottery and charred wood showed the site of the spanish barracoon destroyed by the british in 1840 during the last seven years the patriarchal institution has become extinct and the old slavers who have at times touched at the island have left it emptyhanded corisco had long been celebrated for camwood a hard and ponderous growth yielding a better red than brazil or braziletto alias brazilete brasilettia de cand one of the eucæsalpinieæ a congener of c echinata which produces the brazilwood or pernambucowood of commerce in 1679 the hollander governorgeneral of minas sent some forty whites to cultivate indian wheat and other sort of corn and plants of guinea the design was to supply the dutch west indian companys ships with grain and vegetables especially bananas which grow admirably i heard that there are fifteen varieties upon this dot of dry land thus the crews would not waste time and money at cape lopez and the portuguese islands the dutch colonists began by setting up a factory in a turf redoubt armed with iron guns the better to secure themselves from any surprise or assault of the few natives who are a sort of wild and mischievous blacks the plantation was successful but the bad climate and noxious gases from the newly turned ground combined with overexertion soon killed some seventeen out of the forty and the remainder who also suffered from malignant distempers razed their buildings and returned to the gold coast when the crown of spain once more took possession of fernando po it appointed a governor for corisco but no establishment was maintained there to its credit be it said there was not much interference with the protestant mission public preaching was forbidden pro formâ in 1860 but no notice was taken of passive resistance  the native villages exactly resembling those of the gaboon are all built near the strip of fine white sand which forms the shore and upon the sweet water channels which cut deep into the limestones they are infested with rats against whose depredations the mango trees must be protected with tin ruffs yet there are six kinds of reptilia upon the island including the common black snake and cobras from six to seven feet long these animals aided by the dogs which also persecute the iguanas have prevented rabbits breeding in barbots time 1700 there were only thirty or forty inhabitants who held the north eastern point about a league from the wooding and watering places that handful of blacks has much ado to live healthy the air being very intemperate and unwholesome they are governed by a chief who is lord of the island and they all live very poorly but have plenty enough of cucumbers which grow there in perfection and many sorts of fowl in 1856 the rev mr wilson reckons them at less than 2000 and in 1862 i was told that there were about 1100 of whom 600 were bengas in look dress and ornaments they resemble the mpongwe but some of them have adopted the kru stripe holding a blue nose to be a sign of freedom they consider themselves superior to the pongos and they have exchanged their former fighting reputation for that of peaceful traders to the mainland and to the rivers muni and mundah they live well eating flesh or fish once a day not on sundays only the ambition of henri quatre at times they trap fine green turtle in seines but they do not turn these delicate monsters  mr wilson numbered the whole benga tribe at 8000 but mr mackey reduced the figure to half besides corisco they inhabit the two capes at the north and south of the bay the language is used by other tribes holding the coast northward for a hundred miles or more and probably by the inner people extending in a northerly direction from corisco bay the same with certain modifications is also spoken at são bento batanga and perhaps as far north as the camarones river on the other hand the tribes occupying the eastern margin of corisco bay such as the mbiko dibwe and belengi cannot understand one another and the tongues of the southward regions differ even more from the benga yet all evidently belong to the great south african family  mr mackey who explored corisco island in 1849 assures us that scarcely any of the older inhabitants were born there they came from the continent north or northeast of the bay gradually forcing their way down the characteristic difference of the benga the bákele and the mpongwe dialects is as follows the mpongwes have a great partiality for the use of the passive voice and avoid the active when the passive can be used the bákele verb delights in the active voice and will avoid the passive even by a considerable circumlocution the benga takes an intermediate position in this respect and uses the active and passive very much as we do in english  the corisco branch of the presbyterian board of foreign missions was established by the rev james s mackey in 1850 it made as much progress as could be expected and in 1862 it numbered 110 scholars and 65 communicants the total of those baptized was 80 and 15 had been suspended the members applied themselves as the list of their publications shows with peculiar ardour to the language and they did not neglect natural history and short explorations of the adjoining interior they had sent home specimens of the six reptilia the six snails and land shells the seventyfive sea shells and the 110 fishes all known by name which they collected upon the island and in the bay it is to be presumed that careful dredging will bring to light many more the pools are said to produce a small black fish local as the proteus anguineus of the styrian caves to mention no other  i was curious to hear from mr mackey some details about the muni river where he travelled in company with m du chaillu it still keeps the troublous reputation for petty wars which made the old traders dignify it with the name of danger the nearest falls are about thirty miles from olobe island and the most distant may be sixtyfive of course we had a laugh over the famous omamba or anaconda whose breath can be felt against the face before it is seen  late in april 24th i returned the books kindly lent to me from the mission library shook hands with my kind and hospitable entertainers at the mission house mentally wishing them speedy deliverance from corisco and embarked on board the griffon we quickly covered the great water desert of 160 miles between the gorilla island and fernando po and at noon on the next
