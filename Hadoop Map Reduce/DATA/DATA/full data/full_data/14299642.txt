romance of a busy broker after twenty years lost on dress parade by courier the furnished room the brief dÉbut of tildy      tobins palm   tobin and me the two of us went down to coney one day for there was four dollars between us and tobin had need of distractions for there was katie mahorner his sweetheart of county sligo lost since she started for america three months before with two hundred dollars her own savings and one hundred dollars from the sale of tobins inherited estate a fine cottage and pig on the bog shannaugh and since the letter that tobin got saying that she had started to come to him not a bit of news had he heard or seen of katie mahorner tobin advertised in the papers but nothing could be found of the colleen  so to coney me and tobin went thinking that a turn at the chutes and the smell of the popcorn might raise the heart in his bosom but tobin was a hardheaded man and the sadness stuck in his skin he ground his teeth at the crying balloons he cursed the moving pictures and though he would drink whenever asked he scorned punch and judy and was for licking the tintype men as they came  so i gets him down a side way on a board walk where the attractions were some less violent at a little six by eight stall tobin halts with a more human look in his eye  tis here says he i will be diverted ill have the palm of me hand investigated by the wonderful palmist of the nile and see if what is to be will be  tobin was a believer in signs and the unnatural in nature he possessed illegal convictions in his mind along the subjects of black cats lucky numbers and the weather predictions in the papers  we went into the enchanted chicken coop which was fixed mysterious with red cloth and pictures of hands with lines crossing em like a railroad centre the sign over the door says it is madame zozo the egyptian palmist there was a fat woman inside in a red jumper with pothooks and beasties embroidered upon it tobin gives her ten cents and extends one of his hands she lifts tobins hand which is own brother to the hoof of a drayhorse and examines it to see whether tis a stone in the frog or a cast shoe he has come for  man says this madame zozo the line of your fate shows  tis not me foot at all says tobin interrupting sure tis no beauty but ye hold the palm of me hand  the line shows says the madame that yeve not arrived at your time of life without bad luck and theres more to come the mount of venusor is that a stone bruiseshows that yeve been in love theres been trouble in your life on account of your sweetheart  tis katie mahorner she has references with whispers tobin to me in a loud voice to one side  i see says the palmist a great deal of sorrow and tribulation with one whom ye cannot forget i see the lines of designation point to the letter k and the letter m in her name  whist says tobin to me do ye hear that  look out goes on the palmist for a dark man and a light woman for theyll both bring ye trouble yell make a voyage upon the water very soon and have a financial loss i see one line that brings good luck theres a man coming into your life who will fetch ye good fortune yell know him when ye see him by his crooked nose  is his name set down asks tobin twill be convenient in the way of greeting when he backs up to dump off the good luck  his name says the palmist thoughtful looking is not spelled out by the lines but they indicate tis a long one and the letter o should be in it theres no more to tell goodevening dont block up the door  tis wonderful how she knows says tobin as we walk to the pier  as we squeezed through the gates a nigger man sticks his lighted segar against tobins ear and there is trouble tobin hammers his neck and the women squeal and by presence of mind i drag the little man out of the way before the police comes tobin is always in an ugly mood when enjoying himself  on the boat going back when the man calls who wants the goodlooking waiter tobin tried to plead guilty feeling the desire to blow the foam off a crock of suds but when he felt in his pocket he found himself discharged for lack of evidence somebody had disturbed his change during the commotion so we sat dry upon the stools listening to the dagoes fiddling on deck if anything tobin was lower in spirits and less congenial with his misfortunes than when we started  on a seat against the railing was a young woman dressed suitable for red automobiles with hair the colour of an unsmoked meerschaum in passing by tobin kicks her foot without intentions and being polite to ladies when in drink he tries to give his hat a twist while apologising but he knocks it off and the wind carries it overboard  tobin came back and sat down and i began to look out for him for the mans adversities were becoming frequent he was apt when pushed so close by hard luck to kick the best dressed man he could see and try to take command of the boat  presently tobin grabs my arm and says excited jawn says he do ye know what were doing were taking a voyage upon the water  there now says i subdue yeself the boatll land in ten minutes more  look says he at the light lady upon the bench and have ye forgotten the nigger man that burned me ear and isnt the money i had gonea dollar sixtyfive it was  i thought he was no more than summing up his catastrophes so as to get violent with good excuse as men will do and i tried to make him understand such things was trifles  listen says tobin yeve no ear for the gift of prophecy or the miracles of the inspired what did the palmist lady tell ye out of me hand tis coming true before your eyes look out says she for a dark man and a light woman theyll bring ye trouble have ye forgot the nigger man though he got some of it back from me fist can ye show me a lighter woman than the blonde lady that was the cause of me hat falling in the water and wheres the dollar sixtyfive i had in me vest when we left the shooting gallery  the way tobin put it it did seem to corroborate the art of prediction though it looked to me that these accidents could happen to any one at coney without the implication of palmistry  tobin got up and walked around on deck looking close at the passengers out of his little red eyes i asked him the interpretation of his movements ye never know what tobin has in his mind until he begins to carry it out  ye should know says he im working out the salvation promised by the lines in me palm im looking for the crookednose man thats to bring the good luck tis all that will save us jawn did ye ever see a straighternosed gang of hellions in the days of your life  twas the ninethirty boat and we landed and walked uptown through twentysecond street tobin being without his hat  on a street corner standing under a gaslight and looking over the elevated road at the moon was a man a long man he was dressed decent with a segar between his teeth and i saw that his nose made two twists from bridge to end like the wriggle of a snake tobin saw it at the same time and i heard him breathe hard like a horse when you take the saddle off he went straight up to the man and i went with him  goodnight to ye tobin says to the man the man takes out his segar and passes the compliments sociable  would ye hand us your name asks tobin and let us look at the size of it it may be our duty to become acquainted with ye  my name says the man polite is friedenhausmanmaximus g friedenhausman  tis the right length says tobin do you spell it with an o anywhere down the stretch of it  i do not says the man  can ye spell it with an o inquires tobin turning anxious  if your conscience says the man with the nose is indisposed toward foreign idioms ye might to please yourself smuggle the letter into the penultimate syllable  tis well says tobin yere in the presence of jawn malone and daniel tobin  tis highly appreciated says the man with a bow and now since i cannot conceive that ye would hold a spelling bee upon the street corner will ye name some reasonable excuse for being at large  by the two signs answers tobin trying to explain which ye display according to the reading of the egyptian palmist from the sole of me hand yeve been nominated to offset with good luck the lines of trouble leading to the nigger man and the blonde lady with her feet crossed in the boat besides the financial loss of a dollar sixtyfive all so far fulfilled according to hoyle  the man stopped smoking and looked at me  have ye any amendments he asks to offer to that statement or are ye one too i thought by the looks of ye ye might have him in charge  none says i to him except that as one horseshoe resembles another so are ye the picture of good luck as predicted by the hand of me friend if not then the lines of dannys hand may have been crossed i dont know  theres two of ye says the man with the nose looking up and down for the sight of a policeman ive enjoyed your company immense goodnight  with that he shoves his segar in his mouth and moves across the street stepping fast but tobin sticks close to one side of him and me at the other  what says he stopping on the opposite sidewalk and pushing back his hat do ye follow me i tell ye he says very loud im proud to have met ye but it is my desire to be rid of ye i am off to me home  do says tobin leaning against his sleeve do be off to your home and i will sit at the door of it till ye come out in the morning for the dependence is upon ye to obviate the curse of the nigger man and the blonde lady and the financial loss of the onesixtyfive  tis a strange hallucination says the man turning to me as a more reasonable lunatic hadnt ye better get him home  listen man says i to him daniel tobin is as sensible as he ever was maybe he is a bit deranged on account of having drink enough to disturb but not enough to settle his wits but he is no more than following out the legitimate path of his superstitions and predicaments which i will explain to you with that i relates the facts about the palmist lady and how the finger of suspicion points to him as an instrument of good fortune now understand i concludes my position in this riot i am the friend of me friend tobin according to me interpretations tis easy to be a friend to the prosperous for it pays tis not hard to be a friend to the poor for ye get puffed up by gratitude and have your picture printed standing in front of a tenement with a scuttle of coal and an orphan in each hand but it strains the art of friendship to be true friend to a born fool and thats what im doing says i for in my opinion theres no fortune to be read from the palm of me hand that wasnt printed there with the handle of a pick and though yeve got the crookedest nose in new york city i misdoubt that all the fortunetellers doing business could milk good luck from ye but the lines of dannys hand pointed to ye fair and ill assist him to experiment with ye until hes convinced yere dry  after that the man turns sudden to laughing he leans against a corner and laughs considerable then he claps me and tobin on the backs of us and takes us by an arm apiece  tis my mistake says he how could i be expecting anything so fine and wonderful to be turning the corner upon me i came near being found unworthy hard by says he is a café snug and suitable for the entertainment of idiosyncrasies let us go there and have drink while we discuss the unavailability of the categorical  so saying he marched me and tobin to the back room of a saloon and ordered the drinks and laid the money on the table he looks at me and tobin like brothers of his and we have the segars  ye must know says the man of destiny that me walk in life is one that is called the literary i wander abroad be night seeking idiosyncrasies in the masses and truth in the heavens above when ye came upon me i was in contemplation of the elevated road in conjunction with the chief luminary of night the rapid transit is poetry and art the moon but a tedious dry body moving by rote but these are private opinions for in the business of literature the conditions are reversed tis me hope to be writing a book to explain the strange things i have discovered in life  ye will put me in a book says tobin disgusted will ye put me in a book  i will not says the man for the covers will not hold ye not yet the best i can do is to enjoy ye meself for the time is not ripe for destroying the limitations of print ye would look fantastic in type all alone by meself must i drink this cup of joy but i thank ye boys i am truly grateful  the talk of ye says tobin blowing through his moustache and pounding the table with his fist is an eyesore to me patience there was good luck promised out of the crook of your nose but ye bear fruit like the bang of a drum ye resemble with your noise of books the wind blowing through a crack sure now i would be thinking the palm of me hand lied but for the coming true of the nigger man and the blonde lady and  whist says the long man would ye be led astray by physiognomy me nose will do what it can within bounds let us have these glasses filled again for tis good to keep idiosyncrasies well moistened they being subject to deterioration in a dry moral atmosphere  so the man of literature makes good to my notion for he pays cheerful for everything the capital of me and tobin being exhausted by prediction but tobin is sore and drinks quiet with the red showing in his eye  by and by we moved out for twas eleven oclock and stands a bit upon the sidewalk and then the man says he must be going home and invites me and tobin to walk that way we arrives on a side street two blocks away where there is a stretch of brick houses with high stoops and iron fences the man stops at one of them and looks up at the top windows which he finds dark  tis me humble dwelling says he and i begin to perceive by the signs that me wife has retired to slumber therefore i will venture a bit in the way of hospitality tis me wish that ye enter the basement room where we dine and partake of a reasonable refreshment there will be some fine cold fowl and cheese and a bottle or two of ale ye will be welcome to enter and eat for i am indebted to ye for diversions  the appetite and conscience of me and tobin was congenial to the proposition though twas sticking hard in dannys superstitions to think that a few drinks and a cold lunch should represent the good fortune promised by the palm of his hand  step down the steps says the man with the crooked nose and i will enter by the door above and let ye in i will ask the new girl we have in the kitchen says he to make ye a pot of coffee to drink before ye go tis fine coffee katie mahorner makes for a green girl just landed three months step in says the man and ill send her down to ye      the gift of the magi   one dollar and eightyseven cents that was all and sixty cents of it was in pennies pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until ones cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied three times della counted it one dollar and eightyseven cents and the next day would be christmas  there was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl so della did it which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs sniffles and smiles with sniffles predominating  while the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second take a look at the home a furnished flat at 8 per week it did not exactly beggar description but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad  in the vestibule below was a letterbox into which no letter would go and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name mr james dillingham young the dillingham had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid 30 per week now when the income was shrunk to 20 the letters of dillingham looked blurred as though they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming d but whenever mr james dillingham young came home and reached his flat above he was called jim and greatly hugged by mrs james dillingham young already introduced to you as della which is all very good  della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag she stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat walking a grey fence in a grey backyard tomorrow would be christmas day and she had only 187 with which to buy jim a present she had been saving every penny she could for months with this result twenty dollars a week doesnt go far expenses had been greater than she had calculated they always are only 187 to buy a present for jim her jim many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him something fine and rare and sterlingsomething just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of being owned by jim  there was a pierglass between the windows of the room perhaps you have seen a pierglass in an 8 flat a very thin and very agile person may by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks della being slender had mastered the art  suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass her eyes were shining brilliantly but her face had lost its colour within twenty seconds rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length  now there were two possessions of the james dillingham youngs in which they both took a mighty pride one was jims gold watch that had been his fathers and his grandfathers the other was dellas hair had the queen of sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate her majestys jewels and gifts had king solomon been the janitor with all his treasures piled up in the basement jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed just to see him pluck at his beard from envy  so now dellas beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters it reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her and then she did it up again nervously and quickly once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet  on went her old brown jacket on went her old brown hat with a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street  where she stopped the sign read mme sofronie hair goods of all kinds one flight up della ran and collected herself panting madame large too white chilly hardly looked the sofronie  will you buy my hair asked della  i buy hair said madame take yer hat off and lets have a sight at the looks of it  down rippled the brown cascade twenty dollars said madame lifting the mass with a practised hand  give it to me quick said della  oh and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings forget the hashed metaphor she was ransacking the stores for jims present  she found it at last it surely had been made for jim and no one else there was no other like it in any of the stores and she had turned all of them inside out it was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentationas all good things should do it was even worthy of the watch as soon as she saw it she knew that it must be jims it was like him quietness and valuethe description applied to both twentyone dollars they took from her for it and she hurried home with the 87 cents with that chain on his watch jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company grand as the watch was he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain  when della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason she got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love which is always a tremendous task dear friendsa mammoth task  within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny closelying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy she looked at her reflection in the mirror long carefully and critically  if jim doesnt kill me she said to herself before he takes a second look at me hell say i look like a coney island chorus girl but what could i dooh what could i do with a dollar and eightyseven cents  at 7 oclock the coffee was made and the fryingpan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops  jim was never late della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight and she turned white for just a moment she had a habit for saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things and now she whispered please god make him think i am still pretty  the door opened and jim stepped in and closed it he looked thin and very serious poor fellow he was only twentytwoand to be burdened with a family he needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves  jim stopped inside the door as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail his eyes were fixed upon della and there was an expression in them that she could not read and it terrified her it was not anger nor surprise nor disapproval nor horror nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for he simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face  della wriggled off the table and went for him  jim darling she cried dont look at me that way i had my hair cut off and sold because i couldnt have lived through christmas without giving you a present itll grow out againyou wont mind will you i just had to do it my hair grows awfully fast say merry christmas jim and lets be happy you dont know what a nicewhat a beautiful nice gift ive got for you  youve cut off your hair asked jim laboriously as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor  cut it off and sold it said della dont you like me just as well anyhow im me without my hair aint i  jim looked about the room curiously  you say your hair is gone he said with an air almost of idiocy  you neednt look for it said della its sold i tell yousold and gone too its christmas eve boy be good to me for it went for you maybe the hairs of my head were numbered she went on with sudden serious sweetness but nobody could ever count my love for you shall i put the chops on jim  out of his trance jim seemed quickly to wake he enfolded his della for ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction eight dollars a week or a million a yearwhat is the difference a mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer the magi brought valuable gifts but that was not among them this dark assertion will be illuminated later on  jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table  dont make any mistake dell he said about me i dont think theres anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less but if youll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first  white fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper and then an ecstatic scream of joy and then alas a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat  for there lay the combsthe set of combs side and back that della had worshipped long in a broadway window beautiful combs pure tortoise shell with jewelled rimsjust the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair they were expensive combs she knew and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession and now they were hers but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone  but she hugged them to her bosom and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say my hair grows so fast jim  and then della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried oh oh  jim had not yet seen his beautiful present she held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm the dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit  isnt it a dandy jim i hunted all over town to find it youll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now give me your watch i want to see how it looks on it  instead of obeying jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled  dell said he lets put our christmas presents away and keep em a while theyre too nice to use just at present i sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs and now suppose you put the chops on  the magi as you know were wise menwonderfully wise menwho brought gifts to the babe in the manger they invented the art of giving christmas presents being wise their gifts were no doubt wise ones possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication and here i have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house but in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest of all who give and receive gifts such as they are wisest everywhere they are wisest they are the magi      a cosmopolite in a cafÉ   at midnight the café was crowded by some chance the little table at which i sat had escaped the eye of incomers and two vacant chairs at it extended their arms with venal hospitality to the influx of patrons  and then a cosmopolite sat in one of them and i was glad for i held a theory that since adam no true citizen of the world has existed we hear of them and we see foreign labels on much luggage but we find travellers instead of cosmopolites  i invoke your consideration of the scenethe marbletopped tables the range of leatherupholstered wall seats the gay company the ladies dressed in demistate toilets speaking in an exquisite visible chorus of taste economy opulence or art the sedulous and largessloving garçons the music wisely catering to all with its raids upon the composers the mélange of talk and laughterand if you will the würzburger in the tall glass cones that bend to your lips as a ripe cherry sways on its branch to the beak of a robber jay i was told by a sculptor from mauch chunk that the scene was truly parisian  my cosmopolite was named e rushmore coglan and he will be heard from next summer at coney island he is to establish a new attraction there he informed me offering kingly diversion and then his conversation rang along parallels of latitude and longitude he took the great round world in his hand so to speak familiarly contemptuously and it seemed no larger than the seed of a maraschino cherry in a table dhôte grape fruit he spoke disrespectfully of the equator he skipped from continent to continent he derided the zones he mopped up the high seas with his napkin with a wave of his hand he would speak of a certain bazaar in hyderabad whiff he would have you on skis in lapland zip now you rode the breakers with the kanakas at kealaikahiki presto he dragged you through an arkansas postoak swamp let you dry for a moment on the alkali plains of his idaho ranch then whirled you into the society of viennese archdukes anon he would be telling you of a cold he acquired in a chicago lake breeze and how old escamila cured it in buenos ayres with a hot infusion of the chuchula weed you would have addressed a letter to e rushmore coglan esq the earth solar system the universe and have mailed it feeling confident that it would be delivered to him  i was sure that i had found at last the one true cosmopolite since adam and i listened to his worldwide discourse fearful lest i should discover in it the local note of the mere globetrotter but his opinions never fluttered or drooped he was as impartial to cities countries and continents as the winds or gravitation  and as e rushmore coglan prattled of this little planet i thought with glee of a great almostcosmopolite who wrote for the whole world and dedicated himself to bombay in a poem he has to say that there is pride and rivalry between the cities of the earth and that the men that breed from them they traffic up and down but cling to their cities hem as a child to the mothers gown and whenever they walk by roaring streets unknown they remember their native city most faithful foolish fond making her merebreathed name their bond upon their bond and my glee was roused because i had caught mr kipling napping here i had found a man not made from dust one who had no narrow boasts of birthplace or country one who if he bragged at all would brag of his whole round globe against the martians and the inhabitants of the moon  expression on these subjects was precipitated from e rushmore coglan by the third corner to our table while coglan was describing to me the topography along the siberian railway the orchestra glided into a medley the concluding air was dixie and as the exhilarating notes tumbled forth they were almost overpowered by a great clapping of hands from almost every table  it is worth a paragraph to say that this remarkable scene can be witnessed every evening in numerous cafés in the city of new york tons of brew have been consumed over theories to account for it some have conjectured hastily that all southerners in town hie themselves to cafés at nightfall this applause of the rebel air in a northern city does puzzle a little but it is not insolvable the war with spain many years generous mint and watermelon crops a few longshot winners at the new orleans racetrack and the brilliant banquets given by the indiana and kansas citizens who compose the north carolina society have made the south rather a fad in manhattan your manicure will lisp softly that your left forefinger reminds her so much of a gentlemans in richmond va oh certainly but many a lady has to work nowthe war you know  when dixie was being played a darkhaired young man sprang up from somewhere with a mosby guerrilla yell and waved frantically his softbrimmed hat then he strayed through the smoke dropped into the vacant chair at our table and pulled out cigarettes  the evening was at the period when reserve is thawed one of us mentioned three würzburgers to the waiter the darkhaired young man acknowledged his inclusion in the order by a smile and a nod i hastened to ask him a question because i wanted to try out a theory i had  would you mind telling me i began whether you are from  the fist of e rushmore coglan banged the table and i was jarred into silence  excuse me said he but thats a question i never like to hear asked what does it matter where a man is from is it fair to judge a man by his postoffice address why ive seen kentuckians who hated whiskey virginians who werent descended from pocahontas indianians who hadnt written a novel mexicans who didnt wear velvet trousers with silver dollars sewed along the seams funny englishmen spendthrift yankees coldblooded southerners narrowminded westerners and new yorkers who were too busy to stop for an hour on the street to watch a onearmed grocers clerk do up cranberries in paper bags let a man be a man and dont handicap him with the label of any section  pardon me i said but my curiosity was not altogether an idle one i know the south and when the band plays dixie i like to observe i have formed the belief that the man who applauds that air with special violence and ostensible sectional loyalty is invariably a native of either secaucus nj or the district between murray hill lyceum and the harlem river this city i was about to put my opinion to the test by inquiring of this gentleman when you interrupted with your ownlarger theory i must confess  and now the darkhaired young man spoke to me and it became evident that his mind also moved along its own set of grooves  i should like to be a periwinkle said he mysteriously on the top of a valley and sing toorallooralloo  this was clearly too obscure so i turned again to coglan  ive been around the world twelve times said he i know an esquimau in upernavik who sends to cincinnati for his neckties and i saw a goatherder in uruguay who won a prize in a battle creek breakfast food puzzle competition i pay rent on a room in cairo egypt and another in yokohama all the year around ive got slippers waiting for me in a teahouse in shanghai and i dont have to tell em how to cook my eggs in rio de janeiro or seattle its a mighty little old world whats the use of bragging about being from the north or the south or the old manor house in the dale or euclid avenue cleveland or pikes peak or fairfax county va or hooligans flats or any place itll be a better world when we quit being fools about some mildewed town or ten acres of swampland just because we happened to be born there  you seem to be a genuine cosmopolite i said admiringly but it also seems that you would decry patriotism  a relic of the stone age declared coglan warmly we are all brotherschinamen englishmen zulus patagonians and the people in the bend of the kaw river some day all this petty pride in ones city or state or section or country will be wiped out and well all be citizens of the world as we ought to be  but while you are wandering in foreign lands i persisted do not your thoughts revert to some spotsome dear and  nary a spot interrupted e r coglan flippantly the terrestrial globular planetary hunk of matter slightly flattened at the poles and known as the earth is my abode ive met a good many objectbound citizens of this country abroad ive seen men from chicago sit in a gondola in venice on a moonlight night and brag about their drainage canal ive seen a southerner on being introduced to the king of england hand that monarch without batting his eyes the information that his grandaunt on his mothers side was related by marriage to the perkinses of charleston i knew a new yorker who was kidnapped for ransom by some afghanistan bandits his people sent over the money and he came back to kabul with the agent afghanistan the natives said to him through an interpreter well not so slow do you think oh i dont know says he and he begins to tell them about a cab driver at sixth avenue and broadway those ideas dont suit me im not tied down to anything that isnt 8000 miles in diameter just put me down as e rushmore coglan citizen of the terrestrial sphere  my cosmopolite made a large adieu and left me for he thought he saw some one through the chatter and smoke whom he knew so i was left with the wouldbe periwinkle who was reduced to würzburger without further ability to voice his aspirations to perch melodious upon the summit of a valley  i sat reflecting upon my evident cosmopolite and wondering how the poet had managed to miss him he was my discovery and i believed in him how was it the men that breed from them they traffic up and down but cling to their cities hem as a child to the mothers gown  not so e rushmore coglan with the whole world for his  my meditations were interrupted by a tremendous noise and conflict in another part of the café i saw above the heads of the seated patrons e rushmore coglan and a stranger to me engaged in terrific battle they fought between the tables like titans and glasses crashed and men caught their hats up and were knocked down and a brunette screamed and a blonde began to sing teasing  my cosmopolite was sustaining the pride and reputation of the earth when the waiters closed in on both combatants with their famous flying wedge formation and bore them outside still resisting  i called mccarthy one of the french garçons and asked him the cause of the conflict  the man with the red tie that was my cosmopolite said he got hot on account of things said about the bum sidewalks and water supply of the place he come from by the other guy  why said i bewildered that man is a citizen of the worlda cosmopolite he  originally from mattawamkeag maine he said continued mccarthy and he wouldnt stand for no knockin the place      between rounds   the may moon shone bright upon the private boardinghouse of mrs murphy by reference to the almanac a large amount of territory will be discovered upon which its rays also fell spring was in its heydey with hay fever soon to follow the parks were green with new leaves and buyers for the western and southern trade flowers and summerresort agents were blowing the air and answers to lawson were growing milder handorgans fountains and pinochle were playing everywhere  the windows of mrs murphys boardinghouse were open a group of boarders were seated on the high stoop upon round flat mats like german pancakes  in one of the secondfloor front windows mrs mccaskey awaited her husband supper was cooling on the table its heat went into mrs mccaskey  at nine mr mccaskey came he carried his coat on his arm and his pipe in his teeth and he apologised for disturbing the boarders on the steps as he selected spots of stone between them on which to set his size 9 width ds  as he opened the door of his room he received a surprise instead of the usual stovelid or potatomasher for him to dodge came only words  mr mccaskey reckoned that the benign may moon had softened the breast of his spouse  i heard ye came the oral substitutes for kitchenware ye can apollygise to riffraff of the streets for settin yer unhandy feet on the tails of their frocks but yed walk on the neck of yer wife the length of a clothesline without so much as a kiss me fut and im sure its that long from rubberin out the windy for ye and the victuals cold such as theres money to buy after drinkin up yer wages at galleghers every saturday evenin and the gas man here twice today for his  woman said mr mccaskey dashing his coat and hat upon a chair the noise of ye is an insult to me appetite when ye run down politeness ye take the mortar from between the bricks of the foundations of society tis no more than exercisin the acrimony of a gentleman when ye ask the dissent of ladies blockin the way for steppin between them will ye bring the pigs face of ye out of the windy and see to the food  mrs mccaskey arose heavily and went to the stove there was something in her manner that warned mr mccaskey when the corners of her mouth went down suddenly like a barometer it usually foretold a fall of crockery and tinware  pigs face is it said mrs mccaskey and hurled a stewpan full of bacon and turnips at her lord  mr mccaskey was no novice at repartee he knew what should follow the entrée on the table was a roast sirloin of pork garnished with shamrocks he retorted with this and drew the appropriate return of a bread pudding in an earthen dish a hunk of swiss cheese accurately thrown by her husband struck mrs mccaskey below one eye when she replied with a wellaimed coffeepot full of a hot black semifragrant liquid the battle according to courses should have ended  but mr mccaskey was no 50cent table dhôter let cheap bohemians consider coffee the end if they would let them make that faux pas he was foxier still fingerbowls were not beyond the compass of his experience they were not to be had in the pension murphy but their equivalent was at hand triumphantly he sent the graniteware wash basin at the head of his matrimonial adversary mrs mccaskey dodged in time she reached for a flatiron with which as a sort of cordial she hoped to bring the gastronomical duel to a close but a loud wailing scream downstairs caused both her and mr mccaskey to pause in a sort of involuntary armistice  on the sidewalk at the corner of the house policeman cleary was standing with one ear upturned listening to the crash of household utensils  tis jawn mccaskey and his missis at it again meditated the policeman i wonder shall i go up and stop the row i will not married folks they are and few pleasures they have twill not last long sure theyll have to borrow more dishes to keep it up with  and just then came the loud scream belowstairs betokening fear or dire extremity tis probably the cat said policeman cleary and walked hastily in the other direction  the boarders on the steps were fluttered mr toomey an insurance solicitor by birth and an investigator by profession went inside to analyse the scream he returned with the news that mrs murphys little boy mike was lost following the messenger out bounced mrs murphytwo hundred pounds in tears and hysterics clutching the air and howling to the sky for the loss of thirty pounds of freckles and mischief bathos truly but mr toomey sat down at the side of miss purdy millinery and their hands came together in sympathy the two old maids misses walsh who complained every day about the noise in the halls inquired immediately if anybody had looked behind the clock  major grigg who sat by his fat wife on the top step arose and buttoned his coat the little one lost he exclaimed i will scour the city his wife never allowed him out after dark but now she said go ludovic in a baritone voice whoever can look upon that mothers grief without springing to her relief has a heart of stone give me some thirty orsixty cents my love said the major lost children sometimes stray far i may need carfares  old man denny hall room fourth floor back who sat on the lowest step trying to read a paper by the street lamp turned over a page to follow up the article about the carpenters strike mrs murphy shrieked to the moon oh arrmike fr gawds sake where is me little bit av a boy  whend ye see him last asked old man denny with one eye on the report of the building trades league  oh wailed mrs murphy twas yisterday or maybe four hours ago i dunno but its lost he is me little boy mike he was playin on the sidewalk only this morninor was it wednesday im that busy with work tis hard to keep up with dates but ive looked the house over from top to cellar and its gone he is oh for the love av hiven  silent grim colossal the big city has ever stood against its revilers they call it hard as iron they say that no pulse of pity beats in its bosom they compare its streets with lonely forests and deserts of lava but beneath the hard crust of the lobster is found a delectable and luscious food perhaps a different simile would have been wiser still nobody should take offence we would call no one a lobster without good and sufficient claws  no calamity so touches the common heart of humanity as does the straying of a little child their feet are so uncertain and feeble the ways are so steep and strange  major griggs hurried down to the corner and up the avenue into billys place gimme a ryehigh he said to the servitor havent seen a bowlegged dirtyfaced little devil of a sixyearold lost kid around here anywhere have you  mr toomey retained miss purdys hand on the steps think of that dear little babe said miss purdy lost from his mothers sideperhaps already fallen beneath the iron hoofs of galloping steedsoh isnt it dreadful  aint that right agreed mr toomey squeezing her hand say i start out and help look for um  perhaps said miss purdy you should but oh mr toomey you are so dashingso recklesssuppose in your enthusiasm some accident should befall you then what  old man denny read on about the arbitration agreement with one finger on the lines  in the second floor front mr and mrs mccaskey came to the window to recover their second wind mr mccaskey was scooping turnips out of his vest with a crooked forefinger and his lady was wiping an eye that the salt of the roast pork had not benefited they heard the outcry below and thrust their heads out of the window  tis little mike is lost said mrs mccaskey in a hushed voice the beautiful little troublemaking angel of a gossoon  the bit of a boy mislaid said mr mccaskey leaning out of the window why now thats bad enough entirely the childer they be different if twas a woman id be willin for they leave peace behind em when they go  disregarding the thrust mrs mccaskey caught her husbands arm  jawn she said sentimentally missis murphys little bye is lost tis a great city for losing little boys six years old he was jawn tis the same age our little bye would have been if we had had one six years ago  we never did said mr mccaskey lingering with the fact  but if we had jawn think what sorrow would be in our hearts this night with our little phelan run away and stolen in the city nowheres at all  ye talk foolishness said mr mccaskey tis pat he would be named after me old father in cantrim  ye lie said mrs mccaskey without anger me brother was worth tin dozen bogtrotting mccaskeys after him would the bye be named she leaned over the windowsill and looked down at the hurrying and bustle below  jawn said mrs mccaskey softly im sorry i was hasty wid ye  twas hasty puddin as ye say said her husband and hurryup turnips and getamoveonye coffee twas what ye could call a quick lunch all right and tell no lie  mrs mccaskey slipped her arm inside her husbands and took his rough hand in hers  listen at the cryin of poor mrs murphy she said tis an awful thing for a bit of a bye to be lost in this great big city if twas our little phelan jawn id be breakin me heart  awkwardly mr mccaskey withdrew his hand but he laid it around the nearing shoulder of his wife  tis foolishness of course said he roughly but id be cut up some meself if our little pat was kidnapped or anything but there never was any childer for us sometimes ive been ugly and hard with ye judy forget it  they leaned together and looked down at the heartdrama being acted below  long they sat thus people surged along the sidewalk crowding questioning filling the air with rumours and inconsequent surmises mrs murphy ploughed back and forth in their midst like a soft mountain down which plunged an audible cataract of tears couriers came and went  loud voices and a renewed uproar were raised in front of the boardinghouse  whats up now judy asked mr mccaskey  tis missis murphys voice said mrs mccaskey harking she says shes after finding little mike asleep behind the roll of old linoleum under the bed in her room  mr mccaskey laughed loudly  thats yer phelan he shouted sardonically divil a bit would a pat have done that trick if the bye we never had is strayed and stole by the powers call him phelan and see him hide out under the bed like a mangy pup  mrs mccaskey arose heavily and went toward the dish closet with the corners of her mouth drawn down  policeman cleary came back around the corner as the crowd dispersed surprised he upturned an ear toward the mccaskey apartment where the crash of irons and chinaware and the ring of hurled kitchen utensils seemed as loud as before policeman cleary took out his timepiece  by the deported snakes he exclaimed jawn mccaskey and his lady have been fightin for an hour and a quarter by the watch the missis could give him forty pounds weight strength to his arm  policeman cleary strolled back around the corner  old man denny folded his paper and hurried up the steps just as mrs murphy was about to lock the door for the night      the skylight room   first mrs parker would show you the double parlours you would not dare to interrupt her description of their advantages and of the merits of the gentleman who had occupied them for eight years then you would manage to stammer forth the confession that you were neither a doctor nor a dentist mrs parkers manner of receiving the admission was such that you could never afterward entertain the same feeling toward your parents who had neglected to train you up in one of the professions that fitted mrs parkers parlours  next you ascended one flight of stairs and looked at the secondfloorback at 8 convinced by her secondfloor manner that it was worth the 12 that mr toosenberry always paid for it until he left to take charge of his brothers orange plantation in florida near palm beach where mrs mcintyre always spent the winters that had the double front room with private bath you managed to babble that you wanted something still cheaper  if you survived mrs parkers scorn you were taken to look at mr skidders large hall room on the third floor mr skidders room was not vacant he wrote plays and smoked cigarettes in it all day long but every roomhunter was made to visit his room to admire the lambrequins after each visit mr skidder from the fright caused by possible eviction would pay something on his rent  thenoh thenif you still stood on one foot with your hot hand clutching the three moist dollars in your pocket and hoarsely proclaimed your hideous and culpable poverty nevermore would mrs parker be cicerone of yours she would honk loudly the word clara she would show you her back and march downstairs then clara the coloured maid would escort you up the carpeted ladder that served for the fourth flight and show you the skylight room it occupied 7x8 feet of floor space at the middle of the hall on each side of it was a dark lumber closet or storeroom  in it was an iron cot a washstand and a chair a shelf was the dresser its four bare walls seemed to close in upon you like the sides of a coffin your hand crept to your throat you gasped you looked up as from a welland breathed once more through the glass of the little skylight you saw a square of blue infinity  two dollars suh clara would say in her halfcontemptuous halftuskegeenial tones  one day miss leeson came hunting for a room she carried a typewriter made to be lugged around by a much larger lady she was a very little girl with eyes and hair that had kept on growing after she had stopped and that always looked as if they were saying goodness me why didnt you keep up with us  mrs parker showed her the double parlours in this closet she said one could keep a skeleton or anaesthetic or coal  but i am neither a doctor nor a dentist said miss leeson with a shiver  mrs parker gave her the incredulous pitying sneering icy stare that she kept for those who failed to qualify as doctors or dentists and led the way to the second floor back  eight dollars said miss leeson dear me im not hetty if i do look green im just a poor little working girl show me something higher and lower  mr skidder jumped and strewed the floor with cigarette stubs at the rap on his door  excuse me mr skidder said mrs parker with her demons smile at his pale looks i didnt know you were in i asked the lady to have a look at your lambrequins  theyre too lovely for anything said miss leeson smiling in exactly the way the angels do  after they had gone mr skidder got very busy erasing the tall blackhaired heroine from his latest unproduced play and inserting a small roguish one with heavy bright hair and vivacious features  anna heldll jump at it said mr skidder to himself putting his feet up against the lambrequins and disappearing in a cloud of smoke like an aerial cuttlefish  presently the tocsin call of clara sounded to the world the state of miss leesons purse a dark goblin seized her mounted a stygian stairway thrust her into a vault with a glimmer of light in its top and muttered the menacing and cabalistic words two dollars  ill take it sighed miss leeson sinking down upon the squeaky iron bed  every day miss leeson went out to work at night she brought home papers with handwriting on them and made copies with her typewriter sometimes she had no work at night and then she would sit on the steps of the high stoop with the other roomers miss leeson was not intended for a skylight room when the plans were drawn for her creation she was gayhearted and full of tender whimsical fancies once she let mr skidder read to her three acts of his great unpublished comedy its no kid or the heir of the subway  there was rejoicing among the gentlemen roomers whenever miss leeson had time to sit on the steps for an hour or two but miss longnecker the tall blonde who taught in a public school and said well really to everything you said sat on the top step and sniffed and miss dorn who shot at the moving ducks at coney every sunday and worked in a department store sat on the bottom step and sniffed miss leeson sat on the middle step and the men would quickly group around her  especially mr skidder who had cast her in his mind for the star part in a private romantic unspoken drama in real life and especially mr hoover who was fortyfive fat flush and foolish and especially very young mr evans who set up a hollow cough to induce her to ask him to leave off cigarettes the men voted her the funniest and jolliest ever but the sniffs on the top step and the lower step were implacable                                          i pray you let the drama halt while chorus stalks to the footlights and drops an epicedian tear upon the fatness of mr hoover tune the pipes to the tragedy of tallow the bane of bulk the calamity of corpulence tried out falstaff might have rendered more romance to the ton than would have romeos rickety ribs to the ounce a lover may sigh but he must not puff to the train of momus are the fat men remanded in vain beats the faithfullest heart above a 52inch belt avaunt hoover hoover fortyfive flush and foolish might carry off helen herself hoover fortyfive flush foolish and fat is meat for perdition there was never a chance for you hoover  as mrs parkers roomers sat thus one summers evening miss leeson looked up into the firmament and cried with her little gay laugh  why theres billy jackson i can see him from down here too  all looked upsome at the windows of skyscrapers some casting about for an airship jacksonguided  its that star explained miss leeson pointing with a tiny finger not the big one that twinklesthe steady blue one near it i can see it every night through my skylight i named it billy jackson  well really said miss longnecker i didnt know you were an astronomer miss leeson  oh yes said the small star gazer i know as much as any of them about the style of sleeves theyre going to wear next fall in mars  well really said miss longnecker the star you refer to is gamma of the constellation cassiopeia it is nearly of the second magnitude and its meridian passage is  oh said the very young mr evans i think billy jackson is a much better name for it  same here said mr hoover loudly breathing defiance to miss longnecker i think miss leeson has just as much right to name stars as any of those old astrologers had  well really said miss longnecker  i wonder whether its a shooting star remarked miss dorn i hit nine ducks and a rabbit out of ten in the gallery at coney sunday  he doesnt show up very well from down here said miss leeson you ought to see him from my room you know you can see stars even in the daytime from the bottom of a well at night my room is like the shaft of a coal mine and it makes billy jackson look like the big diamond pin that night fastens her kimono with  there came a time after that when miss leeson brought no formidable papers home to copy and when she went out in the morning instead of working she went from office to office and let her heart melt away in the drip of cold refusals transmitted through insolent office boys this went on  there came an evening when she wearily climbed mrs parkers stoop at the hour when she always returned from her dinner at the restaurant but she had had no dinner  as she stepped into the hall mr hoover met her and seized his chance he asked her to marry him and his fatness hovered above her like an avalanche she dodged and caught the balustrade he tried for her hand and she raised it and smote him weakly in the face step by step she went up dragging herself by the railing she passed mr skidders door as he was redinking a stage direction for myrtle delorme miss leeson in his unaccepted comedy to pirouette across stage from l to the side of the count up the carpeted ladder she crawled at last and opened the door of the skylight room  she was too weak to light the lamp or to undress she fell upon the iron cot her fragile body scarcely hollowing the worn springs and in that erebus of the skylight room she slowly raised her heavy eyelids and smiled  for billy jackson was shining down on her calm and bright and constant through the skylight there was no world about her she was sunk in a pit of blackness with but that small square of pallid light framing the star that she had so whimsically and oh so ineffectually named miss longnecker must be right it was gamma of the constellation cassiopeia and not billy jackson and yet she could not let it be gamma  as she lay on her back she tried twice to raise her arm the third time she got two thin fingers to her lips and blew a kiss out of the black pit to billy jackson her arm fell back limply  goodbye billy she murmured faintly youre millions of miles away and you wont even twinkle once but you kept where i could see you most of the time up there when there wasnt anything else but darkness to look at didnt you    millions of miles    goodbye billy jackson  clara the coloured maid found the door locked at 10 the next day and they forced it open vinegar and the slapping of wrists and burnt feathers proving of no avail some one ran to phone for an ambulance  in due time it backed up to the door with much gongclanging and the capable young medico in his white linen coat ready active confident with his smooth face half debonair half grim danced up the steps  ambulance call to 49 he said briefly whats the trouble  oh yes doctor sniffed mrs parker as though her trouble that there should be trouble in the house was the greater i cant think what can be the matter with her nothing we could do would bring her to its a young woman a miss elsieyes a miss elsie leeson never before in my house  what room cried the doctor in a terrible voice to which mrs parker was a stranger  the skylight room it  evidently the ambulance doctor was familiar with the location of skylight rooms he was gone up the stairs four at a time mrs parker followed slowly as her dignity demanded  on the first landing she met him coming back bearing the astronomer in his arms he stopped and let loose the practised scalpel of his tongue not loudly gradually mrs parker crumpled as a stiff garment that slips down from a nail ever afterward there remained crumples in her mind and body sometimes her curious roomers would ask her what the doctor said to her  let that be she would answer if i can get forgiveness for having heard it i will be satisfied  the ambulance physician strode with his burden through the pack of hounds that follow the curiosity chase and even they fell back along the sidewalk abashed for his face was that of one who bears his own dead  they noticed that he did not lay down upon the bed prepared for it in the ambulance the form that he carried and all that he said was drive like hl wilson to the driver  that is all is it a story in the next mornings paper i saw a little news item and the last sentence of it may help you as it helped me to weld the incidents together  it recounted the reception into bellevue hospital of a young woman who had been removed from no 49 east  street suffering from debility induced by starvation it concluded with these words  dr william jackson the ambulance physician who attended the case says the patient will recover      a service of love   when one loves ones art no service seems too hard  that is our premise this story shall draw a conclusion from it and show at the same time that the premise is incorrect that will be a new thing in logic and a feat in storytelling somewhat older than the great wall of china  joe larrabee came out of the postoak flats of the middle west pulsing with a genius for pictorial art at six he drew a picture of the town pump with a prominent citizen passing it hastily this effort was framed and hung in the drug store window by the side of the ear of corn with an uneven number of rows at twenty he left for new york with a flowing necktie and a capital tied up somewhat closer  delia caruthers did things in six octaves so promisingly in a pinetree village in the south that her relatives chipped in enough in her chip hat for her to go north and finish they could not see her f but that is our story  joe and delia met in an atelier where a number of art and music students had gathered to discuss chiaroscuro wagner music rembrandts works pictures waldteufel wall paper chopin and oolong  joe and delia became enamoured one of the other or each of the other as you please and in a short time were marriedfor see above when one loves ones art no service seems too hard  mr and mrs larrabee began housekeeping in a flat it was a lonesome flatsomething like the a sharp way down at the lefthand end of the keyboard and they were happy for they had their art and they had each other and my advice to the rich young man would besell all thou hast and give it to the poorjanitor for the privilege of living in a flat with your art and your delia  flatdwellers shall indorse my dictum that theirs is the only true happiness if a home is happy it cannot fit too closelet the dresser collapse and become a billiard table let the mantel turn to a rowing machine the escritoire to a spare bedchamber the washstand to an upright piano let the four walls come together if they will so you and your delia are between but if home be the other kind let it be wide and longenter you at the golden gate hang your hat on hatteras your cape on cape horn and go out by the labrador  joe was painting in the class of the great magisteryou know his fame his fees are high his lessons are lighthis highlights have brought him renown delia was studying under rosenstockyou know his repute as a disturber of the piano keys  they were mighty happy as long as their money lasted so is everybut i will not be cynical their aims were very clear and defined joe was to become capable very soon of turning out pictures that old gentlemen with thin sidewhiskers and thick pocketbooks would sandbag one another in his studio for the privilege of buying delia was to become familiar and then contemptuous with music so that when she saw the orchestra seats and boxes unsold she could have sore throat and lobster in a private diningroom and refuse to go on the stage  but the best in my opinion was the home life in the little flatthe ardent voluble chats after the days study the cozy dinners and fresh light breakfasts the interchange of ambitionsambitions interwoven each with the others or else inconsiderablethe mutual help and inspiration andoverlook my artlessnessstuffed olives and cheese sandwiches at 11 pm  but after a while art flagged it sometimes does even if some switchman doesnt flag it everything going out and nothing coming in as the vulgarians say money was lacking to pay mr magister and herr rosenstock their prices when one loves ones art no service seems too hard so delia said she must give music lessons to keep the chafing dish bubbling  for two or three days she went out canvassing for pupils one evening she came home elated  joe dear she said gleefully ive a pupil and oh the loveliest people generalgeneral a b pinkneys daughteron seventyfirst street such a splendid house joeyou ought to see the front door byzantine i think you would call it and inside oh joe i never saw anything like it before  my pupil is his daughter clementina i dearly love her already shes a delicate thingdresses always in white and the sweetest simplest manners only eighteen years old im to give three lessons a week and just think joe 5 a lesson i dont mind it a bit for when i get two or three more pupils i can resume my lessons with herr rosenstock now smooth out that wrinkle between your brows dear and lets have a nice supper  thats all right for you dele said joe attacking a can of peas with a carving knife and a hatchet but how about me do you think im going to let you hustle for wages while i philander in the regions of high art not by the bones of benvenuto cellini i guess i can sell papers or lay cobblestones and bring in a dollar or two  delia came and hung about his neck  joe dear you are silly you must keep on at your studies it is not as if i had quit my music and gone to work at something else while i teach i learn i am always with my music and we can live as happily as millionaires on 15 a week you mustnt think of leaving mr magister  all right said joe reaching for the blue scalloped vegetable dish but i hate for you to be giving lessons it isnt art but youre a trump and a dear to do it  when one loves ones art no service seems too hard said delia  magister praised the sky in that sketch i made in the park said joe and tinkle gave me permission to hang two of them in his window i may sell one if the right kind of a moneyed idiot sees them  im sure you will said delia sweetly and now lets be thankful for gen pinkney and this veal roast  during all of the next week the larrabees had an early breakfast joe was enthusiastic about some morningeffect sketches he was doing in central park and delia packed him off breakfasted coddled praised and kissed at 7 oclock art is an engaging mistress it was most times 7 oclock when he returned in the evening  at the end of the week delia sweetly proud but languid triumphantly tossed three fivedollar bills on the 8x10 inches centre table of the 8x10 feet flat parlour  sometimes she said a little wearily clementina tries me im afraid she doesnt practise enough and i have to tell her the same things so often and then she always dresses entirely in white and that does get monotonous but gen pinkney is the dearest old man i wish you could know him joe he comes in sometimes when i am with clementina at the pianohe is a widower you knowand stands there pulling his white goatee and how are the semiquavers and the demisemiquavers progressing he always asks  i wish you could see the wainscoting in that drawingroom joe and those astrakhan rug portières and clementina has such a funny little cough i hope she is stronger than she looks oh i really am getting attached to her she is so gentle and high bred gen pinkneys brother was once minister to bolivia  and then joe with the air of a monte cristo drew forth a ten a five a two and a oneall legal tender notesand laid them beside delias earnings  sold that watercolour of the obelisk to a man from peoria he announced overwhelmingly  dont joke with me said delia not from peoria  all the way i wish you could see him dele fat man with a woollen muffler and a quill toothpick he saw the sketch in tinkles window and thought it was a windmill at first he was game though and bought it anyhow he ordered anotheran oil sketch of the lackawanna freight depotto take back with him music lessons oh i guess art is still in it  im so glad youve kept on said delia heartily youre bound to win dear thirtythree dollars we never had so much to spend before well have oysters tonight  and filet mignon with champignons said joe where is the olive fork  on the next saturday evening joe reached home first he spread his 18 on the parlour table and washed what seemed to be a great deal of dark paint from his hands  half an hour later delia arrived her right hand tied up in a shapeless bundle of wraps and bandages  how is this asked joe after the usual greetings delia laughed but not very joyously  clementina she explained insisted upon a welsh rabbit after her lesson she is such a queer girl welsh rabbits at 5 in the afternoon the general was there you should have seen him run for the chafing dish joe just as if there wasnt a servant in the house i know clementina isnt in good health she is so nervous in serving the rabbit she spilled a great lot of it boiling hot over my hand and wrist it hurt awfully joe and the dear girl was so sorry but gen pinkneyjoe that old man nearly went distracted he rushed downstairs and sent somebodythey said the furnace man or somebody in the basementout to a drug store for some oil and things to bind it up with it doesnt hurt so much now  whats this asked joe taking the hand tenderly and pulling at some white strands beneath the bandages  its something soft said delia that had oil on it oh joe did you sell another sketch she had seen the money on the table  did i said joe just ask the man from peoria he got his depot today and he isnt sure but he thinks he wants another parkscape and a view on the hudson what time this afternoon did you burn your hand dele  five oclock i think said dele plaintively the ironi mean the rabbit came off the fire about that time you ought to have seen gen pinkney joe when  sit down here a moment dele said joe he drew her to the couch sat beside her and put his arm across her shoulders  what have you been doing for the last two weeks dele he asked  she braved it for a moment or two with an eye full of love and stubbornness and murmured a phrase or two vaguely of gen pinkney but at length down went her head and out came the truth and tears  i couldnt get any pupils she confessed and i couldnt bear to have you give up your lessons and i got a place ironing shirts in that big twentyfourth street laundry and i think i did very well to make up both general pinkney and clementina dont you joe and when a girl in the laundry set down a hot iron on my hand this afternoon i was all the way home making up that story about the welsh rabbit youre not angry are you joe and if i hadnt got the work you mightnt have sold your sketches to that man from peoria  he wasnt from peoria said joe slowly  well it doesnt matter where he was from how clever you are joeandkiss me joeand what made you ever suspect that i wasnt giving music lessons to clementina  i didnt said joe until tonight and i wouldnt have then only i sent up this cotton waste and oil from the engineroom this afternoon for a girl upstairs who had her hand burned with a smoothingiron ive been firing the engine in that laundry for the last two weeks  and then you didnt  my purchaser from peoria said joe and gen pinkney are both creations of the same artbut you wouldnt call it either painting or music  and then they both laughed and joe began  when one loves ones art no service seems  but delia stopped him with her hand on his lips no she saidjust when one loves      the comingout of maggie   every saturday night the clover leaf social club gave a hop in the hall of the give and take athletic association on the east side in order to attend one of these dances you must be a member of the give and takeor if you belong to the division that starts off with the right foot in waltzing you must work in rhinegolds paperbox factory still any clover leaf was privileged to escort or be escorted by an outsider to a single dance but mostly each give and take brought the paperbox girl that he affected and few strangers could boast of having shaken a foot at the regular hops  maggie toole on account of her dull eyes broad mouth and lefthanded style of footwork in the twostep went to the dances with anna mccarty and her fellow anna and maggie worked side by side in the factory and were the greatest chums ever so anna always made jimmy burns take her by maggies house every saturday night so that her friend could go to the dance with them  the give and take athletic association lived up to its name the hall of the association in orchard street was fitted out with musclemaking inventions with the fibres thus builded up the members were wont to engage the police and rival social and athletic organisations in joyous combat between these more serious occupations the saturday night hop with the paperbox factory girls came as a refining influence and as an efficient screen for sometimes the tip went round and if you were among the elect that tiptoed up the dark back stairway you might see as neat and satisfying a little welterweight affair to a finish as ever happened inside the ropes  on saturdays rhinegolds paperbox factory closed at 3 p m on one such afternoon anna and maggie walked homeward together at maggies door anna said as usual be ready at seven sharp mag and jimmy and mell come by for you  but what was this instead of the customary humble and grateful thanks from the nonescorted one there was to be perceived a highpoised head a prideful dimpling at the corners of a broad mouth and almost a sparkle in a dull brown eye  thanks anna said maggie but you and jimmy neednt bother tonight ive a gentleman friend thats coming round to escort me to the hop  the comely anna pounced upon her friend shook her chided and beseeched her maggie toole catch a fellow plain dear loyal unattractive maggie so sweet as a chum so unsought for a twostep or a moonlit bench in the little park how was it when did it happen who was it  youll see tonight said maggie flushed with the wine of the first grapes she had gathered in cupids vineyard hes swell all right hes two inches taller than jimmy and an uptodate dresser ill introduce him anna just as soon as we get to the hall  anna and jimmy were among the first clover leafs to arrive that evening annas eyes were brightly fixed upon the door of the hall to catch the first glimpse of her friends catch  at 830 miss toole swept into the hall with her escort quickly her triumphant eye discovered her chum under the wing of her faithful jimmy  oh gee cried anna mag aint made a hitoh no swell fellow well i guess style look at um  go as far as you like said jimmy with sandpaper in his voice cop him out if you want him these new guys always win out with the push dont mind me he dont squeeze all the limes i guess huh  shut up jimmy you know what i mean im glad for mag first fellow she ever had oh here they come  across the floor maggie sailed like a coquettish yacht convoyed by a stately cruiser and truly her companion justified the encomiums of the faithful chum he stood two inches taller than the average give and take athlete his dark hair curled his eyes and his teeth flashed whenever he bestowed his frequent smiles the young men of the clover leaf club pinned not their faith to the graces of person as much as they did to its prowess its achievements in handtohand conflicts and its preservation from the legal duress that constantly menaced it the member of the association who would bind a paperbox maiden to his conquering chariot scorned to employ beau brummel airs they were not considered honourable methods of warfare the swelling biceps the coat straining at its buttons over the chest the air of conscious conviction of the supereminence of the male in the cosmogony of creation even a calm display of bow legs as subduing and enchanting agents in the gentle tourneys of cupidthese were the approved arms and ammunition of the clover leaf gallants they viewed then genuflexions and alluring poses of this visitor with their chins at a new angle  a friend of mine mr terry osullivan was maggies formula of introduction she led him around the room presenting him to each newarriving clover leaf almost was she pretty now with the unique luminosity in her eyes that comes to a girl with her first suitor and a kitten with its first mouse  maggie tooles got a fellow at last was the word that went round among the paperbox girls pipe mags floorwalkerthus the give and takes expressed their indifferent contempt  usually at the weekly hops maggie kept a spot on the wall warm with her back she felt and showed so much gratitude whenever a selfsacrificing partner invited her to dance that his pleasure was cheapened and diminished she had even grown used to noticing anna joggle the reluctant jimmy with her elbow as a signal for him to invite her chum to walk over his feet through a twostep  but tonight the pumpkin had turned to a coach and six terry osullivan was a victorious prince charming and maggie toole winged her first butterfly flight and though our tropes of fairyland be mixed with those of entomology they shall not spill one drop of ambrosia from the rosecrowned melody of maggies one perfect night  the girls besieged her for introductions to her fellow the clover leaf young men after two years of blindness suddenly perceived charms in miss toole they flexed their compelling muscles before her and bespoke her for the dance  thus she scored but to terry osullivan the honours of the evening fell thick and fast he shook his curls he smiled and went easily through the seven motions for acquiring grace in your own room before an open window ten minutes each day he danced like a faun he introduced manner and style and atmosphere his words came trippingly upon his tongue andhe waltzed twice in succession with the paperbox girl that dempsey donovan brought  dempsey was the leader of the association he wore a dress suit and could chin the bar twice with one hand he was one of big mike osullivans lieutenants and was never troubled by trouble no cop dared to arrest him whenever he broke a pushcart mans head or shot a member of the heinrick b sweeney outing and literary association in the kneecap an officer would drop around and say  the capn d like to see ye a few minutes round to the office whin ye have time dempsey me boy  but there would be sundry gentlemen there with large gold fob chains and black cigars and somebody would tell a funny story and then dempsey would go back and work half an hour with the sixpound dumbbells so doing a tightrope act on a wire stretched across niagara was a safe terpsichorean performance compared with waltzing twice with dempsey donovans paperbox girl at 10 oclock the jolly round face of big mike osullivan shone at the door for five minutes upon the scene he always looked in for five minutes smiled at the girls and handed out real perfectos to the delighted boys  dempsey donovan was at his elbow instantly talking rapidly big mike looked carefully at the dancers smiled shook his head and departed  the music stopped the dancers scattered to the chairs along the walls terry osullivan with his entrancing bow relinquished a pretty girl in blue to her partner and started back to find maggie dempsey intercepted him in the middle of the floor  some fine instinct that rome must have bequeathed to us caused nearly every one to turn and look at themthere was a subtle feeling that two gladiators had met in the arena two or three give and takes with tight coat sleeves drew nearer  one moment mr osullivan said dempsey i hope youre enjoying yourself where did you say you live  the two gladiators were well matched dempsey had perhaps ten pounds of weight to give away the osullivan had breadth with quickness dempsey had a glacial eye a dominating slit of a mouth an indestructible jaw a complexion like a belles and the coolness of a champion the visitor showed more fire in his contempt and less control over his conspicuous sneer they were enemies by the law written when the rocks were molten they were each too splendid too mighty too incomparable to divide preeminence one only must survive  i live on grand said osullivan insolently and no trouble to find me at home where do you live  dempsey ignored the question  you say your names osullivan he went on well big mike says he never saw you before  lots of things he never saw said the favourite of the hop  as a rule went on dempsey huskily sweet osullivans in this district know one another you escorted one of our lady members here and we want a chance to make good if youve got a family tree lets see a few historical osullivan buds come out on it or do you want us to dig it out of you by the roots  suppose you mind your own business suggested osullivan blandly  dempseys eye brightened he held up an inspired forefinger as though a brilliant idea had struck him  ive got it now he said cordially it was just a little mistake you aint no osullivan you are a ringtailed monkey excuse us for not recognising you at first  osullivans eye flashed he made a quick movement but andy geoghan was ready and caught his arm  dempsey nodded at andy and william mcmahan the secretary of the club and walked rapidly toward a door at the rear of the hall two other members of the give and take association swiftly joined the little group terry osullivan was now in the hands of the board of rules and social referees they spoke to him briefly and softly and conducted him out through the same door at the rear  this movement on the part of the clover leaf members requires a word of elucidation back of the association hall was a smaller room rented by the club in this room personal difficulties that arose on the ballroom floor were settled man to man with the weapons of nature under the supervision of the board no lady could say that she had witnessed a fight at a clover leaf hop in several years its gentlemen members guaranteed that  so easily and smoothly had dempsey and the board done their preliminary work that many in the hall had not noticed the checking of the fascinating osullivans social triumph among these was maggie she looked about for her escort  smoke up said rose cassidy wasnt you on demps donovan picked a scrap with your lizzieboy and theyve waltzed out to the slaughter room with him hows my hair look done up this way mag  maggie laid a hand on the bosom of her cheesecloth waist  gone to fight with dempsey she said breathlessly theyve got to be stopped dempsey donovan cant fight him why hellhell kill him  ah what do you care said rosa dont some of em fight every hop  but maggie was off darting her zigzag way through the maze of dancers she burst through the rear door into the dark hall and then threw her solid shoulder against the door of the room of single combat it gave way and in the instant that she entered her eye caught the scenethe board standing about with open watches dempsey donovan in his shirt sleeves dancing lightfooted with the wary grace of the modern pugilist within easy reach of his adversary terry osullivan standing with arms folded and a murderous look in his dark eyes and without slacking the speed of her entrance she leaped forward with a screamleaped in time to catch and hang upon the arm of osullivan that was suddenly uplifted and to whisk from it the long bright stiletto that he had drawn from his bosom  the knife fell and rang upon the floor cold steel drawn in the rooms of the give and take association such a thing had never happened before every one stood motionless for a minute andy geoghan kicked the stiletto with the toe of his shoe curiously like an antiquarian who has come upon some ancient weapon unknown to his learning  and then osullivan hissed something unintelligible between his teeth dempsey and the board exchanged looks and then dempsey looked at osullivan without anger as one looks at a stray dog and nodded his head in the direction of the door  the back stairs giuseppi he said briefly somebodyll pitch your hat down after you  maggie walked up to dempsey donovan there was a brilliant spot of red in her cheeks down which slow tears were running but she looked him bravely in the eye  i knew it dempsey she said as her eyes grew dull even in their tears i knew he was a guinea his names tony spinelli i hurried in when they told me you and him was scrappin them guineas always carries knives but you dont understand dempsey i never had a fellow in my life i got tired of comin with anna and jimmy every night so i fixed it with him to call himself osullivan and brought him along i knew thered be nothin doin for him if he came as a dago i guess ill resign from the club now  dempsey turned to andy geoghan  chuck that cheese slicer out of the window he said and tell em inside that mr osullivan has had a telephone message to go down to tammany hall  and then he turned back to maggie  say mag he said ill see you home and how about next saturday night will you come to the hop with me if i call around for you  it was remarkable how quickly maggies eyes could change from dull to a shining brown  with you dempsey she stammered saywill a duck swim      man about town   there were two or three things that i wanted to know i do not care about a mystery so i began to inquire  it took me two weeks to find out what women carry in dress suit cases and then i began to ask why a mattress is made in two pieces this serious query was at first received with suspicion because it sounded like a conundrum i was at last assured that its double form of construction was designed to make lighter the burden of woman who makes up beds i was so foolish as to persist begging to know why then they were not made in two equal pieces whereupon i was shunned  the third draught that i craved from the fount of knowledge was enlightenment concerning the character known as a man about town he was more vague in my mind than a type should be we must have a concrete idea of anything even if it be an imaginary idea before we can comprehend it now i have a mental picture of john doe that is as clear as a steel engraving his eyes are weak blue he wears a brown vest and a shiny black serge coat he stands always in the sunshine chewing something and he keeps halfshutting his pocket knife and opening it again with his thumb and if the man higher up is ever found take my assurance for it he will be a large pale man with blue wristlets showing under his cuffs and he will be sitting to have his shoes polished within sound of a bowling alley and there will be somewhere about him turquoises  but the canvas of my imagination when it came to limning the man about town was blank i fancied that he had a detachable sneer like the smile of the cheshire cat and attached cuffs and that was all whereupon i asked a newspaper reporter about him  why said he a man about town something between a rounder and a clubman he isnt exactlywell he fits in between mrs fishs receptions and private boxing bouts he doesntwell he doesnt belong either to the lotos club or to the jerry mcgeogheghan galvanised iron workers apprentices left hook chowder association i dont exactly know how to describe him to you youll see him everywhere theres anything doing yes i suppose hes a type dress clothes every evening knows the ropes calls every policeman and waiter in town by their first names no he never travels with the hydrogen derivatives you generally see him alone or with another man  my friend the reporter left me and i wandered further afield by this time the 3126 electric lights on the rialto were alight people passed but they held me not paphian eyes rayed upon me and left me unscathed diners heimgangers shopgirls confidence men panhandlers actors highwaymen millionaires and outlanders hurried skipped strolled sneaked swaggered and scurried by me but i took no note of them i knew them all i had read their hearts they had served i wanted my man about town he was a type and to drop him would be an errora typographbut no let us continue  let us continue with a moral digression to see a family reading the sunday paper gratifies the sections have been separated papa is earnestly scanning the page that pictures the young lady exercising before an open window and bendingbut there there mamma is interested in trying to guess the missing letters in the word nw yok the oldest girls are eagerly perusing the financial reports for a certain young man remarked last sunday night that he had taken a flyer in q x  z willie the eighteenyearold son who attends the new york public school is absorbed in the weekly article describing how to make over an old skirt for he hopes to take a prize in sewing on graduation day  grandma is holding to the comic supplement with a twohours grip and little tottie the baby is rocking along the best she can with the real estate transfers this view is intended to be reassuring for it is desirable that a few lines of this story be skipped for it introduces strong drink  i went into a café toand while it was being mixed i asked the man who grabs up your hot scotch spoon as soon as you lay it down what he understood by the term epithet description designation characterisation or appellation viz a man about town  why said he carefully it means a fly guy thats wise to the allnight pushsee its a hot sport that you cant bump to the rail anywhere between the flatironssee i guess thats about what it means  i thanked him and departed  on the sidewalk a salvation lassie shook her contribution receptacle gently against my waistcoat pocket  would you mind telling me i asked her if you ever meet with the character commonly denominated as a man about town during your daily wanderings  i think i know whom you mean she answered with a gentle smile we see them in the same places night after night they are the devils body guard and if the soldiers of any army are as faithful as they are their commanders are well served we go among them diverting a few pennies from their wickedness to the lords service  she shook the box again and i dropped a dime into it  in front of a glittering hotel a friend of mine a critic was climbing from a cab he seemed at leisure and i put my question to him he answered me conscientiously as i was sure he would  there is a type of man about town in new york he answered the term is quite familiar to me but i dont think i was ever called upon to define the character before it would be difficult to point you out an exact specimen i would say offhand that it is a man who had a hopeless case of the peculiar new york disease of wanting to see and know at 6 oclock each day life begins with him he follows rigidly the conventions of dress and manners but in the business of poking his nose into places where he does not belong he could give pointers to a civet cat or a jackdaw he is the man who has chased bohemia about the town from rathskeller to roof garden and from hester street to harlem until you cant find a place in the city where they dont cut their spaghetti with a knife your man about town has done that he is always on the scent of something new he is curiosity impudence and omnipresence hansoms were made for him and goldbanded cigars and the curse of music at dinner there are not so many of him but his minority report is adopted everywhere  im glad you brought up the subject ive felt the influence of this nocturnal blight upon our city but i never thought to analyse it before i can see now that your man about town should have been classified long ago in his wake spring up wine agents and cloak models and the orchestra plays lets all go up to mauds for him by request instead of händel he makes his rounds every evening while you and i see the elephant once a week when the cigar store is raided he winks at the officer familiar with his ground and walks away immune while you and i search among the presidents for names and among the stars for addresses to give the desk sergeant  my friend the critic paused to acquire breath for fresh eloquence i seized my advantage  you have classified him i cried with joy you have painted his portrait in the gallery of city types but i must meet one face to face i must study the man about town at first hand where shall i find him how shall i know him  without seeming to hear me the critic went on and his cabdriver was waiting for his fare too  he is the sublimated essence of buttin the refined intrinsic extract of rubber the concentrated purified irrefutable unavoidable spirit of curiosity and inquisitiveness a new sensation is the breath in his nostrils when his experience is exhausted he explores new fields with the indefatigability of a  excuse me i interrupted but can you produce one of this type it is a new thing to me i must study it i will search the town over until i find one its habitat must be here on broadway  i am about to dine here said my friend come inside and if there is a man about town present i will point him out to you i know most of the regular patrons here  i am not dining yet i said to him you will excuse me i am going to find my man about town this night if i have to rake new york from the battery to little coney island  i left the hotel and walked down broadway the pursuit of my type gave a pleasant savour of life and interest to the air i breathed i was glad to be in a city so great so complex and diversified leisurely and with something of an air i strolled along with my heart expanding at the thought that i was a citizen of great gotham a sharer in its magnificence and pleasures a partaker in its glory and prestige  i turned to cross the street i heard something buzz like a bee and then i took a long pleasant ride with santosdumont  when i opened my eyes i remembered a smell of gasoline and i said aloud hasnt it passed yet  a hospital nurse laid a hand that was not particularly soft upon my brow that was not at all fevered a young doctor came along grinned and handed me a morning newspaper  want to see how it happened he asked cheerily i read the article its headlines began where i heard the buzzing leave off the night before it closed with these lines  bellevue hospital where it was said that his injuries were not serious he appeared to be a typical man about town      the cop and the anthem  on his bench in madison square soapy moved uneasily when wild geese honk high of nights and when women without sealskin coats grow kind to their husbands and when soapy moves uneasily on his bench in the park you may know that winter is near at hand  a dead leaf fell in soapys lap that was jack frosts card jack is kind to the regular denizens of madison square and gives fair warning of his annual call at the corners of four streets he hands his pasteboard to the north wind footman of the mansion of all outdoors so that the inhabitants thereof may make ready  soapys mind became cognisant of the fact that the time had come for him to resolve himself into a singular committee of ways and means to provide against the coming rigour and therefore he moved uneasily on his bench  the hibernatorial ambitions of soapy were not of the highest in them there were no considerations of mediterranean cruises of soporific southern skies drifting in the vesuvian bay three months on the island was what his soul craved three months of assured board and bed and congenial company safe from boreas and bluecoats seemed to soapy the essence of things desirable  for years the hospitable blackwells had been his winter quarters just as his more fortunate fellow new yorkers had bought their tickets to palm beach and the riviera each winter so soapy had made his humble arrangements for his annual hegira to the island and now the time was come on the previous night three sabbath newspapers distributed beneath his coat about his ankles and over his lap had failed to repulse the cold as he slept on his bench near the spurting fountain in the ancient square so the island loomed big and timely in soapys mind he scorned the provisions made in the name of charity for the citys dependents in soapys opinion the law was more benign than philanthropy there was an endless round of institutions municipal and eleemosynary on which he might set out and receive lodging and food accordant with the simple life but to one of soapys proud spirit the gifts of charity are encumbered if not in coin you must pay in humiliation of spirit for every benefit received at the hands of philanthropy as caesar had his brutus every bed of charity must have its toll of a bath every loaf of bread its compensation of a private and personal inquisition wherefore it is better to be a guest of the law which though conducted by rules does not meddle unduly with a gentlemans private affairs  soapy having decided to go to the island at once set about accomplishing his desire there were many easy ways of doing this the pleasantest was to dine luxuriously at some expensive restaurant and then after declaring insolvency be handed over quietly and without uproar to a policeman an accommodating magistrate would do the rest  soapy left his bench and strolled out of the square and across the level sea of asphalt where broadway and fifth avenue flow together up broadway he turned and halted at a glittering café where are gathered together nightly the choicest products of the grape the silkworm and the protoplasm  soapy had confidence in himself from the lowest button of his vest upward he was shaven and his coat was decent and his neat black readytied fourinhand had been presented to him by a lady missionary on thanksgiving day if he could reach a table in the restaurant unsuspected success would be his the portion of him that would show above the table would raise no doubt in the waiters mind a roasted mallard duck thought soapy would be about the thingwith a bottle of chablis and then camembert a demitasse and a cigar one dollar for the cigar would be enough the total would not be so high as to call forth any supreme manifestation of revenge from the café management and yet the meat would leave him filled and happy for the journey to his winter refuge  but as soapy set foot inside the restaurant door the head waiters eye fell upon his frayed trousers and decadent shoes strong and ready hands turned him about and conveyed him in silence and haste to the sidewalk and averted the ignoble fate of the menaced mallard  soapy turned off broadway it seemed that his route to the coveted island was not to be an epicurean one some other way of entering limbo must be thought of  at a corner of sixth avenue electric lights and cunningly displayed wares behind plateglass made a shop window conspicuous soapy took a cobblestone and dashed it through the glass people came running around the corner a policeman in the lead soapy stood still with his hands in his pockets and smiled at the sight of brass buttons  wheres the man that done that inquired the officer excitedly  dont you figure out that i might have had something to do with it said soapy not without sarcasm but friendly as one greets good fortune  the policemans mind refused to accept soapy even as a clue men who smash windows do not remain to parley with the laws minions they take to their heels the policeman saw a man half way down the block running to catch a car with drawn club he joined in the pursuit soapy with disgust in his heart loafed along twice unsuccessful  on the opposite side of the street was a restaurant of no great pretensions it catered to large appetites and modest purses its crockery and atmosphere were thick its soup and napery thin into this place soapy took his accusive shoes and telltale trousers without challenge at a table he sat and consumed beefsteak flapjacks doughnuts and pie and then to the waiter be betrayed the fact that the minutest coin and himself were strangers  now get busy and call a cop said soapy and dont keep a gentleman waiting  no cop for youse said the waiter with a voice like butter cakes and an eye like the cherry in a manhattan cocktail hey con  neatly upon his left ear on the callous pavement two waiters pitched soapy he arose joint by joint as a carpenters rule opens and beat the dust from his clothes arrest seemed but a rosy dream the island seemed very far away a policeman who stood before a drug store two doors away laughed and walked down the street  five blocks soapy travelled before his courage permitted him to woo capture again this time the opportunity presented what he fatuously termed to himself a cinch a young woman of a modest and pleasing guise was standing before a show window gazing with sprightly interest at its display of shaving mugs and inkstands and two yards from the window a large policeman of severe demeanour leaned against a water plug  it was soapys design to assume the role of the despicable and execrated masher the refined and elegant appearance of his victim and the contiguity of the conscientious cop encouraged him to believe that he would soon feel the pleasant official clutch upon his arm that would insure his winter quarters on the right little tight little isle  soapy straightened the lady missionarys readymade tie dragged his shrinking cuffs into the open set his hat at a killing cant and sidled toward the young woman he made eyes at her was taken with sudden coughs and hems smiled smirked and went brazenly through the impudent and contemptible litany of the masher with half an eye soapy saw that the policeman was watching him fixedly the young woman moved away a few steps and again bestowed her absorbed attention upon the shaving mugs soapy followed boldly stepping to her side raised his hat and said  ah there bedelia dont you want to come and play in my yard  the policeman was still looking the persecuted young woman had but to beckon a finger and soapy would be practically en route for his insular haven already he imagined he could feel the cozy warmth of the stationhouse the young woman faced him and stretching out a hand caught soapys coat sleeve  sure mike she said joyfully if youll blow me to a pail of suds id have spoke to you sooner but the cop was watching  with the young woman playing the clinging ivy to his oak soapy walked past the policeman overcome with gloom he seemed doomed to liberty  at the next corner he shook off his companion and ran he halted in the district where by night are found the lightest streets hearts vows and librettos women in furs and men in greatcoats moved gaily in the wintry air a sudden fear seized soapy that some dreadful enchantment had rendered him immune to arrest the thought brought a little of panic upon it and when he came upon another policeman lounging grandly in front of a transplendent theatre he caught at the immediate straw of disorderly conduct  on the sidewalk soapy began to yell drunken gibberish at the top of his harsh voice he danced howled raved and otherwise disturbed the welkin  the policeman twirled his club turned his back to soapy and remarked to a citizen  tis one of them yale lads celebratin the goose egg they give to the hartford college noisy but no harm weve instructions to lave them be  disconsolate soapy ceased his unavailing racket would never a policeman lay hands on him in his fancy the island seemed an unattainable arcadia he buttoned his thin coat against the chilling wind  in a cigar store he saw a welldressed man lighting a cigar at a swinging light his silk umbrella he had set by the door on entering soapy stepped inside secured the umbrella and sauntered off with it slowly the man at the cigar light followed hastily  my umbrella he said sternly  oh is it sneered soapy adding insult to petit larceny well why dont you call a policeman i took it your umbrella why dont you call a cop there stands one on the corner  the umbrella owner slowed his steps soapy did likewise with a presentiment that luck would again run against him the policeman looked at the two curiously  of course said the umbrella manthat iswell you know how these mistakes occuriif its your umbrella i hope youll excuse mei picked it up this morning in a restaurantif you recognise it as yours whyi hope youll  of course its mine said soapy viciously  the exumbrella man retreated the policeman hurried to assist a tall blonde in an opera cloak across the street in front of a street car that was approaching two blocks away  soapy walked eastward through a street damaged by improvements he hurled the umbrella wrathfully into an excavation he muttered against the men who wear helmets and carry clubs because he wanted to fall into their clutches they seemed to regard him as a king who could do no wrong  at length soapy reached one of the avenues to the east where the glitter and turmoil was but faint he set his face down this toward madison square for the homing instinct survives even when the home is a park bench  but on an unusually quiet corner soapy came to a standstill here was an old church quaint and rambling and gabled through one violetstained window a soft light glowed where no doubt the organist loitered over the keys making sure of his mastery of the coming sabbath anthem for there drifted out to soapys ears sweet music that caught and held him transfixed against the convolutions of the iron fence  the moon was above lustrous and serene vehicles and pedestrians were few sparrows twittered sleepily in the eavesfor a little while the scene might have been a country churchyard and the anthem that the organist played cemented soapy to the iron fence for he had known it well in the days when his life contained such things as mothers and roses and ambitions and friends and immaculate thoughts and collars  the conjunction of soapys receptive state of mind and the influences about the old church wrought a sudden and wonderful change in his soul he viewed with swift horror the pit into which he had tumbled the degraded days unworthy desires dead hopes wrecked faculties and base motives that made up his existence  and also in a moment his heart responded thrillingly to this novel mood an instantaneous and strong impulse moved him to battle with his desperate fate he would pull himself out of the mire he would make a man of himself again he would conquer the evil that had taken possession of him there was time he was comparatively young yet he would resurrect his old eager ambitions and pursue them without faltering those solemn but sweet organ notes had set up a revolution in him tomorrow he would go into the roaring downtown district and find work a fur importer had once offered him a place as driver he would find him tomorrow and ask for the position he would be somebody in the world he would  soapy felt a hand laid on his arm he looked quickly around into the broad face of a policeman  what are you doin here asked the officer  nothin said soapy  then come along said the policeman  three months on the island said the magistrate in the police court the next morning      an adjustment of nature   in an art exhibition the other day i saw a painting that had been sold for 5000 the painter was a young scrub out of the west named kraft who had a favourite food and a pet theory his pabulum was an unquenchable belief in the unerring artistic adjustment of nature his theory was fixed around cornedbeef hash with poached egg there was a story behind the picture so i went home and let it drip out of a fountainpen the idea of kraftbut that is not the beginning of the story  three years ago kraft bill judkins a poet and i took our meals at cyphers on eighth avenue i say took when we had money cypher got it off of us as he expressed it we had no credit we went in called for food and ate it we paid or we did not pay we had confidence in cyphers sullenness and smouldering ferocity deep down in his sunless soul he was either a prince a fool or an artist he sat at a wormeaten desk covered with files of waiters checks so old that i was sure the bottomest one was for clams that hendrik hudson had eaten and paid for cypher had the power in common with napoleon iii and the goggleeyed perch of throwing a film over his eyes rendering opaque the windows of his soul once when we left him unpaid with egregious excuses i looked back and saw him shaking with inaudible laughter behind his film now and then we paid up back scores  but the chief thing at cyphers was milly milly was a waitress she was a grand example of krafts theory of the artistic adjustment of nature she belonged largely to waiting as minerva did to the art of scrapping or venus to the science of serious flirtation pedestalled and in bronze she might have stood with the noblest of her heroic sisters as liverandbacon enlivening the world she belonged to cyphers you expected to see her colossal figure loom through that reeking blue cloud of smoke from frying fat just as you expect the palisades to appear through a drifting hudson river fog there amid the steam of vegetables and the vapours of acres of ham and the crash of crockery the clatter of steel the screaming of short orders the cries of the hungering and all the horrid tumult of feeding man surrounded by swarms of the buzzing winged beasts bequeathed us by pharaoh milly steered her magnificent way like some great liner cleaving among the canoes of howling savages  our goddess of grub was built on lines so majestic that they could be followed only with awe her sleeves were always rolled above her elbows she could have taken us three musketeers in her two hands and dropped us out of the window she had seen fewer years than any of us but she was of such superb evehood and simplicity that she mothered us from the beginning cyphers store of eatables she poured out upon us with royal indifference to price and quantity as from a cornucopia that knew no exhaustion her voice rang like a great silver bell her smile was manytoothed and frequent she seemed like a yellow sunrise on mountain tops i never saw her but i thought of the yosemite and yet somehow i could never think of her as existing outside of cyphers there nature had placed her and she had taken root and grown mightily she seemed happy and took her few poor dollars on saturday nights with the flushed pleasure of a child that receives an unexpected donation  it was kraft who first voiced the fear that each of us must have held latently it came up apropos of course of certain questions of art at which we were hammering one of us compared the harmony existing between a haydn symphony and pistache ice cream to the exquisite congruity between milly and cyphers  there is a certain fate hanging over milly said kraft and if it overtakes her she is lost to cyphers and to us  she will grow fat asked judkins fearsomely  she will go to night school and become refined i ventured anxiously  it is this said kraft punctuating in a puddle of spilled coffee with a stiff forefinger caesar had his brutusthe cotton has its bollworm the chorus girl has her pittsburger the summer boarder has his poison ivy the hero has his carnegie medal art has its morgan the rose has its  speak i interrupted much perturbed you do not think that milly will begin to lace  one day concluded kraft solemnly there will come to cyphers for a plate of beans a millionaire lumberman from wisconsin and he will marry milly  never exclaimed judkins and i in horror  a lumberman repeated kraft hoarsely  and a millionaire lumberman i sighed despairingly  from wisconsin groaned judkins  we agreed that the awful fate seemed to menace her few things were less improbable milly like some vast virgin stretch of pine woods was made to catch the lumbermans eye and well we knew the habits of the badgers once fortune smiled upon them straight to new york they hie and lay their goods at the feet of the girl who serves them beans in a beanery why the alphabet itself connives the sunday newspapers headliners work is cut for him  winsome waitress wins wealthy wisconsin woodsman  for a while we felt that milly was on the verge of being lost to us  it was our love of the unerring artistic adjustment of nature that inspired us we could not give her over to a lumberman doubly accursed by wealth and provincialism we shuddered to think of milly with her voice modulated and her elbows covered pouring tea in the marble teepee of a tree murderer no in cyphers she belongedin the bacon smoke the cabbage perfume the grand wagnerian chorus of hurled ironstone china and rattling casters  our fears must have been prophetic for on that same evening the wildwood discharged upon us millys preordained confiscatorour fee to adjustment and order but alaska and not wisconsin bore the burden of the visitation  we were at our supper of beef stew and dried apples when he trotted in as if on the heels of a dog team and made one of the mess at our table with the freedom of the camps he assaulted our ears and claimed the fellowship of men lost in the wilds of a hash house we embraced him as a specimen and in three minutes we had all but died for one another as friends  he was rugged and bearded and winddried he had just come off the trail he said at one of the north river ferries i fancied i could see the snow dust of chilcoot yet powdering his shoulders and then he strewed the table with the nuggets stuffed ptarmigans bead work and seal pelts of the returned klondiker and began to prate to us of his millions  bank drafts for two millions was his summing up and a thousand a day piling up from my claims and now i want some beef stew and canned peaches i never got off the train since i mushed out of seattle and im hungry the stuff the niggers feed you on pullmans dont count you gentlemen order what you want  and then milly loomed up with a thousand dishes on her bare armloomed up big and white and pink and awful as mount saint eliaswith a smile like day breaking in a gulch and the klondiker threw down his pelts and nuggets as dross and let his jaw fall halfway and stared at her you could almost see the diamond tiaras on millys brow and the handembroidered silk paris gowns that he meant to buy for her  at last the bollworm had attacked the cottonthe poison ivy was reaching out its tendrils to entwine the summer boarderthe millionaire lumberman thinly disguised as the alaskan miner was about to engulf our milly and upset natures adjustment  kraft was the first to act he leaped up and pounded the klondikers back come out and drink he shouted drink first and eat afterward judkins seized one arm and i the other gaily roaringly irresistibly in jollygoodfellow style we dragged him from the restaurant to a café stuffing his pockets with his embalmed birds and indigestible nuggets  there he rumbled a roughly goodhumoured protest thats the girl for my money he declared she can eat out of my skillet the rest of her life why i never see such a fine girl im going back there and ask her to marry me i guess she wont want to sling hash any more when she sees the pile of dust ive got  youll take another whiskey and milk now kraft persuaded with satans smile i thought you upcountry fellows were better sports  kraft spent his puny store of coin at the bar and then gave judkins and me such an appealing look that we went down to the last dime we had in toasting our guest  then when our ammunition was gone and the klondiker still somewhat sober began to babble again of milly kraft whispered into his ear such a polite barbed insult relating to people who were miserly with their funds that the miner crashed down handful after handful of silver and notes calling for all the fluids in the world to drown the imputation  thus the work was accomplished with his own guns we drove him from the field and then we had him carted to a distant small hotel and put to bed with his nuggets and baby sealskins stuffed around him  he will never find cyphers again said kraft he will propose to the first white apron he sees in a dairy restaurant tomorrow and millyi mean the natural adjustmentis saved  and back to cyphers went we three and finding customers scarce we joined hands and did an indian dance with milly in the centre  this i say happened three years ago and about that time a little luck descended upon us three and we were enabled to buy costlier and less wholesome food than cyphers our paths separated and i saw kraft no more and judkins seldom  but as i said i saw a painting the other day that was sold for 5000 the title was boadicea and the figure seemed to fill all outofdoors but of all the pictures admirers who stood before it i believe i was the only one who longed for boadicea to stalk from her frame bringing me cornedbeef hash with poached egg  i hurried away to see kraft his satanic eyes were the same his hair was worse tangled but his clothes had been made by a tailor  i didnt know i said to him  weve bought a cottage in the bronx with the money said he any evening at 7  then said i when you led us against the lumbermantheklondiker it wasnt altogether on account of the unerring artistic adjustment of nature  well not altogether said kraft with a grin      memoirs of a yellow dog   i dont suppose it will knock any of you people off your perch to read a contribution from an animal mr kipling and a good many others have demonstrated the fact that animals can express themselves in remunerative english and no magazine goes to press nowadays without an animal story in it except the oldstyle monthlies that are still running pictures of bryan and the mont pelée horror

cheap new york flat sleeping in a corner on an old sateen underskirt the one she spilled port wine on at the lady longshoremens banquet mustnt be expected to perform any tricks with the art of speech  i was born a yellow pup date locality pedigree and weight unknown the first thing i can recollect an old woman had me in a basket at broadway and twentythird trying to sell me to a fat lady old mother hubbard was boosting me to beat the band as a genuine pomeranianhambletonianredirishcochinchinastokepogis fox terrier the fat lady chased a v around among the samples of gros grain flannelette in her shopping bag till she cornered it and gave up from that moment i was a peta mammas own wootsey squidlums say gentle reader did you ever have a 200pound woman breathing a flavour of camembert cheese

yellow pup i grew up to be an anonymous yellow cur looking like a cross between an angora cat and a box of lemons but my mistress never tumbled she thought that the two primeval pups that noah chased into the ark were but a collateral branch of my ancestors it took two policemen to keep her from entering me at the madison square garden for the siberian bloodhound prize  ill tell you about that flat the house was the ordinary thing in new york paved with parian marble in the entrance hall and cobblestones above the first floor our fiat was threewell not flightsclimbs up my mistress rented it unfurnished and put in the regular things1903 antique unholstered parlour set oil chromo of geishas in a harlem tea house rubber plant and husband  by sirius there was a biped i felt sorry for he was a little man with sandy hair and whiskers a good deal like mine henpeckedwell toucans and flamingoes and pelicans all had their bills in him he wiped the dishes and listened to my mistress tell about the cheap ragged things the lady with the squirrelskin coat on the second floor hung out on her line to dry and every evening while she was getting supper she made him take me out on the end of a string for a walk  if men knew how women pass the time when they are alone theyd never marry laura lean jibbey peanut brittle a little almond cream on the neck muscles dishes unwashed half an hours

about all there is to it twenty minutes before time for him to come home from work she straightens up the house fixes her rat so it wont show and gets out a lot of sewing for a tenminute bluff  i led a dogs life in that flat most all day i lay there in my corner watching that fat woman kill time i slept sometimes and had pipe dreams about being out chasing cats into basements and growling at old ladies with black mittens as a dog was intended to do then she would pounce upon me with a lot of that drivelling poodle palaver and kiss me on the nosebut what could i do a dog cant chew cloves  i began to feel sorry for hubby dog my cats if i didnt we looked so much alike that people noticed it when we went out so we shook the streets that morgans cab drives down and took to climbing the piles of last decembers snow on the streets where cheap people live  one evening when we were thus promenading and i was trying to look like a prize st bernard and the old man was trying to look like he wouldnt have murdered the first organgrinder he heard play mendelssohns weddingmarch i looked up at him and said in my way  what are you looking so sour about you oakum trimmed lobster she dont kiss you you dont have to sit on her lap and listen to talk that would make the book of a musical comedy sound like the maxims of epictetus you ought to be thankful youre not a dog brace up benedick and bid the blues begone  the matrimonial mishap looked down at me with almost canine intelligence in his face  why doggie says he good doggie you almost look like you could speak what is it doggiecats  cats could speak  but of course he couldnt understand humans were denied the speech of animals the only common ground of communication upon which dogs and men can get together is in fiction  in the flat across the hall from us lived a lady with a blackandtan terrier her husband strung it and took it out every evening but he always came home cheerful and whistling one day i touched noses with the blackandtan in the hall and i struck him for an elucidation  see here wiggleandskip i says you know that it aint the nature of a real man to play dry nurse to a dog in public i never saw one leashed to a bowwow yet that didnt look like hed like to lick every other man that looked at him but your boss comes in every day as perky and set up as an amateur prestidigitator doing the egg trick how does he do it dont tell me he likes it  him says the blackandtan why he uses natures own remedy he gets spifflicated at first when we go out hes as shy as the man on the steamer who would rather play pedro when they make em all jackpots by the time weve been in eight saloons he dont care whether the thing on the end of his line is a dog or a catfish ive lost two inches of my tail trying to sidestep those swinging doors  the pointer i got from that terriervaudeville please copyset me to thinking  one evening about 6 oclock my mistress ordered him to get busy and do the ozone act for lovey i have concealed it until now but that is what she called me the blackandtan was called tweetness i consider that i have the bulge on him as far as you could chase a rabbit still lovey is something of a nomenclatural tin can on the tail of ones self respect  at a quiet place on a safe street i tightened the line of my custodian in front of an attractive refined saloon i made a deadahead scramble for the doors whining like a dog in the press despatches that lets the family know that little alice is bogged while gathering lilies in the brook  why darn my eyes says the old man with a grin darn my eyes if the saffroncoloured son of a seltzer lemonade aint asking me in to take a drink lemme seehow longs it been since i saved shoe leather by keeping one foot on the footrest i believe ill  i knew i had him hot scotches he took sitting at a table for an hour he kept the campbells coming i sat by his side rapping for the waiter with my tail and eating free lunch such as mamma in her flat never equalled with her homemade truck bought at a delicatessen store eight minutes before papa comes home  when the products of scotland were all exhausted except the rye bread the old man unwound me from the table leg and played me outside like a fisherman plays a salmon out there he took off my collar and threw it into the street  poor doggie says he good doggie she shant kiss you any more s a darned shame good doggie go away and get run over by a street car and be happy  i refused to leave i leaped and frisked around the old mans legs happy as a pug on a rug  you old fleaheaded woodchuckchaser i said to himyou moonbaying rabbitpointing eggstealing old beagle cant you see that i dont want to leave you cant you see that were both pups in the wood and the missis is the cruel uncle after you with the dish towel and me with the flea liniment and a pink bow to tie on my tail why not cut that all out and be pards forever more  maybe youll say he didnt understandmaybe he didnt but he kind of got a grip on the hot scotches and stood still for a minute thinking  doggie says he finally we dont live more than a dozen lives on this earth and very few of us live to be more than 300 if i ever see that flat any more im a flat and if you do youre flatter and thats no flattery im offering 60 to 1 that westward ho wins out by the length of a dachshund  there was no string but i frolicked along with my master to the twentythird street ferry and the cats on the route saw reason to give thanks that prehensile claws had been given them  on the jersey side my master said to a stranger who stood eating a currant bun  me and my doggie we are bound for the rocky mountains  but what pleased me most was when my old man pulled both of my ears until i howled and said  you common monkeyheaded rattailed sulphurcoloured son of a door mat do you know what im going to call you  i thought of lovey and i whined dolefully  im going to call you pete says my master and if id had five tails i couldnt have done enough wagging to do justice to the occasion      the lovephiltre of ikey schoenstein  the blue light drug store is downtown between the bowery and first avenue where the distance between the two streets is the shortest the blue light does not consider that pharmacy is a thing of bricabrac scent and icecream soda if you ask it for painkiller it will not give you a bonbon  the blue light scorns the laboursaving arts of modern pharmacy it macerates its opium and percolates its own laudanum and paregoric to this day pills are made behind its tall prescription deskpills rolled out on its own pilltile divided with a spatula rolled with the finger and thumb dusted with calcined magnesia and delivered in little round pasteboard pillboxes the store is on a corner about which coveys of raggedplumed hilarious children play and become candidates for the cough drops and soothing syrups that wait for them inside  ikey schoenstein was the night clerk of the blue light and the friend of his customers thus it is on the east side where the heart of pharmacy is not glacé there as it should be the druggist is a counsellor a confessor an adviser an able and willing missionary and mentor whose learning is respected whose occult wisdom is venerated and whose medicine is often poured untasted into the gutter therefore ikeys corniform bespectacled nose and narrow knowledgebowed figure was well known in the vicinity of the blue light and his advice and notice were much desired  ikey roomed and breakfasted at mrs riddles two squares away mrs riddle had a daughter named rosy the circumlocution has been in vainyou must have guessed itikey adored rosy she tinctured all his thoughts she was the compound extract of all that was chemically pure and officinalthe dispensatory contained nothing equal to her but ikey was timid and his hopes remained insoluble in the menstruum of his backwardness and fears behind his counter he was a superior being calmly conscious of special knowledge and worth outside he was a weakkneed purblind motormancursed rambler with illfitting clothes stained with chemicals and smelling of socotrine aloes and valerianate of ammonia  the fly in ikeys ointment thrice welcome pat trope was chunk mcgowan  mr mcgowan was also striving to catch the bright smiles tossed about by rosy but he was no outfielder as ikey was he picked them off the bat at the same time he was ikeys friend and customer and often dropped in at the blue light drug store to have a bruise painted with iodine or get a cut rubberplastered after a pleasant evening spent along the bowery  one afternoon mcgowan drifted in in his silent easy way and sat comely smoothfaced hard indomitable goodnatured upon a stool  ikey said he when his friend had fetched his mortar and sat opposite grinding gum benzoin to a powder get busy with your ear its drugs for me if youve got the line i need  ikey scanned the countenance of mr mcgowan for the usual evidences of conflict but found none  take your coat off he ordered i guess already that you have been stuck in the ribs with a knife i have many times told you those dagoes would do you up  mr mcgowan smiled not them he said not any dagoes but youve located the diagnosis all right enoughits under my coat near the ribs say ikeyrosy and me are goin to run away and get married tonight  ikeys left forefinger was doubled over the edge of the mortar holding it steady he gave it a wild rap with the pestle but felt it not meanwhile mr mcgowans smile faded to a look of perplexed gloom  that is he continued if she keeps in the notion until the time comes weve been layin pipes for the getaway for two weeks one day she says she will the same evenin she says nixy weve agreed on tonight and rosys stuck to the affirmative this time for two whole days but its five hours yet till the time and im afraid shell stand me up when it comes to the scratch  you said you wanted drugs remarked ikey  mr mcgowan looked ill at ease and harasseda condition opposed to his usual line of demeanour he made a patentmedicine almanac into a roll and fitted it with unprofitable carefulness about his finger  i wouldnt have this double handicap make a false start tonight for a million he said ive got a little flat up in harlem all ready with chrysanthemums on the table and a kettle ready to boil and ive engaged a pulpit pounder to be ready at his house for us at 930 its got to come off and if rosy dont change her mind againmr mcgowan ceased a prey to his doubts  i dont see then yet said ikey shortly what makes it that you talk of drugs or what i can be doing about it  old man riddle dont like me a little bit went on the uneasy suitor bent upon marshalling his arguments for a week he hasnt let rosy step outside the door with me if it wasnt for losin a boarder theyd have bounced me long ago im makin 20 a week and shell never regret flyin the coop with chunk mcgowan  you will excuse me chunk said ikey i must make a prescription that is to be called for soon  say said mcgowan looking up suddenly say ikey aint there a drug of some kindsome kind of powders thatll make a girl like you better if you give em to her  ikeys lip beneath his nose curled with the scorn of superior enlightenment but before he could answer mcgowan continued  tim lacy told me he got some once from a croaker uptown and fed em to his girl in soda water from the very first dose he was acehigh and everybody else looked like thirty cents to her they was married in less than two weeks  strong and simple was chunk mcgowan a better reader of men than ikey was could have seen that his tough frame was strung upon fine wires like a good general who was about to invade the enemys territory he was seeking to guard every point against possible failure  i thought went on chunk hopefully that if i had one of them powders to give rosy when i see her at supper tonight it might brace her up and keep her from reneging on the proposition to skip i guess she dont need a mule team to drag her away but women are better at coaching than they are at running bases if the stuffll work just for a couple of hours itll do the trick  when is this foolishness of running away to be happening asked ikey  nine oclock said mr mcgowan suppers at seven at eight rosy goes to bed with a headache at nine old parvenzano lets me through to his back yard where theres a board off riddles fence next door i go under her window and help her down the fireescape weve got to make it early on the preachers account its all dead easy if rosy dont balk when the flag drops can you fix me one of them powders ikey  ikey schoenstein rubbed his nose slowly  chunk said he it is of drugs of that nature that pharmaceutists must have much carefulness to you alone of my acquaintance would i intrust a powder like that but for you i shall make it and you shall see how it makes rosy to think of you  ikey went behind the prescription desk there he crushed to a powder two soluble tablets each containing a quarter of a grain of morphia to them he added a little sugar of milk to increase the bulk and folded the mixture neatly in a white paper taken by an adult this powder would insure several hours of heavy slumber without danger to the sleeper this he handed to chunk mcgowan telling him to administer it in a liquid if possible and received the hearty thanks of the backyard lochinvar  the subtlety of ikeys action becomes apparent upon recital of his subsequent move he sent a messenger for mr riddle and disclosed the plans of mr mcgowan for eloping with rosy mr riddle was a stout man brickdusty of complexion and sudden in action  much obliged he said briefly to ikey the lazy irish loafer my own rooms just above rosys ill just go up there myself after supper and load the shotgun and wait if he comes in my back yard hell go away in a ambulance instead of a bridal chaise  with rosy held in the clutches of morpheus for a manyhours deep slumber and the bloodthirsty parent waiting armed and forewarned ikey felt that his rival was close indeed upon discomfiture  all night in the blue light drug store he waited at his duties for chance news of the tragedy but none came  at eight oclock in the morning the day clerk arrived and ikey started hurriedly for mrs riddles to learn the outcome and lo as he stepped out of the store who but chunk mcgowan sprang from a passing street car and grasped his handchunk mcgowan with a victors smile and flushed with joy  pulled it off said chunk with elysium in his grin rosy hit the fireescape on time to a second and we was under the wire at the reverends at 93o 14 shes up at the flatshe cooked eggs this mornin in a blue kimonolord how lucky i am you must pace up some day ikey and feed with us ive got a job down near the bridge and thats where im heading for now  thethepowder stammered ikey  oh that stuff you gave me said chunk broadening his grin well it was this way i sat down at the supper table last night at riddles and i looked at rosy and i says to myself chunk if you get the girl get her on the squaredont try any hocuspocus with a thoroughbred like her and i keeps the paper you give me in my pocket and then my lamps fall on another party present who i says to myself is failin in a proper affection toward his comin soninlaw so i watches my chance and dumps that powder in old man riddles coffeesee      mammon and the archer   old anthony rockwall retired manufacturer and proprietor of rockwalls eureka soap looked out the library window of his fifth avenue mansion and grinned his neighbour to the rightthe aristocratic clubman g van schuylight suffolkjonescame out to his waiting motorcar wrinkling a contumelious nostril as usual at the italian renaissance sculpture of the soap palaces front elevation  stuckup old statuette of nothing doing commented the exsoap king the eden museell get that old frozen nesselrode yet if he dont watch out ill have this house painted red white and blue next summer and see if thatll make his dutch nose turn up any higher  and then anthony rockwall who never cared for bells went to the door of his library and shouted mike in the same voice that had once chipped off pieces of the welkin on the kansas prairies  tell my son said anthony to the answering menial to come in here before he leaves the house  when young rockwall entered the library the old man laid aside his newspaper looked at him with a kindly grimness on his big smooth ruddy countenance rumpled his mop of white hair with one hand and rattled the keys in his pocket with the other  richard said anthony rockwall what do you pay for the soap that you use  richard only six months home from college was startled a little he had not yet taken the measure of this sire of his who was as full of unexpectednesses as a girl at her first party  six dollars a dozen i think dad  and your clothes  i suppose about sixty dollars as a rule  youre a gentleman said anthony decidedly ive heard of these young bloods spending 24 a dozen for soap and going over the hundred mark for clothes youve got as much money to waste as any of em and yet you stick to whats decent and moderate now i use the old eurekanot only for sentiment but its the purest soap made whenever you pay more than 10 cents a cake for soap you buy bad perfumes and labels but 50 cents is doing very well for a young man in your generation position and condition as i said youre a gentleman they say it takes three generations to make one theyre off moneyll do it as slick as soap grease its made you one by hokey its almost made one of me im nearly as impolite and disagreeable and illmannered as these two old knickerbocker gents on each side of me that cant sleep of nights because i bought in between em  there are some things that money cant accomplish remarked young rockwall rather gloomily  now dont say that said old anthony shocked i bet my money on money every time ive been through the encyclopaedia down to y looking for something you cant buy with it and i expect to have to take up the appendix next week im for money against the field tell me something money wont buy  for one thing answered richard rankling a little it wont buy one into the exclusive circles of society  oho wont it thundered the champion of the root of evil you tell me where your exclusive circles would be if the first astor hadnt had the money to pay for his steerage passage over  richard sighed  and thats what i was coming to said the old man less boisterously thats why i asked you to come in theres something going wrong with you boy ive been noticing it for two weeks out with it i guess i could lay my hands on eleven millions within twentyfour hours besides the real estate if its your liver theres the rambler down in the bay coaled and ready to steam down to the bahamas in two days  not a bad guess dad you havent missed it far  ah said anthony keenly whats her name  richard began to walk up and down the library floor there was enough comradeship and sympathy in this crude old father of his to draw his confidence  why dont you ask her demanded old anthony shell jump at you youve got the money and the looks and youre a decent boy your hands are clean youve got no eureka soap on em youve been to college but shell overlook that  i havent had a chance said richard  make one said anthony take her for a walk in the park or a straw ride or walk home with her from church chance pshaw  you dont know the social mill dad shes part of the stream that turns it every hour and minute of her time is arranged for days in advance i must have that girl dad or this town is a blackjack swamp forevermore and i cant write iti cant do that  tut said the old man do you mean to tell me that with all the money ive got you cant get an hour or two of a girls time for yourself  ive put it off too late shes going to sail for europe at noon day after tomorrow for a two years stay im to see her alone tomorrow evening for a few minutes shes at larchmont now at her aunts i cant go there but im allowed to meet her with a cab at the grand central station tomorrow evening at the 830 train we drive down broadway to wallacks at a gallop where her mother and a box party will be waiting for us in the lobby do you think she would listen to a declaration from me during that six or eight minutes under those circumstances no and what chance would i have in the theatre or afterward none no dad this is one tangle that your money cant unravel we cant buy one minute of time with cash if we could rich people would live longer theres no hope of getting a talk with miss lantry before she sails  all right richard my boy said old anthony cheerfully you may run along down to your club now im glad it aint your liver but dont forget to burn a few punk sticks in the joss house to the great god mazuma from time to time you say money wont buy time well of course you cant order eternity wrapped up and delivered at your residence for a price but ive seen father time get pretty bad stone bruises on his heels when he walked through the gold diggings  that night came aunt ellen gentle sentimental wrinkled sighing oppressed by wealth in to brother anthony at his evening paper and began discourse on the subject of lovers woes  he told me all about it said brother anthony yawning i told him my bank account was at his service and then he began to knock money said money couldnt help said the rules of society couldnt be bucked for a yard by a team of tenmillionaires  oh anthony sighed aunt ellen i wish you would not think so much of money wealth is nothing where a true affection is concerned love is allpowerful if he only had spoken earlier she could not have refused our richard but now i fear it is too late he will have no opportunity to address her all your gold cannot bring happiness to your son  at eight oclock the next evening aunt ellen took a quaint old gold ring from a motheaten case and gave it to richard  wear it tonight nephew she begged your mother gave it to me good luck in love she said it brought she asked me to give it to you when you had found the one you loved  young rockwall took the ring reverently and tried it on his smallest finger it slipped as far as the second joint and stopped he took it off and stuffed it into his vest pocket after the manner of man and then he phoned for his cab  at the station he captured miss lantry out of the gadding mob at eight thirtytwo  we mustnt keep mamma and the others waiting said she  to wallacks theatre as fast as you can drive said richard loyally  they whirled up fortysecond to broadway and then down the whitestarred lane that leads from the soft meadows of sunset to the rocky hills of morning  at thirtyfourth street young richard quickly thrust up the trap and ordered the cabman to stop  ive dropped a ring he apologised as he climbed out it was my mothers and id hate to lose it i wont detain you a minutei saw where it fell  in less than a minute he was back in the cab with the ring  but within that minute a crosstown car had stopped directly in front of the cab the cabman tried to pass to the left but a heavy express wagon cut him off he tried the right and had to back away from a furniture van that had no business to be there he tried to back out but dropped his reins and swore dutifully he was blockaded in a tangled mess of vehicles and horses  one of those street blockades had occurred that sometimes tie up commerce and movement quite suddenly in the big city  why dont you drive on said miss lantry impatiently well be late  richard stood up in the cab and looked around he saw a congested flood of wagons trucks cabs vans and street cars filling the vast space where broadway sixth avenue and thirtyfourth street cross one another as a twentysix inch maiden fills her twentytwo inch girdle and still from all the cross streets they were hurrying and rattling toward the converging point at full speed and hurling themselves into the struggling mass locking wheels and adding their drivers imprecations to the clamour the entire traffic of manhattan seemed to have jammed itself around them the oldest new yorker among the thousands of spectators that lined the sidewalks had not witnessed a street blockade of the proportions of this one  im very sorry said richard as he resumed his seat but it looks as if we are stuck they wont get this jumble loosened up in an hour it was my fault if i hadnt dropped the ring we  let me see the ring said miss lantry now that it cant be helped i dont care i think theatres are stupid anyway  at 11 oclock that night somebody tapped lightly on anthony rockwalls door  come in shouted anthony who was in a red dressinggown reading a book of piratical adventures  somebody was aunt ellen looking like a greyhaired angel that had been left on earth by mistake  theyre engaged anthony she said softly she has promised to marry our richard on their way to the theatre there was a street blockade and it was two hours before their cab could get out of it  and oh brother anthony dont ever boast of the power of money again a little emblem of true lovea little ring that symbolised unending and unmercenary affectionwas the cause of our richard finding his happiness he dropped it in the street and got out to recover it and before they could continue the blockade occurred he spoke to his love and won her there while the cab was hemmed in money is dross compared with true love anthony  all right said old anthony im glad the boy has got what he wanted i told him i wouldnt spare any expense in the matter if  but brother anthony what good could your money have done  sister said anthony rockwall ive got my pirate in a devil of a scrape his ship has just been scuttled and hes too good a judge of the value of money to let drown i wish you would let me go on with this chapter  the story should end here i wish it would as heartily as you who read it wish it did but we must go to the bottom of the well for truth  the next day a person with red hands and a blue polkadot necktie who called himself kelly called at anthony rockwalls house and was at once received in the library  well said anthony reaching for his chequebook it was a good bilin of soap lets seeyou had 5000 in cash  i paid out 300 more of my own said kelly i had to go a little above the estimate i got the express wagons and cabs mostly for 5 but the trucks and twohorse teams mostly raised me to 10 the motormen wanted 10 and some of the loaded teams 20 the cops struck me hardest50 i paid two and the rest 20 and 25 but didnt it work beautiful mr rockwall im glad william a brady wasnt onto that little outdoor vehicle mob scene i wouldnt want

march  never never begin a story this way when you write one no opening could possibly be worse it is unimaginative flat dry and likely to consist of mere wind but in this instance it is allowable for the following paragraph which should have inaugurated the narrative is too wildly extravagant and preposterous to be flaunted in the face of the reader without preparation  sarah was crying over her bill of fare  think of a new york girl shedding tears on the menu card  to account for this you will be allowed to guess that the lobsters were all out or that she had sworn icecream off during lent or that she had ordered onions or that she had just come from a hackett matinee and then all these theories being wrong you will please let the story proceed  the gentleman who announced that the world was an oyster which he with his sword would open made a larger hit than he deserved it is not difficult to open an oyster with a sword but did you ever notice any one try to open the terrestrial bivalve with a typewriter like to wait for a dozen raw opened that way  sarah had managed to pry apart the shells with her unhandy weapon far enough to nibble a wee bit at the cold and clammy world within she knew no more shorthand than if she had been a graduate in stenography just let slip upon the world by a business college so not being able to stenog she could not enter that bright galaxy of office talent she was a freelance typewriter and canvassed for odd jobs of copying  the most brilliant and crowning feat of sarahs battle with the world was the deal she made with schulenbergs home restaurant the restaurant was next door to the old red brick in which she ballroomed one evening after dining at schulenbergs 40cent fivecourse table dhôte served as fast as you throw the five baseballs at the coloured gentlemans head sarah took away with her the bill of fare it was written in an almost unreadable script neither english nor german and so arranged that if you were not careful you began with a toothpick and rice pudding and ended with soup and the day of the week  the next day sarah showed schulenberg a neat card on which the menu was beautifully typewritten with the viands temptingly marshalled under their right and proper heads from hors doeuvre to not responsible for overcoats and umbrellas  schulenberg became a naturalised citizen on the spot before sarah left him she had him willingly committed to an agreement she was to furnish typewritten bills of fare for the twentyone tables in the restauranta new bill for each days dinner and new ones for breakfast and lunch as often as changes occurred in the food or as neatness required  in return for this schulenberg was to send three meals per diem to sarahs hall room by a waiteran obsequious one if possibleand furnish her each afternoon with a pencil draft of what fate had in store for schulenbergs customers on the morrow  mutual satisfaction resulted from the agreement schulenbergs patrons now knew what the food they ate was called even if its nature sometimes puzzled them and sarah had food during a cold dull winter which was the main thing with her  and then the almanac lied and said that spring had come spring comes when it comes the frozen snows of january still lay like adamant in the crosstown streets the handorgans still played in the good old summertime with their december vivacity and expression men began to make thirtyday notes to buy easter dresses janitors shut off steam and when these things happen one may know that the city is still in the clutches of winter  one afternoon sarah shivered in her elegant hall bedroom house heated scrupulously clean conveniences seen to be appreciated she had no work to do except schulenbergs menu cards sarah sat in her squeaky willow rocker and looked out the window the calendar on the wall kept crying to her springtime is here sarahspringtime is here i tell you look at me sarah my figures show it youve got a neat figure yourself sarahanice springtime figurewhy do you look out the window so sadly  sarahs room was at the back of the house looking out the window she could see the windowless rear brick wall of the box factory on the next street but the wall was clearest crystal and sarah was looking down a grassy lane shaded with cherry trees and elms and bordered with raspberry bushes and cherokee roses  springs real harbingers are too subtle for the eye and ear some must have the flowering crocus the woodstarring dogwood the voice of bluebirdeven so gross a reminder as the farewell handshake of the retiring buckwheat and oyster before they can welcome the lady in green to their dull bosoms but to old earths choicest kin there come straight sweet messages from his newest bride telling them they shall be no stepchildren unless they choose to be  on the previous summer sarah had gone into the country and loved a farmer  in writing your story never hark back thus it is bad art and cripples interest let it march march  sarah stayed two weeks at sunnybrook farm there she learned to love old farmer franklins son walter farmers have been loved and wedded and turned out to grass in less time but young walter franklin was a modern agriculturist he had a telephone in his cow house and he could figure up exactly what effect next years canada wheat crop would have on potatoes planted in the dark of the moon  it was in this shaded and raspberried lane that walter had wooed and won her and together they had sat and woven a crown of dandelions for her hair he had immoderately praised the effect of the yellow blossoms against her brown tresses and she had left the chaplet there and walked back to the house swinging her straw sailor in her hands  they were to marry in the springat the very first signs of spring walter said and sarah came back to the city to pound her typewriter  a knock at the door dispelled sarahs visions of that happy day a waiter had brought the rough pencil draft of the home restaurants next day fare in old schulenbergs angular hand  sarah sat down to her typewriter and slipped a card between the rollers she was a nimble worker generally in an hour and a half the twentyone menu cards were written and ready  today there were more changes on the bill of fare than usual the soups were lighter pork was eliminated from the entrées figuring only with russian turnips among the roasts the gracious spirit of spring pervaded the entire menu lamb that lately capered on the greening hillsides was becoming exploited with the sauce that commemorated its gambols the song of the oyster though not silenced was dimuendo con amore the fryingpan seemed to be held inactive behind the beneficent bars of the broiler the pie list swelled the richer puddings had vanished the sausage with his drapery wrapped about him barely lingered in a pleasant thanatopsis with the buckwheats and the sweet but doomed maple  sarahs fingers danced like midgets above a summer stream down through the courses she worked giving each item its position according to its length with an accurate eye just above the desserts came the list of vegetables carrots and peas asparagus on toast the perennial tomatoes and corn and succotash lima beans cabbageand then  sarah was crying over her bill of fare tears from the depths of some divine despair rose in her heart and gathered to her eyes down went her head on the little typewriter stand and the keyboard rattled a dry accompaniment to her moist sobs  for she had received no letter from walter in two weeks and the next item on the bill of fare was dandelionsdandelions with some kind of eggbut bother the eggdandelions with whose golden blooms walter had crowned her his queen of love and future bridedandelions the harbingers of spring her sorrows crown of sorrowreminder of her happiest days  madam i dare you to smile until you suffer this test let the marechal niel roses that percy brought you on the night you gave him your heart be served as a salad with french dressing before your eyes at a schulenberg table dhôte had juliet so seen her love tokens dishonoured the sooner would she have sought the lethean herbs of the good apothecary  but what a witch is spring into the great cold city of stone and iron a message had to be sent there was none to convey it but the little hardy courier of the fields with his rough green coat and modest air he is a true soldier of fortune this dentdelionthis lions tooth as the french chefs call him flowered he will assist at lovemaking wreathed in my ladys nutbrown hair young and callow and unblossomed he goes into the boiling pot and delivers the word of his sovereign mistress  by and by sarah forced back her tears the cards must be written but still in a faint golden glow from her dandeleonine dream she fingered the typewriter keys absently for a little while with her mind and heart in the meadow lane with her young farmer but soon she came swiftly back to the rockbound lanes of manhattan and the typewriter began to rattle and jump like a strikebreakers motor car  at 6 oclock the waiter brought her dinner and carried away the typewritten bill of fare when sarah ate she set aside with a sigh the dish of dandelions with its crowning ovarious accompaniment as this dark mass had been transformed from a bright and loveindorsed flower to be an ignominious vegetable so had her summer hopes wilted and perished love may as shakespeare said feed on itself but sarah could not bring herself to eat the dandelions that had graced as ornaments the first spiritual banquet of her hearts true affection  at 730 the couple in the next room began to quarrel the man in the room above sought for a on his flute the gas went a little lower three coal wagons started to unloadthe only sound of which the phonograph is jealous cats on the back fences slowly retreated toward mukden by these signs sarah knew that it was time for her to read she got out the cloister and the hearth the best nonselling book of the month settled her feet on her trunk and began to wander with gerard  the front door bell rang the landlady answered it sarah left gerard and denys treed by a bear and listened oh yes you would just as she did  and then a strong voice was heard in the hall below and sarah jumped for her door leaving the book on the floor and the first round easily the bears you have guessed it she reached the top of the stairs just as her farmer came up three at a jump and reaped and garnered her with nothing left for the gleaners  why havent you writtenoh why cried sarah  new york is a pretty large town said walter franklin i came in a week ago to your old address i found that you went away on a thursday that consoled some it eliminated the possible friday bad luck but it didnt prevent my hunting for you with police and otherwise ever since  i wrote said sarah vehemently  never got it  then how did you find me  the young farmer smiled a springtime smile  i dropped into that home restaurant next door this evening said he i dont care who knows it i like a dish of some kind of greens at this time of the year i ran my eye down that nice typewritten bill of fare looking for something in that line when i got below cabbage i turned my chair over and hollered for the proprietor he told me where you lived  i remember sighed sarah happily that was dandelions below cabbage  id know that cranky capital w way above the line that your typewriter makes anywhere in the world said franklin  why theres no w in dandelions said sarah in surprise  the young man drew the bill of fare from his pocket and pointed to a line  sarah recognised the first card she had typewritten that afternoon there was still the rayed splotch in the upper righthand corner where a tear had fallen but over the spot where one should have read the name of the meadow plant the clinging memory of their golden blossoms had allowed her fingers to strike strange keys  between the red cabbage and the stuffed green peppers was the item  dearest walter with hardboiled egg      the green door   suppose you should be walking down broadway after dinner with ten minutes allotted to the consummation of your cigar while you are choosing between a diverting tragedy and something serious in the way of vaudeville suddenly a hand is laid upon your arm you turn to look into the thrilling eyes of a beautiful woman wonderful in diamonds and russian sables she thrusts hurriedly into your hand an extremely hot buttered roll flashes out a tiny pair of scissors snips off the second button of your overcoat meaningly ejaculates the one word parallelogram and swiftly flies down a cross street looking back fearfully over her shoulder  that would be pure adventure would you accept it not you you would flush with embarrassment you would sheepishly drop the roll and continue down broadway fumbling feebly for the missing button this you would do unless you are one of the blessed few in whom the pure spirit of adventure is not dead  true adventurers have never been plentiful they who are set down in print as such have been mostly business men with newly invented methods they have been out after the things they wantedgolden fleeces holy grails lady loves treasure crowns and fame the true adventurer goes forth aimless and uncalculating to meet and greet unknown fate a fine example was the prodigal sonwhen he started back home  halfadventurersbrave and splendid figureshave been numerous from the crusades to the palisades they have enriched the arts of history and fiction and the trade of historical fiction but each of them had a prize to win a goal to kick an axe to grind a race to run a new thrust in tierce to deliver a name to carve a crow to pickso they were not followers of true adventure  in the big city the twin spirits romance and adventure are always abroad seeking worthy wooers as we roam the streets they slyly peep at us and challenge us in twenty different guises without knowing why we look up suddenly to see in a window a face that seems to belong to our gallery of intimate portraits in a sleeping thoroughfare we hear a cry of agony and fear coming from an empty and shuttered house instead of at our familiar curb a cabdriver deposits us before a strange door which one with a smile opens for us and bids us enter a slip of paper written upon flutters down to our feet from the high lattices of chance we exchange glances of instantaneous hate affection and fear with hurrying strangers in the passing crowds a sudden douse of rainand our umbrella may be sheltering the daughter of the full moon and first cousin of the sidereal system at every corner handkerchiefs drop fingers beckon eyes besiege and the lost the lonely the rapturous the mysterious the perilous changing clues of adventure are slipped into our fingers but few of us are willing to hold and follow them we are grown stiff with the ramrod of convention down our backs we pass on and some day we come at the end of a very dull life to reflect that our romance has been a pallid thing of a marriage or two a satin rosette kept in a safedeposit drawer and a lifelong feud with a steam radiator  rudolf steiner was a true adventurer few were the evenings on which he did not go forth from his hall bedchamber in search of the unexpected and the egregious the most interesting thing in life seemed to him to be what might lie just around the next corner sometimes his willingness to tempt fate led him into strange paths twice he had spent the night in a stationhouse again and again he had found himself the dupe of ingenious and mercenary tricksters his watch and money had been the price of one flattering allurement but with undiminished ardour he picked up every glove cast before him into the merry lists of adventure  one evening rudolf was strolling along a crosstown street in the older central part of the city two streams of people filled the sidewalksthe homehurrying and that restless contingent that abandons home for the specious welcome of the thousandcandlepower table dhôte  the young adventurer was of pleasing presence and moved serenely and watchfully by daylight he was a salesman in a piano store he wore his tie drawn through a topaz ring instead of fastened with a stick pin and once he had written to the editor of a magazine that junies love test by miss libbey had been the book that had most influenced his life  during his walk a violent chattering of teeth in a glass case on the sidewalk seemed at first to draw his attention with a qualm to a restaurant before which it was set but a second glance revealed the electric letters of a dentists sign high above the next door a giant negro fantastically dressed in a red embroidered coat yellow trousers and a military cap discreetly distributed cards to those of the passing crowd who consented to take them  this mode of dentistic advertising was a common sight to rudolf usually he passed the dispenser of the dentists cards without reducing his store but tonight the african slipped one into his hand so deftly that he retained it there smiling a little at the successful feat  when he had travelled a few yards further he glanced at the card indifferently surprised he turned it over and looked again with interest one side of the card was blank on the other was written in ink three words the green door and then rudolf saw three steps in front of him a man throw down the card the negro had given him as he passed rudolf picked it up it was printed with the dentists name and address and the usual schedule of plate work and bridge work and crowns and specious promises of painless operations  the adventurous piano salesman halted at the corner and considered then he crossed the street walked down a block recrossed and joined the upward current of people again without seeming to notice the negro as he passed the second time he carelessly took the card that was handed him ten steps away he inspected it in the same handwriting that appeared on the first card the green door was inscribed upon it three or four cards were tossed to the pavement by pedestrians both following and leading him these fell blank side up rudolf turned them over every one bore the printed legend of the dental parlours  rarely did the arch sprite adventure need to beckon twice to rudolf steiner his true follower but twice it had been done and the quest was on  rudolf walked slowly back to where the giant negro stood by the case of rattling teeth this time as he passed he received no card in spite of his gaudy and ridiculous garb the ethiopian displayed a natural barbaric dignity as he stood offering the cards suavely to some allowing others to pass unmolested every half minute he chanted a harsh unintelligible phrase akin to the jabber of car conductors and grand opera and not only did he withhold a card this time but it seemed to rudolf that he received from the shining and massive black countenance a look of cold almost contemptuous disdain  the look stung the adventurer he read in it a silent accusation that he had been found wanting whatever the mysterious written words on the cards might mean the black had selected him twice from the throng for their recipient and now seemed to have condemned him as deficient in the wit and spirit to engage the enigma  standing aside from the rush the young man made a rapid estimate of the building in which he conceived that his adventure must lie five stories high it rose a small restaurant occupied the basement  the first floor now closed seemed to house millinery or furs the second floor by the winking electric letters was the dentists above this a polyglot babel of signs struggled to indicate the abodes of palmists dressmakers musicians and doctors still higher up draped curtains and milk bottles white on the window sills proclaimed the regions of domesticity  after concluding his survey rudolf walked briskly up the high flight of stone steps into the house up two flights of the carpeted stairway he continued and at its top paused the hallway there was dimly lighted by two pale jets of gas onefar to his right the other nearer to his left he looked toward the nearer light and saw within its wan halo a green door for one moment he hesitated then he seemed to see the contumelious sneer of the african juggler of cards and then he walked straight to the green door and knocked against it  moments like those that passed before his knock was answered measure the quick breath of true adventure what might not be behind those green panels gamesters at play cunning rogues baiting their traps with subtle skill beauty in love with courage and thus planning to be sought by it danger death love disappointment ridiculeany of these might respond to that temerarious rap  a faint rustle was heard inside and the door slowly opened a girl not yet twenty stood there whitefaced and tottering she loosed the knob and swayed weakly groping with one hand rudolf caught her and laid her on a faded couch that stood against the wall he closed the door and took a swift glance around the room by the light of a flickering gas jet neat but extreme poverty was the story that he read  the girl lay still as if in a faint rudolf looked around the room excitedly for a barrel people must be rolled upon a barrel whono no that was for drowned persons he began to fan her with his hat that was successful for he struck her nose with the brim of his derby and she opened her eyes and then the young man saw that hers indeed was the one missing face from his hearts gallery of intimate portraits the frank grey eyes the little nose turning pertly outward the chestnut hair curling like the tendrils of a pea vine seemed the right end and reward of all his wonderful adventures but the face was wofully thin and pale  the girl looked at him calmly and then smiled  fainted didnt i she asked weakly well who wouldnt you try going without anything to eat for three days and see  himmel exclaimed rudolf jumping up wait till i come back  he dashed out the green door and down the stairs in twenty minutes he was back again kicking at the door with his toe for her to open it with both arms he hugged an array of wares from the grocery and the restaurant on the table he laid thembread and butter cold meats cakes pies pickles oysters a roasted chicken a bottle of milk and one of redhot tea  this is ridiculous said rudolf blusteringly to go without eating you must quit making election bets of this kind supper is ready he helped her to a chair at the table and asked is there a cup for the tea on the shelf by the window she answered when he turned again with the cup he saw her with eyes shining rapturously beginning upon a huge dill pickle that she had rooted out from the paper bags with a womans unerring instinct he took it from her laughingly and poured the cup full of milk drink that first he ordered and then you shall have some tea and then a chicken wing if you are very good you shall have a pickle tomorrow and now if youll allow me to be your guest well have supper  he drew up the other chair the tea brightened the girls eyes and brought back some of her colour she began to eat with a sort of dainty ferocity like some starved wild animal she seemed to regard the young mans presence and the aid he had rendered her as a natural thingnot as though she undervalued the conventions but as one whose great stress gave her the right to put aside the artificial for the human but gradually with the return of strength and comfort came also a sense of the little conventions that belong and she began to tell him her little story it was one of a thousand such as the city yawns at every daythe shop girls story of insufficient wages further reduced by fines that go to swell the stores profits of time lost through illness and then of lost positions lost hope andthe knock of the adventurer upon the green door  but to rudolf the history sounded as big as the iliad or the crisis in junies love test  to think of you going through all that he exclaimed  it was something fierce said the girl solemnly  and you have no relatives or friends in the city  none whatever  i am all alone in the world too said rudolf after a pause  i am glad of that said the girl promptly and somehow it pleased the young man to hear that she approved of his bereft condition  very suddenly her eyelids dropped and she sighed deeply  im awfully sleepy she said and i feel so good  then rudolf rose and took his hat ill say goodnight a long nights sleep will be fine for you  he held out his hand and she took it and said goodnight but her eyes asked a question so eloquently so frankly and pathetically that he answered it with words  oh im coming back tomorrow to see how you are getting along you cant get rid of me so easily  then at the door as though the way of his coming had been so much less important than the fact that he had come she asked how did you come to knock at my door  he looked at her for a moment remembering the cards and felt a sudden jealous pain what if they had fallen into other hands as adventurous as his quickly he decided that she must never know the truth he would never let her know that he was aware of the strange expedient to which she had been driven by her great distress  one of our piano tuners lives in this house he said i knocked at your door by mistake  the last thing he saw in the room before the green door closed was her smile  at the head of the stairway he paused and looked curiously about him and then he went along the hallway to its other end and coming back ascended to the floor above and continued his puzzled explorations every door that he found in the house was painted green  wondering he descended to the sidewalk the fantastic african was still there rudolf confronted him with his two cards in his hand  will you tell me why you gave me these cards and what they mean he asked  in a broad goodnatured grin the negro exhibited a splendid advertisement of his masters profession  dar it is boss he said pointing down the street but i spect you is a little late for de fust act  looking the way he pointed rudolf saw above the entrance to a theatre the blazing electric sign of its new play the green door  im informed dat its a fustrate show sah said the negro de agent what represents it pussented me with a dollar sah to distribute a few of his cards along with de doctahs may i offer you one of de doctahs cards sah  at the corner of the block in which he lived rudolf stopped for a glass of beer and a cigar when he had come out with his lighted weed he buttoned his coat pushed back his hat and said stoutly to the lamp post on the corner  all the same i believe it was the hand of fate that doped out the way for me to find her  which conclusion under the circumstances certainly admits rudolf steiner to the ranks of the true followers of romance and adventure      from the cabbys seat   the cabby has his point of view it is more singleminded perhaps than that of a follower of any other calling from the high swaying seat of his hansom he looks upon his fellowmen as nomadic particles of no account except when possessed of migratory desires he is jehu and you are goods in transit be you president or vagabond to cabby you are only a fare he takes you up cracks his whip joggles your vertebrae and sets you down  when time for payment arrives if you exhibit a familiarity with legal rates you come to know what contempt is if you find that you have left your pocketbook behind you are made to realise the mildness of dantes imagination  it is not an extravagant theory that the cabbys singleness of purpose and concentrated view of life are the results of the hansoms peculiar construction the cockoftheroost sits aloft like jupiter on an unsharable seat holding your fate between two thongs of inconstant leather helpless ridiculous confined bobbing like a toy mandarin you sit like a rat in a trapyou before whom butlers cringe on solid landand must squeak upward through a slit in your peripatetic sarcophagus to make your feeble wishes known  then in a cab you are not even an occupant you are contents you are a cargo at sea and the cherub that sits up aloft has davy joness street and number by heart  one night there were sounds of revelry in the big brick tenementhouse next door but one to mcgarys family café the sounds seemed to emanate from the apartments of the walsh family the sidewalk was obstructed by an assortment of interested neighbours who opened a lane from time to time for a hurrying messenger bearing from mcgarys goods pertinent to festivity and diversion the sidewalk contingent was engaged in comment and discussion from which it made no effort to eliminate the news that norah walsh was being married  in the fulness of time there was an eruption of the merrymakers to the sidewalk the uninvited guests enveloped and permeated them and upon the night air rose joyous cries congratulations laughter and unclassified noises born of mcgarys oblations to the hymeneal scene  close to the curb stood jerry odonovans cab nighthawk was jerry called but no more lustrous or cleaner hansom than his ever closed its doors upon point lace and november violets and jerrys horse i am within bounds when i tell you that he was stuffed with oats until one of those old ladies who leave their dishes unwashed at home and go about having expressmen arrested would have smiledyes smiledto have seen him  among the shifting sonorous pulsing crowd glimpses could be had of jerrys high hat battered by the winds and rains of many years of his nose like a carrot battered by the frolicsome athletic progeny of millionaires and by contumacious fares of his brassbuttoned green coat admired in the vicinity of mcgarys it was plain that jerry had usurped the functions of his cab and was carrying a load indeed the figure may be extended and he be likened to a breadwaggon if we admit the testimony of a youthful spectator who was heard to remark jerry has got a bun  from somewhere among the throng in the street or else out of the thin stream of pedestrians a young woman tripped and stood by the cab the professional hawks eye of jerry caught the movement he made a lurch for the cab overturning three or four onlookers and himselfno he caught the cap of a waterplug and kept his feet like a sailor shinning up the ratlins during a squall jerry mounted to his professional seat once he was there mcgarys liquids were baffled he seesawed on the mizzenmast of his craft as safe as a steeple jack rigged to the flagpole of a skyscraper  step in lady said jerry gathering his lines the young woman stepped into the cab the doors shut with a bang jerrys whip cracked in the air the crowd in the gutter scattered and the fine hansom dashed away crosstown  when the oatspry horse had hedged a little his first spurt of speed jerry broke the lid of his cab and called down through the aperture in the voice of a cracked megaphone trying to please  where now will ye be drivin to  anywhere you please came up the answer musical and contented  tis drivin for pleasure she is thought jerry and then he suggested as a matter of course  take a thrip around in the park lady twill be ilegant cool and fine  just as you like answered the fare pleasantly  the cab headed for fifth avenue and sped up that perfect street jerry bounced and swayed in his seat the potent fluids of mcgary were disquieted and they sent new fumes to his head he sang an ancient song of killisnook and brandished his whip like a baton  inside the cab the fare sat up straight on the cushions looking to right and left at the lights and houses even in the shadowed hansom her eyes shone like stars at twilight  when they reached fiftyninth street jerrys head was bobbing and his reins were slack but his horse turned in through the park gate and began the old familiar nocturnal round and then the fare leaned back entranced and breathed deep the clean wholesome odours of grass and leaf and bloom and the wise beast in the shafts knowing his ground struck into his bythehour gait and kept to the right of the road  habit also struggled successfully against jerrys increasing torpor he raised the hatch of his stormtossed vessel and made the inquiry that cabbies do make in the park  like shtop at the cassino lady gezzer rfreshms n lishn the music evbody shtops  i think that would be nice said the fare  they reined up with a plunge at the casino entrance the cab doors flew open the fare stepped directly upon the floor at once she was caught in a web of ravishing music and dazzled by a panorama of lights and colours some one slipped a little square card into her hand on which was printed a number34 she looked around and saw her cab twenty yards away already lining up in its place among the waiting mass of carriages cabs and motor cars and then a man who seemed to be all shirtfront danced backward before her and next she was seated at a little table by a railing over which climbed a jessamine vine  there seemed to be a wordless invitation to purchase she consulted a collection of small coins in a thin purse and received from them license to order a glass of beer there she sat inhaling and absorbing it allthe newcoloured newshaped life in a fairy palace in an enchanted wood  at fifty tables sat princes and queens clad in all the silks and gems of the world and now and then one of them would look curiously at jerrys fare they saw a plain figure dressed in a pink silk of the kind that is tempered by the word foulard and a plain face that wore a look of love of life that the queens envied  twice the long hands of the clocks went round royalties thinned from their al fresco thrones and buzzed or clattered away in their vehicles of state the music retired into cases of wood and bags of leather and baize waiters removed cloths pointedly near the plain figure sitting almost alone  jerrys fare rose and held out her numbered card simply  is there anything coming on the ticket she asked  a waiter told her it was her cab check and that she should give it to the man at the entrance this man took it and called the number only three hansoms stood in line the driver of one of them went and routed out jerry asleep in his cab he swore deeply climbed to the captains bridge and steered his craft to the pier his fare entered and the cab whirled into the cool fastnesses of the park along the shortest homeward cuts  at the gate a glimmer of reason in the form of sudden suspicion seized upon jerrys beclouded mind one or two things occurred to him he stopped his horse raised the trap and dropped his phonographic voice like a lead plummet through the aperture  i want to see four dollars before goin any further on th thrip have ye got th dough  four dollars laughed the fare softly dear me no ive only got a few pennies and a dime or two  jerry shut down the trap and slashed his oatfed horse the clatter of hoofs strangled but could not drown the sound of his profanity he shouted choking and gurgling curses at the starry heavens he cut viciously with his whip at passing vehicles he scattered fierce and everchanging oaths and imprecations along the streets so that a late truck driver crawling homeward heard and was abashed but he knew his recourse and made for it at a gallop  at the house with the green lights beside the steps he pulled up he flung wide the cab doors and tumbled heavily to the ground  come on you he said roughly  his fare came forth with the casino dreamy smile still on her plain face jerry took her by the arm and led her into the police station a graymoustached sergeant looked keenly across the desk he and the cabby were no strangers  sargeant began jerry in his old raucous martyred thunderous tones of complaint ive got a fare here that  jerry paused he drew a knotted red hand across his brow the fog set up by mcgary was beginning to clear away  a fare sargeant he continued with a grin that i want to inthroduce to ye its me wife that i married at ould man walshs this avening and a divil of a time we had tis thrue shake hands wid th sargeant norah and well be off to home  before stepping into the cab norah sighed profoundly  ive had such a nice time jerry said she      an unfinished story   we no longer groan and heap ashes upon our heads when the flames of tophet are mentioned for even the preachers have begun to tell us that god is radium or ether or some scientific compound and that the worst we wicked ones may expect is a chemical reaction this is a pleasing hypothesis but there lingers yet some of the old goodly terror of orthodoxy  there are but two subjects upon which one may discourse with a free imagination and without the possibility of being controverted you may talk of your dreams and you may tell what you heard a parrot say both morpheus and the bird are incompetent witnesses and your listener dare not attack your recital the baseless fabric of a vision then shall furnish my themechosen with apologies and regrets instead of the more limited field of pretty pollys small talk  i had a dream that was so far removed from the higher criticism that it had to do with the ancient respectable and lamented barofjudgment theory  gabriel had played his trump and those of us who could not follow suit were arraigned for examination i noticed at one side a gathering of professional bondsmen in solemn black and collars that buttoned behind but it seemed there was some trouble about their real estate titles and they did not appear to be getting any of us out  a fly copan angel policemanflew over to me and took me by the left wing near at hand was a group of very prosperouslooking spirits arraigned for judgment  do you belong with that bunch the policeman asked  who are they was my answer  why said he they are  but this irrelevant stuff is taking up space that the story should occupy  dulcie worked in a department store she sold hamburg edging or stuffed peppers or automobiles or other little trinkets such as they keep in department stores of what she earned dulcie received six dollars per week the remainder was credited to her and debited to somebody elses account in the ledger kept by g oh primal energy you say reverend doctorwell then in the ledger of primal energy  during her first year in the store dulcie was paid five dollars per week it would be instructive to know how she lived on that amount dont care very well probably you are interested in larger amounts six dollars is a larger amount i will tell you how she lived on six dollars per week  one afternoon at six when dulcie was sticking her hatpin within an eighth of an inch of her medulla oblongata she said to her chum sadiethe girl that waits on you with her left side  say sade i made a date for dinner this evening with piggy  you never did exclaimed sadie admiringly well aint you the lucky one piggys an awful swell and he always takes a girl to swell places he took blanche up to the hoffman house one evening where they have swell music and you see a lot of swells youll have a swell time dulce  dulcie hurried homeward her eyes were shining and her cheeks showed the delicate pink of lifesreal lifesapproaching dawn it was friday and she had fifty cents left of her last weeks wages  the streets were filled with the rushhour floods of people the electric lights of broadway were glowingcalling moths from miles from leagues from hundreds of leagues out of darkness around to come in and attend the singeing school men in accurate clothes with faces like those carved on cherry stones by the old salts in sailors homes turned and stared at dulcie as she sped unheeding past them manhattan the nightblooming cereus was beginning to unfold its deadwhite heavyodoured petals  dulcie stopped in a store where goods were cheap and bought an imitation lace collar with her fifty cents that money was to have been spent otherwisefifteen cents for supper ten cents for breakfast ten cents for lunch another dime was to be added to her small store of savings and five cents was to be squandered for licorice dropsthe kind that made your cheek look like the toothache and last as long the licorice was an extravagancealmost a carousebut what is life without pleasures  dulcie lived in a furnished room there is this difference between a furnished room and a boardinghouse in a furnished room other people do not know it when you go hungry  dulcie went up to her roomthe third floor back in a west side brownstonefront she lit the gas scientists tell us that the diamond is the hardest substance known their mistake landladies know of a compound beside which the diamond is as putty they pack it in the tips of gasburners and one may stand on a chair and dig at it in vain until ones fingers are pink and bruised a hairpin will not remove it therefore let us call it immovable  so dulcie lit the gas in its onefourthcandlepower glow we will observe the room  couchbed dresser table washstand chairof this much the landlady was guilty the rest was dulcies on the dresser were her treasuresa gilt china vase presented to her by sadie a calendar issued by a pickle works a book on the divination of dreams some rice powder in a glass dish and a cluster of artificial cherries tied with a pink ribbon  against the wrinkly mirror stood pictures of general kitchener william muldoon the duchess of marlborough and benvenuto cellini against one wall was a plaster of paris plaque of an ocallahan in a roman helmet near it was a violent oleograph of a lemoncoloured child assaulting an inflammatory butterfly this was dulcies final judgment in art but it had never been upset her rest had never been disturbed by whispers of stolen copes no critic had elevated his eyebrows at her infantile entomologist  piggy was to call for her at seven while she swiftly makes ready let us discreetly face the other way and gossip  for the room dulcie paid two dollars per week on weekdays her breakfast cost ten cents she made coffee and cooked an egg over the gaslight while she was dressing on sunday mornings she feasted royally on veal chops and pineapple fritters at billys restaurant at a cost of twentyfive centsand tipped the waitress ten cents new york presents so many temptations for one to run into extravagance she had her lunches in the departmentstore restaurant at a cost of sixty cents for the week dinners were 105 the evening papersshow me a new yorker going without his daily papercame to six cents and two sunday papersone for the personal column and the other to readwere ten cents the total amounts to 476 now one has to buy clothes and  i give it up i hear of wonderful bargains in fabrics and of miracles performed with needle and thread but i am in doubt i hold my pen poised in vain when i would add to dulcies life some of those joys that belong to woman by virtue of all the unwritten sacred natural inactive ordinances of the equity of heaven twice she had been to coney island and had ridden the hobbyhorses tis a weary thing to count your pleasures by summers instead of by hours  piggy needs but a word when the girls named him an undeserving stigma was cast upon the noble family of swine the wordsofthreeletters lesson in the old blue spelling book begins with piggys biography he was fat he had the soul of a rat the habits of a bat and the magnanimity of a cat   he wore expensive clothes and was a connoisseur in starvation he could look at a shopgirl and tell you to an hour how long it had been since she had eaten anything more nourishing than marshmallows and tea he hung about the shopping districts and prowled around in department stores with his invitations to dinner men who escort dogs upon the streets at the end of a string look down upon him he is a type i can dwell upon him no longer my pen is not the kind intended for him i am no carpenter  at ten minutes to seven dulcie was ready she looked at herself in the wrinkly mirror the reflection was satisfactory the dark blue dress fitting without a wrinkle the hat with its jaunty black feather the butslightlysoiled glovesall representing selfdenial even of food itselfwere vastly becoming  dulcie forgot everything else for a moment except that she was beautiful and that life was about to lift a corner of its mysterious veil for her to observe its wonders no gentleman had ever asked her out before now she was going for a brief moment into the glitter and exalted show  the girls said that piggy was a spender there would be a grand dinner and music and splendidly dressed ladies to look at and things to eat that strangely twisted the girls jaws when they tried to tell about them no doubt she would be asked out again there was a blue pongee suit in a window that she knewby saving twenty cents a week instead of ten inlets seeoh it would run into years but there was a secondhand store in seventh avenue where  somebody knocked at the door dulcie opened it the landlady stood there with a spurious smile sniffing for cooking by stolen gas  a gentlemans downstairs to see you she said name is mr wiggins  by such epithet was piggy known to unfortunate ones who had to take him seriously  dulcie turned to the dresser to get her handkerchief and then she stopped still and bit her underlip hard while looking in her mirror she had seen fairyland and herself a princess just awakening from a long slumber she had forgotten one that was watching her with sad beautiful stern eyesthe only one there was to approve or condemn what she did straight and slender and tall with a look of sorrowful reproach on his handsome melancholy face general kitchener fixed his wonderful eyes on her out of his gilt photograph frame on the dresser  dulcie turned like an automatic doll to the landlady  tell him i cant go she said dully tell him im sick or something tell him im not going out  after the door was closed and locked dulcie fell upon her bed crushing her black tip and cried for ten minutes general kitchener was her only friend he was dulcies ideal of a gallant knight he looked as if he might have a secret sorrow and his wonderful moustache was a dream and she was a little afraid of that stern yet tender look in his eyes she used to have little fancies that he would call at the house sometime and ask for her with his sword clanking against his high boots once when a boy was rattling a piece of chain against a lamppost she had opened the window and looked out but there was no use she knew that general kitchener was away over in japan leading his army against the savage turks and he would never step out of his gilt frame for her yet one look from him had vanquished piggy that night yes for that night  when her cry was over dulcie got up and took off her best dress and put on her old blue kimono she wanted no dinner she sang two verses of sammy then she became intensely interested in a little red speck on the side of her nose and after that was attended to she drew up a chair to the rickety table and told her fortune with an old deck of cards  the horrid impudent thing she said aloud and i never gave him a word or a look to make him think it  at nine oclock dulcie took a tin box of crackers and a little pot of raspberry jam out of her trunk and had a feast she offered general kitchener some jam on a cracker but he only looked at her as the sphinx would have looked at a butterflyif there are butterflies in the desert  dont eat it if you dont want to said dulcie and dont put on so many airs and scold so with your eyes i wonder if youd be so superior and snippy if you had to live on six dollars a week  it was not a good sign for dulcie to be rude to general kitchener and then she turned benvenuto cellini face downward with a severe gesture but that was not inexcusable for she had always thought he was henry viii and she did not approve of him  at halfpast nine dulcie took a last look at the pictures on the dresser turned out the light and skipped into bed its an awful thing to go to bed with a goodnight look at general kitchener william muldoon the duchess of marlborough and benvenuto cellini this story really doesnt get anywhere at all the rest of it comes latersometime when piggy asks dulcie again to dine with him and she is feeling lonelier than usual and general kitchener happens to be looking the other way and then  as i said before i dreamed that i was standing near a crowd of prosperouslooking angels and a policeman took me by the wing and asked if i belonged with them  who are they i asked  why said he they are the men who hired workinggirls and paid em five or six dollars a week to live on are you one of the bunch  not on your immortality said i im only the fellow that set fire to an orphan asylum and murdered a blind man for his pennies      the caliph cupid and the clock   prince michael of the electorate of valleluna sat on his favourite bench in the park the coolness of the september night quickened the life in him like a rare tonic wine the benches were not filled for park loungers with their stagnant blood are prompt to detect and fly home from the crispness of early autumn the moon was just clearing the roofs of the range of dwellings that bounded the quadrangle on the east children laughed and played about the finesprayed fountain in the shadowed spots fauns and hamadryads wooed unconscious of the gaze of mortal eyes a hand organphilomel by the grace of our stage carpenter fancyfluted and droned in a side street around the enchanted boundaries of the little park street cars spat and mewed and the stilted trains roared like tigers and lions prowling for a place to enter and above the trees shone the great round shining face of an illuminated clock in the tower of an antique public building  prince michaels shoes were wrecked far beyond the skill of the carefullest cobbler the ragman would have declined any negotiations concerning his clothes the two weeks stubble on his face was grey and brown and red and greenish yellowas if it had been made up from individual contributions from the chorus of a musical comedy no man existed who had money enough to wear so bad a hat as his  prince michael sat on his favourite bench and smiled it was a diverting thought to him that he was wealthy enough to buy every one of those closeranged bulky windowlit mansions that faced him if he chose he could have matched gold equipages jewels art treasures estates and acres with any croesus in this proud city of manhattan and scarcely have entered upon the bulk of his holdings he could have sat at table with reigning sovereigns the social world the world of art the fellowship of the elect adulation imitation the homage of the fairest honours from the highest praise from the wisest flattery esteem credit pleasure fameall the honey of life was waiting in the comb in the hive of the world for prince michael of the electorate of valleluna whenever he might choose to take it but his choice was to sit in rags and dinginess on a bench in a park for he had tasted of the fruit of the tree of life and finding it bitter in his mouth had stepped out of eden for a time to seek distraction close to the unarmoured beating heart of the world  these thoughts strayed dreamily through the mind of prince michael as he smiled under the stubble of his polychromatic beard lounging thus clad as the poorest of mendicants in the parks he loved to study humanity he found in altruism more pleasure than his riches his station and all the grosser sweets of life had given him it was his chief solace and satisfaction to alleviate individual distress to confer favours upon worthy ones who had need of succour to dazzle unfortunates by unexpected and bewildering gifts of truly royal magnificence bestowed however with wisdom and judiciousness  and as prince michaels eye rested upon the glowing face of the great clock in the tower his smile altruistic as it was became slightly tinged with contempt big thoughts were the princes and it was always with a shake of his head that he considered the subjugation of the world to the arbitrary measures of time the comings and goings of people in hurry and dread controlled by the little metal moving hands of a clock always made him sad  by and by came a young man in evening clothes and sat upon the third bench from the prince for half an hour he smoked cigars with nervous haste and then he fell to watching the face of the illuminated clock above the trees his perturbation was evident and the prince noted in sorrow that its cause was connected in some manner with the slowly moving hands of the timepiece  his highness arose and went to the young mans bench  i beg your pardon for addressing you he said but i perceive that you are disturbed in mind if it may serve to mitigate the liberty i have taken i will add that i am prince michael heir to the throne of the electorate of valleluna i appear incognito of course as you may gather from my appearance it is a fancy of mine to render aid to others whom i think worthy of it perhaps the matter that seems to distress you is one that would more readily yield to our mutual efforts  the young man looked up brightly at the prince brightly but the perpendicular line of perplexity between his brows was not smoothed away he laughed and even then it did not but he accepted the momentary diversion  glad to meet you prince he said good humouredly yes id say you were incog all right thanks for your offer of assistancebut i dont see where your buttingin would help things any its a kind of private affair you knowbut thanks all the same  prince michael sat at the young mans side he was often rebuffed but never offensively his courteous manner and words forbade that  clocks said the prince are shackles on the feet of mankind i have observed you looking persistently at that clock its face is that of a tyrant its numbers are false as those on a lottery ticket its hands are those of a bunco steerer who makes an appointment with you to your ruin let me entreat you to throw off its humiliating bonds and to cease to order your affairs by that insensate monitor of brass and steel  i dont usually said the young man i carry a watch except when ive got my radiant rags on  i know human nature as i do the trees and grass said the prince with earnest dignity i am a master of philosophy a graduate in art and i hold the purse of a fortunatus there are few mortal misfortunes that i cannot alleviate or overcome i have read your countenance and found in it honesty and nobility as well as distress i beg of you to accept my advice or aid do not belie the intelligence i see in your face by judging from my appearance of my ability to defeat your troubles  the young man glanced at the clock again and frowned darkly when his gaze strayed from the glowing horologue of time it rested intently upon a fourstory red brick house in the row of dwellings opposite to where he sat the shades were drawn and the lights in many rooms shone dimly through them  ten minutes to nine exclaimed the young man with an impatient gesture of despair he turned his back upon the house and took a rapid step or two in a contrary direction  remain commanded prince michael in so potent a voice that the disturbed one wheeled around with a somewhat chagrined laugh  ill give her the ten minutes and then im off he muttered and then aloud to the prince ill join you in confounding all clocks my friend and throw in women too  sit down said the prince calmly i do not accept your addition women are the natural enemies of clocks and therefore the allies of those who would seek liberation from these monsters that measure our follies and limit our pleasures if you will so far confide in me i would ask you to relate to me your story  the young man threw himself upon the bench with a reckless laugh  your royal highness i will he said in tones of mock deference do you see yonder housethe one with three upper windows lighted well at 6 oclock i stood in that house with the young lady i amthat is i wasengaged to i had been doing wrong my dear princei had been a naughty boy and she had heard of it i wanted to be forgiven of coursewe are always wanting women to forgive us arent we prince  i want time to think it over said she there is one thing certain i will either fully forgive you or i will never see your face again there will be no halfway business at halfpast eight she said at exactly halfpast eight you may be watching the middle upper window of the top floor if i decide to forgive i will hang out of that window a white silk scarf you will know by that that all is as was before and you may come to me if you see no scarf you may consider that everything between us is ended forever that concluded the young man bitterly is why i have been watching that clock the time for the signal to appear has passed twentythree minutes ago do you wonder that i am a little disturbed my prince of rags and whiskers  let me repeat to you said prince michael in his even wellmodulated tones that women are the natural enemies of clocks clocks are an evil women a blessing the signal may yet appear  never on your principality exclaimed the young man hopelessly you dont know marianof course shes always on time to the minute that was the first thing about her that attracted me ive got the mitten instead of the scarf i ought to have known at 831 that my goose was cooked ill go west on the 1145 tonight with jack milburn the jigs up ill try jacks ranch awhile and top off with the klondike and whiskey goodnightererprince  prince michael smiled his enigmatic gentle comprehending smile and caught the coat sleeve of the other the brilliant light in the princes eyes was softening to a dreamier cloudy translucence  wait he said solemnly till the clock strikes i have wealth and power and knowledge above most men but when the clock strikes i am afraid stay by me until then this woman shall be yours you have the word of the hereditary prince of valleluna on the day of your marriage i will give you 100000 and a palace on the hudson but there must be no clocks in that palacethey measure our follies and limit our pleasures do you agree to that  of course said the young man cheerfully theyre a nuisance anywayalways ticking and striking and getting you late for dinner  he glanced again at the clock in the tower the hands stood at three minutes to nine  i think said prince michael that i will sleep a little the day has been fatiguing  he stretched himself upon a bench with the manner of one who had slept thus before  you will find me in this park on any evening when the weather is suitable said the prince sleepily come to me when your marriage day is set and i will give you a cheque for the money  thanks your highness said the young man seriously it doesnt look as if i would need that palace on the hudson but i appreciate your offer just the same  prince michael sank into deep slumber his battered hat rolled from the bench to the ground the young man lifted it placed it over the frowsy face and moved one of the grotesquely relaxed limbs into a more comfortable position poor devil he said as he drew the tattered clothes closer about the princes breast  sonorous and startling came the stroke of 9 from the clock tower the young man sighed again turned his face for one last look at the house of his relinquished hopesand cried aloud profane words of holy rapture  from the middle upper window blossomed in the dusk a waving snowy fluttering wonderful divine emblem of forgiveness and promised joy  by came a citizen rotund comfortable homehurrying unknowing of the delights of waving silken scarfs on the borders of dimlylit parks  will you oblige me with the time sir asked the young man and the citizen shrewdly conjecturing his watch to be safe dragged it out and announced  twentynine and a half minutes past eight sir  and then from habit he glanced at the clock in the tower and made further oration  by george that clocks half an hour fast first time in ten years ive known it to be off this watch of mine never varies a  but the citizen was talking to vacancy he turned and saw his hearer a fast receding black shadow flying in the direction of a house with three lighted upper windows  and in the morning came along two policemen on their way to the beats they owned the park was deserted save for one dilapidated figure that sprawled asleep on a bench they stopped and gazed upon it  its dopy mike said one he hits the pipe every night park bum for twenty years on his last legs i guess  the other policeman stooped and looked at something crumpled and crisp in the hand of the sleeper  gee he remarked hes doped out a fiftydollar bill anyway wish i knew the brand of hop that he smokes  and then rap rap rap went the club of realism against the shoe soles of prince michael of the electorate of valleluna      sisters of the golden circle   the rubberneck auto was about ready to start the merry topriders had been assigned to their seats by the gentlemanly conductor the sidewalk was blockaded with sightseers who had gathered to stare at sightseers justifying the natural law that every creature on earth is preyed upon by some other creature  the megaphone man raised his instrument of torture the inside of the great automobile began to thump and throb like the heart of a coffee drinker the topriders nervously clung to the seats the old lady from valparaiso indiana shrieked to be put ashore but before a wheel turns listen to a brief preamble through the cardiaphone which shall point out to you an object of interest on lifes sightseeing tour  swift and comprehensive is the recognition of white man for white man in african wilds instant and sure is the spiritual greeting between mother and babe unhesitatingly do master and dog commune across the slight gulf between animal and man immeasurably quick and sapient are the brief messages between one and ones beloved but all these instances set forth only slow and groping interchange of sympathy and thought beside one other instance which the rubberneck coach shall disclose you shall learn if you have not learned already what two beings of all earths living inhabitants most quickly look into each others hearts and souls when they meet face to face  the gong whirred and the glaringatgotham car moved majestically upon its instructive tour  on the highest rear seat was james williams of cloverdale missouri and his bride  capitalise it friend typothat last wordword of words in the epiphany of life and love the scent of the flowers the booty of the bee the primal drip of spring waters the overture of the lark the twist of lemon peel on the cocktail of creationsuch is the bride holy is the wife revered the mother galliptious is the summer girlbut the bride is the certified check among the wedding presents that the gods send in when man is married to mortality  the car glided up the golden way on the bridge of the great cruiser the captain stood trumpeting the sights of the big city to his passengers widemouthed and openeared they heard the sights of the metropolis thundered forth to their eyes confused delirious with excitement and provincial longings they tried to make ocular responses to the megaphonic ritual in the solemn spires of spreading cathedrals they saw the home of the vanderbilts in the busy bulk of the grand central depot they viewed wonderingly the frugal cot of russell sage bidden to observe the highlands of the hudson they gaped unsuspecting at the upturned mountains of a newlaid sewer to many the elevated railroad was the rialto on the stations of which uniformed men sat and made chop suey of your tickets and to this day in the outlying districts many have it that chuck connors with his hand on his heart leads reform and that but for the noble municipal efforts of one parkhurst a district attorney the notorious bishop potter gang would have destroyed law and order from the bowery to the harlem river  but i beg you to observe mrs james williamshattie chalmers that wasonce the belle of cloverdale paleblue is the brides if she will and this colour she had honoured willingly had the moss rosebud loaned to her cheeks of its pinkand as for the violether eyes will do very well as they are thank you a useless strip of white chafoh no he was guiding the auto carof white chiffonor perhaps it was grenadine or tullewas tied beneath her chin pretending to hold her bonnet in place but you know as well as i do that the hatpins did the work  and on mrs james williamss face was recorded a little library of the worlds best thoughts in three volumes volume no 1 contained the belief that james williams was about the right sort of thing volume no 2 was an essay on the world declaring it to be a very excellent place volume no 3 disclosed the belief that in occupying the highest seat in a rubberneck auto they were travelling the pace that passes all understanding  james williams you would have guessed was about twentyfour it will gratify you to know that your estimate was so accurate he was exactly twentythree years eleven months and twentynine days old he was well built active strongjawed goodnatured and rising he was on his wedding trip  dear kind fairy please cut out those orders for money and 40 h p touring cars and fame and a new growth of hair and the presidency of the boat club instead of any of them turn backwardoh turn backward and give us just a teenyweeny bit of our wedding trip over again just an hour dear fairy so we can remember how the grass and poplar trees looked and the bow of those bonnet strings tied beneath her chineven if it was the hatpins that did the work cant do it very well hurry up with that touring car and the oil stock then  just in front of mrs james williams sat a girl in a loose tan jacket and a straw hat adorned with grapes and roses only in dreams and milliners shops do we alas gather grapes and roses at one swipe this girl gazed with large blue eyes credulous when the megaphone man roared his doctrine that millionaires were things about which we should be concerned between blasts she resorted to epictetian philosophy in the form of pepsin chewing gum  at this girls right hand sat a young man about twentyfour he was wellbuilt active strongjawed and goodnatured but if his description seems to follow that of james williams divest it of anything cloverdalian this man belonged to hard streets and sharp corners he looked keenly about him seeming to begrudge the asphalt under the feet of those upon whom he looked down from his perch  while the megaphone barks at a famous hostelry let me whisper you through the lowtuned cardiaphone to sit tight for now things are about to happen and the great city will close over them again as over a scrap of ticker tape floating down from the den of a broad street bear  the girl in the tan jacket twisted around to view the pilgrims on the last seat the other passengers she had absorbed the seat behind her was her bluebeards chamber  her eyes met those of mrs james williams between two ticks of a watch they exchanged their lifes experiences histories hopes and fancies and all mind you with the eye before two men could have decided whether to draw steel or borrow a match  the bride leaned forward low she and the girl spoke rapidly together their tongues moving quickly like those of two serpentsa comparison that is not meant to go further two smiles and a dozen nods closed the conference  and now in the broad quiet avenue in front of the rubberneck car a man in dark clothes stood with uplifted hand from the sidewalk another hurried to join him  the girl in the fruitful hat quickly seized her companion by the arm and whispered in his ear that young man exhibited proof of ability to act promptly crouching low he slid over the edge of the car hung lightly for an instant and then disappeared half a dozen of the topriders observed his feat wonderingly but made no comment deeming it prudent not to express surprise at what might be the conventional manner of alighting in this bewildering city the truant passenger dodged a hansom and then floated past like a leaf on a stream between a furniture van and a florists delivery wagon  the girl in the tan jacket turned again and looked in the eyes of mrs james williams then she faced about and sat still while the rubberneck auto stopped at the flash of the badge under the coat of the plainclothes man  whats eatin you demanded the megaphonist abandoning his professional discourse for pure english  keep her at anchor for a minute ordered the officer theres a man on board we wanta philadelphia burglar called pinky mcguire there he is on the back seat look out for the side donovan  donovan went to the hind wheel and looked up at james williams  come down old sport he said pleasantly weve got you back to sleepytown for yours it aint a bad idea hidin on a rubberneck though ill remember that  softly through the megaphone came the advice of the conductor  better step off sir and explain the car must proceed on its tour  james williams belonged among the level heads with necessary slowness he picked his way through the passengers down to the steps at the front of the car his wife followed but she first turned her eyes and saw the escaped tourist glide from behind the furniture van and slip behind a tree on the edge of the little park not fifty feet away  descended to the ground james williams faced his captors with a smile he was thinking what a good story he would have to tell in cloverdale about having been mistaken for a burglar the rubberneck coach lingered out of respect for its patrons what could be a more interesting sight than this  my name is james williams of cloverdale missouri he said kindly so that they would not be too greatly mortified i have letters here that will show  youll come with us please announced the plainclothes man pinky mcguires description fits you like flannel washed in hot suds a detective saw you on the rubberneck up at central park and phoned down to take you in do your explaining at the stationhouse  james williamss wifehis bride of two weekslooked him in the face with a strange soft radiance in her eyes and a flush on her cheeks looked him in the face and said  go with em quietly pinky and maybe itll be in your favour  and then as the glaringatgotham car rolled away she turned and threw a kisshis wife threw a kissat some one high up on the seats of the rubberneck  your girl gives you good advice mcguire said donovan come on now  and then madness descended upon and occupied james williams he pushed his hat far upon the back of his head  my wife seems to think i am a burglar he said recklessly i never heard of her being crazy therefore i must be and if im crazy they cant do anything to me for killing you two fools in my madness  whereupon he resisted arrest so cheerfully and industriously that cops had to be whistled for and afterwards the reserves to disperse a few thousand delighted spectators  at the stationhouse the desk sergeant asked for his name  mcdoodle the pink or pinky the brute i forget which was james williamss answer but you can bet im a burglar dont leave that out and you might add that it took five of em to pluck the pink id especially like to have that in the records  in an hour came mrs james williams with uncle thomas of madison avenue in a respectcompelling motor car and proofs of the heros innocencefor all the world like the third act of a drama backed by an automobile mfg co  after the police had sternly reprimanded james williams for imitating a copyrighted burglar and given him as honourable a discharge as the department was capable of mrs williams rearrested him and swept him into an angle of the stationhouse james williams regarded her with one eye he always said that donovan closed the other while somebody was holding his good right hand never before had he given her a word of reproach or of reproof  if you can explain he began rather stiffly why you  dear she interrupted listen it was an hours pain and trial to you i did it for heri mean the girl who spoke to me on the coach i was so happy jimso happy with you that i didnt dare to refuse that happiness to another jim they were married only this morningthose two and i wanted him to get away while they were struggling with you i saw him slip from behind his tree and hurry across the park thats all of it deari had to do it  thus does one sister of the plain gold band know another who stands in the enchanted light that shines but once and briefly for each one by rice and satin bows does mere man become aware of weddings but bride knoweth bride at the glance of an eye and between them swiftly passes comfort and meaning in a language that man and widows wot not of      the romance of a busy broker   pitcher confidential clerk in the office of harvey maxwell broker allowed a look of mild interest and surprise to visit his usually expressionless countenance when his employer briskly entered at half past nine in company with his young lady stenographer with a snappy goodmorning pitcher maxwell dashed at his desk as though he were intending to leap over it and then plunged into the great heap of letters and telegrams waiting there for him  the young lady had been maxwells stenographer for a year she was beautiful in a way that was decidedly unstenographic she forewent the pomp of the alluring pompadour she wore no chains bracelets or lockets she had not the air of being about to accept an invitation to luncheon her dress was grey and plain but it fitted her figure with fidelity and discretion in her neat black turban hat was the goldgreen wing of a macaw on this morning she was softly and shyly radiant her eyes were dreamily bright her cheeks genuine peachblow her expression a happy one tinged with reminiscence  pitcher still mildly curious noticed a difference in her ways this morning instead of going straight into the adjoining room where her desk was she lingered slightly irresolute in the outer office once she moved over by maxwells desk near enough for him to be aware of her presence  the machine sitting at that desk was no longer a man it was a busy new york broker moved by buzzing wheels and uncoiling springs  wellwhat is it anything asked maxwell sharply his opened mail lay like a bank of stage snow on his crowded desk his keen grey eye impersonal and brusque flashed upon her half impatiently  nothing answered the stenographer moving away with a little smile  mr pitcher she said to the confidential clerk did mr maxwell say anything yesterday about engaging another stenographer  he did answered pitcher he told me to get another one i notified the agency yesterday afternoon to send over a few samples this morning its 945 oclock and not a single picture hat or piece of pineapple chewing gum has showed up yet  i will do the work as usual then said the young lady until some one comes to fill the place and she went to her desk at once and hung the black turban hat with the goldgreen macaw wing in its accustomed place  he who has been denied the spectacle of a busy manhattan broker during a rush of business is handicapped for the profession of anthropology the poet sings of the crowded hour of glorious life the brokers hour is not only crowded but the minutes and seconds are hanging to all the straps and packing both front and rear platforms  and this day was harvey maxwells busy day the ticker began to reel out jerkily its fitful coils of tape the desk telephone had a chronic attack of buzzing men began to throng into the office and call at him over the railing jovially sharply viciously excitedly messenger boys ran in and out with messages and telegrams the clerks in the office jumped about like sailors during a storm even pitchers face relaxed into something resembling animation  on the exchange there were hurricanes and landslides and snowstorms and glaciers and volcanoes and those elemental disturbances were reproduced in miniature in the brokers offices maxwell shoved his chair against the wall and transacted business after the manner of a toe dancer he jumped from ticker to phone from desk to door with the trained agility of a harlequin  in the midst of this growing and important stress the broker became suddenly aware of a highrolled fringe of golden hair under a nodding canopy of velvet and ostrich tips an imitation sealskin sacque and a string of beads as large as hickory nuts ending near the floor with a silver heart there was a selfpossessed young lady connected with these accessories and pitcher was there to construe her  lady from the stenographers agency to see about the position said pitcher  maxwell turned half around with his hands full of papers and ticker tape  what position he asked with a frown  position of stenographer said pitcher you told me yesterday to call them up and have one sent over this morning  you are losing your mind pitcher said maxwell why should i have given you any such instructions miss leslie has given perfect satisfaction during the year she has been here the place is hers as long as she chooses to retain it theres no place open here madam countermand that order with the agency pitcher and dont bring any more of em in here  the silver heart left the office swinging and banging itself independently against the office furniture as it indignantly departed pitcher seized a moment to remark to the bookkeeper that the old man seemed to get more absentminded and forgetful every day of the world  the rush and pace of business grew fiercer and faster on the floor they were pounding half a dozen stocks in which maxwells customers were heavy investors orders to buy and sell were coming and going as swift as the flight of swallows some of his own holdings were imperilled and the man was working like some highgeared delicate strong machinestrung to full tension going at full speed accurate never hesitating with the proper word and decision and act ready and prompt as clockwork stocks and bonds loans and mortgages margins and securitieshere was a world of finance and there was no room in it for the human world or the world of nature  when the luncheon hour drew near there came a slight lull in the uproar  maxwell stood by his desk with his hands full of telegrams and memoranda with a fountain pen over his right ear and his hair hanging in disorderly strings over his forehead his window was open for the beloved janitress spring had turned on a little warmth through the waking registers of the earth  and through the window came a wanderingperhaps a lostodoura delicate sweet odour of lilac that fixed the broker for a moment immovable for this odour belonged to miss leslie it was her own and hers only  the odour brought her vividly almost tangibly before him the world of finance dwindled suddenly to a speck and she was in the next roomtwenty steps away  by george ill do it now said maxwell half aloud ill ask her now i wonder i didnt do it long ago  he dashed into the inner office with the haste of a short trying to cover he charged upon the desk of the stenographer  she looked up at him with a smile a soft pink crept over her cheek and her eyes were kind and frank maxwell leaned one elbow on her desk he still clutched fluttering papers with both hands and the pen was above his ear  miss leslie he began hurriedly i have but a moment to spare i want to say something in that moment will you be my wife i havent had time to make love to you in the ordinary way but i really do love you talk quick pleasethose fellows are clubbing the stuffing out of union pacific  oh what are you talking about exclaimed the young lady she rose to her feet and gazed upon him roundeyed  dont you understand said maxwell restively i want you to marry me i love you miss leslie i wanted to tell you and i snatched a minute when things had slackened up a bit theyre calling me for the phone now tell em to wait a minute pitcher wont you miss leslie  the stenographer acted very queerly at first she seemed overcome with amazement then tears flowed from her wondering eyes and then she smiled sunnily through them and one of her arms slid tenderly about the brokers neck  i know now she said softly its this old business that has driven everything else out of your head for the time i was frightened at first dont you remember harvey we were married last evening at 8 oclock in the little church around the corner      after twenty years   the policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively the impressiveness was habitual and not for show for spectators were few the time was barely 10 oclock at night but chilly gusts of wind with a taste of rain in them had well nigh depeopled the streets  trying doors as he went twirling his club with many intricate and artful movements turning now and then to cast his watchful eye adown the pacific thoroughfare the officer with his stalwart form and slight swagger made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace the vicinity was one that kept early hours now and then you might see the lights of a cigar store or of an allnight lunch counter but the majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since been closed  when about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his walk in the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned with an unlighted cigar in his mouth as the policeman walked up to him the man spoke up quickly  its all right officer he said reassuringly im just waiting for a friend its an appointment made twenty years ago sounds a little funny to you doesnt it well ill explain if youd like to make certain its all straight about that long ago there used to be a restaurant where this store standsbig joe bradys restaurant  until five years ago said the policeman it was torn down then  the man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar the light showed a pale squarejawed face with keen eyes and a little white scar near his right eyebrow his scarfpin was a large diamond oddly set  twenty years ago tonight said the man i dined here at big joe bradys with jimmy wells my best chum and the finest chap in the world he and i were raised here in new york just like two brothers together i was eighteen and jimmy was twenty the next morning i was to start for the west to make my fortune you couldnt have dragged jimmy out of new york he thought it was the only place on earth well we agreed that night that we would meet here again exactly twenty years from that date and time no matter what our conditions might be or from what distance we might have to come we figured that in twenty years each of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made whatever they were going to be  it sounds pretty interesting said the policeman rather a long time between meets though it seems to me havent you heard from your friend since you left  well yes for a time we corresponded said the other but after a year or two we lost track of each other you see the west is a pretty big proposition and i kept hustling around over it pretty lively but i know jimmy will meet me here if hes alive for he always was the truest stanchest old chap in the world hell never forget i came a thousand miles to stand in this door tonight and its worth it if my old partner turns up  the waiting man pulled out a handsome watch the lids of it set with small diamonds  three minutes to ten he announced it was exactly ten oclock when we parted here at the restaurant door  did pretty well out west didnt you asked the policeman  you bet i hope jimmy has done half as well he was a kind of plodder though good fellow as he was ive had to compete with some of the sharpest wits going to get my pile a man gets in a groove in new york it takes the west to put a razoredge on him  the policeman twirled his club and took a step or two  ill be on my way hope your friend comes around all right going to call time on him sharp  i should say not said the other ill give him half an hour at least if jimmy is alive on earth hell be here by that time so long officer  goodnight sir said the policeman passing on along his beat trying doors as he went  there was now a fine cold drizzle falling and the wind had risen from its uncertain puffs into a steady blow the few foot passengers astir in that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat collars turned high and pocketed hands and in the door of the hardware store the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment uncertain almost to absurdity with the friend of his youth smoked his cigar and waited  about twenty minutes he waited and then a tall man in a long overcoat with collar turned up to his ears hurried across from the opposite side of the street he went directly to the waiting man  is that you bob he asked doubtfully  is that you jimmy wells cried the man in the door  bless my heart exclaimed the new arrival grasping both the others hands with his own its bob sure as fate i was certain id find you here if you were still in existence well well welltwenty years is a long time the old restaurants gone bob i wish it had lasted so we could have had another dinner there how has the west treated you old man  bully it has given me everything i asked it for youve changed lots jimmy i never thought you were so tall by two or three inches  oh i grew a bit after i was twenty  doing well in new york jimmy  moderately i have a position in one of the city departments come on bob well go around to a place i know of and have a good long talk about old times  the two men started up the street arm in arm the man from the west his egotism enlarged by success was beginning to outline the history of his career the other submerged in his overcoat listened with interest  at the corner stood a drug store brilliant with electric lights when they came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze upon the others face  the man from the west stopped suddenly and released his arm  youre not jimmy wells he snapped twenty years is a long time but not long enough to change a mans nose from a roman to a pug  it sometimes changes a good man into a bad one said the tall man youve been under arrest for ten minutes silky bob chicago thinks you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat with you going quietly are you thats sensible now before we go on to the station heres a note i was asked to hand you you may read it here at the window its from patrolman wells  the man from the west unfolded the little piece of paper handed him his hand was steady when he began to read but it trembled a little by the time he had finished the note was rather short     bob i was at the appointed place on time when you struck the    match to light your cigar i saw it was the face of the man wanted in    chicago somehow i couldnt do it myself so i went around and got    a plain clothes man to do the job      jimmy      lost on dress parade   mr towers chandler was pressing his evening suit in his hall bedroom one iron was heating on a small gas stove the other was being pushed vigorously back and forth to make the desirable crease that would be seen later on extending in straight lines from mr chandlers patent leather shoes to the edge of his lowcut vest so much of the heros toilet may be intrusted to our confidence the remainder may be guessed by those whom genteel poverty has driven to ignoble expedient our next view of him shall be as he descends the steps of his lodginghouse immaculately and correctly clothed calm assured handsomein appearance the typical new york young clubman setting out slightly bored to inaugurate the pleasures of the evening  chandlers honorarium was 18 per week he was employed in the office of an architect he was twentytwo years old he considered architecture to be truly an art and he honestly believedthough he would not have dared to admit it in new yorkthat the flatiron building was inferior in design to the great cathedral in milan  out of each weeks earnings chandler set aside 1 at the end of each ten weeks with the extra capital thus accumulated he purchased one gentlemans evening from the bargain counter of stingy old father time he arrayed himself in the regalia of millionaires and presidents he took himself to the quarter where life is brightest and showiest and there dined with taste and luxury with ten dollars a man may for a few hours play the wealthy idler to perfection the sum is ample for a wellconsidered meal a bottle bearing a respectable label commensurate tips a smoke cab fare and the ordinary etceteras  this one delectable evening culled from each dull seventy was to chandler a source of renascent bliss to the society bud comes but one début it stands alone sweet in her memory when her hair has whitened but to chandler each ten weeks brought a joy as keen as thrilling as new as the first had been to sit among bon vivants under palms in the swirl of concealed music to look upon the habitués of such a paradise and to be looked upon by themwhat is a girls first dance and shortsleeved tulle compared with this  up broadway chandler moved with the vespertine dress parade for this evening he was an exhibit as well as a gazer for the next sixtynine evenings he would be dining in cheviot and worsted at dubious table dhôtes at whirlwind lunch counters on sandwiches and beer in his hallbedroom he was willing to do that for he was a true son of the great city of razzledazzle and to him one evening in the limelight made up for many dark ones  chandler protracted his walk until the forties began to intersect the great and glittering primrose way for the evening was yet young and when one is of the beau monde only one day in seventy one loves to protract the pleasure eyes bright sinister curious admiring provocative alluring were bent upon him for his garb and air proclaimed him a devotee to the hour of solace and pleasure  at a certain corner he came to a standstill proposing to himself the question of turning back toward the showy and fashionable restaurant in which he usually dined on the evenings of his especial luxury just then a girl scuddled lightly around the corner slipped on a patch of icy snow and fell plump upon the sidewalk  chandler assisted her to her feet with instant and solicitous courtesy the girl hobbled to the wall of the building leaned against it and thanked him demurely  i think my ankle is strained she said it twisted when i fell  does it pain you much inquired chandler  only when i rest my weight upon it i think i will be able to walk in a minute or two  if i can be of any further service suggested the young man i will call a cab or  thank you said the girl softly but heartily i am sure you need not trouble yourself any further it was so awkward of me and my shoe heels are horridly commonsense i cant blame them at all  chandler looked at the girl and found her swiftly drawing his interest she was pretty in a refined way and her eye was both merry and kind she was inexpensively clothed in a plain black dress that suggested a sort of uniform such as shop girls wear her glossy darkbrown hair showed its coils beneath a cheap hat of black straw whose only ornament was a velvet ribbon and bow she could have posed as a model for the selfrespecting working girl of the best type  a sudden idea came into the head of the young architect he would ask this girl to dine with him here was the element that his splendid but solitary periodic feasts had lacked his brief season of elegant luxury would be doubly enjoyable if he could add to it a ladys society this girl was a lady he was sureher manner and speech settled that and in spite of her extremely plain attire he felt that he would be pleased to sit at table with her  these thoughts passed swiftly through his mind and he decided to ask her it was a breach of etiquette of course but oftentimes wageearning girls waived formalities in matters of this kind they were generally shrewd judges of men and thought better of their own judgment than they did of useless conventions his ten dollars discreetly expended would enable the two to dine very well indeed the dinner would no doubt be a wonderful experience thrown into the dull routine of the girls life and her lively appreciation of it would add to his own triumph and pleasure  i think he said to her with frank gravity that your foot needs a longer rest than you suppose now i am going to suggest a way in which you can give it that and at the same time do me a favour i was on my way to dine all by my lonely self when you came tumbling around the corner you come with me and well have a cozy dinner and a pleasant talk together and by that time your game ankle will carry you home very nicely i am sure  the girl looked quickly up into chandlers clear pleasant countenance her eyes twinkled once very brightly and then she smiled ingenuously  but we dont know each otherit wouldnt be right would it she said doubtfully  there is nothing wrong about it said the young man candidly ill introduce myselfpermit memr towers chandler after our dinner which i will try to make as pleasant as possible i will bid you goodevening or attend you safely to your door whichever you prefer  but dear me said the girl with a glance at chandlers faultless attire in this old dress and hat  never mind that said chandler cheerfully im sure you look more charming in them than any one we shall see in the most elaborate dinner toilette  my ankle does hurt yet admitted the girl attempting a limping step i think i will accept your invitation mr chandler you may call memiss marian  come then miss marian said the young architect gaily but with perfect courtesy you will not have far to walk there is a very respectable and good restaurant in the next block you will have to lean on my armsoand walk slowly it is lonely dining all by ones self im just a little bit glad that you slipped on the ice  when the two were established at a wellappointed table with a promising waiter hovering in attendance chandler began to experience the real joy that his regular outing always brought to him  the restaurant was not so showy or pretentious as the one further down broadway which he always preferred but it was nearly so the tables were well filled with prosperouslooking diners there was a good orchestra playing softly enough to make conversation a possible pleasure and the cuisine and service were beyond criticism his companion even in her cheap hat and dress held herself with an air that added distinction to the natural beauty of her face and figure and it is certain that she looked at chandler with his animated but selfpossessed manner and his kindling and frank blue eyes with something not far from admiration in her own charming face  then it was that the madness of manhattan the frenzy of fuss and feathers the bacillus of brag the provincial plague of pose seized upon towers chandler he was on broadway surrounded by pomp and style and there were eyes to look at him on the stage of that comedy he had assumed to play the onenight part of a butterfly of fashion and an idler of means and taste he was dressed for the part and all his good angels had not the power to prevent him from acting it  so he began to prate to miss marian of clubs of teas of golf and riding and kennels and cotillions and tours abroad and threw out hints of a yacht lying at larchmont he could see that she was vastly impressed by this vague talk so he endorsed his pose by random insinuations concerning great wealth and mentioned familiarly a few names that are handled reverently by the proletariat it was chandlers short little day and he was wringing from it the best that could be had as he saw it and yet once or twice he saw the pure gold of this girl shine through the mist that his egotism had raised between him and all objects  this way of living that you speak of she said sounds so futile and purposeless havent you any work to do in the world that might interest you more  my dear miss marian he exclaimedwork think of dressing every day for dinner of making half a dozen calls in an afternoonwith a policeman at every corner ready to jump into your auto and take you to the station if you get up any greater speed than a donkey carts gait we donothings are the hardest workers in the land  the dinner was concluded the waiter generously fed and the two walked out to the corner where they had met miss marian walked very well now her limp was scarcely noticeable  thank you for a nice time she said frankly i must run home now i liked the dinner very much mr chandler  he shook hands with her smiling cordially and said something about a game of bridge at his club he watched her for a moment walking rather rapidly eastward and then he found a cab to drive him slowly homeward  in his chilly bedroom chandler laid away his evening clothes for a sixtynine days rest he went about it thoughtfully  that was a stunning girl he said to himself shes all right too id be sworn even if she does have to work perhaps if id told her the truth instead of all that razzledazzle we mightbut confound it i had to play up to my clothes  thus spoke the brave who was born and reared in the wigwams of the tribe of the manhattans  the girl after leaving her entertainer sped swiftly crosstown until she arrived at a handsome and sedate mansion two squares to the east facing on that avenue which is the highway of mammon and the auxiliary gods here she entered hurriedly and ascended to a room where a handsome young lady in an elaborate house dress was looking anxiously out the window  oh you madcap exclaimed the elder girl when the other entered when will you quit frightening us this way it is two hours since you ran out in that rag of an old dress and maries hat mamma has been so alarmed she sent louis in the auto to try to find you you are a bad thoughtless puss  the elder girl touched a button and a maid came in a moment  marie tell mamma that miss marian has returned  dont scold sister i only ran down to mme theos to tell her to use mauve insertion instead of pink my costume and maries hat were just what i needed every one thought i was a shopgirl i am sure  dinner is over dear you stayed so late  i know i slipped on the sidewalk and turned my ankle i could not walk so i hobbled into a restaurant and sat there until i was better that is why i was so long  the two girls sat in the window seat looking out at the lights and the stream of hurrying vehicles in the avenue the younger one cuddled down with her head in her sisters lap  we will have to marry some day she said dreamilyboth of us we have so much money that we will not be allowed to disappoint the public do you want me to tell you the kind of a man i could love sis  go on you scatterbrain smiled the other  i could love a man with dark and kind blue eyes who is gentle and respectful to poor girls who is handsome and good and does not try to flirt but i could love him only if he had an ambition an object some work to do in the world i would not care how poor he was if i could help him build his way up but sister dear the kind of man we always meetthe man who lives an idle life between society and his clubsi could not love a man like that even if his eyes were blue and he were ever so kind to poor girls whom he met in the street      by courier   it was neither the season nor the hour when the park had frequenters and it is likely that the young lady who was seated on one of the benches at the side of the walk had merely obeyed a sudden impulse to sit for a while and enjoy a foretaste of coming spring  she rested there pensive and still a certain melancholy that touched her countenance must have been of recent birth for it had not yet altered the fine and youthful contours of her cheek nor subdued the arch though resolute curve of her lips  a tall young man came striding through the park along the path near which she sat behind him tagged a boy carrying a suitcase at sight of the young lady the mans face changed to red and back to pale again he watched her countenance as he drew nearer with hope and anxiety mingled on his own he passed within a few yards of her but he saw no evidence that she was aware of his presence or existence  some fifty yards further on he suddenly stopped and sat on a bench at one side the boy dropped the suitcase and stared at him with wondering shrewd eyes the young man took out his handkerchief and wiped his brow it was a good handkerchief a good brow and the young man was good to look at he said to the boy  i want you to take a message to that young lady on that bench tell her i am on my way to the station to leave for san francisco where i shall join that alaska moosehunting expedition tell her that since she has commanded me neither to speak nor to write to her i take this means of making one last appeal to her sense of justice for the sake of what has been tell her that to condemn and discard one who has not deserved such treatment without giving him her reasons or a chance to explain is contrary to her nature as i believe it to be tell her that i have thus to a certain degree disobeyed her injunctions in the hope that she may yet be inclined to see justice done go and tell her that  the young man dropped a halfdollar into the boys hand the boy looked at him for a moment with bright canny eyes out of a dirty intelligent face and then set off at a run he approached the lady on the bench a little doubtfully but unembarrassed he touched the brim of the old plaid bicycle cap perched on the back of his head the lady looked at him coolly without prejudice or favour  lady he said dat gent on de oder bench sent yer a song and dance by me if yer dont know de guy and hes tryin to do de johnny act say de word and ill call a cop in tree minutes if yer does know him and hes on de square wy ill spiel yer de bunch of hot air he sent yer  the young lady betrayed a faint interest  a song and dance she said in a deliberate sweet voice that seemed to clothe her words in a diaphanous garment of impalpable irony a new ideain the troubadour line i suppose iused to know the gentleman who sent you so i think it will hardly be necessary to call the police you may execute your song and dance but do not sing too loudly it is a little early yet for openair vaudeville and we might attract attention  awe said the boy with a shrug down the length of him yer know what i mean lady taint a turn its wind he told me to tell yer hes got his collars and cuffs in dat grip for a scoot clean out to frisco den hes goin to shoot snowbirds in de klondike he says yer told him not to send round no more pink notes nor come hangin over de garden gate and he takes dis means of puttin yer wise he says yer refereed him out like a hasbeen and never give him no chance to kick at de decision he says yer swiped him and never said why  the slightly awakened interest in the young ladys eyes did not abate perhaps it was caused by either the originality or the audacity of the snowbird hunter in thus circumventing her express commands against the ordinary modes of communication she fixed her eye on a statue standing disconsolate in the dishevelled park and spoke into the transmitter  tell the gentleman that i need not repeat to him a description of my ideals he knows what they have been and what they still are so far as they touch on this case absolute loyalty and truth are the ones paramount tell him that i have studied my own heart as well as one can and i know its weakness as well as i do its needs that is why i decline to hear his pleas whatever they may be i did not condemn him through hearsay or doubtful evidence and that is why i made no charge but since he persists in hearing what he already well knows you may convey the matter  tell him that i entered the conservatory that evening from the rear to cut a rose for my mother tell him i saw him and miss ashburton beneath the pink oleander the tableau was pretty but the pose and juxtaposition were too eloquent and evident to require explanation i left the conservatory and at the same time the rose and my ideal you may carry that song and dance to your impresario  im shy on one word lady juxjuxput me wise on dat will yer  juxtapositionor you may call it propinquityor if you like being rather too near for one maintaining the position of an ideal  the gravel spun from beneath the boys feet he stood by the other bench the mans eyes interrogated him hungrily the boys were shining with the impersonal zeal of the translator  de lady says dat shes on to de fact dat gals is dead easy when a feller comes spielin ghost stories and tryin to make up and dats why she wont listen to no softsoap she says she caught yer dead to rights huggin a bunch o calico in de hothouse she sidestepped in to pull some posies and yer was squeezin de oder gal to beat de band she says it looked cute all right all right but it made her sick she says yer better git busy and make a sneak for de train  the young man gave a low whistle and his eyes flashed with a sudden thought his hand flew to the inside pocket of his coat and drew out a handful of letters selecting one he handed it to the boy following it with a silver dollar from his vestpocket  give that letter to the lady he said and ask her to read it tell her that it should explain the situation tell her that if she had mingled a little trust with her conception of the ideal much heartache might have been avoided tell her that the loyalty she prizes so much has never wavered tell her i am waiting for an answer  the messenger stood before the lady  de gent says hes had de skibunk put on him widout no cause he says hes no bum guy and lady yer read dat letter and ill bet yer hes a white sport all right  the young lady unfolded the letter somewhat doubtfully and read it      dear dr arnold i want to thank you for your most kind and    opportune aid to my daughter last friday evening when she was    overcome by an attack of her old hearttrouble in the conservatory    at mrs waldrons reception had you not been near to catch her as    she fell and to render proper attention we might have lost her i    would be glad if you would call and undertake the treatment of her    case    gratefully yours    robert ashburton   the young lady refolded the letter and handed it to the boy  de gent wants an answer said the messenger wots de word  the ladys eyes suddenly flashed on him bright smiling and wet  tell that guy on the other bench she said with a happy tremulous laugh that his girl wants him      the furnished room   restless shifting fugacious as time itself is a certain vast bulk of the population of the red brick district of the lower west side homeless they have a hundred homes they flit from furnished room to furnished room transients forevertransients in abode transients in heart and mind they sing home sweet home in ragtime they carry their lares et penates in a bandbox their vine is entwined about a picture hat a rubber plant is their fig tree  hence the houses of this district having had a thousand dwellers should have a thousand tales to tell mostly dull ones no doubt but it would be strange if there could not be found a ghost or two in the wake of all these vagrant guests  one evening after dark a young man prowled among these crumbling red mansions ringing their bells at the twelfth he rested his lean handbaggage upon the step and wiped the dust from his hatband and forehead the bell sounded faint and far away in some remote hollow depths  to the door of this the twelfth house whose bell he had rung came a housekeeper who made him think of an unwholesome surfeited worm that had eaten its nut to a hollow shell and now sought to fill the vacancy with edible lodgers  he asked if there was a room to let  come in said the housekeeper her voice came from her throat her throat seemed lined with fur i have the third floor back vacant since a week back should you wish to look at it  the young man followed her up the stairs a faint light from no particular source mitigated the shadows of the halls they trod noiselessly upon a stair carpet that its own loom would have forsworn it seemed to have become vegetable to have degenerated in that rank sunless air to lush lichen or spreading moss that grew in patches to the staircase and was viscid under the foot like organic matter at each turn of the stairs were vacant niches in the wall perhaps plants had once been set within them if so they had died in that foul and tainted air it may be that statues of the saints had stood there but it was not difficult to conceive that imps and devils had dragged them forth in the darkness and down to the unholy depths of some furnished pit below  this is the room said the housekeeper from her furry throat its a nice room it aint often vacant i had some most elegant people in it last summerno trouble at all and paid in advance to the minute the waters at the end of the hall sprowls and mooney kept it three months they done a vaudeville sketch miss bretta sprowlsyou may have heard of heroh that was just the stage namesright there over the dresser is where the marriage certificate hung framed the gas is here and you see there is plenty of closet room its a room everybody likes it never stays idle long  do you have many theatrical people rooming here asked the young man  they comes and goes a good proportion of my lodgers is connected with the theatres yes sir this is the theatrical district actor people never stays long anywhere i get my share yes they comes and they goes  he engaged the room paying for a week in advance he was tired he said and would take possession at once he counted out the money the room had been made ready she said even to towels and water as the housekeeper moved away he put for the thousandth time the question that he carried at the end of his tongue  a young girlmiss vashnermiss eloise vashnerdo you remember such a one among your lodgers she would be singing on the stage most likely a fair girl of medium height and slender with reddish gold hair and a dark mole near her left eyebrow  no i dont remember the name them stage people has names they change as often as their rooms they comes and they goes no i dont call that one to mind  no always no five months of ceaseless interrogation and the inevitable negative so much time spent by day in questioning managers agents schools and choruses by night among the audiences of theatres from allstar casts down to music halls so low that he dreaded to find what he most hoped for he who had loved her best had tried to find her he was sure that since her disappearance from home this great watergirt city held her somewhere but it was like a monstrous quicksand shifting its particles constantly with no foundation its upper granules of today buried tomorrow in ooze and slime  the furnished room received its latest guest with a first glow of pseudohospitality a hectic haggard perfunctory welcome like the specious smile of a demirep the sophistical comfort came in reflected gleams from the decayed furniture the ragged brocade upholstery of a couch and two chairs a footwide cheap pier glass between the two windows from one or two gilt picture frames and a brass bedstead in a corner  the guest reclined inert upon a chair while the room confused in speech as though it were an apartment in babel tried to discourse to him of its divers tenantry  a polychromatic rug like some brilliantflowered rectangular tropical islet lay surrounded by a billowy sea of soiled matting upon the gaypapered wall were those pictures that pursue the homeless one from house to housethe huguenot lovers the first quarrel the wedding breakfast psyche at the fountain the mantels chastely severe outline was ingloriously veiled behind some pert drapery drawn rakishly askew like the sashes of the amazonian ballet upon it was some desolate flotsam cast aside by the rooms marooned when a lucky sail had borne them to a fresh porta trifling vase or two pictures of actresses a medicine bottle some stray cards out of a deck  one by one as the characters of a cryptograph become explicit the little signs left by the furnished rooms procession of guests developed a significance the threadbare space in the rug in front of the dresser told that lovely woman had marched in the throng tiny finger prints on the wall spoke of little prisoners trying to feel their way to sun and air a splattered stain raying like the shadow of a bursting bomb witnessed where a hurled glass or bottle had splintered with its contents against the wall across the pier glass had been scrawled with a diamond in staggering letters the name marie it seemed that the succession of dwellers in the furnished room had turned in furyperhaps tempted beyond forbearance by its garish coldnessand wreaked upon it their passions the furniture was chipped and bruised the couch distorted by bursting springs seemed a horrible monster that had been slain during the stress of some grotesque convulsion some more potent upheaval had cloven a great slice from the marble mantel each plank in the floor owned its particular cant and shriek as from a separate and individual agony it seemed incredible that all this malice and injury had been wrought upon the room by those who had called it for a time their home and yet it may have been the cheated home instinct surviving blindly the resentful rage at false household gods that had kindled their wrath a hut that is our own we can sweep and adorn and cherish  the young tenant in the chair allowed these thoughts to file softshod through his mind while there drifted into the room furnished sounds and furnished scents he heard in one room a tittering and incontinent slack laughter in others the monologue of a scold the rattling of dice a lullaby and one crying dully above him a banjo tinkled with spirit doors banged somewhere the elevated trains roared intermittently a cat yowled miserably upon a back fence and he breathed the breath of the housea dank savour rather than a smella cold musty effluvium as from underground vaults mingled with the reeking exhalations of linoleum and mildewed and rotten woodwork  then suddenly as he rested there the room was filled with the strong sweet odour of mignonette it came as upon a single buffet of wind with such sureness and fragrance and emphasis that it almost seemed a living visitant and the man cried aloud what dear as if he had been called and sprang up and faced about the rich odour clung to him and wrapped him around he reached out his arms for it all his senses for the time confused and commingled how could one be peremptorily called by an odour surely it must have been a sound but was it not the sound that had touched that had caressed him  she has been in this room he cried and he sprang to wrest from it a token for he knew he would recognize the smallest thing that had belonged to her or that she had touched this enveloping scent of mignonette the odour that she had loved and made her ownwhence came it  the room had been but carelessly set in order scattered upon the flimsy dresser scarf were half a dozen hairpinsthose discreet indistinguishable friends of womankind feminine of gender infinite of mood and uncommunicative of tense these he ignored conscious of their triumphant lack of identity ransacking the drawers of the dresser he came upon a discarded tiny ragged handkerchief he pressed it to his face it was racy and insolent with heliotrope he hurled it to the floor in another drawer he found odd buttons a theatre programme a pawnbrokers card two lost marshmallows a book on the divination of dreams in the last was a womans black satin hair bow which halted him poised between ice and fire but the black satin hairbow also is femininitys demure impersonal common ornament and tells no tales  and then he traversed the room like a hound on the scent skimming the walls considering the corners of the bulging matting on his hands and knees rummaging mantel and tables the curtains and hangings the drunken cabinet in the corner for a visible sign unable to perceive that she was there beside around against within above him clinging to him wooing him calling him so poignantly through the finer senses that even his grosser ones became cognisant of the call once again he answered loudly yes dear and turned wildeyed to gaze on vacancy for he could not yet discern form and colour and love and outstretched arms in the odour of mignonette oh god whence that odour and since when have odours had a voice to call thus he groped  he burrowed in crevices and corners and found corks and cigarettes these he passed in passive contempt but once he found in a fold of the matting a halfsmoked cigar and this he ground beneath his heel with a green and trenchant oath he sifted the room from end to end he found dreary and ignoble small records of many a peripatetic tenant but of her whom he sought and who may have lodged there and whose spirit seemed to hover there he found no trace  and then he thought of the housekeeper  he ran from the haunted room downstairs and to a door that showed a crack of light she came out to his knock he smothered his excitement as best he could  will you tell me madam he besought her who occupied the room i have before i came  yes sir i can tell you again twas sprowls and mooney as i said miss bretta sprowls it was in the theatres but missis mooney she was my house is well known for respectability the marriage certificate hung framed on a nail over  what kind of a lady was miss sprowlsin looks i mean  why blackhaired sir short and stout with a comical face they left a week ago tuesday  and before they occupied it  why there was a single gentleman connected with the draying business he left owing me a week before him was missis crowder and her two children that stayed four months and back of them was old mr doyle whose sons paid for him he kept the room six months that goes back a year sir and further i do not remember  he thanked her and crept back to his room the room was dead the essence that had vivified it was gone the perfume of mignonette had departed in its place was the old stale odour of mouldy house furniture of atmosphere in storage  the ebbing of his hope drained his faith he sat staring at the yellow singing gaslight soon he walked to the bed and began to tear the sheets into strips with the blade of his knife he drove them tightly into every crevice around windows and door when all was snug and taut he turned out the light turned the gas full on again and laid himself gratefully upon the bed                                          it was mrs mccools night to go with the can for beer so she fetched it and sat with mrs purdy in one of those subterranean retreats where housekeepers foregather and the worm dieth

critical but for that mole she had agrowin by her left eyebrow do fill up your glass again mrs mccool      the brief dÉbut of tildy   if you do not know bogles chop house and family restaurant it is your loss for if you are one of the fortunate ones who dine expensively you should be interested to know how the other half consumes provisions and if you belong to the half to whom waiters checks are things of moment you should know bogles for there you get your moneys worthin quantity at least  bogles is situated in that highway of bourgeoisie that boulevard of brownjonesandrobinson eighth avenue there are two rows of tables in the room six in each row on each table is a casterstand containing cruets of condiments and seasons from the pepper cruet you may shake a cloud of something tasteless and melancholy like volcanic dust from the salt cruet you may expect nothing though a man should extract a sanguinary stream from the pallid turnip yet will his prowess be balked when he comes to wrest salt from bogles cruets also upon each table stands the counterfeit of that benign sauce made from the recipe of a nobleman in india  at the cashiers desk sits bogle cold sordid slow smouldering and takes your money behind a mountain of toothpicks he makes your change files your check and ejects at you like a toad a word about the weather beyond a corroboration of his meteorological statement you would better not venture you are not bogles friend you are a fed transient customer and you and he may not meet again until the blowing of gabriels dinner horn so take your change and goto the devil if you like there you have bogles sentiments  the needs of bogles customers were supplied by two waitresses and a voice one of the waitresses was named aileen she was tall beautiful lively gracious and learned in persiflage her other name there was no more necessity for another name at bogles than there was for fingerbowls  the name of the other waitress was tildy why do you suggest matilda please listen this timetildytildy tildy was dumpy plainfaced and too anxious to please to please repeat the last clause to yourself once or twice and make the acquaintance of the duplicate infinite  the voice at bogles was invisible it came from the kitchen and did not shine in the way of originality it was a heathen voice and contented itself with vain repetitions of exclamations emitted by the waitresses concerning food  will it tire you to be told again that aileen was beautiful had she donned a few hundred dollars worth of clothes and joined the easter parade and had you seen her you would have hastened to say so yourself  the customers at bogles were her slaves six tables full she could wait upon at once they who were in a hurry restrained their impatience for the joy of merely gazing upon her swiftly moving graceful figure they who had finished eating ate more that they might continue in the light of her smiles every man thereand they were mostly mentried to make his impression upon her  aileen could successfully exchange repartee against a dozen at once and every smile that she sent forth lodged like pellets from a scattergun in as many hearts and all this while she would be performing astounding feats with orders of pork and beans pot roasts hamand sausageandthewheats and any quantity of things on the iron and in the pan and straight up and on the side with all this feasting and flirting and merry exchange of wit bogles came mighty near being a salon with aileen for its madame récamier  if the transients were entranced by the fascinating aileen the regulars were her adorers there was much rivalry among many of the steady customers aileen could have had an engagement every evening at least twice a week some one took her to a theatre or to a dance one stout gentleman whom she and tildy had privately christened the hog presented her with a turquoise ring another one known as freshy who rode on the traction companys repair wagon was going to give her a poodle as soon as his brother got the hauling contract in the ninth and the man who always ate spareribs and spinach and said he was a stock broker asked her to go to parsifal with him  i dont know where this place is said aileen while talking it over with tildy but the weddingrings got to be on before i put a stitch into a travelling dressaint that right well i guess  but tildy  in steaming chattering cabbagescented bogles there was almost a heart tragedy tildy with the blunt nose the haycoloured hair the freckled skin the bagomeal figure had never had an admirer not a man followed her with his eyes when she went to and fro in the restaurant save now and then when they glared with the beasthunger for food none of them bantered her gaily to coquettish interchanges of wit none of them loudly jollied her of mornings as they did aileen accusing her when the eggs were slow in coming of late hours in the company of envied swains no one had ever given her a turquoise ring or invited her upon a voyage to mysterious distant parsifal  tildy was a good waitress and the men tolerated her they who sat at her tables spoke to her briefly with quotations from the bill of fare and then raised their voices in honeyed and otherwiseflavoured accents eloquently addressed to the fair aileen they writhed in their chairs to gaze around and over the impending form of tildy that aileens pulchritude might season and make ambrosia of their bacon and eggs  and tildy was content to be the unwooed drudge if aileen could receive the flattery and the homage the blunt nose was loyal to the short grecian she was aileens friend and she was glad to see her rule hearts and wean the attention of men from smoking potpie and lemon meringue but deep below our freckles and haycoloured hair the unhandsomest of us dream of a prince or a princess not vicarious but coming to us alone  there was a morning when aileen tripped in to work with a slightly bruised eye and tildys solicitude was almost enough to heal any optic  fresh guy explained aileen last night as i was going home at twentythird and sixth sashayed up so he did and made a break i turned him down cold and he made a sneak but followed me down to eighteenth and tried his hot air again gee but i slapped him a good one side of the face then he give me that eye does it look real awful til i should hate that mr nicholson should see it when he comes in for his tea and toast at ten  tildy listened to the adventure with breathless admiration no man had ever tried to follow her she was safe abroad at any hour of the twentyfour what bliss it must have been to have had a man follow one and black ones eye for love  among the customers at bogles was a young man named seeders who worked in a laundry office mr seeders was thin and had light hair and appeared to have been recently roughdried and starched he was too diffident to aspire to aileens notice so he usually sat at one of tildys tables where he devoted himself to silence and boiled weakfish  one day when mr seeders came in to dinner he had been drinking beer there were only two or three customers in the restaurant when mr seeders had finished his weakfish he got up put his arm around tildys waist kissed her loudly and impudently walked out upon the street snapped his fingers in the direction of the laundry and hied himself to play pennies in the slot machines at the amusement arcade  for a few moments tildy stood petrified then she was aware of aileen shaking at her an arch forefinger and saying  why til you naughty girl aint you getting to be awful miss slyboots first thing i know youll be stealing some of my fellows i must keep an eye on you my lady  another thing dawned upon tildys recovering wits in a moment she had advanced from a hopeless lowly admirer to be an evesister of the potent aileen she herself was now a mancharmer a mark for cupid a sabine who must be coy when the romans were at their banquet boards man had found her waist achievable and her lips desirable the sudden and amatory seeders had as it were performed for her a miraculous piece of oneday laundry work he had taken the sackcloth of her uncomeliness had washed dried starched and ironed it and returned it to her sheer embroidered lawnthe robe of venus herself  the freckles on tildys cheeks merged into a rosy flush now both circe and psyche peeped from her brightened eyes not even aileen herself had been publicly embraced and kissed in the restaurant  tildy could not keep the delightful secret when trade was slack she went and stood at bogles desk her eyes were shining she tried not to let her words sound proud and boastful  a gentleman insulted me today she said he hugged me around the waist and kissed me  that so said bogle cracking open his business armour after this week you get a dollar a week more  at the next regular meal when tildy set food before customers with whom she had acquaintance she said to each of them modestly as one whose merit needed no bolstering  a gentleman insulted me today in the restaurant he put his arm around my waist and kissed me  the diners accepted the revelation in various wayssome incredulously some with congratulations others turned upon her the stream of badinage that had hitherto been directed at aileen alone and tildys heart swelled in her bosom for she saw at last the towers of romance rise above the horizon of the grey plain in which she had for so long travelled  for two days mr seeders came not again during that time tildy established herself firmly as a woman to be wooed she bought ribbons and arranged her hair like aileens and tightened her waist two inches she had a thrilling but delightful fear that mr seeders would rush in suddenly and shoot her with a pistol he must have loved her desperately and impulsive lovers are always blindly jealous  even aileen had not been shot at with a pistol and then tildy rather hoped that he would not shoot at her for she was always loyal to aileen and she did not want to overshadow her friend  at 4 oclock on the afternoon of the third day mr seeders came in there were no customers at the tables at the back end of the restaurant tildy was refilling the mustard pots and aileen was quartering pies mr seeders walked back to where they stood  tildy looked up and saw him gasped and pressed the mustard spoon against her heart a red hairbow was in her hair she wore venuss eighth avenue badge the blue bead necklace with the swinging silver symbolic heart  mr seeders was flushed and embarrassed he plunged one hand into his hip pocket and the other into a fresh pumpkin pie  miss tildy said he i want to apologise for what i done the other evenin tell you the truth i was pretty well tanked up or i wouldnt of done it i wouldnt do no lady that away when i was sober so i hope miss tildy youll accept my pology and believe that i wouldnt of done it if id known what i was doin and hadnt of been drunk  with this handsome plea mr seeders backed away and departed feeling that reparation had been made  but behind the convenient screen tildy had thrown herself flat upon a table among the butter chips and the coffee cups and was sobbing her heart outout and back again to the grey plain wherein travel they with blunt noses and haycoloured hair from her knot she had torn the red hairbow and cast it upon the floor seeders she despised utterly she had but taken his kiss as that of a pioneer and prophetic prince who might have set the clocks going and the pages to running in fairyland but the kiss had been maudlin and unmeant the court had not stirred at the false alarm she must forevermore remain the sleeping beauty  yet not all was lost aileens arm was around her and tildys red hand groped among the butter chips till it found the warm clasp of her friends  dont you fret til said aileen who did not understand entirely that turnipfaced little clothespin of a seeders aint worth it he aint anything of a gentleman or he wouldnt ever of apologised
