the sierra blanca countryeverybody admits it sherman f bidwell was saying as the widow delaney who kept the palace home cooking restaurant in the town of delaney named after her husband old dan delaney came into the diningroom mrs delaney paused with a plate of steaming potatoes and her face was a mask of scorn as she addressed the group but her words were aimed especially at bidwell who had just come in from the lower country to resume his prospecting up the gulch  its aisy sayin gould is in thim hills but when ye find it rainbows will be fishinrods as she passed the potatoes over bidwells head she went on didnt dan delaney break his blessed neck aclimbin the high places up the creekto no purpis includin that same accident you min may talk and talk but talk dont pay for petaties and bacon mind that for eight years ive been here and im worse off today than iver beforean the town phwat is it two saloons and a boardinhouseand not a ton of ore dugmuch less shipped out yr large words dig no dirt im thinkin sherm bidwell  bidwell was a mildspoken man who walked a little sidewise with eyes always on the ground as though ceaselessly searching for pieces of float he replied to his landlady with some spirit ive chashayed around these mountains ever since i got back from californey in fiftyfour and i know good rocks i cant just lay my pick on the vein but im due to find it soon for im agettin old why consider the float its everywhereand you know theres colors in every sandbar theres got to be a ledge somewhere close by  the widow snorted hah yiss float me windysills is burthened with dirty floatbut wheres the gould  ill find it mrs delaneybut you must be patient he mildly replied  pashint me pashint sure job was a complainin millwheel beside me sherm bidwell me boarders have shrunk to five and youre one o the fiveand here you are after another grubstake to go picnicking into the mountains wid i know your smooth tonguesure i dobut yere up against me determination this toime me prince ye dont get a pound o meat nor a measure o flour from maggie delaney  bidwell sat with an air of resigned christian fortitude while the widow delivered herself to tell the truth he had listened to these precise words beforeand resented them only because spoken publicly  the other boarders finished their supper in silence and went out but bidwell lingered to wheedle the mistress while she ate her own fill at the splotched and littered table the kerosenelamp stood close to her plate and brought out the glow of her cheek and deepened the blue of her eyes into violet she was still on the right side of forty and well cared for  bidwell shot a shy glance at her i like to stir you up maggie darlin it makes you purty as a girl  she caught up a loaf of bread and heaved it at him he caught it deftly and inquired guilelessly is this the first of my grubstake lassie  it is not tis the last crumb yell have of me out wid ye grubstake indade you go out this night me bucko  bidwell rose in pretended fright and shuffled to the door i dont need mucha couple o sacks o flour  she lifted an arm you tramp  he slammed the door just in time to prevent a cup from flying straight into his smiling eyes after a moment of silent laughter and with a wink at the men in the office he reopened the door and said  yere a warmhearted handsome girl maggie two strips o bacon  a muffled cry and a crash caused him to again slam the door and withdraw  coming back to the middle of the room he took out his pipe and began to fill it one of the younger men said  youll get that grubstake over the eye the widdy is dangerous tonight  sherm seemed not much concerned having fired his pipe he took a piece of rock from his pocket what do you think o this he inquired casually  the other examined it eagerly and broke out jeecripes why say thats jest rotten with gold whered you find it  out in the hills was the placid reply a new veinhigh up  the third man took the rock and said that vein has got to be low downthat cant come from high up were on the wrong trail think o cripple creekmines right under the grass on the hills yer cant fool me  but we know the veins are highweve seen em argued the other men  yesbut theyre different veins this rock comes from lower down  what do you say to that sherm  one guess is as good as another he replied and moved away with his piece of ore  the old mans mighty fly this evenin i wonder if he really has trailed that float to a standstill id sooner think hes stringin us  bidwell went out on the edge of the ravine and for a long time sat on a rock listening to the roar of the swift stream and looking up at the peaks which were still covered with heavy yellow snow stained with the impalpable dust which the winter winds had rasped from the exposed ledges of rock it was chill in the cañon and the old man shivered with cold as well as with a sense of discouragement for twenty years he had regularly gone down into the valleys in winter to earn money with which to prospect in summerall to no purpose for years margaret delaney had been his very present help in time of trouble and now she had broken with him and under his mask of smiling incredulity he carried a profoundly disturbed conscience his benefactress was in deadly earnestshe meant every word she saidthat he felt and unless she relented he was lost for he had returned from the valley this time without a dollar to call his own he had a big strong mule and some blankets and a saddlenothing further  the wind grew stronger and keener roaring down the cañon with the breath of the upper snows and the mans blood cried out for a fire june stands close to winter in the high ranges of the crestones and at last he rose stiffly and returned to the little sittingroom where he found the widow in the midst of an argument with her boarders to prove that they were all fools together for hangin to the side of a mountain that had no more gould in it than a flatiron or a loomp o coalsure thing  what you goin to do about our assays asked young johnson  assays is it annybody can have assaysthat will pay the price yere all lazy dogs in the manger thats phwat ye air ye assay and want somebody else to pay ye fer the privilege of workin why dont ye work yersilvesye loots sit around here expectin some wan ilse to shovel gould into yer hat yell pay me yer boardmoind that she ended making a personal application of her theories ivery wan o ye  if any lingering resolution remained in bidwells heart it melted away as he listened to mrs delaneys throaty voice and plain blunt words opening the door timidly he walked in and without looking at the angry woman seized upon his bundles which lay behind the door  the widows voice rang out where ye gawun wid thim bags  bidwell straightened theyre my bundles i reckon cant a man do as he likes with his own  not whin hes owin fer board put thim boondles down  the culprit sighed and sat down on the bundles even young johnson lost his desire to laugh for bidwell looked pathetically old and discouraged at the moment as he mildly asked  you wouldnt send a man out in the night without his blankets would you  id send a sneak to purgatoryif i cud ye thought yed ooze out did ye nice speciment you are  bidwell was roused if i had planned to sneak i wouldnt a come into the room with you astandin in the middle of the floor he replied with some firmness you ordered me out didnt you well im goin i cant pay youyou knew that when you told me to goand i owe you a good deali admit thatbut im going to pay it but i must have a little time  the other men with a grateful sense of delicacy got up and went out leaving bidwell free space to justify himself in the eyes of the angry woman  as the door slammed behind the last man the widow walked over and gave bidwell a cuff get off thim boondles gaw set on a chair like a man an not squat there like a baboon she pitched his bundles through an open door into a small bedroom ye know where yer bed is i hope i do know phwat dan delaney wud say to me housin and feedin the likes o you but ill do it wan more summerand then ye gaw flyin ye hear that now  and she threw the door back on its hinges so sharply that a knob was broken  bidwell went in closed the door gently and took to his bed dazed with this sudden change in the climate shes come round beforeand surprised me he thought but never so durn sudden as this i hope she aint sick or anything  next morning at breakfast maggie was all smiles the storm of the evening before had given place to brilliant sunshine she ignored all winks and nudgings among her boarders and did not scruple to point out to bidwell the choicest biscuit on the plate and to hand him the fattest slice of bacon all of which he accepted without elation  old sherm must be one o these hypnotical chaps said johnson as they were lighting their pipes in the sittingroom hes converted the widow into another helping hes goin to get his flour and bacon all right  you bet he is and anything else he wants beats me what she finds in that old sidewinder anyhow  oh sherm isnt so worse if he had a decent outfit  bidwell was deeply touched by maggies clemency and would have put his feelings into the best terms he was familiar with but the widow stopped him  the best way to thank me is to hustle out and trail up that float if its there find it if its not there give oer the search for ye are a gray man sherm bidwell and im not the woman i was eight years ago  in the exaltation of the moment bidwell rose and his shoulders were squared as he said im agoin maggie if i find it ill come back and marry you if i dontill lay my useless old bones in the hills  ahgo long dont be a crazy fool she said but her face flushed with pleasure at the sincerity of his tone yeve made such promises ivery time before  i know i have but i mean it now  aho so thats the way of itye didnt mean it before is that phwat yere sayin  his proud pose collapsed you know what i meanonly youre such a tormentin little devil  thank ye for the compliment mr bidwell  bidwell turned im going after old nebuchadnezzar he said firmly i cant waste time on a chickenheaded woman  out wid ye before i break the measly head of ye she retorted  an hour later with his mule packed with food and blankets and tools he moved off up the trail the other men stood to watch him go consumed with curiosity yet withholding all question  the widow did not so much as look from the door as her grubstaker disappeared   ii  three days later bidwell crept stealthily down the trail leading his mule as silently as possible he timed his arrival so that mrs delaney would be in the kitchen alone with the chinaman getting the dishes ready for breakfast  who is ut called the widow as he softly knocked  mesherm he replied  saints in hevin whats the matter are ye sick she gasped as she flung the door open  sh dont speak so loud he commanded sit down i want to speak solemnlike to you  his tone impressed her deeply have ye struck ut she asked tremulously  i haint found it yet but i want to tell yei believe ive had a hunch send the chink away  something in his tone stopped all scornful words upon her lips ordering the chinaman to bed she turned and asked  phwat do ye mean spake man  well sir as i started up the trail something kept sayin to me sherman youre on the wrong track it was just as if you pulled my sleeve and nudged me and said this way i couldnt sleep that night i just lay on the ground and figured up there highterrible highare seams of orei know thatbut theyre in granite and hard to get at thats one gold belt theres money in a mine up there but it will take money to get it then theres another gold belt down about hereor even lowerand ive just come to the conclusion that our mine maggie is down here in the foothills not on old blanca  the air of mystery which enveloped and transformed the man had its effect on the woman her eyes opened wide  was it a voice like  no it was more like a pull seemed to be pulling me to cross the creek where i found that chunk of porphritic limestone i couldnt sleep the second nightand ive been in camp up there in burro park tryin to figure it all out i hated to give up and come backi was afraid yed think i was weakeningbut i cant help it now ill tell you what im going to doim going to make a camp over on the north side of the creek i dont want the boys to know where ive gone but i wanted you to know what im doingi wanted you to knowits plum ghostlyit scared me  she whispered mebbe its dan  i thought o that him and me were always good friends and he was in my mind all the while  but howld on sherm it may be the divil leadin ye on to break yr neck as did dan twas over there he fell  well i thought o that too its either dan or the devil and im going to find out which  the saints go wid ye said the widow all her superstitious fears aroused and if it is dan hell sure be good to you fer my sake   iii  sierra blanca is the prodigious tripleturreted tower which stands at the southern elbow of the sangre de cristo range it is a massive but symmetrical mountain with three peaks so nearly of the same altitude that the central dome seems the lowest of them all though it is actually fourteen thousand four hundred and eighty feet above the sea on the west and south this great mass rises from the flat dry floor of the san luis valley in sweeping curving lines and the piñons cover these lower slopes like a robe of bronze green  at eight thousand feet above the sea these suave lines become broken the piñons give place to pine and fir and the somber cañons begin to yawn it was just here where the grassy hills began to break into savage walls that bidwell made his camp beside a small stream which fell away into bear creek to the south from this camp he could look far out on the violet and gold of the valley and see the railway trains pass like swift and monstrous dragons he could dimly see the lights of las animas also and this led him to conceal his own campfire  each day he rode forth skirting the cliffs examining every bit of rock which showed the slightest mineral stain scarcely a moment of the daylight was wasted in this search his mysterious guide no longer touched him and this he took to be a favorable omen im near it he said  one day he hitched his mule to a small dead pine at the foot of a steep cliff and was climbing to the summit when a stone dislodged by his feet fell bounced thumped the mule in the ribs and so scared the animal that he pulled up the tree and ran away  angry and dispirited for he was hungry and tired bidwell clambered down and began to trail the mule toward camp the tree soon clogged the runaway and brought him to a stand in a thicket of willows  as bidwell knelt to untie the rope his keen eyes detected the glitter of gold in the dirt which still clung to the moist root of the pine with a sudden conviction of having unearthed his fortune the miner sprang to his saddle and hurried back to the spot whence the tree had been rived it was dusk by the time he reached the spot but he could detect gold in the friable rock which lined the cavity left by the uprooted sapling with a mind too excited to sleep he determined to stay with his find till morning to leave it involved no real risk of losing it and yet he could not bring himself to even build a campfire for fear some one might be drawn from the darkness to dispute his claim  it was a terribly long night and when old blancas southern peak began to gleam out of the purple receding waves of the night the mans brain was numb with speculation and suspense hovering over the little heap of broken rock which he had scooped out with his hands he waited in almost frenzied impatience for the sun  he could tell by the feeling that the ore was what miners of his grade call rotten quartz and he knew that it often held free gold in enormous richness it was so friable he could crumble it in his hands and so yellow with ironstains that it looked like lumps of clay as the dawn light came a stranger happening upon him would have feared for his reason so pale was his face so bloodshot his eyes  at last he could again detect the gleam of gold each moment as the light grew the value of the ore increased it was literally meshed with rusty free gold the whole mound was made up of a disintegrated ledge of porphyry and thousands of dollars were in sight as his mind grasped these facts the miner rose and dancedbut he did not shout  all that day he worked swiftly silently like an animal seeking to escape an enemy digging out this rock and carrying it to a place of concealment in a deep thicket not far away he did not stop to eat or drink till midafternoon and then only because he was staggering with weakness and his hands were growing ineffective after eating he fell asleep and did not wake till deep in the night for some minutes he could not remember what had happened to him at last his good fortune grew real again saddling his mule he rode up the creek and crossed miles above his newly discovered mine in order to conceal his trail and it was well toward dawn before he tapped on the widows window  is that you sherm she asked  yes get up quick i have news  when she opened the kitchen door for him she started back for love of god man phwat have you been doin wid yersilf  be quiet he commanded sharply and crept in staggering under the weight of a blanket full of ore you neednt work any more maggie ive got it here it is  man yere crazy what have you there not gould  you bet it is quartz jest rotten with gold where can i hide it his manner would not have been wilder had his bag of ore been the body of a man he had murdered quick its almost daylight  let me see ut i do not believe ut  he untied the blanket and as the corners unrolled disclosing the redbrown mass even her unskilled eyes could see the gleaming grains of pure metal she fell on her knees and crossed herself  praise be to mary where did ye find utand how  not a word about that im scared if any one should find it while i am away they could steal thousands of dollars why its like a pocket in a placer get me every sack you can give me gruband hide this there are tons of it this is the best of it we are richrich as jews maggie  they worked swiftly the widow emptied a crackerbarrel and put the ore at the bottom and then tumbled the crackers in on top of the ore she set out some cold meat and bread and butter and while bidwell ate she brought out every rag that could serve as a sack  ill have more for ye tomorrow i wish i cud go wid ye sherm id like to set me claws at work at that dirt  i need help but i am afraid to have a man well i must be off goodby ill be back tonight with another load i guess old sherm is worth a kiss yetehmaggie  be off wid ye cant ye see the dawn is comin a moment later she ran up to him and gave him a great hug therenow haste ye  be silent  as the grave itself she replied and turned to brush up the crackercrumbs that chinese divil has sharp eyes she muttered   iv  it was inevitable that the golden secret should escape others besides the chinese cook had sharp eyes and the widow delaney grew paler and more irritable as the days wore on she had a hunted look she hardly ever left her kitchen it was observed and her bedroom door had a new lock every second night bidwell gaunt and ragged and furtive as a burglar brought a staggering muleload of the richest ore and stowed it away under the shanty floor and in the widows bedroom luckily miners are sound sleepers or the two midnight marauders would have been discovered on the second night  one day john the cook seized the crackerbarrel intending to put it into a different corner he gave it a slight wrench looked a little surprised and lifted a little stronger it did not budge he remarked  klackels belly hebby no sabbe klackels allee same deese  let that alone screamed mrs delaney phwat will ye be doin nixt ye squinteyed monkey ill tell ye whin to stir things about  the startled chinaman gave way in profound dismay me goin seep lound klackelballell you sabbe  well ill do the sweepin there i nailed that barrel to the flure apurpis lave it alone will ye  this incident decided her that night when bidwell came she broke out  sherm i cannot stand this anny longer im that nairvous i cant hear a fly buzz widout hot streaks chasin up and down me spine like little red snakes and man luk at yersilf why yere hairy as a goat and yer eyes are loike two white onions i say stop sherm dear  whatll we do asked bidwell in alarm  do ill tell ye phwat well do well put our feets down and say yis tis true weve shtruck ut and its ours then ill get a team from las animas and load the stuff in before the face and eyes of the world and go wid it to sell it whilst you load yr gun an stand guard over the hole in the ground im fair crazy wid this burglars business were both as thin as quakin asps and full as shaky you go down the trail this minute and bring a team and a strong wagonno wan will know till ye drive in now go  bidwell was ruled by her clear and sensible words and rode away into the clear dark of the summers night with a feeling that it was all a dreama vision such as he had often had while prospecting in the mountains but as day came on and he looked back upon the red hole he had made in the green hillside the reality of it all came to pinch his heart and make him gasp his storehouse his well of golden waters was unguarded and open to the view of any one who should chance to look that way he beat his old mule to a gallop in the frenzy of the moment  the widow meanwhile got breakfast for the men and as soon as they were off up the trail she set the awed and wondering chinaman to hauling the sacks of ore out from beneath the shanty and piling them conveniently near the roadway she watched every movement and checked off each sack like a shippingclerk merciful powers the work that man did she exclaimed alluding to bidwell who had dug all that mass of ore and packed it in the night from the mine to its safe concealment  of course mrs clark the storekeepers wife saw them at work and came over to see what was going on  good morning mrs delaney youre not going to move  i am  im sorry whats the reason of it why that looks like ore she said as she peered at a sack  it is ore and im goin to ship it to the mill have ye anny objection asked mrs delaney defiantly  where did it come from  thats my business theres wan more under there she said to the chinaman and as he came creeping out like a monstrous bug tugging a pair of bidwells overalls orefilled as if they formed the trunk of a man whom he had murdered and hidden mrs clark turned and fled toward the store to tell her husband  there ye go now ye screechowl sneered the widow delaney its all up wid us soon the whole world will know of ut wellwere here first she defiantly added  clark came over pale with excitement let me see that ore he called out as he ran up and laid his hand on a sack  get offand stay off said maggie whipping a revolver out of her pocket thats my ore and you let it alone  clark recoiled in surprise but the widows anxiety to protect her property added enormously to his excitement the ore must be very rich he argued how do i know but that comes from one of my claims he asked  the widow thrust the muzzle of the revolver under his nose would ye call me a thafe tis well bidwell is not here hed do more than make ye smell of a gun go back to yer own businessif ye value a whole skinan stay away from phwat does not concern ye  all this was characteristically intemperate of maggie and by the time bidwell came clattering up the trail with a big freightwagon the whole gulch was aroused and a dozen men encircled the heap of motley bags on which mrs delaney sat keeping them at bay  when she heard the wagon her nerves steadied a little and she said more soberly boys there comes bidwell with a wagon to haul this stuff away and johnson you help him load it while i go see about dinner  as bidwell drove up a mutter of amazement ran round the group and each man had his say  why bid whats the matter you look like a man found dead  im just beginning to live said bidwell and the reply was long remembered in bear gulch  well now ye know all about it ye gawks take hold and help the man load up ill have dinner ready fer ye in a snort repeated the widow  clark drew his partners aside he packed that ore here he must have left a trail you take a turn up the cañon and see if you cant find it its close by somewhere  bidwell saw them conferring and called out you neednt take any trouble clark ill lead you to the place after dinner my claim is staked and application filedso dont try any tricks on me  the widows eyes were equally keen and the growing cupidity of the men did not escape her coming out with a big meat sandwich she said twill not do to sit down sherm take this in yer fist and go theyll all be slippin away like snakes if ye dont ill take john and the orewell make it somehowand ill stay wid it till its paid for  she was right the miners were struggling with the demons of desire and ready to stampede at any moment hastily packing his mule bidwell started up the trail saying  fall in behind me boys and dont scrouge the man who tries to crowd me off the trail will regret it  they were quiet enough till he left the trail and started down toward the bear then johnson cried i know where it is and plunged with a whoop into the thicket of willows that bordered the creek  mebbe he does and mebbe he dont said clark im going to stick by bid till we get the lay o the land  they maintained fairly good order until bidwells trail became a plain line leading up the hillside then the stampede began with wild halloos and resounding thwacking of mules they scattered out raced over the hilltop and disappeared leaving bidwell to plod on with his laden burro  when he came in sight of his mine men were hammering stakes into the ground on all sides of the discovery claim and clark and johnson were in a loud wrangle as to who reached the spot first leading his mule up to the cliff wall where he had built a shelter bidwell unpacked his outfit and as he stood his rifle against a rock he said  im planted right here neighbors my roots run deep underground and the man who tries to jump this claim will land in the middle of hell firenow thats right  their claims once staked and their loud differences stilled the men had leisure to come and examine the discovery claim  youve the best of it said cantor an old miner there may not be an ounce of gold outside your vein its a curious formation i cant tell how it runs  toward night the other miners left and went back to camp leaving bidwell alone as darkness came on he grew nervous again theyd kill me if they dared he muttered as he crouched in his shelter his gun on his knee he was very sleepy but resolved not to close his eyes if i only had a dogsome one i could trust but i havent a soul he added bitterly as his weakness grew the curse of gold sat heavily upon him and his hands were lax with weariness  i was a fool to let maggie go off with that ore he muttered his mind following the widow in her perilous journey down the gulch he did not distrust her he only feared her ability to override the difficulties of her mission for the best part of his life he had sought the metal beneath his feet and now that he had found it his blood ran cold with suspicion and fear  daylight brought a comparative sense of safety and building a fire he cooked his breakfast in peacethough his eyes were restless oh theyll come he said aloud theyll boil in here on me in another hour or two  and they did the men from delaney came first followed a little later by their partners from the high gulches and after them the genuine stampeders the merchants clerks hired hands barbers hostlers and halfstarved lawyers from the valley towns came pouring up the trail and pausing just long enough to see the shine of gold in bidwells dump flung themselves upon the land seizing the first unclaimed contiguous claim without regard to its character or formation their stakes once set they began to roam pawing at the earth like prairiedogs and quite as ineffectually swarms of the most curious surrounded bidwells hole in the ground picking at the ore and flooding the air with shouts and questions till the old man in desperation ordered them off his premises and set up a notice  keep off this ground or meet trouble  to his friends he explained every piece of rock they carry off is worth so much money  yeve enough here to buy the warrld mon protested angus craig an old miner from the north  i dont know whether i have or not said bidwell it may be just a little spatter of gold  that night the whole range of foothills was noisy with voices and sparkling with campfires from the treeless valleys below these lights could be seen and the heavily laden trains of the san luis accommodation trailed a loud hallelujah as the incoming prospectors lifted their voices in joyous greeting to those on the mountainside  its another cripple creek one man shouted and the cry struck home were in on it they all exulted  bidwell did not underestimate his importance in this rush of goldfrenzied men he was appalled by the depth and power of the streams centering upon him for weeks he had toiled to the full stretch of his powers without sufficient sleep and he was deathly weary emaciated to the bone and trembling with nervous weakness but he was indomitable a long life of camping prospecting and trenching had fitted him to withstand even this strain and to stay with it was an instinct with him therefore he built a big fire not far from the mine and spread his blankets there but he did not lie down till after midnight and only then because he could not keep awake even while in sitting posture i must sleep anyhow he muttered i cant stand this any longer i must sleepand so his eyes closed  he was awakened by a voice he knew calling out is this the way ye watch yr mine sherm bidwell and looking up he saw the widow delaney sitting astride a mule and looking down at him with tender amusement ye are a pitcher sure ye look like wan o the holy saints of ouldor a tramp help me off this baste and ill turn to and scorch a breakfast for ye  he staggered stiffly to his feet and awkwardly approached her i had only just dropped off he apologized  ye poor lad she said compassionately yere stiff as a poker wid cold  how did ye come out with the ore he asked  thrust yr maggie i saw it loaded into a car and sent away bedad i had a moind to go wid it to the mill but i says sherm nor mesilf can be in two places to wanst so i gave oer the notion and came home theyll thieve the half of it av coorse but so goes the world divil catch it  the widow was a powerful reinforcement she got breakfast while bidwell dozed again and with the influence of hot coffee and the genial sun the firm grew confident of holding at least the major part of their monstrous good luck  thrust no wan but me said the widow in decisive warning the world is full of rogues from this toime ivery mans hand is agin yr goldschamin to reach yr pockets rest yersilf and ill look after the gould from this toime on we work only wid our brains  she did indeed become the captain on her advice he sent a man for oresacks and tools while other willing hands set to work to build a cabin to shelter them  were takin no chances she said we camp right here  that day las animas crestone powder gulch and los gatos emptied themselves upon the hills and among them were representatives of big firms in denver colorado springs and pueblo the path past the maggie mine was worn deep by the feet of the goldseekers and bidwells rude pole barrier was polished by the nervous touch of greedy palms  about ten oclock a quiet man in a gray suit of clothes asked bidwell if he wanted to sell bidwell said no short and curt but maggie asked with a smile how much  enough to make you comfortable for life if it runs as well as this sample ill chance fifty thousand dollars on it  maggie snorted fifty thousand why i tuk twoice that to the mill last night  let me get in and examine the mine a little closer i may be able to raise my bid  not till ye make it wan hundred thousand may you even have a luk at it she replied  other agents camesome confidential others coldly critical but all equally unsuccessful the two idiots could not see why they should turn over the gold which lay there in sight to a syndicate it was theirs by every right and though the offers went far beyond their conception they refused to consider them  all day axes resounded in the firs and picks were busy in the gullies camp goods provisions and bedding streamed by on trains of mules and by nightfall a city was in its initial stagestent stores openair saloons eatingbooths and canvas hotels a few of the swarming incomers were skeptical of the find but the larger number were hilariously boastful of their locations and around their evening campfires groups gathered to exult over their potentialities  the sun had set but the western slope of the hill was still brilliant with light as bidwells messenger with his sumpter horse piled high with bales of oresacks came round the clump of firs at the corner of bidwells claim he was followed by a tall man who rode with a tired droop and nervous clutching at the rein  bidwell stared and exclaimed may i be shot if the preachers arent takin a hand in the rush  the widow looked unwontedly rosy as she conclusively said i sent for him man dear  you did what for  the widow was close enough now to put her hand in the crook of his elbow to make us wan sherm darlin theres no time like the prisent  bidwell tugged at his ragged beard i wish i had time to slick up a bit  therell be plinty of time for that afterward she said go welcome the minister  in the presence of old angus craig and young johnson they were married and when the minister gave mrs bidwell a rousing smack she wiped her lips with the back of her hand and said to bidwell  now were ayqul partners sherm and all old scores wiped out  and old angus wagged his head and said canny lass the widdy  when the news of this marriage reached the camp demons of laughter and disorder were let loose starting from somewhere afar off a loud procession formed with campkettles for drums and aspenbark whistles for pipes with caterwaul and halloo the whole loosely cohering army of prospectors surrounded the little log cabin of the maggie mine and shouted in wild discord  bidwell come forth  a speech a speech  bidwell was for poking his revolver out through the unchinked walls and ordering the mob to disperse but his wife was diplomatic  tis but an excuse to get drink she said go give them treat  so bidwell went forth and while a couple of stalwart friends lifted him high he shouted sharp and to the point its on me clark  the mob howling with delight rushed upon him and bore him away struggling and sputtering to clarks saloon where kegs of beer were broached and the crowd took a first deep draught bidwell in alarm for maggie began to fight to get back to the cabin but cries arose for the bride  the bridelets see the bride  bidwell expostulated oh no leave her alone are you gentlemen if you are you wont insist on seeing her  in the midst of the crowd a clear voice rang out  the bride is it well here she is get out o me way  clear the road there for the bride yelled a hundred voices as maggie walked calmly up an aisle densely walled with strange men she had been accustomed to such characters all her life and knew them too well to be afraid mounting a beerkeg she turned a benign face on the crowd the light of the torches lighted her hair till it shone like spun gold in a halo round her head she looked very handsome in the warm sympathetic light of the burning pitchpine  oh yiss oill make a speech im not afraid of a handful of twobyfours like you tenderfeet from the valley and when me speech is ended yell go home and go to bed eleven days ago sherm me man discovered this lode since then weve both worked night and day to git out the orewere dogtiredsure we arebut were raisonable folk and here we stand now gaze yr fill and go home and lave us to restlike yr dacent mothers would have ye do  good for you maggie called old angus craig who stood near her mak way lads  the men opened a path for the bride and groom and raised a thundering cheer as they passed  old angus craig shook his head again and said to johnson sik a luck canna last to strike a lode and win a braw lass a in the day ye may say hooiver he waited lang for baith     the cowboss         the reckless cowboy on his watcheyed bronco still lopes       across the grassy foothillsor holds his milling herd in       the high parks     ii  the cowboss   i  the postoffice at eagle river was so small that mccoy and his herders always spoke of the official within as the badger saying that he must surely back into his den for lack of room to turn round his presentment at the arched loophole in his stockade was formidable his head was large his brow high and seamed his beard long and tangled and the look of his hazelgray eyes remote with cold abstraction  hes not a man to monkey with said mccoy when the boys complained that the old seed had put up a sign no spitting in this office id advise you to act accordingly i reckon hes boss of that thing while hes in there hes a populist but hes regularly appointed by the president and i dont see that were in any position to presume to spit if he objects no there aint a thing to do but get up a petition and have him removedand i wont agree to sign it when you do  eagle river was only a cattleyard station a shippingpoint for the mighty spread of rolling hills which make up the bear valley range to the north and the grampa to the south aside from the postoffice it possessed two saloons a store a boardinghouse or two and a low brown stationhouse that was all except during the autumn when there was nearly always an outfit of cowboys camped about the corrals loading cattle or waiting for cars  on the day when this story opens mccoy had packed away his last steer and being about to take the train for kansas city called his foreman aside  see here roy seems to me the boys are extra boozed already its up to you to pull right out for the ranch  thats what im going to try to do answered roy well camp at the head of jack rabbit tonight  good idea get em out of town before darkevery mothers son of em ill be back on saturday  roy pierce was a dependable young fellow and honestly meant to carry out the orders of his boss but there was so little by way of diversion in eagle the boys had to get drunk in order to punctuate a paragraph in their life there was not a disengaged woman in the burg and bad whisky was merely a sad substitute for romance therefore the settlers who chanced to meet this bunch of herders in the outskirts of eagle river that night walked wide of them for they gave out the sounds of battle  they could all ride like cossacks notwithstanding their dizzy heads and though they waved about in their saddles like men of rubber their faithful feet clung to their stirrups like those of a bat to its perch in camp they scuffled argued ran footraces and howled derisive epithets at the cook who was getting supper with drunken gravity using pepper and salt with lavish hand  into the midst of this hullabaloo roy the cowboss rode white with rage and quite sober  ill kill that old son of a gun one of these days said he to henry ring  kill who  that postmaster if he wasnt a united states officer id do it now  whats the matter wouldnt he shuffle the mail fer you  never lifted a finger nothing he barked out at me didnt even look up till i let loose on him  what did he do then  poked an old civil war pistol out of the window and told me to hike  which you did  which i did after passing him a few compliments lay down your badge i says come out o your den and ill pepper you so full of holes that your hide wont hold bluejoint hay and ill do it too the old hound  but you got out persisted ring maliciously  i got out but i tell you right now hes got something coming to him no mailsifter of a little twoforacent town like eagle is goin to put it all over me that way and not repent of it ive figured out a scheme to get even with him and you have got to help  this staggered henry who began to sidestep and limp count me out on that said he the old skunk treated me just about the same way i dont blame you a feller sure has a right to have his postmaster make a bluff at shuffling the deck but after all  however in the end the boss won his most trusted fellows to his plan for he was a youth of power and besides they had all been roiled by the grizzled crusty old official and were quite ready to take a hand in his punishment  roy developed his plot well pull out of camp about midnight and ride round to the east sneak in and surround the old mans shack shouting and yelling and raising cain hell come out of his hole to order us off and ill rope him before he knows where hes at then well toy with him for a few minuteslong enough to learn him a lesson in politenessand let him go  no one in the gang seemed to see anything specially humorous in this method of inculcating urbanity of manner and at last five of them agreed to stand their share of the riot although henry ring muttered something about the mans being old and not looking very strong  hes strong enough to wave a twofoot gun retorted roy and so silenced all objection  one night as soon as the camp was quiet pierce rose and touching his marauders into activity saddled and rode away as stealthily as the leader of a band of indian scouts he made straightway over the divide to the east then turned and crossing the river entered the town from the south in order to deceive any chance observer  just below the station in a little gully he halted his warparty and issued final orders now ill ride ahead and locate myself right near the back door then when i strike a light you fellows come in and swirl round the shack like a gust o hell the old devil will come out the back door to see whats doin and ill jerk him endwise before he can touch trigger i wont hurt him any more than he needs now dont stir till im in position  silently swiftly his pony shuffled along the sandy road and over the railwaycrossing the town was soundless and unlighted save for a dim glow in the telegraph office and the air was keen and crisp with frost as he approached the badgers shack pierce detected a gleam of light beneath the curtain of the side windows if hes awake so much the better he thought but his nerves thrilled as he softly entered the shadow  suddenly the pony trod upon something which made a prodigious crash the door opened a tall young girl appeared in a wide flare of yellow light which ran out upon the grass like a golden carpet with eager anxious voice she called out  is that you doctor  the raider stiffened in his saddle with surprise his first impulse was to set spurs to his horse and vanish his next was to tear off his disguise and wait for the voice was sweeter than any he had ever heard and the girls form a vision of beauty  alarmed at his silence she again called out who are you what do you want  a neighbor miss he answered dismounting and stepping into the light is there anything i can do for you  at this moment hell seemed to have let loose the wildest of its warriors with shrill whoopings with flare of popping guns roys faithful herders came swirling round the cabin intent to do their duty frenzied with delight of it  horrified furious at this breach of discipline pierce ran to meet them waving his hat and raising the wild yell whooee with which he was wont to head off and turn a bunch of steers stop it get out he shouted as he succeeded in reaching the ears of one or two of the raiders its all offtheres a girl here somebody sick skeedoo  the shooting and the tumult died away the horsemen vanished as swiftly as abruptly as they came leaving their leader in panting breathless possession of the field he was sober enough now and repentant too  slowly he returned to the door of the shack with vague intent to apologize something very sudden and very terrible must have fallen upon the postmaster  after some hesitation he knocked timidly on the door  have they gone the girl asked  yes ive scared em away they didnt mean no harm i reckon i want to know cant i be of some kind of use  the door opened cautiously and the girl again appeared she was very pale and held a pistol in her hand but her voice was calm youre very good she said and im much obliged who are you  i am roy pierce foreman for mccoy a cattleman north of here  was it really a band of indians  naw only a bunch of cowpunchers on a bat  you mean cowboys  thats what its their little way of havin fun i reckon they didnt know you was here i didnt whos sick  my uncle  you mean the postmaster  yes  when was he took  last night they telegraphed me about six oclock i didnt get here till this morningi mean yesterday morning  whats the ail of him  a stroke im afraid he cant talk and hes stiff as a stake oh i wish the doctor would come  her anxiety was moving ill try to find him for you  i wish you would  you arent all alone  yes mrs gilfoyle had to go home to her baby she said shed come back but she hasnt  roys heart swept a wide arc as he stood looking into the pale awed lovely face of the girl  ill bring help he said and vanished into the darkness shivering with a sense of guilt the poor old cuss probably he was sick the very minute i was bullyragging him  the local doctor had gone down the valley on a serious case and would not be back till morning his wife said thereupon roy wired to claywall the countyseat for another physician he also secured the aid of mrs james the landlady of the palace hotel and hastened back to the relief of the girl whom he found walking the floor of the little kitchen tremulous with dread  im afraid hes dying she said his teeth are set and hes unconscious  without knowing what to say in way of comfort the herder passed on into the little office where the postmaster lay on a low couch with face upturned in rigid inflexible pose his hands clenched his mouth foamlined roy unused to sickness and death experienced both pity and awe as he looked down upon the prostrate form of the man he had expected to punish and yet these emotions were rendered vague and slight by the burning admiration which the niece had excited in his susceptible and chivalrous heart  she was tall and very fair with a face that seemed plain in repose but which bewitched him when she smiled her erect and powerful body was glowing with health and her lips and eyes were deliciously young and sweet her anxious expression passed away as roy confidently assured her that these seizures were seldom fatal he didnt know a thing about it but his tone was convincing  i knew a man once who had these fits four or five times a year didnt seem to hurt him a bit one funny thinghe never had em while in the saddle they most always come on just after a heavy meal i reckon the old man must of overet  mrs james came in soonall too soon to please himbut he reported to her his message to claywall a doctor will be down on the cannonball about five oclock he added  thats very kind and thoughtful of you said the girl then she explained to mrs james that mr pierce had just driven off a horrid band of cowboys who were attacking the town  the landlady snorted with contempt im so used to boozy cowboys howlin round i dont bat an eye when they shoot up the street theyre all a lot of cheap skates anyway you want to swat em with the mop if they come round thats the way i do  roy was nettled by her tone for he was now very anxious to pose as a valorous defender of the innocent but agreed with her that the boys were just having a little whiz as they started home they didnt mean no harm  ought i to sit in there the girl asked the woman with a glance toward the inner room  no i dont think you can do any good ill just keep an eye on him and let you know if theys any change  the girl apologized for the looks of the kitchen poor uncle has been so feeble lately he couldnt keep things in order and i havent had any chance since i came if you dont mind ill rid things up now itll keep my mind occupied  illustration youre pretty swift arent you she said cuttingly  good idea exclaimed roy ill help  he had been in a good many exciting mixups with steers bears cayuses sheriffs posses and indians but this was easily the most stirring and amazing hour of his life while his pony slowly slid away up the hill to feed he with flapping gun and rattling spurs swept polished and lifted things for lidathat was her namelida converse  my folks live in colorado springs she explained in answer to his questions my mother is not very well and father is east so i had to come uncle dan was pretty bad when i got here only not like he is now this fit came on after the doctor went away at nine  im glad your father was east declared the raider who was unable to hold to a serious view of the matter now that he was in the midst of a charming and intimate conversation just thinkif he had a come id never have seen you  she faced him in surprise and disapproval of his boldness youre pretty swift arent you she said cuttingly  a fellers got to be in this country he replied jauntily  she was prepared to be angry with him but his candid humorous admiring gaze disarmed her youve been very nice she said and i feel very grateful but i guess you better not say any more such things to metonight  you mustnt forget i chased off them redskins  you said they were cowboys  of course i did i wanted to calm your mind  she was a little puzzled by his bluffing i dont believe there are any indians over here  well if they were cowboys they were a fierce lot  she considered ive told you i feel grateful what more can i do  a good deal but as you say that can go over till tomorrow did i tell you that i had a bunch of cattle of my own  i dont remember of it  well i have im not one of these crazy cowboys who blows in all his wad on faro and drinknot on your life ive got some ready chink stacked away in a claywall bank want to see my bankbook  she answered curtly please take that kettle of slop out and empty it and what time did you say the express was due  roy was absorbed ecstatic he virtually forgot all the rest of the world his herders could ride to the north pole his pony might starve the cannonball express go over the cliff the postmaster die so long as he was left in service to this princess  lord amighty wasnt i in luck he repeated to himself suppose id a roped her instead of the old man  when he returned from listening for the train he found her washing her hands at the end of her task and the room in such order as it had never known before the sight of her standing there flushed and very womanly rolling down her sleeves was more than the young fellow could silently observe  i hope the old manll be a long time getting well he said abruptly  thats a nice thing to say what do you mean by such a cruel wish  i see my finish when you go away no more lonely ranchlife for me  if you start in on that talk again i will not speak to you she declared and she meant it  all right ill shut up but i want to tell you im a trailer for keeps and you cant lose me no matter where you go from this time on i forget everything in the world but you  with a look of resolute reproof she rose and joined mrs james in the inner room leaving roy cowed and a good deal alarmed  i reckon im a little too swift he admitted but oh my soul shes a peach  when the train whistled lida came out again will you please go to meet the doctor she asked with no trace of resentment in her manner  sure thing i was just about starting he replied instantly  while he was gone she asked mrs james if she knew the young man and was much pleased to find that the sharptongued landlady had only good words to say of roy pierce  hes no ordinary cowboy she explained if he makes up to you you neednt shy  who said he was making up to me i never saw him before  i want to know well anybody could see with half an eye that he was naturally rustlin round you i thought youd known each other for years  this brought tears of mortification to the girls eyes i didnt mean to be taken that way of course i couldnt help being grateful after all hed done but i think its a shame to be so misunderstood its mean and low down of himand poor uncle so sick  now dont make a hill out of an antheap said the old woman vigorously no harms done youre a mighty slick girl and these boys dont see many like you out here in the sagebrush and piñons facts are youre kind o upsettin to a feller like roy you make him kind o drunklike he dont mean to be sassy  well i wish youd tell him not to do anything more for me i dont want to get any deeper in debt to him  the claywall physician came into the little room as silently as a piute he was a plump dark little man of impassive mien but seemed to know his business he drove the girl out of the room but drafted mrs james and roy into service  its merely a case of indigestion said he but its plenty serious enough you see the distended stomach pressing against the heart  the girl sitting in the kitchen and hearing the swift and vigorous movement within experienced a revulsion to the awe and terror of the midnight for the second time in her life death had come very close to her but in this case her terror was shot through with the ruddy sympathy of a handsome picturesque young cavalier she could not be really angry with him though she was genuinely shocked by his reckless disregard of the proprieties for he came at such a dark and lonely and helpless hour and his prompt and fearless action in silencing those dreadful cowboys was heroic therefore when the doctor sent roy out to say that her uncle would live a part of her relief and joy shone upon the young rancher who was correspondingly exalted  now you must let me hang round till he gets well he said forgetful of all other duties  that reminds me youll need some breakfast she said hurriedly for here comes the sun and as she spoke the light of the morning streamed like a golden river into the little room  its me to the woodpile then cried roy and his smile was of a piece with the sunshine on the wall   ii  beside the fallen monarch of the wood the lifting saplings bud and intertwine so over the stern old postmaster these young people reenacted the most primitive drama in the world indifferent to the jeers of his fellows roy devoted himself to the service of the badgers niece and was still in town when mccoy returned from the east that is to say from kansas city  lida had ceased to protest against the cowboys attendance and his lovemaking for the good reason that her protests were unavailing he declined to take offense and he would not remain silent a part of his devotion was due of course to his sense of guilt and yet this was only a small part true he had sent warnings and dire threats to silence his band of marauders but he did not feel keenly enough about their possible talebearing to carry his warnings in person i cant spare the time he argued knowing that lida would be going home in a few days and that his world would then be blank  i lose too much of you he said to her once i cant afford to have you out of my sight a minute  she had grown accustomed to such speeches as these and seldom replied to them except to order the speaker about with everincreasing tyranny youre so anxious to work she remarked ill let you do aplenty youll get sick o me soon  sick of you lord heavens whatll i do when you leave  youll go back to your ranch a fine foreman you must be fooling round here like a tramp what does your boss think  dont know and dont care dont care what anybody thinksbut you youre my only landmark these days youre my sun moon and stars thats what you are i set my watch by you  youre crazy she answered with laughter  sure thing locoed we call it out here youve got me locoedyoure my pink poison blossom there aint any feed that interests me but you im lonesome as a snakebit cow when i cant see you  say do you know uncle dan begins to notice you he asked me today what you were hanging round here for and who you were  what did you tell him  i told him you were mccoys hired man just helping me take care of him  thats a lie im your hired man im takin care of youwilling to work for a kiss a day  youll not get even that  im not getting ityet  youll never get it  dont be too sure of that my lifework is collecting my dues ive got em all set down you owe me a dozen for extra jobs and a good hug for overtime  she smiled derisively and turned the current the meals you eat are all of a dollar a day  theyre worth a bushel of diamondswhen you cook em but let me ask you somethingis your old dad as fierce as uncle dan  she nodded you bet he is hes crusty as old crust dont you go up against my daddy with any little bankbook its got to be a fat wad and mind you no cloves on your breath either hes crabbed on the drink question thats why he settled in colorado springs no saloons there you know  he considered a moment much obliged now heres something for you youre not obliged to hand out soft words and a sweet smile to every doggone injun that happens to call for mail stop it why youll have all the cowpunchers for fifty miles around calling for letters that bunch that was in here just now was from steamboat springs their mail dont come here it comes by way of wyoming they were runnin a bluff it makes me hot to have such barefaced swindling going on i wont stand for it  well you see im not really deputized to handle the mail so i must be careful not to make anybody mad  anybody but me i dont count  oh you wouldnt complain i know that  i wouldnt hey sure of that well im going to start a petition to have myself made postmaster  better get uncle dan out first she answered with a sly smile the office wont hold you both                                       at the end of a week the old postmaster was able to hobble to the window and sort the mail but the doctor would not consent to his cooking his own meals  if you can stay another week he said to lida i think youd better do it he isnt really fit to live alone  thereupon she meekly submitted and continued to keep house in the little kitchen for herself her uncle and for roy who still came regularly to her table bringing more than his share of provisions however she was a good deal puzzled by the change which had come over him of late he was less gay less confident of manner and he often fell into fits of abstraction  he was in fact under conviction of sin and felt the need of confessing to lida his share in the zealous assault of the cowboys that night its sure to leak out he decided and id better be the first to break the news but each day found it harder to begin and only the announcement of her intended departure one morning brought him to the hazard he was beginning to feel less secure of her and less indifferent to the gibes of the town jokers who found in his enslavement much material for caustic remark they called him the tired cowboy and the trusty  they were all sitting at supper in the kitchen one night when the old postmaster suddenly said to roy seems to me i remember you did i know you before i was sick his memory had been affected by his stroke and he took up the threads of his immediate past with uncertain fingers  i reckon so leastwise i used to get my mail here answered roy a bit startled  the old man looked puzzled yes but it seems a little more special than that someway your face is associated with trouble in my mind did we have any disagreement  after the postmaster returned to his chair in the office roy said to lida theyre going to throw your uncle out in a few weeks  you dont mean it  sure thing he really aint fit to be here any more dont you see how kind o dazed he is theyre going to get him out on a doctors certificateloss of memory now why dont you get deputized and act in his place  goodness sakes i dont want to live here  where do you want to liveon a ranch  not on your life colorado springs is good enough for me  thats hard on roy what could i do to earn a living there  you dont have to live there do you  home is where you are she had come to the point where she received such remarks in glassy silence he looked at her in growing uneasiness and finally said see here lida ive got something to tell you you heard the old man kind o feelin around in his old haymow of a mind about me well him and me did have a cussinout match one day and he drawed a gun on me and ordered me out of the office  what for  well it was this wayi think he was probably sick and didnt feel a little bit like sorting mail when i asked for it he sure was aggravatin and i cussed him good and plenty i reckon i had a clove on my tongue that day and was irritable and when he lit onto me i was hot as a hornet and went away swearing to get square he braced himself for the plunge that was my gang of cowboys that came hellroaring around the night i met you they were under my orders to scare your uncle out of his hole and i was going to rope him  oh she gasped and drew away from him that poor sick old man  he hastened to soften the charge of course i didnt know he was sick or i wouldnt ave done it he didnt look sick the day before besides i didnt intend to hurt himmuch i was only fixin for to scare him up for pullin a gun on me that was all  thats the meanest thing i ever heard ofto think of that old man helpless and you and a dozen cowboys attacking him  i tell you i didnt know he was ailin and there was only six of us  her tone hurt as she pointed at him and you pretend to be so brave  no i dont  you did  no i didnt you said i was brave and kind but i denied it i never soberly claimed any credit for driving off that band of outlaws thats one reason why ive been sticking so close to business herei felt kind o consciencestruck  her eyes were ablaze now oh it is youve said a dozen times it was on my account  thats rightabout eighty per cent on yours and twenty per cent on my own accounti mean the old mans  the idea she rose her face dark with indignation dont you dare come here another time i never heard of anything moremore awful you a rowdy ill never speak to you again go away i despise you  her anger and chagrin were genuine that he felt there was nothing playful or mocking in her tone at the moment she saw him as he was a reckless vengeful young ruffian and as such she hated him  he got upon his feet slowly and went out without further word of defense   iii  the sun did not rise for roy pierce on the day which followed her departure his interest in eagle river died and his good resolutions weakened he went on one long wild wilful carouse and when mccoy rescued him and began to exhort toward a better life he resigned his job and went back to the home ranch where his brothers claude and harry welcomed him with sarcastic comment as the returning goat  he tried to make his peace with them by saying im done with whisky forever  good notion retorted claude who was something of a cynic just cut out women and drink and youll be happy  roy found it easier to give up drink than to forget lida to put away thought of her was like trying to fend the sunlight from his cabin window with his palm he was entirely and hopelessly enslaved to the memory of her glowing face and smiling eyes what was there in all his world to console him for the loss of her  mrs pierce wonderingly persisted in asking what had come over him that he should be so sad and silent and claude finally enlightened her  hes all bent up over a girlthe postmasters nieceof eagle river who had to quit the country to get shut of him  the mothers heart was full of sympathy and her desire to comfort her stricken son led to shy references to his trouble which made him savage he went about the ranch so grimly so spiritlessly that claude despairingly remarked  i wish the lord that girl had got you youre as cheerful to have around as a poisoned hound why dont you go down to the springs and sit on her porch thats about all youre good for now  this was a bullseye shot for roys desire by day and his dream by night was to trail her to her home but the fear of her scornful greeting the thought of a cutting query as to the meaning of his call checked him at the very threshold of departure a dozen times  he had read of lovelorn people in the saturday storyteller which found its way into the homes of the ranchers but he had always sworn or laughed at their sufferings as a part of the play he felt quite differently about these cases love was no longer a theme for jest an abstraction a faroff trouble it had become a hunger more intolerable than any he had ever known a pain that made all others he had experienced transitory and of no account  even claude admitted the reality of the disease by repeating well you have got it bad your symptoms are about the worst ever youre locoed for fair youll be stepping high and wide if you dont watch out  in some mysterious way the whole valley now shared in a knowledge of the raid on the postoffice as well as in an understanding of roys throwdown by the postmasters niece and the expression of this interest in his affairs at last drove the young rancher to desperation he decided to leave the state im going to nome he said to his brothers one day  pious thought declared claude the climate may freeze this poison out of you why surego youre no good on earth here  roy did not tell him or his mother that he intended to go by way of the springs in the wish to catch one last glimpse of his loved one before setting out for the far northland to speak with her was beyond his hope no all he expected was a chance glimpse of her in the street the gleam of her face in the garden perhaps i may pass her gate at night and see her at the window   iv  the town to him was a maze of bewildering complexity and magnificence and he wandered about for a day in awkward silence hesitating to inquire the way to the converse home he found it at last a pretty cottage standing on a broad terrace amid trees and vines vivid with the autumn hues and if any thought of asking lida to exchange it for a shack on a ranch still lingered in his mind it was instantly wiped out by his first glance at the place  he walked by on the opposite side of the street and climbed the mesa back of the house to spy upon it from the rear hoping to detect his loved one walking about under the peartrees but she did not appear after an hour or so he came down and paced back and forth with eyes on the gate unable to leave the street till his soul was fed by one look at her  as the sun sank and the dusk began to come on he grew a little more reckless of being recognized and crossing the way continued to sentinel the gate he was passing it for the fourth time when lida came out upon the porch with an older woman she looked at the stranger curiously but did not recognize him she wore a hat and was plainly about to go for a walk  roy knew he ought to hurry away but he did not on the contrary he shamelessly met her with a solemn huskyvoiced greeting hello girl hows uncle dan  she started back in alarm then flushed as she recognized him how dare you speak to melike that  in this moment as he looked into her face his courage began to come back to him why didnt you answer my letters he asked putting her on defense  what business had you to write to me i told you i would not answer  no you didnt you only said you wouldnt speak to me again  well you knew what i meant she replied with less asperity  someway these slight concessions brought back his audacity his power of defense you bet i did but what difference does that make to a sick man oh ive had a time im no use to the world since you left i told you the truthyoure my sun moon and stars and ive come down to say it just once more before i pull out for alaska im going to quit the state the whole valley is on to my case of loco and im due at the north pole ive come to say goodby heres where i take my congee  she read something desperate in the tone of his voice what do you mean you arent really leaving  thats what heres where i break camp i cant go on this way ive got the worst fever anybody ever had i reckon i cant eat or sleep or work just on account of studying about you youve got me goin in a circle and if you dont say you forgive meits me to the boneyard and thats no joke youll find  she tried to laugh but something in his worn face intense eyes and twitching lips made her breathing very difficult you mustnt talk like that its just as foolish as can be  well that dont help me a little bit you no business to come into my life and tear things up the way you did i was all right till you came i liked myself and my neighbors bully now nothing interests mebut just youand your opinion of me you think i was a cowardly coyote putting up that job on your uncle the way i did well i admit it but ive been aching to tell you ive turned into another kind of farmer since then youve educated me seems like i was a kid but ive grown up into a man all of a sudden and im startin on a new line of action im not asking much today just a nice easy word it would be a heap of comfort to have you shake hands and say youre willing to let the past go now that aint much to you but its a whole lot to me girl youve got to be good to me this time  she was staring straight ahead of her with breath quickened by the sincere passion in his quivering voice the manly repentance which burdened his soul reached her heart after all it was true he had been only a reckless thoughtless boy as he planned that raid on her uncle and he had been so kind and helpful afterwardand so merry it was pitiful to see how changed he was how repentant and sorrowful  she turned quickly and with a shy teary smile thrust her hand toward him all right lets forget it then as he hungrily impulsively sought to draw her nearer she laughingly pushed him away i dont meanso much as you think but the light of forgiveness and something sweeter was in her face as she added wont you come in a minute and see mother and fatherand uncle dan  im wild to see uncle dan he replied with comical inflection as he followed her slowly up the path     the remittance man         wayward son from across the seasis gone roused to       manhood by his countrys call he has joined the ranks of       those who fight to save the shores of his ancestral isle     iii  the remittance man   i  the kettle hole ranch house faces a wide treeless valley and is backed by an equally bare hill to the west the purple peaks of the rampart range are visible it is a group of ramshackle and dispersed cabinsnot western enough to be picturesque and so far from being eastern as to lack cleanliness or even comfort and the young englishman who rode over the hill one sunset was bitterly disappointed in the whole plant  i shall stay here but one night said he as he entered the untidy house  he stayed five years and the cause of this change of mind lay in the person of fan blondell the daughter of the old man who owned the ranch and to whom young lester had been sent to learn the business of cattleraising  fan was only seventeen at this time but in the full flower of her physical perfection lithe fullbosomed and ruddy she radiated a powerful and subtle charm she had the face of a childhappytempered and purebut every movement of her body appealed with dangerous directness to the sickly young englishman who had never known an hour of the abounding joy of life which had been hers from the cradle enslaved to her at the first glance he resolved to win her love  his desire knew no law in affairs of this kind but his first encounter with blondell put a check to the dark plans he had formedfor the rancher had the bearing of an aged motheaten but dangerous old bear his voice was a rumble his teeth were broken fangs and his hands resembled the paws of a gorilla like so many of those colorado ranchers of the early days he was a missourian and his wife big fat worried and complaining was a kentuckian neither of them had any fear of dirt and fan had grown up not merely unkempt but smudgy her gown was greasy her shoes untied and yet strange to say this carelessness exercised a subduing charm over lester who was fastidious to the point of wasting precious hours in filling his boots with trees and folding his neckties the girls slovenly habits of dress indicated to his mind a similar recklessness as to her moral habits and it sometimes happens that men of his stamp come to find a fascination in the elemental in human life which the orderly no longer possess  lester we may explain was a remittance mana youth sent to america by his family on the pretense of learning to raise cattle but in reality to get him out of the way he was not a bad man on the contrary he was in most ways a gentleman and a man of some readingbut he lacked initiative even in his villainy blondell at once called him a lazy houndprovoked thereto by lesters slowness of toilet of a morning and had it not been for fanbacked by the fifty dollars a month which lester was paying for instructionhe would have been booted off the place  fan laughed at her father you better go slow george adelbert is heeled  blondell snorted heeled he couldnt unlimber his gun inside of fifteen minutes  well he can ride  the old man softened a little yes he can ride and he dont complain once he gets mounted but he carries pajammys in his saddlebags and a toothbrush on his slicker hanged if he dont use it too  thats what i like about him she answered defiantly were all so blamed careless about the way we live i wish hed jack us all up a bit  truly fan was under conviction brought to a realization of her slouchiness by lesters care of his own room as well as by his lofty manners she no longer wore her dress open at the throat and she kept her yellow hair brushed trying hard to make each meal a little less like a pigs swilling she knew how things ought to be done a little for at the gold fish ranch and at starr bakers everything was spick and span mrs baker especially was a careful and energetic housekeeper but to keep to this higher level every day was too great an effort even for a girl in love she dropped back now and again weary and disheartened  it was her matingtime she leaned to lester from the first glance the strangeness of his accent his reference to things afar off to london and paris appealed to her in the same way in which poetry moved herdimly vaguelybut his hands his eyes his tender lowtoned voice won her heart she hovered about him when he was at home careless of the comments of the other men ignoring the caustic slatting of her mother she had determined to win him no matter what the father might sayfor to her all men were of the same social level and she as good as the best indeed she knew no other world than the plains of colorado for she was born in the little dugout which still remained a part of the kitchen the conventions of cities did not count with her  she was already aware of her power too and walked among the rough men of her acquaintance with the step of an amazonian queen unafraid unabashed she was not in awe of lester on the contrary her love for him was curiously mingled with a certain sisterly almost maternal pity he was so easily flustered he was in a certain sense on her hands like an invalid  she soon learned that he was wax beneath her palmthat the touch of a finger on his arm made him uneasy of eye and trembling of limb it amused her to experiment with himto command him to demand speech of him when he was most angry and disgusted with the life he was living that he despised her father and mother she did not know but that he was sick of the cowboys and their clack she did know and she understood quite as well as if he had already told her that she alone kept him from returning at once to denver to try some other manner of earning a living this realization gave her pride and joy  she had but one jealousyhe admired and trusted mrs baker and occasionally rode over there to talk with her and fan could not understand that he sought intellectual refuge from the mental squalor of the blondells but she perceived a difference in his glance on his return mrs baker being a keensighted practical little woman soon fell upon the plainest kind of speech with the young englishman  this is no place for you she defiantly said the rest of us are all more or less born to the plains and farmlife but youre not youre just sagging thats all youre getting deeper into the slough all the time  quite right he answered but i dont know what else i can do i have no tradei know nothing of any art or profession and my brother is quite content to pay my way so long as he thinks im on a ranch and in the way of learning the business  she with her clear eyes searching his soul replied the longer you stay the more difficult it will be to break away dont you see that youre in danger of being fastened here forever  he knew what she meant and his thin face flushed i know it and i am going to ask starr to give me a place here with you and im about to write my brother stating full reasons for the change he might advance me enough to buy into starrs herd  she considered this ill take the matter up with starr she replied after a pause meanwhile you can come over and stay as a visitor as long as you pleasebut dont bring fan she added sharply i cant stand slatterns and you must cut loose from her once for all  again he flushed i understandbut it isnt easy fan has been mighty good to me life would have been intolerable over there but for her  i should think life would have been intolerable with her mrs baker answered with darkening brow and then they talked of other things till he rose to ride away  he headed his horse homeward fully resolved to give notice of removal but he did not on the contrary he lost himself to fan the girl glowing with love and anger and at the very climax of her animal beauty developed that night a subtlety of approach a method of attack which baffled and in the end overpowered him she was adroit enough to make no mention of her rivals she merely set herself to cause his committal to bend him to her side as the romping girl she played round him indifferent to the warning glances of her mother her eyes shining her cheeks glowing till the man he was the life he had lived the wishes of his brother were fused and lost in the blind passion of the present this glorious glowing creature can be mine what does all the rest matter was his final word of renunciation  in this mood he took her to his arms in this madness he told her of his love committing himself into her hands declining into her life and in the end requested of her parents the honor of their daughters hand  mrs blondell wept a tear or two and weakly gave her consent but the old ranchman thundered and lightened what can you do for my girl he demanded as i understand it you havent a centthe very clothes youve got on your back are paid for by somebody else what right have you to come to me with such a proposal  to all this lester surprised and disconcerted could but meekly answer that he hoped soon to buy a ranch of his ownthat his brother had promised to set him up as soon as he had mastered the business  blondell opened his jaws to roar again when fan interposed and taking a clutch in his shaggy beard said calmly now dad you hush george adelbert and i have made it all up and you better fall in gracefully it wont do you any good to paw the dirt and beller  lester grew sick for a moment as he realized the temper of the family into which he was about to marry but when fan turning with a gay laugh put her round smooth arm about his neck the rosy cloud closed over his head again   ii  blondell was silenced but not convinced a penniless soninlaw was not to his liking fan was his only child and the big ranch over which he presided was worth sixty thousand dollars what right had this lazy englishman to come in and marry its heiress the more he thought about it the angrier he grew and when he came in the following night he broke forth  see here mister i reckon you better get ready and pull out im not going to have you for a soninlaw not this season the man that marries my fan has got to have sabe enough to round up a flock of goatsand wit enough to get up in the morning so you better vamoose tomorrow  lester received his sentence in silence at the moment he was glad of it he turned on his heel and went to packing with more haste with greater skill than he had ever displayed in any enterprise hitherto his hurry arose from a species of desperation if i can only get out of the house was his inward cry  why pack up he suddenly asked himself what do they matterthese boots and shirts and books he caught a few pictures from the wall and stuffed them into his pockets and was about to plunge out into the dusk when fan entered the room and stood looking at him with ominous intentness  she was no longer the laughing romping girl but the woman with alert eye and tightly closed lips what are you doing dell  your father has ordered me to leave the ranch he answered and so im going  no youre not i dont care what he has ordered youre not goingshe came up and put her arms about his necknot without me and feeling her claim to pity he took her in his arms and tenderly pressed her cheek upon his bosom then she began to weep i cant live without you dell she moaned  he drew her closer a wave of tenderness rising in his heart ill be lonely without you fanbut your father is right i am too poorwe have no home  what does that matter she asked i wouldnt marry you for any amount of money and i know you dont care for this old ranch ill be glad to get shut of it ill go with you and well make a home somewhere else then her mood changed her face and voice hardened she pushed herself away from him no i wont ill stay here and so shall you dad cant boss me and i wont let him run you out come and face him up with me  so leading him she returned to the kitchen where blondell alone with his wife was eating supper his elbows on the table his hair unkempt his face glowering a glooming contrast to his radiant and splendid daughter who faced him fearlessly dad what do you mean by talking this way to george adelbert hes going to stay and im going to stay and youre going to be decent about it for im going to marry him  no youre not he blurted out  well i am she drew nearer and with her hands on the table looked down into his windworn face and dim eyes i say youve got to be decent do you understand her body was as lithe as beautiful as that of a tigress as she leaned thus and an unalterable resolution blazed in her eyes as she went on a deeper significance coming into her voice furthermore im as good as married to him right now and i dont care who knows it  the old mans head lifted with a jerk and he looked at her with mingled fear and fury what do you mean  anything you want to have it mean she replied you drive him out and you drive me outthats what i mean  blondell saw in her face the look of the woman who is willing to assume any guilt any shame for her lover and dropping his eyes before her gaze growled a curse and left the room  fan turned to her lover with a ringing boyish laugh its all right dell hes surrendered   iii  lester passed the month before his marriage in alternating uplifts and depressions and the worst of it lay in the fact that his moments of exaltation were sensualof the flesh and born of the girls presencewhile his depression came from his sane contemplation of the fate to which he was hastening he went one day to talk it all over with mrs baker who now held a dark opinion of fan blondell she frankly advised him to break the engagement and to go back to england  i cant do that my dear mrs baker i am too far committed to fan to do that besides i know she would make a terrible scene she would follow me and besides i am fond of her you know shes very beautiful nowand she does love me poor beggar i wonder at it but she does then he brightened up you know she has the carriage of a duchess really if she were trained a little she would be quite presentable anywhere  mrs baker shook her head shes at her best this minute look at the mother thats what shell be like in a few years  oh nonot really shes an improvementa vast improvementon the old people dont you think  you cant make a purse out of a sows ear fan will sag right down after marriage mark my words shes a slattern in her blood and before the honeymoon is over shell be slouching around in old slippers and her nightgown that is plain talk mr lester but i cant let you go into this trap with your eyes shut  lester went away with renewed determination to pack his belongings and bolt but the manly streak in his blood made it impossible for him to go without some sort of explanation to her  the other hands who called him george adelbert in mockery were more and more contemptuous of him and one or two were sullen for they loved fan and resented this lilyfingered gent who was to their minds after the old mans acres young compton the son of a neighboring rancher was most insulting for he had himself once carried on a frank courtship with fan and enjoyed a brief halfexpressed engagement he was a fine young fellow not naturally vindictive and he would not have uttered a word of protest had his successful rival been a man of the states but to give way to an english adventurer whose way was paid by his brother was a different case altogether  of george adelberts real feeling the boys of course knew nothing had they known of his hidden contempt for them they would probably have taken him out of the country at the end of a rope but of his position with fan they were in no doubt for she was very frank with them if they accused her of being sweet on the bloody englishman she laughed if they threatened his life in a jocular way she laughed again but in a different way and said dont make a mistake george adelbert is a fighter from way back east and once in a burst of rage she said i wont have you saying such things lincoln compton i wont have it i tell you no one could accuse her of disloyalty or cowardice  in his letters home lester had put his fiancées best foot forward shes quite too good for me he wrote to his brother shes young and beautiful and sole heiress of an estate twice as big as our whole family can muster shes uncultivated the diamond in the rough and all that sort of thing you understand but shell polish easily he put all this down in the sardonic wish to procure some sort of settlement from his brother he got it by return mail  edward was suavely congratulatory and in closing said im deucedly glad youre off my hands just now my boy for im confoundedly hard up youre doing the sensible thingonly dont try to bring your family homenot at present  lester was thrown into despairing fury by this letter which not only cut him off from his remittances but politely shut the paternal door in his own face as well as in the face of his bride for the moment he had some really heroic idea of setting to work to show them what he could do the beggar he squats down on the inheritance shoves me out and then takes on a lot of side as to his superiority over me he always was a selfsufficient ass id like to punch his jaw  then his rage faded out and a kind of sullen resignation came to him what was the use why not submit to fate everything has been against me from the start he bitterly complained and in this spirit he approached his weddingday  the old man acknowledging him as a soninlaw prospective addressed him now with gruff kindness and had lester shown the slightest gain in managerial ability he would have been contentglad to share a little of his responsibility with a younger man in his uncouth hairy grimy fashion blondell was growing old and feeling it as he said to his wife its a pity that our only child couldnt have brought a real man like compton into the family there aint a hand on the place that wouldnt a been more welcome to me what do you suppose would become of this place if it was put into this dandys hands  i dont know pa fan for all her slack ways is a purty fair manager she wouldnt waste it she might let it run down but shed hang on to it  but shes a fool about that jackass  she is now answered the mother with cynical emphasis which she softened by adding dell aint the kind that would try to work her  he sighed with troubled gaze and grumbled an oath i dont know what to think of him he gits me and in that rather mournful spirit he went about his work leaving the whole matter of the marriage festival in the hands of the women in a dim way he still felt that haste was necessary although fans face was as joyous as careless and as innocent as a childs as she galloped about the country with her george adelbert she sowed her bids broadcast as if wishing all the world to share her happiness there was nothing exclusive or shrinking or parsimonious in frances blondell   iv  the marriage feast was indeed an epochmaking event in the county it resembled a barbecue and was quite as inclusive distinctions of the social sort were few in arapahoe county cattlerustlers and sheepmen were debarred of course but aside from these unfortunates practically the whole population of men women children and babies assembled in the kettle hole ranch grove the marriage was to be al fresco as the limone limerick repeated several times  blondell found it a hard day for what with looking after the roasting ox and the ice and the beer he was almost too busy to say hello to his guests fan had contrived to get a clean shirt on him by the trick of whisking away his old one and substituting a white one in its place he put this on without realizing how splendid it was but rebelled flatly at the collar and by the time the ox was well basted his shirt was subdued to a condition which left him almost at ease with himself  fan received the people at the door of the shackher mother being too busy in the preparation for dinner to do more than say howdy to those who deliberately sought her out but fan was not embarrassed or wearied it was her great dayshe was only a little disturbed when george adelbert fled to his room for a little relief from the strain of his position for he lacked both her serenity of spirit and her physical health  once lester would have enjoyed the action and comment of these people as characters in a play but now the knowledge that he was about to sink to their level and be nailed there filled him with a fear and disgust which not even the radiant face and alluring body of his bride could conceal or drive out these lumbering ranchers these tobaccochewing drawling lumpkins were they to be his companions for the rest of his life these women with their toothless shapeless mouths these worn and weary mothers in homemade calico and cheap millinery were they to be the visitors at his fireside what kind of woman would they make of fan  by one oclock the corrals were full of ponies and the sheds and yards crowded with carriages all faded by the pitiless sun and sucked dry by the neverresting wind of the plain  meanwhile the young women had set long tables in the back yard and covered them with foodcontributed chicken homemade biscuit cake and pie while the young fellows had been noisily working at constructing a bowery for the dance which was to follow the ceremony at three and at last fan raised a buglecall for dinner and they all came with a rush  the feast did not last long for every one was hungry and ate without permitting delay or distraction nearly all remarked on having had a very early breakfast and they certainly showed capacity for not merely beef and beer but pie and icecream and when they shoved back and lighted the cigars which lester had provided with prodigal hand they all agreed that the barbecue was up to the bills  the ceremony at three was short almost hurried so great was the bustle about the house and yard fan wore no veil and george adelbert made no change from the neat sacksuit which he had put on at rising at the close of the clergymans blessing he was called upon for a second time to pump the hard hands and stringy arms of his neighbors as they filed by to bid them both a hearty godspeed  after this painful procession was ended fan dragged him away to the bower where the young folks were already dancing with prodigious clatter how young she is he exclaimed as he saw her mix with the crowd of tireless stamping prancing cowboys  as the dance went on he grew furious with her lack of reserve her indelicacy her goodnatured laughter with the men who crowded about her familiarly was a kind of disloyalty she seemed at times to be exchanging doubtful jests with them and at last to protect her from the results of her own fatuity he danced with her himselfdanced almost incessantly notwithstanding the heat and the noise  at sunset they all returned to the tables and ate up what remained of the ox and the pies  lester was well enough acquainted with these rough youths to know that some deviltry was preparing and already furious with his bride and distrustful of the future his selfcommand at last gave way drawing fan away from the crowd he said tenderly  ive had enough of this im having aglar harness the buckskins into the red cart and i want you to go to the house and pack a few thingswere going to limone and catch the early train for denver  we cant do that dell we got to stay here and feed this gang once more  oh hang the gang im sick of them get ready i tell you who cares what these beggars think  she laughed youre jealous of them then rising to his passion she answered all right ill sneak some clothes into a bag and well slide out and leave the gang  a halfhour later they stole away toward the back of the garden and out upon the prairie where a mexican was holding a spirited team fan was giggling so hard that she was barely able to lift the valise which she carried in her hand  dont you tell she said to the mexican if they ask say we went to holcombe  all right i sabe the mexican replied even as he spoke the music in the bower ceased and voices were heard in question  fan sobered theyve missed us already  lester took the reins send em south aglar and at his chirp the team sprang forward out upon the road into the coolness and silence of the midnight plain  fan clutching lesters arm shook with laughter its like elopingaint it  the tone of her voice irritated him good heaven how vulgar she is and she is my wife was his thought and he took no pleasure in her nearness  wild whoops reached them from the ranchhouse now hid in the valley behind them and a few moments later the yells broke out again perceptibly nearer  theyre after us cried fan vastly excited and pleased its a race now and catching the whip from his hand she lashed the horses into a gallop  he said ill turn into the sunfish trail well throw em off the track  no use she laughed no use dell they can read a trail like injuns besides theyre overtaking us we might as well turn and go back  his only answer was a shout to the horses he was burning with fury now all his hidden contempt his concealed hatred of the vulgarians behind him filled his heart it was like them the savages to give chase  with shrill whoops in imitation of comanches the cowboys came on riding their swift and tireless ponies like skimming hawks they swept down the swells and the bride clinging to her husbands arm called each of them by his name  link compton is in the lead pull up she reached a firm hand and laid it on the lines pull up dell its no use  he tried to shake off her grasp but could not her voice changed to command dont be a fool she called sharply and laying both hands upon the reins she brought the horses into a trot in spite of his furious objection just as the first of the pursuing cowboys rode alongside and seizing one of the horses by the bit cried out  come back we need you  even as he spoke a whistling rope settled round the fleeing couple and the team came to a stand surrounded by a hooting mob of mounted men the noose tightdrawn was like a steel embrace and compton called  thought youd give us the slip did ye well i dont think  leave us alone you ruffians shouted lester or itll be the worse for you  they all laughed at this and compton drew the rope tighter pinning lesters arms to his side  boys began fan in appeal but she got no further  lester wrenching his right arm loose began to shoot what happened after that no one ever clearly knew but the team sprang wildly forward and comptons pony reared and fell backward and the bride and groom were thrown violently to the ground                                       when fan opened her eyes she saw the big stars above her and felt a sinewy arm beneath her head compton was fanning her with his hat and calling upon her to speak his voice agonized with fear and remorse  slowly it all came back to her and struggling to a sitting position she called piteously dell where are you dell her voice rose in fear a tone no man had ever heard in it before she staggered to her feet and dazedly looked about her a group of awed silenced dismounted men stood not far away and on the ground lying in a crumpled distorted heap was her husband with a shriek of agony she fell on her knees beside him calling upon him to open his eyes to speak to her  then at last as the conviction of his death came to her she lifted her head and with a voice of level hoarsethroated hate she imprecated her murderers ill kill you every one of you ill kill you for thisyou cowardly wolvesill kill   v  they lifted them both up for dead and compton taking fan in his strong arms held her like a child as they drove slowly back to the ranch all believed lester dead but compton who held his ear to fans lips insisted that she was breathing and indeed she recovered from her swoon before they reached the house  blondell more powerfully moved than ever before in his life after a swift curse upon the culprits took his girl to his bosom and carried her to her bed  as her brain cleared fan rose and staggering across the room took her husbands head in her arms bring some water dell is hurt dont you see he is hurt be quick  has somebody gone for the doctor asked the mother to whom this was the raving of dementia somebody go  no one had for all believed the man to be dead but compton exclaimed ill go turning to vault his horse glad of something to do eager to escape the sight of fans agonized face  the dash of cold water on his bruised face brought a flutter of life to lesters eyelids and in triumph the bride cried out  i told you so he is alive oh dell cant you speak to me  he could not so much as lift his eyelids but his breathing deepened and with that sign of returning vitality fan was forced to be content she was perfectly composed now and helped to bathe his crushed and bleeding head and his broken shoulder with a calmness very impressive to all those who were permitted to glance within the room  slowly the guests departed the cowboys lowvoiced and funereal of mien rode away in groups of three or four  the doctor came hurrying down the slope about ten of the morning his small roan mustang galloping his case of instruments between his feet he was very young and luckily very selfconfident and took charge of the case with thrilling authority  the coma was induced he explained by the concussion of the brain the shoulder is also badly contused and the collarbone broken but if brain fever does not set in the man will live the treatment so far as it has gone is admirable  compton returned with him or a little before him and seemed to be waiting for arrest he was a lean brown young fellow with good gray eyes and a shapely nose yes i threw the rope he confessed to every one it was all in fun but he shot my horse and as he reared up he jerked the people out of the buggy i guess the broncos jumped ahead at the same time but it was my fault i had no business to rope em in fact we had no business chasing em up at all  at last blondell gruffly told him to go home if the man dies well come after you he added with blunt ferocity  all right responded the young fellow with lofty spirit ill be therebut i want to see fan a moment before i leave i want to know if there is anything i can do for her or him  blondell was for refusing this utterly but his wife said you didnt mean nothing linkim sure of thatand ive always liked you and so has fan she wont lay it up against you i know ill tell her youre here  fan sitting beside lesters bed turned at her mothers word and saw the young fellow standing in the doorway in mute appeal her glance was without anger but it was cold and distant she shook her head and the young rancher turned away shaken with sobs that look was worse than her curse had been                                       from the dim grim region of his delirium and his deathlike unconsciousness george lester struggled slowly back to life his reawakening was like a new birth he seemed born again this time an americana western american in the measure of a good old homely phrase some sense a sense of the fundamental oneness of humanity had been beaten into his head  as he lay there helpless and suffering he was first of all aware of fan whose face shone above him like the moon and was soon able to understand her unwearying devotion and to remember that she was his wife she was always present when he woke and he accepted her presence as he accepted sunshine knowing nothing of the sleeplessness and toil which her attendance involveda knowledge of this came later  at times gruff old blondell himself bent his shaggy head above his bed to ask how he felt and no mother could have been more considerate than mrs blondell  what right have i to despise these people he asked himself one day what have i done to lift myself above them and this question extended to the neighbors to the awkward ranchers who came stiffly and with a sort of awe into his room to pass a good word as they said they are a good sort after allhis heart prompted him to admit  but his deepest penitence his tenderest gratitude rose to fan whom care and love had marvelously refined he was able to forget her careless speech and to look quite through her untidy ways to the golden good heart which beat beneath her unlovely gowns nothing was too hard too menial for her hands and her smile warmed his midnight sickroom like sunshine  he was curiously silent even after his strength was sufficient for speech content to lie on his bed and watch her as she moved about him he answered only in monosyllables while the deep current of his love gathered below his reticence as he came to a full understanding of what he had been and to a sense of his unworthy estimate of her and her people his passion broke bounds  fan he called out one morning im not fit to receive all your care and devotionbut im going to try to be im going to set to work in earnest when i get up your people shall be my people your cares my cares he could not go on and fan who was looking down at him in wonder stooped and laid a kiss on his quivering lips  you get well boy thats all you need to worry about she said and her face was very sweetfor she smiled upon him as if he were a child     the lonesome man         the murderer still seeks forgetfulness in the solitude       building his cabin in the shadow of great peaks     iv  the lonesome man   the road that leads to the historic north shoulder of solidor is lonely now the stages that once crawled painfully upward through its flowery meadows are playhouses for the children of silver plume and the brakes that once howled so resoundingly on the downward way are rusting to ashes in the weeds that spring from the soil of the silverado queens unused corral the railway half a hundred miles to the north has left the famous pass to solitude and to grass  once a week or possibly oftener a cattleman or prospector rides across or a little band of tourists plod up or downthinking they are penetrating to the heart of the rockiesbut for the most part the trail is passing swiftly to the unremembered twilight of the tragic past there are it is true one or two stampmills above pemberton but they draw their supplies from the valley to the west and not from the plains cities and the upper camps have long since been deserted by the restless seeker of sudden gold  it is a desolate unshaded country made so by the reckless hand of the tenderfoot prospector who in the days of the silver rush cut and burned the timber sinfully and the great peaks are meticulated with the rotting boles of noble pines and spotted with the decaying stumps of the firs which once made the whole land as beautiful as a park here and there however a segment of this splendid ancient forest remains to give some hint of what the ranges were before the destroying horde of silverseekers struck and scarred it  along this trail and above the last vestige of its standing trees a man could be seen walking eastward and upward one bright afternoon in august a couple of years ago he moved slowly for he was heavily built and obviously not much used to climbing for he paused often to breathe the air at that altitude is thin and to the one not accustomed to it most unsatisfying in the intervals of his pauses the travelers eyes swept the heights and explored each cañon wall as if in search of a restingplace around him the conies cried and small birds skimmed from ledge to ledge but his dark face did not lighten with joy of the beauty which shone over his head nor to that which flamed under his feet it was plain that he was too preoccupied with some inner problem too intent on his quest to give eye or ear to the significance of bird or flower  huge solidor bare and bleak rose grandly to the north propping the highpiled shining clouds and the somber dustcovered fields of snow showed to what far height his proud summit soared above his fellows little streams of icy water trickled through closeknit velvety sward whereon small flowers white and gold and lilac showed like fairy footprints down from the pass a chill wind delicious and invigorating rushed as palpably as if it were a liquid wave in all this upper region no shelter offered to the tired man  a few minutes later as he rounded the sloping green bastion which flanks the peak to the south the mans keen eyes lighted upon a small cabin which squatted almost unnoticeably against a gray ledge some five hundred feet higher than the rock whereon he stood the door of this hut was open and the figure of a man dwarfed by distance could be detected intently watching the pedestrian on the trail unlike most cabindwellers he made no sign of greeting uttered no shout of cheer on the contrary as the stranger approached he disappeared within his den like a marmot  there was something appealing in the slow mounting of the man on foot he was both tired and breathless and as he neared the cabin which was built on ground quite twelve thousand feet above sealevel his limbs dragged and every step he made required his utmost will twice he stopped to recover his strength and to ease the beating of his heart and as he waited thus the last time the lone cabindweller appeared in his door and silently gazed confronting his visitor with a strangely inhospitable and prolonged scrutiny it was as if he were a lonely animal jealous of his ground and resentful even of the most casual human inspection  the stranger advancing near spoke is this the trail to silver plume he asked his heaving breast making his speech broken  it is replied the miner whose thin face and hawklike eyes betrayed the hermit and the man on guard  how far is it across the pass  about thirty miles  a good nights walk are there any camps above here  none  how far is it to the next cabin  some twelve miles  the miner still studying the stranger with piercing intensity expressed a desire to be reassured what are you doing up here on this trail are you a mining expert a spy he seemed to ask  the traveler divining his curiosity explained i stayed last night at the mill below im a millwright i have some property to inspect in silver plume hence im walking across i didnt know it was so far i was misinformed im not accustomed to this high air and im used up can you take care of me  the miner glanced round at the heap of ore which betrayed his craft and then back at the dark bearded impassive face  come in he said at last ill feed you but his manner was at once surly and suspicious  the walls of the hovel were built partly of logs and partly of boulders and its roof was compacted of dirt and gravel but it was decently habitable the furniture handrived out of slabs was scanty and the floor was laid with planks yet everything indicated many days of wear  youve been here some time the stranger remarked rather than asked  ten years  thereafter the two men engaged in a silent duel the millwright leaning back in his rude chair stretched his tired limbs and gazed down the valley with no further word of inquiry while his grudging host prepared a primitive meal and set it upon a box which served as a table  you may eat he curtly said  in complete silence and with calm abstraction the stranger turned to the food and ate and drank accepting it all as if this were a roadhouse and he a paying guest the sullen watchfulness of his host seemed not to disturb him not even to interest him  at length the miner spoke as if in answer to a questionthe question he feared  no my mine has not panned out wellnot yet the ore is lowgrade and the mill is too far away  to this informing statement the other man did not so much as lift an eyebrow his face was like a closed door his eyes were curtained windows he mused darkly as one who broods on some bitter defeat  nevertheless he was a human presence and the lonely dweller on the heights could not resist the charm of his guests personality remote as he seemed  where do you live he asked  there was a moments hesitation  in st paul  ever been here before  the dark man shook his shaggy head slowly and dropped his eyes as if this were the end of the communication no and i never expect to come again  the miner perceived power in his guests resolute taciturnity and the very weight of the silence eventually opened his own lips from moment to moment the impulse to talk grew stronger within him there was something as compelling as heat in this reticent visitor whose soul was so intent on inward problems that it perceived nothing of interest in an epaulet of gold on the shoulder of mount solidor  few come this trail now the miner volunteered as he cleared the table i am alone and seldom see a human being drifting my way i do not invite them  the stranger refilled his pipe and again leaned back against the wall in ponderous repose if he heard his hosts remark he gave no sign of it and yet despite the persistence of his guests silenceperhaps because of itthe lonely goldseeker babbled on with increasing candor contradicting himself revealing hiding edging round his story confessing to his hopes of riches betraying in the end the secrets of his lonely life it was as if the gates of his unnatural reserve had broken down and the desire to be heard to be companioned had overborne all his early caution  its horribly lonesome up here he confessed sometimes i think ill give it all up and go back to civilization when i came here the pass had its traffic now no one rides it which is lucky for me he added i have no prying visitorsi mean no one to contest my claimand yet a man cant do much alone even if my ore richens i must transport it or build a mill sometimes i wonder what im living for stuck away in this hole in the hills i was born to better things  he checked himself at this moment as if he were on the edge of selfbetrayal but his listener seemed not vitally interested in these personal details however he made some lowvoiced remark and as if hypnotized the miner resumed his monologue  the nights are the worst they are endlessand sometimes when i cannot sleep i feel like surrendering to my fate here again he broke off sharply thats nonsense of course i mean it seems as if a life were too much to pay for a crazy acti mean a mine youll ask why i dont sell it but its all i have and besides no one has any faith in it but myself i cannot sell and i cant live down there among men  gabbling keeping time to his nervous feet and hands endlessly repeating himself denying confessing the miner raged on and through it all the darkbrowed guest smoked tranquilly too indifferent to ask a question or make comment but when once or twice he lifted his eyes the garrulous one shuddered and turned away a scared look on his haggard face he seemed unable to endure that steady glance  at last for a little space he remained silent then as if compelled by some increasing magic in his hearer he burst forth  im not here entirely by my own faulti mean my own choice a man is a product of his environment you know that and mine made me idle wasteful drink got medrink made me madand soand sohere i am struggling to win back a fortune once i gambledon the wheel now i am gambling with nature on the green of these mountain slopes but ill wini have already wonand soon i shall sell and go back to the great cities  again his will curbed his treacherous tongue and walking to the doorway he stood for a moment looking out then he fiercely snarled  oh god how i hate it allhow i hate myself i am going mad with this life the squeak of these shadowy conies the twitter of these unseen little birds go on day by day theyll drive me mad if you had not come tonight i could not have slepti would have gone to the mill and that means drink to medrink and oblivion you came and saved me i feared youhated you then now i bless you  once more he seemed to answer an unspoken query  i have no people my mother is dead my father has disowned mehe does not even know i am alive im the black devil of the familybut i shall go back  his face was working with passion and though he took a seat opposite his guest his hands continued to flutter aimlessly and his head moved restlessly from side to side  i dont know why i am telling all this to you he went on after a pause i reckon its because of the weakness of the thirst that is coming over me some time ill go down to those hellholes at the mills and never come backthe stuff they sell to me is destructive as fireit is poison youre a man of substance i can see thatyoure no hobo like most of the fellows out herethats why im talking to you you remind me of some one i know theres something familiar in your eyes  the man with the beard struck the ashes from his pipe and began scraping it there is always a woman in these cases he critically remarked  the miner took this simple statement as a challenging question his excitement visibly increased but he did not at once reply he talked on aimlessly incoherently struggling like a small animal in a torrent he rose at last and as he stood in the doorway breathing deeply his face livid in the sunset light the muscles of his jaw trembled  the stranger observed his hosts agitation but put away his pipe with slow and steady hand he said nothing and yet an observer would have declared he held the other and weaker man in the grasp of an inexorable hypnotic silence finally he fixed a calm cold glance upon his host as if summoning him to answer  yes the miner confessed there is always a woman in the caseanother and more fortunate man the woman is false the man is treacherous you trust and they betray such beings ruin and maddenthey make outlaws such as i am  love is above will asserted the millwright with decision  the other man fiercely turned i know what you meanyou mean the woman is not to be condemnedthat love goes where it is drawn that is true but deceit is not involuntaryit is deliberate  sometimes we deceive ourselves  in her case it was deceit retorted the miner who was now so deeply engaged with his own story that each general observation on the part of his guest was taken to be specific and personal  the room was growing dusky and the strangers glance appeared keener more insistent as his body melted into the shadow his shaggy head and black beard all but disappeared only the faint outlines of his forehead remained and yet as his physical self faded into the gloom his personality his psychic self loomed larger his will enveloped the hermit drawing upon him with irresistible power it was as if he were wringing him dry of a confession as the priest closes in upon the culprit  i had my happy daysmy days of carefree youth the unquiet man was saying but my time of innocence was short evil companions came early and reckless deeds followed i knew i was losing something i knew i was being drawn downward but i could not escape day and night i called for help and thenshe came  who came  the one who made me forget all the others the one who made me ashamed  and then  and then for a time i was happy in the hope that i might win her and so redeem my life  and she  she pitied meat firstand loved meat least i thought so  as his excitement increased his words came slower burdened with passion he spoke like a prisoner addressing a judge his voice but a husky whisper  i told her i was unworthy of herthat was when i believed her to be an angel i promised to begin a new life for her sake then she promised mehelped meand all the while she was false to mefalse as a hellcat  how queried the almost invisible man and his voice was charged with stern demand  all the time she was promised to another manand that man my enemy  here his frenzy flared forth in a torrent of words  thenthen i went mad my brain was scarred and numb i lost all sense of pityall fear of lawall respect for woman i only knew my wrongsmy despairmy hate i watched i waited i found them together  and then what did you do then demanded the stranger rising from his seat with sudden energy his voice deep insistent masterful tell me what you did  the miners wild voice died to a hesitant whisper ii fled  but before thatbefore you fled  what is it to you asked the hermit gazing with scared eyes at the man who towered above him like the demon of retribution who are you  i am the avenger answered the other the man you hated was my brother the woman you killed was his wife  the fugitive fell upon his knees with a cry like that of one being strangled  out of the darkness a red flame darted and the crouching man fell to the floor a crumpled bloody heap  for a long time the executioner stood above the body waiting listening from the shadow to the faint receding breathstrokes of his victim when all was still he restored his weapon to its sheath and stepped over the threshold into the keen and pleasant night  as he closed the door behind him the stranger raised his eyes to solidor whose sovereign cloudlike crest swayed among the stars  now i shall rest he said with solemn satisfaction     the trail tramp         mounted wanderer horseman of the restless heart still       rides from place to place contemptuous of gold carrying in       his parfleche all the vanishing traditions of the west     v  the trail tramp   kelley afoot  i  kelley was in off the range and in profound disgust with himself for after serving honorably as linerider and later as cowboss for ten years or more he had ridden over to keno to meet an old comrade just how it happened he couldnt tell but he woke one morning without a dollar and what was worse incredibly worse without horse or saddle even his revolver was gone  in brief tall ed for the first time in his life was set afoot and this you must understand is a most direful disaster in cowboy life it means that you must begin again from the ground up as if you were a perfectly new tenderfoot from nebraska  fort keno was of course not a real fort but it was a real barracks the town was an imitation town the fort spick span in rows with nicely planted trees and green grassplats kept in condition at vast expense to the war department stood on the bank of the sluggish river while just below it and across the stream sprawled the town drab fleabitten unkempt littered with tin cans and old bottles a collection of saloons gamblinghouses and nameless dives with a few peoplea very fewmaking an honest living by selling groceries saddles and coaloil  among the industries of keno city was a liveryandsales stable and kelley with intent to punish himself at once applied for the position of hostler you durned fool he said addressing himself as youve played the drunken injun suppose you play valet to a lot of mustangs for a while  as a disciplinary design he felicitated himself as having hit upon the most humiliating and distasteful position in keno it was understood that harford of the cottonwood corral never hired a real man as hostler he seemed to prefer bums and tramps either because he could get them cheaper or else because no decent man would work for him he was an arbitrary cuss and ready with gun or boot he came down a long trail of weatherworn experiences in the southwest and showed it in both face and voice he was a big man who had once been fatter but his wrinkled and sour visage seldom crinkled into a smile he had never been jolly and he was now morose  kelley hated him that too was another part of his elaborate scheme of selfpunishmenthated but did not fear him for tall ed kelley feared nothing that walked the earth or sailed the air you bum he continued to say in bitter derision as he caught glimpses of himself of a morning in the little fragment of broken glass which being tacked on the wall served as mirror in the office you durned mangy coyote you need a shave but you wont get it you need a clean shirt and a new bandanna but you wont get them neithernot yet awhile youll earn em by going without a drop of whisky and by forking manure fer the next six months you hear me  he slept in the barn on a soiled illsmelling bunk and his hours of repose were broken by calls on the telephone or by some one beating at the door late at night or early in the morning but he always responded without a word of complaint it was all lovely discipline it was like batting a measly bronco over the head in correction of some grievous fault like nipping your calf for example and he took a grim satisfaction in going about degraded and forgotten of his fellows for no one in keno knew that this grimy hostler was cowboss on the perco this in a certain degree softened his disgrace and lessened his punishment but he couldnt quite bring himself to the task of explaining just how he had come to leave the range and go into service with harford  the officers of the fort when tired of the ambulance occasionally took out a team and covered rig and so kelley came in contact with the commanding officer major dugan a fine figure of a man with carefully barbered head and immaculate uniform in kelleys estimation he was almost too well kept for a man nearing fifty he was indeed a gallant to whom comely women were still the fairest kind of game  in truth tall ed as hostler often furnished the major with a carriage in which to make some of his private expeditions and this was another and final disgrace which the cowman perceived and commented upon to assist an old libertine like the major in concealing his night journeys was the nethermost deep of selfdiscipline but when the pretty young wife of his employer became the object of the majors attention kelley was thrown into doubt  anita harford part spanish and part german as sometimes happens in new mexico was a curious and interesting mixture with lovely goldenbrown hair and big darkbrown eyes she had the ingratiating smile of the señora her mother and the moods of gravity almost melancholy of her father  she had been away in albuquerque during the first week of kelleys hostlership and though he had heard something of her from the men about the corral he had no great interest in her till she came one afternoon to the door of the stable where she paused like a snowwhite timid antelope and softly said  are you the new hostler  i am miss  she smiled at his mistake i am mrs harford please let me have the single buggy and bay nellie  kelley concealed his surprise sure thing mom want her right now  if you please  as she moved away so lightly and so daintily kelley stared in stupefaction guess ive miscalculated somewhere old harf must have more drag into him than i made out how did the old seed get a woman like that pears like hes the champion hypnotic spieler when it comes to skirts  he hitchedup the horse in profound meditation for the first time since his downfall his humiliation seemed just a trifle deeper than was necessary he regretted his filthy shirt and his unshorn cheeks and as he brought the horse around to the door of the bosss house he slipped out of the buggy on the off side hurriedly tethered the mare to the pole and retreated to his alley like a rat to its burrow the few moments when anitas clear eyes had rested upon him had been moments of selfrevelation  kelley youre all kinds of a blankety fool said he youre causing yourself a whole lot of extra misery and youre a disgustin object besides it isnt necessary fer you to be a skunk in order to give yourself a welting go now and get a shave and a clean shirt and start again  this he did and out of his next weeks pay he bought a clean pair of overalls and a new sombrero so that when he came back to the barn harford was disturbed  hope you arent going to pull out kelley you suit me and if its a question of pay ill raise you a couple of dollars on a week  oh no im not leaving only i jest felt like i was a little too measly pears like i ought to afford a clean shirt it does make a heap of difference in the looks of a feller no im booked to stay with you fer a while yet  naturally thereafter little mrs harford filled a large place in kelleys gloomy world he was not a romantic person but he was often lonesome in the midst of his selfimposed penance he forbade himself the solace of the saloon he denied himself a day or even an hour off duty and harford secretly amazed and inwardly delighted went so far one day as to offer him a cigar  kelley waved it away no ive cut out the tobacco too  this astounded his boss say its a wonder you escaped the ministry  its more of a wonder than you know replied kelley i was headed right plumb that way till i was seventeen my mother had it all picked out fer me then i broke away  harford with the instinctive caution of the plainsman pursued the subject no further he was content to know that for a very moderate wage he had secured the best man with horses that the stable had ever known his only anxiety related to the question of keeping his find  kelleys too good to be permanent he said to his wife that night hell skip out with one of the best saddlehorses some night or else hell go on a tearing drunk and send the whole outfit up in smoke i dont understand the cuss he looks like the usual hobo out of a job but hes as abstemious as a new england deacon pears like he has no faults at all  anita had been attracted to kelley lowly as he looked and upon hearing his singular virtues recounted by her husband opened her eyes in augmented interest all the men in her world were rough her father drank her brothers fought and swore and cheated and her husband was as free of speech in her presence as if she were another kind of man softening his words a little but not much therefore the next time she met kelley she lingered to make conversation with him rejoicing in his candid eyes and handsome face she observed also that his shirt was clean and his tie new he looks almost like a soldier she thought and this was her highest compliment  surrounded as she was by gamblers horsejockeys cattlebuyers and miners all generally speaking of the same slouchy unkempt type she recognized in the officers of the fort gentlemen of highest breeding and radiant charm erect neat brisk of step the lieutenants on parade gave off something so alien yet so sweet that her heart went out to them collectively and when they lifted their caps to her individually she smiled upon them all with childish unconsciousness of their dangerous qualities  most of the younger unmarried men took these smiles to be as they were entirely without guile others spoke jestingly in private of her attitude but were inclined to respect harfords reputation as a gunman only the major himself was reckless enough to take advantage of the young wifes admiration for a uniform  kelley soon understood the situation his keen eyes and sensitive ears informed him of the light estimation in which his employers wife was held by the major but at first he merely said this is none of your funeral kelley stick to your currycomb harford is able to take care of his own  this good resolution weakened the very next time anita met him and prettily praised him mr harford says you are the best man he ever had and i think that must be so for my pony never looked so clean and shiny  kelley almost blushed for as a matter of faithful history he had spent a great deal of time brushing bay nellie she did indeed shine like a bottle and her harness newly oiled and carefully burnished glittered as if composed of jet and gold  oh thats all right its a part of my job he replied as carelessly as he could contrive i like a good horseand a pretty woman he might have added but he didnt  although anita lingered as if desiring a word or two more the tall hostler turned resolutely away and disappeared into the stable  bay nellie as the one dependable carriagehorse in the outfit of broncos had been set aside for the use of anita and her friends but kelley had orders from harford to let the mare out whenever the women did not need her provided a kindly driver was assured and so it happened that the wives of the officers occasionally used her although none of them could be called friends or even acquaintances of little mrs harford  kelley observed their distant if not contemptuous nods to his employers wife as they chanced to meet her on the street but he said no word even when some of the town loafers frankly commented on it he owed nothing to harford its not my job to defend his wifes reputation nevertheless it made him hot when he heard one of these loafers remark i met the old major the other evening driving along the river road with harfs wife somebody better warn the major or therell be merry hell and a military funeral one of these days  i reckon youre mistaken said kelley  not by a whole mile it was dark but not so dark but that i could see who they were they were in a top buggy drivin that slick nag the old man is so choice about  when was it asked kelley  night before last i met em up there just at the bend of the river  kelley said no more for he remembered that anita had called for the horse on that date just about sundown and had driven away alone she returned alone about tenat least she drove up to the stable door alone but he recalled hearing the low tones of a mans voice just before she called  it made him sad and angry he muttered an imprecation against the whole world of men himself included if i hadnt seen herif i didnt know how sweet and kind and pretty she wasi wouldnt mind he said to himself but to think of a little babe like her he checked himself that old cockalorum needs killing i wonder if ive got to do it he asked in conclusion   ii  harford came home the next day and for several weeks there was no further occasion for gossip although kelley had his eyes on the major so closely that he could neither come nor go without having his action analyzed he kept close record of anitas coming and going also although it made him feel like a scoundrel whenever she glanced at him he was sure she was only the thoughtless child in all her indiscretions with a childs romantic admiration of a handsome uniform  ill speak to her he resolved ill hand her out a word of warning just to clear my conscience she needs a big brother or an unclesome one to give her a jolt and ill do it  the opportunity came one day soon after harfords return but his courage almost failed at the moment of meeting so dainty so small so charming and so birdlike did the young wife seem  she complimented him again on the condition of the mare and asked timidly how much does my husband pay you  more than im worth he replied with gloomy selfdepreciation  she caught the note of bitterness in his voice and looked at him a moment in surprised silence her big eyes full of question what made you say that  kelley repenting of his lack of restraint smiled and said oh i felt that wayfor a minute you see i used to lead a high life of ease i was a noblemanan irish lord  she smiled and uttered an incredulous word but he went on  yes although my name is kelley i belong to a long line of kings im working as hostler just to square myself fer having killed a man you see my queen was kind o foolish and reckless and let a certain english duke hang round her till i got locoed and being naturally quick on the trigger i slew him  she was not stupid she understood and with quick resentful glance she took the reins from his hands and stepped into the carriage  kelley silenced and with a feeling that he had bungled his job fell back a pace while she drove away without so much as a backward glance  i reckon she got it he said grimly as he went back to his work i didnt put it out just the way i had it in my head but she peared to sense enough of it to call me a piute for butting in if that dont work on her ill tack a warning on the major which nobody will misread fer a joke  as the hours of the afternoon went by he became more and more uneasy i hope shell turn up before dark fer harf is liable to get back any minute he said a dozen times and when at last he saw her coming up the street with a woman in the seat beside her he breathed deeply and swore heartily in his relief i guess my parable kind o worked he said exultantly shes kept clear of the old goat this trip  the little lady stopped her horse at the door of the stable and with a cool and distant nod alighted and walked away  im the hostler nowsure thing grinned kelley no raise of pay fer tall ed this week  he was in reality quite depressed by the change in her attitude toward him reckon i didnt get just the right slaunch on that warning of mineand yet at the same time she ought to have seen i meant it kindlyoh well hell its none o my funeral anyway harford is no green squash hes a seasoned old warrior who ought to know when men are stealing his wife and he went back to his dusty duties in full determination to see nothing and do nothing outside the barn  nevertheless when thereafter anybody from the fort asked for bay nellie he gave out that she was engaged and the very first time the major asked for the mare kelley not only brusquely said shes in use but hung up the receiver in the midst of the majors explanation  the town gossips were all busy with the delightful report that mrs harford had again been seen driving with the major whose reputation for gallantry monstrously exaggerated by the reek of the saloons made even a single hour of his company a dash of pitch to the best of women kelley speculated on just how long it would take harford to learn of these hints against his wife some of his blunt followers were quite capable of telling him in so many words that the major was doing him wrong and when they did an explosion would certainly take place  one day a couple of harfords horses standing before the stable became frightened and ran away up the street kelley leaping upon one of the fleetest broncos in the stalls went careering in pursuit just as anita came down the walk he was a fine figure of a man even when slouching about the barn but mounted he was magnificent it was the first time he had ridden since the loss of his own outfit and the feel of a vigorous steed beneath his thighs the noise of pounding feet the rush of air filled his heart with mingled exultation and regret he was the centaur again  anita watched him pass and disappear with a feeling of surprise as well as of admiration she was skilled in reading the character of men on horseback and peculiarly sensitive to such an exhibition of grace and power her hostler was transformed into something new and wholly admirable and she gladly took the trouble to watch for his return as she could not witness the roping and the skilful subduing of the outlaws  the picture he made as he tore along swinging his rope had displaced that of the dirty indifferent hostler and anita thereafter looked upon him with respect notwithstanding his presumptuous warning which still lay heavy in her ears  she still resented his interference but she resented it less now that she knew him better she began to wonder about him who was he why was he the hostler naturally being wise in certain ways of men she inferred that strong drink had set him afoot but when she hesitantly approached her husband on this point his reply was brusque i dont know anything about kelley and dont want to know so long as he does his work his family vault is safe  still desiring to be informed she turned to her servants with no better results they knew very little about tall ed but we like him they were free to say  this newly discovered mystery in the life of her hostler accomplished what his warning had failed to do it caused her to neglect her correspondence with the major his letter lay in a hollow willowtree on the river road unread for nearly a week and when one afternoon she finally rode by to claim it her interest was strangely dulled the spice of the adventure was gone  as she was about to deliver her pony to kelley that night he handed her an envelope and with penetrating glance said i found this on the river road today i wouldnt write any more suchif i was you it aint nice and it aint safe  it was her own letter the one she had but just written and deposited in the tree she chilled and stiffened under the keen edge of kelleys contemptuous pity then burned hot with illogical rage  what right you spied on me its a shame  so it is he agreed quietly but i dont want any killing doneunless i do it myself  you are a thief she accused  all right he answered dispassionately spykeeperbig brotherdoganything goesonly i dont intend to let you slide to hell without a protest youre nothing but a kida baby you dont know what youre going into im an old stager i know a whole lot that i wish i didnt know ive known women who said they didnt carelots of embut they did they all cared they all knew theyd lost out theres only one end to the trail youre starting in on and it aint a pretty one harf married you in good faith and even if he is gettin old and slowfooted and skinny hes your husband and entitled to a square deal  blinded by her tears and weak with passionate resentment of his tone she could scarcely clamber down from the carriage as soon as her feet touched the ground she started away kelley retained her by the force of his hand upon her wrist  wait a moment he said huskily youre mad now and you want to murder me but think it all over and youll see im your friend  there was something in his voice which caused her to look squarely up into his face and the tenderness she saw there remained long in her memory  youre too sweet and lovely to be the sport of a cheap skate like that dont throw yourself away on any man goodby and god bless ye  she walked away with bent head and tearblinded eyes her heart filled with weakness and pain she was like a child justly punished yet resenting it and mingled with her resentment was a growing love and admiration for the man whose blunt words had bruised her soul in the hope of her redemption                                       kelley went back to his little office gathered his small belongings together and called up harford on the phone ill take that blue cayuse and that denverbrand saddle and call it square to date yes im leaving ive got a call to a ranch over on the perco sorry but i reckon ive worked out my sentence all right so long  ten minutes later he was mounted and riding out of town the air was crisp with autumn frost and the stars were blazing innumerably in the sky a coyote had begun his evening song and to the north rose the high dark mass of the book cliffs toward this wall he directed his way he hurried like one fleeing from temptation and so indeed he was   kelly as marshal  i  along about 96 sulphur springs had become several kinds of a bad town from being a small liquoringup place for cattlemen it had taken on successively the character of a landoffice a lumbercamp and a coalmine  as a cow town it had been hardly more than a hamlet as a mining center it rose to the dignity of possessing as judge pulfoot was accustomed to boast nearly two thousand souls not counting mexicans and navajos it lay in the hot hollows between piñonspotted hills but within sight spread the grassy slopes of the secondary mountains over whose tops the snowlined peaks of the continental divide loomed in stern majesty  the herders still carried winchesters on their saddles and revolvers strung to their belts and each of them strove to keep up cowboy traditions by unloading his weapon on the slightest provocation the gamblers also sustained the conventions of their profession by killing one another now and again and the average citizen regarded these activities with a certain approval for they all denoted a live town  the boys need diversion said the mayor and so long as they confine their celebrations to such hours as will not disturb the children and womenat least the domestic kind of womeni wont complain  and really it is gratifying to record that very few desirable citizens were shot sulphur continued to thrive to glow in the annals of mountain chivalry until by some chance old tom hornaby of wire grass was elected senator that victory marked the beginning of the decline of sulphur  hornaby was pulfoots candidate and the judge took a paternal pride in him he even went up to the capital to see him sworn in and was there unfortunately when the humorous member from lode alluded to hornaby as my esteemed colleague from brimstone center where even the judges tote guns and the children chew dynamiteand what was still more disturbing he was again in the capital when the news came of the shooting and robbing of a couple of coalminers the details of which filled the city papers with sarcastic allusions to tom hornabys live town on the stinking water  hornaby being a heavy owner of land in and about sulphur was very properly furious and judge pulfootdeeply grievedwas indeed on the instant converted a great light fell about him he perceived his home town as it wasor at least he got a glimpse of it as it appeared to the timid souls of civilized men he cowered before hornaby  tom youre right he sadly agreed the old town needs cleaning up it sure is disgraceful  hornaby buttered no parsnips you go right back said he and kick out that bonehead marshal of yours and put a fullsized man into his place a man that will cut that gunplay out and distribute a few of those pluguglies over the landscape what chance have i got in this legislature as the senator from brimstone center ill never get shet of that fool tag whilst im up here  you certainly have a right to be sore the judge admitted but it aint no boys job cleaning up our little burg its going to be good stiff work i dont know who to put into it  i do  who  my foreman ed kelley  i dont know him  well i do hes only been with me a few months but ive tried him and hes all right hes been all over the west knows the greasers and injuns and can take care of himself anywhere the man dont live that can scare him you notice his eyes hes got a glare like the muzzle of a silverplated doublebarrel shotgun he dont know what fear is ive seen him in action and i know  the judge was impressed will the board accept him  theyve got to accept him or go plumb to the devil down there these articles and speeches have put us in wrong with the whole state this wild west business has got to be cut out it scares away capital now you get busy  the judge went back resolved upon a change of administration the constituent who held the office of marshal was brave enough but he had grown elderly and inert he was in truth a joke the gamblers laughed at him and the cowboys played horse with him the spirit of deviltry was stronger than it had ever been in the history of the county  something religious has got to be done the judge argued to the city fathers and having presented hornabys message demanded the installation of kelley  the board listened attentively but were unconvinced who is this kelley hes nothing but a tramp a mounted hobo who knows him  hornaby knows him and wants him and his order goes lets have him in and talk with him anyhow  kelley was called in he showed up a tall composed young fellow of thirty with weatherworn face and steady gray eyes in which the pupils were unusually small and very dark blue his expression was calm and his voice pleasant he listened in amused silence while the judge told him what the program was then he said  thats a whale of a job youve laid out for me but hornabys boss all is if i start in on this you fellows have got to see me through its a right stiff program and i need some insurance pears to me like there should be a little pot for tall ed at the end of this gamesay three dollars a day and a couple of hundred bones when everything is quiet  to this the judge agreed you go in and clean up run these gunmen down the valley cut out this amatoor wild west businessits hurting us property is depreciating right along we certainly cant stand any more of this brimstone business go to it well see that youre properly reimbursed  all right judge but you understand if i go into this peacemaking war i draw no political lines i am chief for the time being and treat everybody alikegreasers paches your friends my friends everybody  thats all right its your deal said the judge and the aldermen   ii  tall ed had drifted into sulphur from the southwest some six months before and although fairly well known among the ranchers on the wire grass was not a familiar figure in town the news of his appointment was received with laughter by the loafers and with wonder by the quiet citizens who coldly said  he appears like a fullsized man but size dont count theres clayt mink for instance the worst little motheaten scrap in the state and yet hell kill at the drop of a hat sooner or later hes going to try out this new marshal same as he did the others  this seemed likely for mink owned and operated the biggest gamblinghouse in sulphur and was considered to be as he was a dangerous man he already hated kelley who had once protected a drunken cattleman from being almost openly robbed in his saloon furthermore he was a relentless political foe to hornaby  he was indeed a mere scrap of a man with nothing about him fullsized except his mustache and yet despite his unheroic physique he was quick and remorseless in action in italy he would have carried a dagger in england he would have been a lightweight roughandtumble fighter in the violent west he was a gunman menacing every citizen who crossed his inclination and he took kelleys appointment as a direct affront on the part of hornaby and pulfoot  hed better keep out of my way he remarked to his friends with a malignant sneer  kelley was not deceived in his adversary hes a coward at heart like all these hairhung triggers he said to pulfoot im not hunting any trouble with him but it was not necessary to finish his sentence his voice and smile indicated his meaning  the town was comparatively quiet for the first month or two after kelley took office it seemed that the rough element was reflectively taking his measure and hornabys herders as they rode in and out of town told stories of tall eds rough and ready experiences which helped to establish official confidence in him  i reckon weve done the right thing this time wrote pulfoot to hornaby the boys all seem to realize weve got a man in office  this calm this unnatural calm was broken one night by mink himself who shot and all but killed the liverystable keeper in a dispute over roulette knowing that his deed would bring the new marshal down upon him at once the gambler immediately declared determined war  the man who comes after me will need a wooden overcoat he promulgated i wont stand being hounded that hostler was pulling his gun on me i got him first thats all it was a fair fight and everybody knows it  the liveryman was in fact armed at the time and the disposition of many citizens was to let him learn his lesson but judge pulfoot fearing hornabys temper ordered kelley to get his man  tom wants that weasel disciplined he said hes a damage to the community  kelley received his orders with calmness well judge he said after a little pause ill get him but id like to do it in my own way to go after him just now gives him the inside position hell hear of me the minute i start and will be backed up into the corner somewhere with his gun all poised  are you afraid  you can call it that the young marshal languidly replied i dont believe in taking fool chances mink is a dead shot and probably wireedged with whisky and expecting me my plan is to wait until hes a little off his guardthen go in quick and pull him down  to this the judge gave reluctant consent but when a few hours later he heard that mink had disappeared he was indignant you get that devil or well let you out he said and showed a telegram from hornaby protesting against this new outbreak of violence the old mans redheaded over it  i know it said kelley i heard from him to that effect if the hostler dies we wont see mink no more if hes in town ill get him good night   iii  a few days later as he was walking up the street half a dozen men successively spoke to him saying minks at home loadedand looking for you and each of them grinned as he said it joyously anticipating trouble  without a word other than a careless that so kelley passed on and a thrill of excitement ran through the hearts of the loafers  it was about sunset of a dusty autumn afternoon and the cowboys and miners gathered in knots along the street having eaten their suppers were ready to be entertained upon seeing kelley approach with easy stride they passed the joyous word along each spectator was afraid he might miss some part of the play  kelley was fully aware that his official career and perhaps his life hung in the balance to fail of arresting the desperado was to brand himself a bungler and to expose himself to the contempt of other sureshot ruffians however having faced death many times in the desert and on the range he advanced steadily apparently undisturbed by the warnings he had received  just before reaching minks saloon he stepped into lemonts drugstore a cheap little shop where candy and cigars and other miscellaneous goods were sold the only person in the place was rosa lemont a slim little maid of about fifteen years of age  hello rosie he said quietly i want to slip out your back door he smiled meaningly the street is a trifle crowded just now  with instant comprehension of his meaning she led the way dont let them kill you she whispered with scared lips  ill try not to he answered lightly  once in the alley he swung his revolver to a handy spot on his thigh and entered the saloon abruptly from the rear  the back room a rude dancehall was empty but the door into the barroom was open and he slipped through it like a shadow mink was not in sight but the barkeeper stood rigidly on duty  hello jack called kelley as he casually approached the bar wheres the boss  before he had finished his question he detected his man reflected in the mirror behind the bar the gambler imagined himself to be hidden behind the screen which separated the womens drinkingplace from the main room and did not know that kelley had seen him in the glass his revolver was in his hand and malignant purpose blazed in his eyesand yet he hesitated lawless as he was it appeared that he could not instantly bring himself to the point of shooting an officer in the back  kelley realizing his disadvantage and knowing that any attempt to forestall the action of his enemy would be fatal cheerily called out to an acquaintance who stood in a stupor of fear farther up the bar howdy sam come and have a drink his jovial tone and apparent ignorance of danger prolonged minks moment of indecision the third man thought kelley unaware of his danger but did not have the courage to utter a sound  the marshal perceiving certain death in the assassins eyes was about to whirl in a desperate effort to get at least one shot at him when something happened some one caromed against the screen it toppled and fell upon the gambler disconcerting his aim his bullet went wide and kelley was upon him like a tiger before he could recover control of his weapon and they both went to the sawdust together  now came a singular revelation of the essential cowardice of the desperado deprived of his revolver and helpless in kelleys great hands he broke down white trembling drooling with terror he pleaded for his life dont shootdont kill me he repeated over and over  i ought to kill you argued kelley with a reflective hesitation which wrought his captive to a still greater frenzy of appeal  i begi beg he whined dont shoot  amazed and disgusted with the mans weakness kelley kicked him in the ribs get up he said shortly  mink arose but no sooner was he on his feet than his courage returned ill have your heart for this he said venomously then his mind took a sudden turn who pushed that screen onto me he asked ill kill the man who did that  youll have time to figure out that problem in the quiet of the jug said kelley come along  at the door of the calaboose the gambler braced himself i wont go in there he declared i wont be juggedill die right here  kelleys answer was a jerk a twist and a sudden thrust which landed the redoubtable boaster in the middle of his cell you can die inside if you want to he said and turned the key on him my responsibility ends right here   iv  the street was crowded with excited men and women as kelley came back up the walk one or two congratulated him on his escape from sudden death but the majority resented him as the hired bouncer of the landboomers in the town  who pushed that screen was the question which everybody asked of kelley  i didnt see he responded i was busy just about that time  in truth he had only glimpsed a darting figure but one he knew who else but rosa lemont could have been so opportune and so effective in her action she alone knew of his presence in the alley  she was only a plain little hobbledehoy half mexican and half french and not yet out of short dresses and kelley had never paid her any attention beyond passing the time of day with a kindly smile and yet with the fervid imagination of her race she had already conceived a passionate admiration for kelley knowing that he was entering minks deathtrap she had followed him like a faithful squire eager to defend and understanding his danger to the full had taken the simplest and most effective means of aiding him from the doorway she had witnessed his victory then flying through the rear door had been in position at the store window as he passed with his prisoner on his way to the calaboose  when kelley came back to her door with intent to thank her for what she had done he found the room full of excited men and with instinctive delicacy passed on his way not wishing to involve her in the story of the arrest  it appeared that all the men of the town who thrived by lawlessness and vice now decided to take up minks case and make his discharge an issue a sudden demonstration of their political power brought the judge to terms he weakened the gambler was released with a fine of one hundred dollars and a warning to keep the peace and by noon of the following day was back in his den more truculent than ever  kelley was properly indignant but the man tried to kill me he protested to the court  he swears not replied the justice we have punished him for resisting an officer that is the best we can do  what about jake  oh well that was war jake had a gun and mink is able to prove that he shot in selfdefense furthermore he has settled with jake  kelley argued no more he could have called rosa in as a witness to the attempt upon his life but to do so would expose her to public comment and her big solemn worshipful eyes had already produced in him a vague pity without understanding fully her feeling he knew that she looked up to him and he perceived that she was born to sorrow in larger measure than she deserved sallow thin boyish she gave promise of a kind of beauty which would sometime make her desired of both white men and brown  poor little mongrel he said to himself shes in for misery enough without worrying over me                                       well im up against it now kelley remarked to dad miller hornabys foreman the next time he met him minks friends have thrown a scare into the judge and he has turned that coyote loose against me looks like i had one of two things to dokill the cuss or jump the town  shoot him on sight advised miller  if i do that im in bad with the court kelley argued you see when i took him before i had the law on my side now its just man to manuntil he commits another crime killing me wouldnt be a crime  thats so mused his friend youre cinched any way you look at it  kelley went on moreover some of my greaser friends have started a line of fool talk about making me sheriff and that has just naturally set the whole political ring against me theyd just as soon i got killed as nota little sooner ive a right to resign havent i nobody has a license to call me a coward after what ive done have they  no license but i reckon they will all the same responded his friend  kelleys face hardened well ill disappoint em im going to stay with it however he went to the mayor and voiced his resentment of the courts action  his honor pretended to be greatly concerned now dont quit on us ed hornaby expects you to stay put youre the only man who can clean up the town youve done great work already and we appreciate it in fact were going to raise your pay  pay to a corpse dont count retorted kelley its a question of backing you fellows have got to stand behind me  well do it ed only hornaby thinks youd better put a card in the paper saying that you have no intention of going into politics  oh hell said kelley disgustedly is hornaby suspicious of me too well for that ive a mind to run and he went out in deep disgust  as the days went by and no open movement against him took place his vigilance somewhat relaxed mink kept to his lair like some treacherous bloodthirsty animal which was a bad sign  at heart tall ed was restless and discontented each day he walked the streets of the flybit town dreaming of the glorious desert spaces he had crossed and of the high trails he had explored he became more and more homesick for the hills far away to the north gleamed the snowy crest of the continental divide and the desire to ride on over that majestic barrier into valleys whose purple shadows allured him like banners grew stronger each night he lifted his face to the stars and thought of his glorious moonlit camps on the rio perco sands and the sound of waterfalls was in his dreams  what am i here for he asked himself why should i be watchdogme a wolf a free ranger why should i be upholding the law whats the law to a tramp  had it not been for a curious sense of loyalty to hornaby added to a natural dislike of being called a quitter he would have surrendered his star and resumed his saddle he owned a good horse once more and had earned nearly two hundred dollars with my present outfit i can amble clear across to oregon he assured himself wistfully  as he stood with uplifted face dreaming of the mountains rosa lemont came down the street and as she passed him said in a low voice minks on the plazacrazy drunk watch out  kelley straightened and cast an unhurried glance around him no one was in sight but a group of cowpunchers tying their horses in front of a saloon and a few miners seated on the edge of the walk nevertheless he knew the girl had good reason for her warning and so after walking a block or two in the opposite direction he turned and came slowly back up the main street till he reached lemonts doorway where he paused apparently interested in something across the street  rosa came from within and with equally wellsimulated carelessness leaned against the doorframe minks bughouse she explained and got a winchester hes just around the corner waiting for you he says hes going to shoot you on sight she stammered a little with excitement but her voice was low  much obliged rosie he replied feelingly dont worry i may see him first and listen while i have a chance i want to thank you for pushing that screen onto him it was a good job  thats all right she answered hastily but please be careful  dont worry he gravely replied ive beat him once and i can do it again and after a pause he added i reckon youre the only one that cares what happens to mebut dont mix in this game little one dont do it  a crowd had gathered in the street with attention concentrated as if for a dogfight and kelley pushing his way through the circle suddenly confronted mink who as the object of interest was busied in rolling a cigarette while his winchester leaned against a post to this fact kelley probably owed his life for in the instant between the gamblers recognition and the snatching up of his rifle kelley was able to catch and depress the muzzle of the gun before it was discharged the bullet passed low entering the wooden sidewalk close to his foot ill take that gun he said and would have immediately overpowered his adversary had not several of the bystanders furiously closed in upon him singlehanded he was forced to defend himself against these his fellowcitizens as well as against mink who struggled like a wildcat for the possession of his gun one man seized the marshal from behind pinioning his arms another hung upon his neck a third dogged at his knees a fourth disarmed him  battered bruised covered with blood and dirt the marshal fought like a panther weighed down with hounds twice he went to earth smothered blinded gasping but rose again almost miraculously still unconquered until at last through the sudden weakening of the men on his right arm he gained possession of the rifle and with one furious sweep brought it down on the gamblers head another circling stroke and his assailants fell away with blazing eyes he called out get back there now every man of you  breathing hard he looked them over one by one youre a pretty bunch of citizens he said with cutting contempt you ought to be shotevery man jack of you then glancing down at the wounded gambler at his feet he added some of you better take this whelp to a doctor he needs help  lemont and another of minks friends took up the unconscious man and carried him into the drugstore and kelley followed with a feeling that all the town was against him and that he must rearm himself for a night of warfare his revolver was gone and to replace it and to gain a breathingspace he retreated to his room his endurance all but exhausted  he had no regret for what he had done on the contrary he took a savage satisfaction in having at last ended mink but as he hurriedly buckled on his cartridgebelt he foresaw the danger ahead of him in minks friends who he knew would get him if they could  the patter of feet in the hall and a knock at the door startled him whos there he demanded catching up his rifle  its rosa called a girlish voice let me in  are you alone  yes open quick  he opened the door gun in hand what is it rosie he gently asked  theyre coming she answered breathlessly  whore coming  that saloon crowd theyre almost here  other footsteps sounded on the stairs run away girl said kelley softly theres going to be trouble  rosie pushed him back into the room no no let me stay let me help you fight she pleaded  while still he hesitated mrs mink a short squat woman with eyes aflame with hate rushed through the doorway and thrust a rifle against kelleys breast quick as a boxer rosa pushed the weapon from the womans hands and with desperate energy shoved her backward through the door and closed it  runrun she called to the marshal  but kelley did not move and something in his face turned the girls face white he was standing like a man hypnotized every muscle rigid with fallen jaw and staring eyes he looked at the weapon in his hand at last he spoke huskily  girl youve saved my soul from hell you surely have he shivered as if with cold rubbing his hands stiffly yes he muttered a second more and id a killed herkilled a woman  the sound of a fierce altercation came up the hall cautious footsteps were heard approaching and at last a voice called out hello kelley you there  i am whats wanted of me  its the mayor let me speak with you a minute  kelley considered for a breath or two his brain was sluggish open the door rosie he finally said and backed against the wall  the girl obeyed and the mayor entered but his hands were open and raised dont shoot ed were friends he was followed by the judge and a couple of aldermen  its all right ed said the judge minks coming to life put up your gun we dont blame you he had no call to attack an officer like that  at the word officer kelley let his rifle slip with a slam to the floor and began to fumble at the badge on his coat that reminds me your honor he said at last heres a little piece of tin that belongs to youor the city  he tossed the loosened badge to the mayor who caught it deftly protesting oh dont quit ed youve just about won the fight stay with it  a wry smile wrinkled one side of the trailers set face im no fool your honor i know when ive got enough i dont mind being shot in the back and mobbed and wallered in the dirtthats all in the days work but when it comes to having women pop in on me with winchesters i must be excused im leaving for the range ill enjoy being neighbor to the conies for a while this civilized life is a little too busy for me  rosa who had been listening understood his mood much better than the men and with her small hands upon his arm she pleaded take me with you i hate these peoplei want to go with you  he turned a tender pitying almost paternal glance upon her no girl no i cant do that youre too young it wouldnt be right to snarl a grown womans life up with minemuch less a child like you then as if to soften the effect of his irrevocable decision he added perhaps some time well meet again but its goodby now he put his arm about her and drew her to his side and patted her shoulder as if she were a lad then he turned lend me a dollar judge im anxious to ride  the judge looked troubled were sorry edbut if you feel that way why  thats the way i feel answered the trailer and his tone was conclusive                                       dusk was falling when mounted on his horse with his stake in his pocket kelley rode out of the stable into the street swarming with excited men the opposition had regained its courage yells of vengeance rose lynch him lynch the dog was the cry  reining his bronco into the middle of the road with rifle across the pommel of his saddle kelley advanced upon the crowd in the shadowy fringes of which he could see ropes swinging in the hands of minks drunken partisans  come on you devils he called throw a rope if you dare  awed by the sheer bravery of the challenge the crowd slowly gave way before him  the block seemed a mile long to kelley but he rode it at a walk his horse finding his own way until at last he reached the bridge which led to the highline red mountain road here he paused faced about and sheathed his winchester then with a wave of his hand toward rosa lemont who had followed him thus far he called out  goodby girl youre the only thing worth saving in the whole dern town adios  and defeated for the first time in his life tall ed turned his cayuses head to the san mcgill range with only the memory of a worshipful childwomans face to soften the effect of his hard experience as the marshal of brimstone basin   partners for a day  i  cinnebar was filled with those who took chances the tenderfoot staked his claim on the chance of selling it again the prospector toiled in his overland tunnel on the chance of cracking the apex of a vein the small companies sank shafts on the chance of touching pay ore the big companies tunneled deep and drifted wide in the hope of cutting several veins the merchants built in the belief that the camp was a permanent town and the gamblers took chances of losing money if their game was honest and put their lives at hazard if they cheated  only the saloonkeepers took no chances whatever they played the safe game they rejoiced in a certainty for if the miners had good luck they drank to celebrate it and if they had bad luck they drank to forget itand so the liquordealers prospered  tall ed kelley on his long trip across the big flat as he called the valley between the continental divide and the cascade range stopped at cinnebar to see what was going on in less than three days he sold his horse and saddle and took a chance on a leased mine at the end of a year he was half owner in a tunnel that was yielding a fair grade of ore and promised to pay but he was not content a year in one place was a long time for him and he was already meditating a sale of his interest in order that he might take up the line of his march toward the northwest when a curious experience came to him  one night as he drifted into the palace saloon he felt impelled to take a chance with the white marble that is to say he sat in at the roulettetable and began to play small stakes  the man who rolled the marble was young and goodlooking kelley had seen him before and liked him perhaps this was the reason he played roulette instead of faro at any rate he played losing steadily at firstthen suddenly the ball began to fall his way and before the clock pointed to ten he had several hundred dollars in winnings  this is my night he said on meeting the eyes of the young dealer  dont crowd a winning horse retorted the man at the wheel and kelley caught something in his look which checked his play and led him to quit the game in that glance the gambler had conveyed a friendly warning although he said as kelley was going away be a sport give the wheel another show see me tomorrow  kelley went away with a distinct feeling of friendliness toward the youngster whose appearance was quite unlike the ordinary gambler he seemed not merely bored but disgusted with his trade and kelley said to himself that lad has a story to tell hes no ordinary robber  the next afternoon he met the youth on the street much obliged for your tip last night the game looked all right to me  it was all right replied the gambler i didnt mean that it was crooked but i hate to see a good man lose his money as you were sure to do  i thought you meant the wheel was fixed  oh no its straight i call a fair game but i knew your run of luck couldnt last andhe hesitated a littleid kinda taken a fancy to you  well thats funny too replied kelley i went over to play your machine because i kind of cottoned to you i reckon were due to be friends my names kelleytall ed the boys call me  mine is morsefred morse i came out here with a grubstake lost it and being out of a job fell into rolling the marble for a living what are youa miner  i make a bluff at mining a leased claim up here but ill admit im nothing but a wandering cowpunchera kind of mounted hobo i have an itch to keep moving ive been here a year and im crazy to straddle a horse and ride off into the west i know the south and east pretty wellso the open country for me is off there where the sun goes down his voice had a touch of poetry in it and the other man though he felt the bigness of the view said  i never was on a horse in my life and i dont like roughing it but i like you and i wish youd let me see something of you where are you living  mostly up at my minebut i have a room down here at the boston house i pick up my meals anywhere  the young mans voice grew hesitant would you consider taking me in as a side partner im lonesome where i am  kelley was touched by the gamblers tone no harm trying he said with a smile we couldnt do more than kill each other but i warn you im likely any day to buy an old cayuse and pull out im subject to fits like that  all rightill take the chance im used to taking chances  kelley laughed so am i  in this informal way they formed a social partnership and the liking they mutually acknowledged deepened soon into a friendship that was close akin to fraternal love  within a week each knew pretty accurately the origin and history of the other and although they had but an hour or two of an afternoon for talk they grew to depend upon each other strangely and when one day morse came into the room in unwonted excitement and said ed i want you to do something for me kelley instantly replied all right boy spit it out whats wanted  im in a devil of a hole my mother and my little sister are coming through here on their way to the coast theyre going to stop off to see me i want you to let me in on a partnership in your mine just for a day theyll only stay a few hours but i want to have them

you in on my share and hell carry out his part of it hes a good deal of a bonehead but no talker but youll have to put on some miners duds and spend today riding around the hills to get a little sunburn you dont look like a miner  i know it that worries me too  having given his promise kelley seemed eager to carry the plan through successfully he was sorry for the youth but he was sorrier for the mother who was coming with such fond pride in the success of her sonfor morse confessed that he had been writing of his mine for a year  he outfitted his new partner with a pair of wellworn miners boots and some trousers that were stained with clay and laughed when fred found them several inches too long  youve got to wear em no new ones wont work how would it do for you to be so durn busy at the mine that i had to come down and bring your people up  good idea then his face became blank what would i be busy about  thats so grinned kelley well lets call it your day off and ill be busy  no i want you to come with me to the train i need you you must do most of the talkingabout the mine i mean ill say youre the practical miner and ill refer all questions about the business to you and we must keep out of the main street i dont want mother to even pass the place ive been operating in  what if they decide to stay all night  they wont theyre going right on they wont be here more than five or six hours  all right well find em dinner up at mrs finnegans if theyre like most tourists theyll think the roughscuff ways of the boston house great fun by the way how old is this little sister  oh she must be about twentytwo  good lord kelley was dashed he thought a minute well you attend to her and ill keep the old lady interested  no youve got to keep close to flo im more afraid of her than i am of mother shes sharp as tacks and the least little break on my part will let her in on my stall no youve got to be on guard all the time  well ill do my best but im no billie dear with girls ive grew up on the trail and my talk is mostly redneck but i mean well as the fellow says even if i dont always do well  oh youre all right kelley you look the real thing youll be part of the scenery for them  spin the marble its only for half a day anyway they can call me a hole in the ground if they want to but you must get some tan i tell you what you do you go up on the hill and lay down in the sun and burn that saloon bleach off your face and neck and hands thats got to be done youve got the complexion of a barber  morse looked at his white supple hands and felt of his smooth chin youre right its a dead giveaway ill look like a jailbird to them if i dont color up if id only known it a few days sooner id have started a beard  youll be surprised at what the sun will do in two hours kelley said encouragingly youll peel afterward but youll get rid of the bleach   ii  in truth morse looked very well the next morning as he stood beside kelley and watched the high line train come in over the shoulder of mogallon and loop its cautious way down the minepitted slopes his main uneasiness was caused by the thought that his mother might ask some man on the train if he knew her son and he was disturbed also by a number of citizens lounging on the platform some of them were curious about the change in him hello fred going fishing or been  the boy was trembling as he laid his hand on kelleys arm ed i feel like a coyote its a dang shame to fool your old mother like this  better to fool her than to disappoint her answered tall ed stiffen up boy carry it through  the little train drew up to the station and disgorged a crowd of italian workmen from the smoker and a throng of tourists from the observationcar and among these gay trippers kelley saw a small plain little woman in black and a keeneyed laughing girl who waved her hand to fred why shes a queen thought kelley  mrs morse embraced her son with a few murmured words of endearment but the girl held her brother off and looked at him well you do look the part she said what a glorious sunburnand the bootsand the hat and all why fred you resemble a man  i may resemble one he said but heres the real thing heres my partner tall ed kelley he pulled kelley by the arm ed this is my mother  howdy maam said kelley extending a timid hand  and this is my sister florence  howdy miss repeated kelley  florence laughed as she shook hands he says howdy just like the books  kelley stiffened a bit what should a feller say howdys the word  i told you shed consider you part of the scenery put in fred well now mother were going to take you right up to our mine its away on top of that hill  oh glorious exclaimed florence and is it a real mine  it is but kelley is boss so im going to let him tell you all about it hes the man that found it  mrs morse looked up at the towering hill how do we get there  a trolleycar runs part way and thenwell take a cab come on he added anxiously for he could see some of his saloon friends edging near  the trolley came down almost to the station and in a few moments they were aboard with kelley seated beside florence and mrs morse fondly clinging to her son who seemed more boyish than ever to kelley the old trailer was mightily embarrassed by his close contact with a sprightly girl he had never known any one like her she looked like the pictures in the magazinessame kind of hat same kind of jacket and skirtand she talked like a magazine story too her face was small her lips sweet and her eyes big and bright  she was chatty as a camp bird and saw everything and wanted to know about it why were there so many empty cabins what was the meaning of all those rusty ruined mills werent there any gardens or grass  why you see miss the camp is an old busted camp im working a leasei mean we are  what do you mean by a lease  well you see a lot of men have got discouraged and quit and went back east and offered their claims for lease on royalty and i and another fellerand fredwe took one of these and it happened to have ore in it  how long has fred been with youhe never mentioned you in his letters  why its about a year since we took the lease kelley began to grow hot under her keen eyes  strange he never wrote of you he seems very proud of you too  kelley looked out of the window we get along first rate  the girl studied his fine profile attentively im glad he fell in with a strong man like youan experienced miner he might have made a mistake and lost all his small fortune my but its fine up here whats that wonderful snowy range off there  thats the sangre de cristo range  sangre de cristoblood of christ those old spaniards had a lot of poetry in them didnt they  i reckon soand a whole lot of stiffening too you go through the southwest and see the country they trailed overthe hot dry places and the quicksands and cañons and all that they sure made them injuns remember when they passed by  you know that country  i may say i do it was my paradeground for about fifteen years i roamed over most of it its a fine country  why did you leave it do you like this better  i like any new country i like to explore  but youre settled for a while  well i dont knowif my partner will take my interest i think ill shift along i want to get into alaska finally id like to climb one of them high peaks  fred who was seated in front turned mother wants to know what the mine paid last yearyou tell her  it didnt pay much replied kelley cautiously you see we had some new machinery to put in and some roads to grade and one thing or anotheri reckon it paid abouthe hesitatedabout three hundred a month but its going to do better this year  florence who was studying the men sharply then said you wrote you were getting about five dollars a day  freds face showed distress i meant net he said i didnt want to worry you about details of machinery and all that  kelley began to feel that the girls ears and eyes were alert to all discrepancies and he became cautiousso cautious that his pauses revealed more than his words but the mother saw nothing heard nothing but the face and voice of her son who pointed out the big mines that were still running and the famous ones that were dead and so kept her from looking too closely at the steep grades up which the car climbed  at length on the very crest of the high smooth hill they alighted and fred led the way toward a rusty old hack that looked as much out of place on that windswept point as a chinese pagoda  florence spoke of it looks like huckleberry springs whom does its owner find to carry up here  mostly it carries the minister and undertaker at funerals replied kelley  cheerful lot exclaimed the girl it smells morbific  you cant be particular up here responded fred youll find our boardingplace somewhat crude  oh i dont mind crudenessbut i hate decayed pretensions if this were only a mountain cart now  it was the only kerridge with springs explained kelley  the little mother now began to take notice of her sons partner my son tells me you have been very good to hima kind of big brother i am very grateful  oh ive done no more for him than he has for me we both felt kind of lonesome and so rode alongside  its wonderful to me how you could keep mr kelley out of your letters said florence he looks exactly like a remington character only his eyes are honester and his profile handsomer  kelley flushed and fred laughed i never did understand why remington made all his men crosseyed  mrs morse put her small cold hand on kelleys wrist dont mind my daughter shes got this new fad of speaking her mind shes a good daughtereven if she does say rude things  oh i dont mind being called a goodlooker said kelley only i want to be sure im not being made game of  you neednt worry retorted fred a man of your inches is safe from ridicule  ridicule exclaimed florence with a glance of admiration you cant ridicule a tall pine  i told you shed have you a part of the landscape exulted fred shell have you a mountain peak next  kelley who felt himself at a disadvantage remained silent but not in a sulky mood the girl was too entertaining for that it amused him to get the point of view of a citybred woman to whom everything was either strange or related to some play or story she had known the cabins the mills the occasional miners they met all absorbed her attention and when they reached the little shafthouse and were met by old hank stoddard kelleys partner her satisfaction was complete for hank had all the earmarks of the old prospectortangled beard jackboots pipe flannel shirt and all he was from the south also and spoke with a drawl  oh but he is a joy florence said privately to kelley i didnt know such bret harte types existed any more how did you find him  i used to know him down on the perco he had a mine down there that came just within a hairline of paying and when i ran across him up here he had a notion the mine would do to lease i hadnt much only a horse and saddle and a couple of hundred dollars but we formed a partnership  that was before my brother came into the firm  kelley recovered himself yes you see he came in a little laterwhen we needed a little ready cash  she seemed satisfied but as they went into the mine she listened closely to all that kelley and stoddard said stoddards remarks were safe for he never so much as mentioned kelleys name it was all i with old hanki did this and i did thattill florence said to kelley  you junior partners in this mine dont seem to be anything but company for mr stoddard  hank always was a bit conceited admitted kelley but then he is a real sureenough miner we are only capitalists  where did fred get all the signs of toil on his trousers and boots she asked with dancing eyes  oh he workspart of the time  she peered into his face with roguish glance does it all with his legs i guess i notice his hands are soft as mine  kelley nearly collapsed good lord he thought you ought to be a female detective he came to the line gamely well theres a good deal of running to be done and we let him do the outside messenger work  his sunburn seems quite recent and his trousers dont fit as his trousers usually do he used to be finicky about such things  a feller does get kind of careless up here in the hills kelley argued  they did not stay long in the mine for there wasnt much to see it was a very small mineand walking made the mother short of breath and so they came back to the office and hank arranged seats on some dynamiteboxes and a keg of spikes and then left them to talk things over  im so glad youre up herewhere its so clean and quiet said the mother im told these mining towns are dreadful almost barbaric even yet of course theyre not as they were in bret hartes time but they are said to be rough and dangerous i hope you dont have to go down there often  of course i have to go mother we get all our supplies and our mail down there  i suppose thats true but mr kelley seems such a strong capable personhere she whisperedbut i dont think much of your other partner mr stoddard  who old hank why hes steady as a clock he looks rough but hes the kindest old chap on the hill why hes scared to death of you and flo  he has the appearance of a neglected old bachelor  well he isnt he has a wife and seven children back in tennesseeso he says  fred said florence sharply i hope you arent playing off on these partners of yours  what do you mean  i meanletting them do all the hard and disagreeable work  kelley interposed dont you worry about us miss we arent complaining we cant do the part he does he does all the buying and sellingandcorrespondenceand the like of that but come its pretty near noon i reckon wed better drift along to mrs finnegans the first table is bad enough in our boardingplace  again fred took his mother and left kelley to lead the way with florence  now mr kelley began the girl i must tell you that i dont believe my brother has a thing to do with this mine except to divide the profits furthermore you are trying to cover something up from me youre doing it very well but youve made one or two little catches which have disturbed me my brother has never mentioned you or hank in his letters and thats unnatural he told us he was interested in a mine which was paying one hundred and fifty dollars a month now why did he say that ill tell you why its because you pay him a salary and hes not really a partner she paused to watch his face then went on now what does he dowhat can he do to earn five dollars per day his palms are as soft as silkthe only callous is on his right forefinger  kelleys face schooled to impassivity remained unchanged but his eyes shifted his astonishment was too great to be entirely concealed theres a whole lot of runningand figuringand so on  not with that little mine why you cant employ more than five men  six corrected kelley proudly  well six you cant afford to pay my brother five dollars a day just to run errands and keep accounts for these six men youre fooling him youre paying him a salary out of sheer good nature because you like him deny it if you can  kelley looked back to see that fred was well out of earshot he is mighty good company he admitted  there she exclaimed triumphantly you cant fool me i knew there was something queer about this whole arrangement then her voice changed its very very kind of you mr kelley and i deeply appreciate it and if you dont want me to do iti will not let mother into our secret  whats the use hes happier being called a partner  very wellwell let it go that way  thereafter her manner changed she was more thoughtful she looked at him with softer eyes it seemed to her very wonderful this friendship between a rough big man and her brother who had always been something of a scapegrace at home her own regard for kelley deepened men arent such brutes after all  her smile was less mocking her jests less pointed as she sat at mrs finnegans long table and ate boiled beef and cabbage and drank the simmered hay which they called tea she was opposite kelley this time and could study him to better advantage  kelley on his part was still very uneasy the girls uncanny penetration had pressed so clearly to the heart of his secret that he feared the hours which remained im at the end of my rope he inwardly admitted shell catch me sure unless i can get away from her  nevertheless he wondered a little and was a trifle chagrined when the girl suddenly turned from him to her brother he was a little uneasy thereat for he was certain she would draw from the youngster some admissions that would lead to a full confession  as a matter of fact she sought her brothers knowledge of kelley tell me about him fred where did you meet him first he interests me  well morse answered cautiously i dont know exactly i used to see him come down the hill of an evening after his mail and i kind of took a shine to him and he did to me at least thats what he said afterward he has had a wonderful career hes been all over arizona and new mexico alone hes been arrested for a bandit and almost killed as city marshal and he has been associated with a band of cattlerustlers oh you should get him talking he nearly died of thirst in the desert once and a snake bit him in the navajo country and he lay sick for weeks in a hopi town  what a singular life is he satisfied with it  he says he is he declares he is never so happy as when he is leading a packhorse across the range  i dont wonder you like him she said thoughtfully but you should do your part dont let him be always the giver and you the taker im afraid you shirk on him a little fred  why what makes you think that  well your hands are pretty soft for a working miner  he met her attack bravely you dont suppose we do all the pick work in the mine do you  no i dont see how you could possibly do any of it come now freddy fess up youve been playing the gentleman in this enterprise and all this makeup is for our benefit isnt it  young morse saw that the safest plan was to admit the truth of her surmise oh well i never did have any hand in the actual mining but then there is plenty of other work to be done  her answer was sharp and clear well then do it dont be a drone  something very plain and simple and boyish came out in the young gambler as he walked and talked with his mother and sister and kelley regarded him with some amazement and much humor it only proved that every man no matter how warlike he pretends to be in public is in private a weak sorry soul dependent on some one and this youth so far from being a desperado was by nature an affectionate son and a loyal brother  furthermore kelley himself felt very much less the tramp and much more like folks than at any time since leaving home ten or fifteen years before he was careful to minimize all his hobo traits and to correspondingly exalt his legitimate mining and cattle experiences although he could see that morse had made florence curious about the other and more adventurous side of his career  florence was now determined to make a study of the town i like it up here she said as she looked down over the tops of the houses it interests me fred i propose that you keep us all night  oh we cant do that exclaimed her brother hastily we havent room  well theres a hotel i should hope  a hotelyes but it is a pretty bad hotel you see its sort of run downlike the town  this did not seem to disturb her rather it added to her interest no matter we can stand it one night i want to see the place i would like to see a little of its street life tonight its all so new and strange to me  kelley perceiving that she was determined upon this stopover and fearing that the attempt to railroad her out of town on the afternoon train might add to her suspicions then said  i think we can find a place for you if you feel like staying  morse was extremely uneasy and florence remarked upon it you dont seem overflowing with hospitality fred you dont seem anxious to have us stay on for another day  he shifted his weight from one foot to the other well its a pretty rough old village floa pretty rough place for you and mother  we are not alarmed so long as we have you and mr kelley as our protectors she replied smiling sweetly upon tall ed  they had reached the carline by this time and were standing looking down the valley and fred pulling out his watch remarked you just have time to make that threeoclock train that will connect you with the night express for los angeles  fred whats the matter with you queried his sister sharply you seem absolutely determined to get rid of us at once then seeing that she had perhaps gone a little too far she said with a smile mother isnt he the loving son  the youth surrendered to her will and dropped all opposition he appeared to welcome their decision to wait over another day but kelley busied himself with thinking how he could ward off any undesired information which might approach the two womenthe mother especially it would be quite wonderful if with another twentyfour hours to spend florence did not get freds secret from him  he decided to put the matter squarely before her and when they took the car arranged to have her sit beside him in a seat across the aisle from the mother and son and almost immediately began his explanation by saying very significantly  i reckon the boy is right miss morse you had better take that threeoclock train  she faced him with instant appreciation of the change in his tone why so she asked fixing a clear and steady glance upon his face  it will be easier for him and better forfor all of us if you go he wants to spare your mother from  she was quick to perceive his hesitation from what she asked and as he did not at once reply she went on firmly you might just as well tell me mr kelley freds been up to some mischief hes afraid and youre afraid well find out something to his disadvantage now tell me is itis ita woman  no said kelley as decisively as he could so far as i know freds not tangled up that way  quick as a flash she took him up on his emphasized word in what way is he tangled up  kelley more and more amazed at her shrewdness and directness decided to meet it with blunt candor well you see its like this when he first came out here he struck a streak of hard luck and lost all he had he was forced to go to work at anything he could get to earn money andyou see when a feller is down and out hes got to grab anything that offersand so when dutch pete took a liking to him and offered him a job he just naturally had to take it  you mean he has been working at something we wouldnt like to know about  thats the size of it  what is this job it isnt working for you you wouldnt ask him to do anything that would be disgraceful  kelley did not take time to appreciate this compliment he made his plunge no he has been working fora saloon  she showed the force of the blow by asking in a horrified tone you dont mean tending bar  oh no not so bad as that replied kelley leastways it dont seem so bad to me hes been rolling the marble in a roulette wheel  she stared at him in perplexity i dont believeii dont believe i understand what that is just tell me exactly  well hes been taking care of a roulette layout  you mean he has been gambling  well no he hasnt been gambling at least not lately but he represents the house you see he is something like a dealer at faro and is on a salary  she comprehended fully nowat least she comprehended enough to settle back into her seat with a very severe and somber expression on her face thats where his five per day comes from she mused for a little while on this and then suddenly another thought came to her what about his being your partner  kelley saw that it was necessary to go the whole way and he said quietly that was all fixed up yesterday you see he wanted to save your mother and you and he came to meand wanted me to take him in as a partner andi did it  you mean a partner for a day  yes he was mighty nervous about your coming and i told him i would help him out of course it didnt worry me none and so i concluded i would do it  her face softened as she pondered upon this that was very good of you mr kelley  oh no you see i kinda like the boy and then weve been partnersside partners we room together  she looked out of the window but she saw nothing of the landscape now i understand it all you want me to take mother away before she finds out  pears like that is the best thing for you to do it would hit her a good deal harder than it does you  it hits me hard enough she replied to think of my brother running a gamblingmachine in a saloon is not especially reassuring you say he went into it to carry him over a hard place im afraid you were saving my feelings in saying that mr kelley how long has he been in this business  a little less than a year  and you want me to go away without trying to get him out of this awful trade  i dont see how you could safely try it i think he is going to quit it himself your coming has been a terrible jolt to him now ill tell you what you do you take the old lady and pull out over the hill and ill undertake to get the boy out of this gambling myself  she was deeply affected by his quiet and earnest manner and studied him with reflective glance before she said youre right mother must never know of this she was brought up to believe that saloons and gambling were the devils strongest lure for souls and it would break her heart to know that fred has become a gambler i will do as you say mr kelley i will take this train but you must write me and tell me what you do you will write wont you  yes replied kelley hesitatingly ill writebut i aint much of a fist at it of course i may not make a go of my plan but i think it will work out all right  she reached her hand to him as if to seal a compact and he took it she said i dont know who you are or what you are mr kelley but youve been a loyal friend to my brother and very considerate of my mother and me and i appreciate it deeply  kelley flushed under the pressure of her small fingers and replied as indifferently as he could thats all right miss ive got a mother and a sister myself  well theyd be proud of you if they could know what you have done today she said  his face took on a look of sadness they might but im glad they dont know all ive been through in the last ten years   iii  morse was surprised almost delighted when his sister announced her decision to take the afternoon train thats right he said you can stop on your way back in the spring perhaps kelley and i will have our own house by that time  the train was on the siding nearly ready to start and there was not much chance for further private conference but florence succeeded in getting a few final words with kelley  i wish you would tell me what your plan is she said you neednt if you dont want to  kelley seemed embarrassed but concluded to reply it is very simple said he im going to make him an actual partner in the mine im going to deed him an interest so that when you come back in the spring he wont have to lie about it  her glance increased his uneasiness i dont understand you mr kelley you must love my brother  he could not quite meet her glance as he answered well i wouldnt use exactly that word he said slowly but ive taken a great notion to himand then as i say i have an old mother myself  the bell on the engine began to ring and she caught his hand in both of hers and pressed it hard i leave him in your hands she said and looked up at him with eyes that were wet with tears and then in a low voice she added if i dared to id give you a good hugbut i darent goodbyand be sure and write  as they stood to watch the train climb the hill morse drew a deep sigh and said gee but flo is keen i thought one while she was going to get my goat i wonder what made her change her mind all of a sudden  kelley looked down at him somberly i did  you did how  i told her what you had really been working at  the boy staggered under the force of this holy smoke did you do that  sure i did it was the only way to save that dear old mother of yours i told your sister also that i was going to stop your whitemarble exercise and im going to do it if i have to break your back  there was no mistaking the sincerity and determination of kelleys tone and the young man so far from resenting these qualities replied meekly i want to get out of it ed ive been saying all day that i must quit it but what can i do  ill tell you my plan said kelley with decision youve got to buy my interest in the mine  morse laughed but i havent any money i havent three hundred dollars in the world  ill take your note provided your sister will indorse it and she will  the young fellow looked up at his tall friend in amazement which turned at last into amusement he began to chuckle good lord i knew youd made a mash on flo but i didnt know it was mutual i heard her say be sure and write he slapped kelley on the back therell be something doing when she comes back in the spring eh  kelley remained unmoved there will be if she finds you rolling that white marble  she wont ill take your offer but what will you be doing  climbing some alaska trail replied kelley with a remote glance     the prospector         still pushes his small packmule through the snow of       glacial passes seeking the unexplored and therefore more       alluring mountain range     vi  the prospector   old pogosa was seated in the shade of a farmwagon not far from the traders store at washakie eating a cracker and mumbling to herself when a white man in miners dress spoke to her in a kindly voice and offered her an orange she studied him with a dim shining suspicious gaze but took the orange eugene the grandson of her niece stood beside the stranger and he too had an orange  tell her said the white man that i want to talk with her about old days that i am a friend of her people and that i knew sitting bull and bear robe they were great chiefs  as these words were interpreted to the old witch her mouth softened a little and raising her eyes she studied her visitor intently at last she said ay he was a great chief sitting bull my cousin i came to visit shoshoni many moons ago never returned to my own people  to this the miner replied they say your husband iapi was one of the sheepeaters exiled to the mountains  her eyes widened her gaze deepened she clipped her forefinger in sign of agreement it was very cold up there in winter we were often hungry for the game had all been driven to the plain and we could not follow many of our children died all died but one  the stranger whose name was wetherell responded with a sigh my heart is heavy when i hear of it because you are old and have not much food i give you this money and he handed her a silver dollar and walked away  the next day led by eugene wetherell and kelley his partner again approached the old sioux this time with a generous gift of beef  my brother here is paperchief he explained as a friend of the red people he wants to put in a book all the wrongs that the sheepeaters suffered  in this way the goldseekers proceeded to work upon pogosas withered heart her mind was clouded with age but a spark of her oldtime cunning still dwelt there and as she came to understand that the white men were eager to hear the story of the lost mine she grew forgetful her tongue halted on details of the trail why should not her tale produce other sides of bacon more oranges and many yards of cloth her memory wabbled like her fingernow pointing west now north at one time the exiles found the gold in the cabin in a baglike shining sand at another it lay in the sand like shining soldiers buttons but always it was very beautiful to look upon and always she repeated the white men fled no one slew them they went hurriedly leaving all their tools  she knows exulted wetherell she knows and shes the one living indian who can direct us to eugene he exclaimed say to her pretty soon shes going to be richmebbe go home to cheyenne river if she shows us the trail we will take her to her own people  like a decrepit eagle the crone pondered suddenly she spoke and her speech was a hoarse chant you are good to me the bones of my children lie up there i will go once more before i die  kelley was quick to take advantage of sunset emotion tell her we will be here before sunrise warn her not to talk to any one and to all this eugene gave ready assent  wetherell slept very little that night although their tent stood close beside the singing water of the little wind they were several miles from the fort and in a lonely spot with only one or two indian huts near and yet he had the conviction that their plans and the very hour of their starting were known to other of the red people at one moment he was sure they were all chuckling at the foolish white men at another he shivered to think how easy it would be to ambush this crazy expedition in some of the deep solitary defiles in those upper forests a regiment could be murdered and hidden in some of those savage glooms said he to himself  kelley slept like a top but woke at the first faint dawn with the precision of an alarmclock in ten minutes he had the horses in and was throwing the saddles on roll out andy he shouted here comes eugene  wetherell lent himself to the work with suddenly developed enthusiasm and in half an hour the little train of laden animals was in motion toward the hills pogosa was waiting squatted on the ground at some distance from her tepee slipping from his horse he helped her mount she groaned a little as she did so but gathered up the reins like one resuming a longforgotten habit for years she had not ventured to mount a horse and her withered knees were of small service in maintaining her seat but she made no complaint  slowly the little train crawled up the trail which ran for the most part along the open side of the slope in plain view from below at sunrise they were so well up the slope that an observer from below would have had some trouble in making out the character of the cavalcade at seven oclock they entered the first patch of timber and were hidden from the plain  on the steep places where the old squaw was forced to cling to her saddle groaning with pain the kindly wetherell walked beside her easing her down the banks in crossing the streams he helped her find the shallowest fording and in other ways was singularly considerate kelley couldnt have done this but he saw the value of it  its a hard trip and weve got to make it as easy for the old bird as we can  shes human retorted wetherell and this ride is probably painful for her mentally as well as physically  i spose it does stir her up some responded kelley she may balk any minute and refuse to go wed better camp early  a little later eugene called out she says set tepee here and kelley consented  again it was wetherell who helped her from her saddle and spread his pack for her to rest upon he also brought a blanket and covered her as tenderly as if she were his own grandmother shes pretty near all in he said in palliation of this action he took a pleasure in seeing her revive under the influence of hot food  when she began to talk eugene laughingly explained she stuck on you she say you good man your heart big for old injun woman  kelley chuckled keep it up andy he called through the tent i leave all that business to you  pogosas face darkened she understood the laugh send him away she commanded eugene all of which made kelley grin with pleasure  the whole enterprise now began to take on poetry to wetherell the wilderness so big so desolate so empty to him was full of memories to this brown old witch to her the rushing stream sang longforgotten songs of war and the chase she could hear in its clamor the voices of friends and lovers this pathway so dim and fluctuating so indefinite to the white man led straight into the heroic past for her perhaps she was treading it now not for the meat and flannel which kelley had promised her but for the pleasure of reliving the past she was young when her husband was banished in these splendid solitudes her brave young hunter adventured day by day here beside one of these glorious streams her children were born in exile here they suffered the snows of winter the pests of summer and here they had died one by one till only she remained then old and feeble she had crawled back into the reservation defiant of washakie seeking comfort as a blind dog returns to the fireside from which he has been cruelly spurned  as she slept the men spread a map on the ground and for the hundredth time wetherell measured the blank space lying between bonneville basin and frémonts peak marked unexplored and exclaimed  its wonderful how a mountain country expands as you get into it dont look much on the map but gee a fellow could spend ten years looking for this mine and then be no better off than when he started  yes responded kelley its certainly up to you to cherish the old lady  in the morning wetherell dressed hastily and crept into the little tent where pogosa lay how are you granny he asked she only shook her head and groaned  she say her back broke eugene interpreted  a brisk rubbing with a liniment which he had brought from his kit limbered the poor abused loins and at last pogosa sat up she suddenly caught wetherells hand and drew it to her withered breast  good white man she cried out  tell her ill make her eyes well too he commanded eugene the medicine will hurt a little but it will make her eyes stronger to see the trail  kelley could not suppress his amusement as he watched wetherells operations youll spoil granma he remarked shell be discontented with the agency doctor im not discouragin your massage operations mind you but i cant help thinking that shell want clean towels and an osteopath to stroke her back every morning when she goes back to her tepee  if she only holds out long enough to help us to find the mine she can have a trained nurse and waitingmaid to friz her hairif she wants it frizzed  you dont mean to let her in as a partner  i certainly do isnt she enduring the agonies for us im going to see that she is properly paid for it  a hunk of beef and plenty of blankets and flannel is all she can use but first lets find the mine we can quarrel over its division afterward  i doubt if we get her ahorse today shes pretty thoroughly battered up  we must move andy somebody may trail us up i want to climb into the next basin before night let me talk to her  she flatly refused to move for kelley and eugene said she too sick legs sick back sick eyes sick go no further  kelley turned to wetherell its your edge andy shes balked on me  wetherell took another tack he told her to rest by and by ill come and rub your back again and fix your eyes tomorrow you will feel strong and well to this she made no reply  all the day kelley kept his eyes on the back trail expecting each moment to see some dusky trailer break from the cover as night began to fall it was wetherell who brought a brand and built a little fire near the door to pogosas tent so that the flame might cheer her and she uttered a sigh of comfort as its yellow glare lighted her dark tepee walls he brought her bacon also and hot bread and steaming coffee not merely because she was useful as a guide but also because she was old and helpless and had been lured out of her own home into this gray and icy world of cloud  eddie he said as he returned to his partner were on a wildgoose chase the thing is preposterous there isnt any minethere cant be such a mine  why not whats struck you now  this country has been traversed for a century it is sheeped and cattlegrazed and hunted and forestranged  kelley waved his hand out toward the bleak crags which loomed dimly from amid the slashing shrouds of rain traversed man nobody ever does anything more than ride from one park to another the mine is not in a park its on some of these rockytimbered ridges a thousand sheepherders might ride these trails for a hundred years and never see a piece of pay quartz its a big country look at it now what chance have we without pogosa now here we are on our way with a sour old wench who thinks more of a piece of bread than she does of a hunk of ore its up to you andyyou and your mash  well ive caught the mindreading delusion i begin to believe that i understand pogosas reasoning she is now beginning to be eaten by remorse she came into this expedition for the food and drink she now repents and is about to confess that she knows nothing about the mine she and eugene have conspired against us and are doing usgood  nitsky youre away off your base the fact is pogosa is a sioux she cares nothing for the shoshoni and she wants to realize on this mine she wants to go back to her people before she dies she means businessdont you think she dont and if her runninggear dont unmesh tonight or tomorrow shes going to make goodthats my hunch  i hope youre right but i cant believe it  you dont need to you keep her thinking youre the sungodthats your job  it rained all that day and when night settled down it grew unreasonably warm for that altitude and down on the marshes the horses stood patiently enduring the gnats and mosquitoes they plagued pogosa so cruelly that wetherell took his own web of bobinet and made a protecting cage for her head and hands never before had she been shielded from the pests of outdoor life she laughed as she heard the baffled buzzing outside her net and pointing her finger addressed them mockingly wetherell took the same joy in this that a child takes in the action of a kitten dressed as a doll to eugene he said  you tell her injun plenty fool he dont know enough to get gold and buy mosquito netting if she is wise and shows me the mine she will never be bitten again no flies no mosquitoes plenty beef plenty butter and hot biscuits plenty sugar and coffee white mans own horse carry her back to her people  it took some time to make the old woman understand this and then she replied briefly but with vigor and eugene translated it thus white man all same big chief go find mine sure for you no want other white man to have gold all yours  the morning broke tardily the rain had ceased but the gray mist still hid the peaks and now and then the pines shook down a shower of drops upon the tent cloth as if impatient of the persistent gathering of moisture otherwise the forest was as still as if it were cut from bronze  kelley arose and going outside began kicking the embers together wake up andy its a gray outlook we have he announced after a careful survey the worst sign is this warmth and stillness were in the heart of the storm and the mosquitoes are hellish  as wetherell was creeping from the tent door one of the pines quivered and sent down a handful of drops squarely soaking the back of his neck and a huge mosquito stuck savagely to the end of his nose he was not in the best of humor as he straightened up  i can stand cold and snow or wet and cold but this hot sticky dark weather irritates me lets climb high and see if we cant reach the frostline  well be frosty enough when this storm passes kelley said comfortingly then in a note of astonishment and surprise well look at that  wetherell looked where he pointed and beheld pogosa squatting before a meager fire at her tent door her head carefully draped in her bobinet he forgot his own lumps and bumps and laughed so doth the white mans civilization creep upon and subdue the amerind destroying his robust contempt for the elements and making of him a sybarite  eugene appeared grinning ruefully heap dam moskeets drink my blood all night  i reckon you got granmas share said kelley  pogosa met wetherells glance with an exultant smile and pointed at the net as if to say see i am safe the angry brutes cannot touch me  the old girl is on her taps this morning she deserves a reward wait a jiffy thereand kelley uncorked a flask and poured a wee drop of an ambercolored liquid into the cup of coffee which wetherell was about to take to hersay nothing and see what happens  she ate a rousing breakfast and was especially pleased with the coffee kelley repeated the dose and she much invigorated ordered eugene to bring her pony to her this tickled kelley mightily  you see how it is shes already the millionairess who ever heard of an injun getting up a horse for an old squaw look at eugene  eugene was indeed in open rebellion and wetherell not caring to have trouble with him went down and brought up the pony himself he also gave the old woman his slicker and insisted on her wearing it whereat eugene wondered again  the rain was beginning as they took their way over the meadow and wetherell was near to being bogged the first crack out of the box do we go up that cliff he asked  pogosa waved her forefinger back and forth as though tracing the doublings of the trail  kelley scanned the wall narrowly i dont quite see it he remarked openly but i reckon i can find it and he spurred his horse to the front  no no screamed pogosa in a sudden fury her voice shrill and nasal kelley stopped and she motioned wetherell to his place in the lead  with a comical look in his eyes the trailer fell back pears like i aint good enough to precede her majesty go ahead andy  wetherell in much doubt of his ability to scale that cliff started forth the old trail could be seen dimly and also the recent tracks of three horses they were not precisely fresh but they gave some uneasiness  who made em eugene and when he asked  one man ridingwhite man announced eugene two packhorsevery light packmademebbe sothree days ago  the forestranger from the other side possibly  wetherell by watching the hoofmarks by studying the conformation of the cliff before him and by glancing back now and again at pogosa contrived to find the way slowly and for several hours they climbed this vast dike it was nearly eleven thousand feet above the sea here and kelley himself breathed with effort as he climbed  i begin to see why people dont use this trail much he said as they stopped to rest on one of the broad shelves im beginning to wonder how were going to pack our ore to market over this road  it will take mighty rich ore to pay its own freight responded wetherell  pogosa seemed strangely excited her eyes were gleaming her face working with emotion  see the old girl said kelley we must be hot on the trail of the mine it dont look like mineral formation but gold is where you find it  go on signed pogosa  the way seemed interminable and at times wetherell despaired of getting his withered commander into the park which he was sure lay above this dike at noon they halted long enough to make coffee kelley flavored it as before and pogosa was ready to go on an hour later  as they rose above the dike and bonnevilles peak came into view a low humming sound startled the hunters it came from pogosa with eyes lit by the reviving fires of memory she was chanting a hoarse song she seemed to have thrown off half the burden of her years her voice gradually rose till her weird improvisation put a shiver into wetherells heart she had forgotten the present and with hands resting on the pommel of her saddle with dim eyes fixed upon the valley was reliving the past  she singing old hunting song eugene explained many years ago she sing it this heap fine huntingground then elk bighorn bear all fine things in summer winter nothing but bighorn sheepeaters live here many summers pogos young and happy then now she is old and lonesome people all gone purty soon she die so she say  even the unimaginative mind of tall ed kelley thrilled to the tragic significance of this survivor of a dying race chanting her solitary song her memory was quickening under the touch of these cliffs and the sound of these streams she was retracing the steps of her youth  kelley interpreted it differently shes close to it he called its here in this valley in some of these ridges  resolutely unhesitatingly pogosa rode down the first stream which ran to the north making directly for a low hill on which could be discerned a low comb of deflected rocks of a dark color at last riding up the ledge she slipped from her horse and tottering forward fell face downward on the grass beside an upturned giant slab of gray stone  the men stared in wonder searching the ground for evidence of mineral none could be seen suddenly lifting her head the crone began to sing again uttering a heartshaking wail which poured from her quivering lips like the cry of the forsaken the sight of her withered hands strained together and the tears in her sunken cheeks went to the soul the desolate rocks the falling rain the wild and monstrous cliffs the encircling mountains all lent irresistible power to her grief she seemed the minstrel of her race mourning for a vanished world  come away eugene urged with a delicacy which sprang from awe her husband buried there  deeply touched to know that her grief was personal and filled too with a kind of helpless amazement at this emotional outbreak the goldseekers withdrew down the slope followed by the riderless pony leaving the old woman crouched close against the sepulcher of her dead pouring forth the sobbing wail of her song  this looks like the end of our mine said kelley gloomily i begin to think that the old witch led us up here just for the sake of visiting that grave  it looks that way responded wetherell but what can we do you cant beat her and weve done all we could to bribe her  eugene advised you wait bimeby she got done cryin tomorrow she got coldwant meat coffeeplenty bad then we go get her  they went into camp not far away in the edge of a thicket of scraggly winddwarfed pines and put up their tents for the night  wouldnt it put a cramp into you began kelley as they stood beside their fire to think that this old relict has actually led us all the way up here in order to water the grave of a sweetheart who died forty years ago  it shows how human she is  human shes superhuman shes crazy thats what she is  it is all very wonderful to me but im worried about her she mustnt stay out there in this rain its going to turn cold see that streak in the west  as wetherell left the campfire and began to climb back toward the comb of rocks he felt not merely the sheer immensity of this granite basin but the loneliness its almost insupportable silence and emptiness with the feeling of one who intrudes he called to the old woman he stooped and put his arm about her come he said you will die here come to the fire  she suffered him to lead her away but her head hung on her breast her arms were limp  back at the campfire after seeing that pogosa had been properly taken care of the men faced each other in gloomy silence  right here we take our medicine partner remarked kelley here we put a dot and double the line id like to break over that divide and see how it looks in there but our lady friend seems indisposed and i guess well just toast our knees and think where we missed it  after all said wetherell soothingly this morning may be merely incidental let us be patient she may recover and at dark he carried some hot drink over to her tepee but found her sleeping and decided not to awaken her  back at their fire as the night deepened the men lighted their pipes and with blankets at their backs huddled close about it an imperious voice broke from pogosas tent wetherell looked around at eugene  did you speak he asked  eugene protested no pogosa talk  it sounded like a chiefs voice kelley began a vigorous voice  eugene trembling like a scared puppy crept close to wetherell his voice was a mere whisper that no pogosthat injun spirit talking  kelley was amused a spirit eh what does this spirit injun say  say white man with red beard listencome closer and listen  thats you andy draw close your side partner has something to say  wetherell alarmed by this delirium of his patient rose to his feet and as he did so her harsh voice uttered a short phrase which stiffened eugene with fright he left his place and sidled after wetherell  she say me eugene come talk for you  very true youll need him this may be a dying confession argued kelley  you go ahead in tepee eugene urged me sit outside pogos medicine now see um vision spirits talk to her  as he peered in at the tepee door wetherell perceived pogosa dimly she was sitting erect in her bed her eyes were wide the pose of her head erect and vigorous she appeared a span taller and when she spoke her voice seemed to issue from a deep and powerful chest  with eugene as a scared interpreter pogosa said here now where we are encamped a battle took place many winters ago and some of the exiles were slain one of these was iapi the husband of pogosa he it was who could not speak shoshoni  impatiently kelley asked will she be able to show us the mine  she will try but she is old and her mind is misty she say she is grateful to you red beard and will give the gold to you she asks that you take her back to her own people after you find the mine  is the mine far from here asked wetherell gently  no but it is very hard to find  cant you trace the trail on a piece of paper for me he inquired  no pogosa cannot make the road she can only tell you send the other white man away  vamoose wetherell called with a note of triumph in his voice and tall ed faded away  with faltering voice pogosa began the allimportant part of her tale the mine is on the head of the wind river not far but the way is very hard pogosa will not be able to lead you from where we are you cross the valley to the mountain you turn to your right and descend to a small lake lying under a bank of snow this bank is held up by a row of black rocks below this lake is a stream and a long hill of round stones all mixed together on the west side of this ridge just above another small lake you will find the mine  can it be approached from below  no a great cañon and many cliffs are there her voice ceased abruptly as suddenly as if life had been instantly withdrawn she fell back upon her bed and eugene released from the grasp of her hand fled to kelley leaving wetherell alone with the mystery  she seems to have dropped into a sort of trance he said to kelley as he came back to the campfire  have you faith enough to follow those directions asked his partner  i certainly have  kelley laughed she may have a different set of directions tomorrow night what do you say eugene pogos all same fraud  eugene cowering close to the fire needed not speech to make evident his awe of the battlefield injun spirits all round he whispered hear em they cry to pogos he lifted a hand in warning  its only the wind in the dead pines said kelley  plenty injun spirits they cry persisted eugene  there speaks the primitive man remarked wetherell our ancestors in ireland or wales or scotland all had the same awe and wonder of the darkjust as the negroes in the south believe that on certain nights the dead soldiers of lee and grant rise and march again  kelley yawned lets turn in and give the witches full swing its certainly their kind of a night  eugene spoke up me sleep in your tepee pogos scare me plenty hard  ridicule could not affect him and out of pity for his suffering wetherell invited him to make down his bed in the doorway of his own little tent  i hope granma wont have another fit in the middle of the night said kelley sleepily if she does you can interview her alone im dead to the world till dawn  nothing happened after this save that an occasional nervous chill overcame eugene and caused him to call out whats that in a suppressed tone you hear em voice he asked several times to all of which wetherell replied it is the wind lie down it is only the wind  musing upon the singular business in the deep of the night wetherell concluded that pogosa in a moment of emotional exaltation and foreseeing her inability to guide him in person had taken this method of telling him truly where the mine lay  a mutter of voices in pogosas tepee interrupted his thought she is delirious again he thought but the cold nipped and he dreaded rising and dressing as he hesitated he thought he could distinguish two voices shaking eugene he whispered listen eugene tell me what is going on in pogosas tent  the halfbreed needed no awakening she speak sioux i no speak sioux some sioux mans talk with her mebbe so her husband  wetherell smiled and snuggled down in his bed all right eugene if iapi is there he will take care of her good night                                       morning broke gloriously clear crisp and frosty the insects were inert the air had lost its heat and murk the sun struck upon the sides of the tepees with cheerful glow and all was buoyant normal and bracing as the partners arose  hurrying to pogosas tepee wetherell peeped in i wonder if she remembers her performance he asked himself but could not determine since she refused to answer eugene when he questioned her she took the food which wetherell gave her but did not eat or drink slowly she rose and hobbled away over the frosty grass toward the grave of iapi  thats a bad sign observed kelley whats she going to do now eugene  shes goin put meat by stone mebbe so injun spirits come eat  well shed better absorb some of the grub herself  i think its a beautiful act professed wetherell lifting his fieldglass to study her motions shes happy now she and her dead sweetheart are together again  i know iapi once eugene volunteered he big man very strong good rider one spring all people hungry no game ponies weak iapi say go kill sheep washakie hear of killing sheep send warriors iapi here make battle kill mebbe so four six injun kill iapi washakie sorry now his spirit cry in trees last night  better let pogosa alone for the day the sun is warming the rocks she is no longer cold we can leave our camp here and scout around on our own account returning this afternoon  they rode across the valley in the direction indicated by the voice it was a bewildering maze into which the prospector must descend in search of the gold which is marked in yellow letters on some maps of the state several times did wetherell drop into the basins searching in vain for the small lake and the blackwalled bank of snow but at last eugenes eye detected faint indications of a trail  weve struck the right road this time exulted wetherell here is the wall of black rocks there was no snow but he argued that the season having been extraordinarily warm and wet this landmark had temporarily disappeared  i am sure this is the lake and stream declared wetherell see where the snow has lain  how far down do you figure the mine was  some miles below near a second lake im afraid we cant make it this trip it will be dark by the time we reach camp well just mark the spot and come back tomorrow  kelley was for pushing on what matter if we dont get back  im thinking of pogosa  he shrugged his shoulders theres grub and shelter handy she can come down any time and feed  yes but i hate to think of her all alone she may be worse  send eugene back we dont need him now  wetherell was almost as eager to go on as kelley but could not banish the pathetic figure of pogosa so easily now that all signs pointed to the actual mine his blood was fired with passion for the gold  eugene go back and wait for us see that pogosa is comfortable well return by dark  the word dark sent a shiver through eugene he shook his head no im afraid spirits come again  come on said kelley you cant make him do that if we hurry we can get down to the other lake and back by sunset the squaw will take care of herself shes used to being alonebesides the spirits are with her  with the hope that it was not far wetherell yielded and set off down the slope following the bank of the stream soon the other lake could be seen not far below them and slipping sliding amid a cascade of pebbles the goldseekers now glowing with certainty of success plunged straight toward the pool two or three times this precipitous method of descent led them into blind alleys from which they were obliged to climb but at last just as the sun went behind the imperial peak they came out upon the shore of the little tarn which lay shallowly over a perfectly flat floor of creamcolored sand  here we are called kelley now if your ghost proves a liar pogosa must answer for it here is the rocky ridge on the east  and here is trail called eugene pointing to a faint line leading straight into the pines  wetherell spurred his horse into this trail and in less than five minutes came upon the mine it was not a shining thing to look at so he did not shout it was merely a cavernous opening in a high ledge of dark rock on one side stood the sunken and decaying walls of a small log hut the roof had fallen in and vines filled the interior in front of the door and all about lumps of reddish rustylooking rock were scattered a big stone hollowed in the middle showed that it had been used as a mortar for crushing the ore the tunnel itself was irregular in shape and almost high enough to admit a horse it dipped slightly from the threshold  tall ed spoke first in a tone of suppressed excitement well lets see what shes like  i trust pogosa up goes our poster replied wetherell  all right you put up the sign while i examine this ore  with his hatchet wetherell set to work hewing a square face on a tree he was putting the first tack in his placard when kelley walked over toward him and with exaggeratedly quiet voice said  just look at that will you  wetherell took the lump of ore and thrilled to the sight it needed no expert to discern the free gold which lay in thin scales and sparkling lumps all through the rock  i want to yell said kelley and his voice trembled  dont do it said wetherell lets hurry back to camp and move down here i wont feel safe till we do  i dont leave this place tonight andy you and eugene go back to camp ill stay here and hold down the find  wetherell tremulous with excitement and weak in the knees remounted his horse and set off for camp it was a long climb and the latter part of it tedious by reason of the growing darkness and the weariness of the horses wetherells pony would not lead and was fairly at the end of his powers but at last they reached their campingplace wetherells first thought was of pogosa she was nowhere in sight and her tepee was empty  she on hill declared eugene lying down on stone injun cry there three days  the poor old thing shell be famished and chilled to the bone its a shame our leaving her alone this way but thats the way of the man in love with gold greed destroys all that is tender and loyal in a man i am going right up and bring her down eugene you start a fire and put some coffee on to boil  with a heart full of pity the repentant goldseeker hurried toward the cairn the crumpled little figure so tragic in its loneliness and helpless grief was lying where he had left it she did not stir at the sound of his footsteps nor when he laid his hand softly on her shoulder  come pogosa he said with gentle authority come coffee fire waiting we found the mine youre rich you shall go back to your people come  something in the feel of her shoulder in the unyielding rigidity of her pose startled and stilled him he shook her questioningly she was stark as stone her body had been cold for many hours her spirit was with iapi     the outlaw        still seeks sanctuary in the green timber finding the       storms of the granite peaks less to be feared than the fury       of his neighbors     vii  the outlaw   i  freeman ward geologist for the government was not altogether easy in his mind as he led his little packtrain out of pinedale a frontier settlement on the western slope of the rocky mountain divide for he had permitted the girl of his deepest interest to accompany him on his expedition  alice mansfield accustomed to having her way and in this case presuming upon wards weakness insisted on going outwardly he had argued against it making much of the possible storms of the rough trails of the cold and dampness but she argued that she was quite as able to go as mrs adams the wife of the botanist of the expedition so ward had yielded and here these women were forming part of a cavalcade which was headed for frémont peak concerning whose height and formation the leader wished to inform himself alice was however a bit dashed by wards change of manner as he laid upon his train his final instructions  there is to be no skylarking he said and no backtracking each one is to exercise great care we cannot afford to lose a horse nor waste our provisions this is not a picnic excursion but a serious government enterprise i cannot turn back because of any discomfort you may encounter in camp  i am ready for what comes alice answered smilingly  but she rode for the rest of the day remarkably silent there had been times when she was certain that ward cared a great deal for hernot in the impersonal way indicated by his reprimandbut in the way of a lover and she was very fond of him had indeed looked forward to this trip in his company as one sure to yield hours of delightful intimacy on the train he had been very devoted almost loverlike peggy adams insisted but now she was dismayed by his tone of military command  their first days march brought them to a beautiful water called heart lake which shone dark and deep amid its martial firs at the head of one of the streams which descended into the east fork and there the guides advised a camp they were now above the hunters almost above the game in a region delightfully primeval as the women put it and very beautiful and peaceful  after the tents were in order and the supper eaten alice having tuned up her little metal banjo began to twitter tender melodies to the moon of course and the long face of the man of science broadened and he seemed less concerned about rocks and fauna and flora  the camp was maintained at heart lake for a day while ward and his men explored the various gorges in order to discover a way into blizzard basin which was their goal they returned to camp each time more and more troubled about the question of taking the women over the divide into the rough country which lay to the north  it is a totally different world adams explained to his wife it is colder and stormier over there the forest on the north slopes is full of downtimber and the cliffs are stupendous i wish you girls were back in the settlement and in this wish ward heartily joined  however the more they talked the more determined the women were to go  it was like a may day the following noon as they left timberline and following the row of tiny monuments set up by the foresters entered upon the wide and undulating stretch of low edges which led to the summit the air was clear and the verdureless shapes of the monstrous peaks stood sharp as steel against the sky the tender grass was filled with minute glistening flowers the wind was gentle sweet moist and cool  pooh said alice this is absurdly easy freeman has been telling us dreadful tales all along just to be rid of us  but she began to admit that her escort of four strong men was a comfort as the guide explained that this rough country had long been known as the retreat of cattlethieves and outlaws  do you think there are any such men in here now asked mrs adams  undoubtedly ward said but i dont think from the condition of this trail that they come in on this side of the range i suspect its too lonely even for a cattlethief  they unsaddled that night on the bank of a stream near a small meadow and around the campfire discussed the trail which they were to take next day the guides agreed that it was a holy terror which made alice the more eager to traverse it  i like trails that make men quake i welcome adventurethats what i came for she said  early the next forenoon as they were descending the steep northslope trail alice gave out a cry of pain and adams called to ward  hold on allies horse is down  ward was not surprised he rode in continual expectation of trouble she was forever trying short cuts and getting snared in the fallen logs once she had been scraped from her saddle by an overhanging bough and now in attempting to find an easier path down a slippery ridge her horse had fallen with her ward was ungracious enough to say  precisely what ive warned her against but he hurried to her relief nevertheless  are you badly hurt he asked as she stood before him striving to keep back her tears of pain  oh no not at all badly my foot was jammed a little please help me on to my horse ill be all right in a minute  she put so good a face on her accident that he helped her into her saddle and ordered the train to move on but peggy perceived that the girl was suffering keenly  shant we stop allie she called a few minutes later  no ill be all right in a few minutes  she rode on for nearly half an hour bravely enduring her pain but at last she turned to mrs adams and cried out i cant stand it peggy my foot pains me frightfully  adams again called to ward and the procession halted while ward came back all his anger gone  well go into camp he said as he examined her bruised foot youre badly hurt  its a poor place to camp professor protested gage if she can go on for about fifteen minutes  ill try she said but i cant bear the stirrup and my shoe is full of blood  ward who was now keenly sympathetic put her on his own horse and walked beside her while they slowly crawled down into the small valley which held a deep and grassy tarn here they went into camp and the day was lost  alice was profoundly mortified to find herself the cause of the untimely halt and as she watched the men making camp with anxious irritated faces she wept with shame of her folly she had seized the worst possible moment in the most inaccessible spot of their journey to commit her crowning indiscretion  she was ill in every nerve shivering and weak and remained for that day the center of all the activities of the camp ward very tender even in his chagrin was constantly at her side his brow knotted with care he knew what it meant to be disabled two hundred miles from a hospital with fifty miles of mountain trail between ones need and a roof but alice buoyed herself up with the belief that no bones were broken and that in the clear air of the germless world her wound would quickly heal  she lay awake a good part of that night hearing above the roar of the water the faroff noises of the wildanimal world a wolf howled a cat screamed and their voices were fearinspiring  she began also to worry about the effect of her mishap on the expedition for she heard ward say to adams this delay is very unfortunate our stay is so limited i fear we will not be able to proceed for some days and snow is likely to fall at any time  what they said after that alice could not hear but she was in full possession of their trouble it was not a question of the loss of a few days it meant the possible failure of the entire attempt to reach the summit  peggy she declared next morning the men must push on and leave you with me here in the camp i will not permit the expedition to fail on my account  this seemed a heroic resolution at the moment with the menacing sounds of the night still fresh in her ears but it was the most natural and reasonable thing in the world at the moment for the sun was rising warm and clear and the valley was as peaceful and as beautiful as a park  mrs adams readily agreed to stay for she was wholly free from the ordinary timidities of women but ward though sorely tempted replied  no well wait a day or two longer and see how you come on  at this point one of the guides spoke up saying if the women would be more comfortable in a cabin theres one down here in the brush by the lake i found it this morning when i was wranglin the horses  a cabin in this wild place said alice  yes maammust be a rangers cabin  ward mused if its habitable it would be warmer and safer than a tent lets go see about it  he came back jubilant it doesnt seem to have been occupied very recently but is in fair shape well move you right down there  the wounded girl welcomed the shelter of a roof and it was good to feel solid logs about her helpless self the interior of the hut was untidy and very rude but it stood in a delightful nook on the bank of a pond just where a small stream fell into the valley and it required but a few minutes of mrs adamss efforts to clear the place out and make it cozy and soon alice groaning faintly was deposited in the rough pole bunk at the dark end of the room what an inglorious end to her exalted ride  ward seemed to understand her tears as he stood looking down upon her but he only said i dislike leaving you even for the day i shall give up my trip  no no you must go on she cried out i shall hate myself if you dont go on  he reluctantly yielded to her demand but said if i find that we cant get back tomorrow i will send gage back hes a trusty fellow i cant spare adams and smith and toddas you knoware paying for their trip  mrs adams spoke up firmly you need not worry about us we can get along very well without anybody if you climb the peak youll need gage im not afraid were the only people in this valley and with this staunch little cabin i feel perfectly at home  thats quite true replied ward in a relieved tone we are above the huntersno one ever crosses here now but it will be lonely  not at all alice assured him we shall enjoy being alone in the forest  with slow and hesitating feet ward left the two women and swung into his saddle i guess ill send gage back anyhow he said  dont think of it called peggy  as a matter of fact alice was glad to have the men pull out their pity their reproach irritated her it was as if they repeated aloud a scornful phraseyoure a lovely and tempting creature but youre a foolhen just the same  the two women spent the day peacefully save now and then when alices wounded foot ached and needed care but as night began to rise in the cañon like the smoke of some hidden silent subterranean fire and the high crags glowed in the last rays of the sun each of them acknowledged a touch of that immemorial awe of the darkness with which the race began  peggy seating herself in the doorway described the scene to her patient who could see but little of it oh but its gloriously uncanny to be here only think we are now alone with god and his animals and the night  i hope none of gods bears is roaming about replied alice flippantly  there arent any bears above the berries were perfectly safe my soul but its a mighty country i wish you could see the glow on the peaks  im taking my punishment replied alice freeman was very angry wasnt he  if it breaks off the match i wont be surprised replied peggy with resigned intonation  there wasnt any match to break off  well replied the other and as she slowly rose she added i wont say that he is perfectly distracted about you but i do know that he thinks more of you than of any other woman in the world and ive no doubt he is worrying about you this minute   ii  it was deep moonless night when alice woke with a start for a few moments she lay wondering what had roused herthen a bright light flashed and her companion screamed  whos there demanded the girl  in that instant flare she saw a mans face young smooth with dark eyes gleaming beneath a broad hat he stood like a figure of bronze while his match was burning then exclaimed in breathless wonder  great peters ghost a woman finally he stepped forward and looked down upon the white scared faces as if uncertain of his senses two of them he whispered as he struck his second match he gently asked would you mind saying how you got here  alice spoke first we came up with a geological survey i got hurt and they had to leave us behind  wheres your party gone  up to the glaciers  when did they leave  yesterday morning  when do you expect them back  not for two or three days  he seemed to ponder a moment you say youre hurt where  my horse slipped and fell on my foot  wait a minute he commanded ill rustle a candle i left one here  when his form came out of the dark blur behind his candle alice perceived that he was no ordinary hunter he was young alert and very goodlooking although his face was stern and his mouth bitter he laid aside his hat as he approached the bunk in which the two women were cowering as mice tremble before a cat for a full minute he looked down at them but at last he smiled and said in a jocular tone  youre sureenough women i can see that youll excuse mebut when a man comes back to a shack in the middle of the night in a place like this and finds a couple of women in a bunk hes likely to think hes seeing pictures in his sleep  i can understand that alice returned recovering her selfcommand youre the ranger i suppose i told my friend here that you might return  im mighty glad i did he said heartily  thank you youre very kind  he bent a keen glare upon her whats your name  alice mansfield  whats your friends name  mrs adams  are you a missis too  she hesitated this was impertinent but then she herself was an intrusive guest no she answered i am not married  where are you from  new york city  youre a long way from home  yes im feeling that this minute she drew the coverlet a little closer to her chin  he quickly read this sign you neednt be afraid of me  im not  yes you are youre both all of a tremble and white as two sheep  it isnt that wailed the girl but ive twisted my foot again her moan of pain broke the spell that bound peggy  would you leave please for a moment she called to the owner of the cabin ive got to get up and doctor my patient  sure he exclaimed moving toward the door if i can do anything let me know  as soon as her patients aching foot was eased peggy opened the door and peeped out a faint flare of yellow had come into the east and beside the fire rolled in his blanket the ranger was sleeping frost covered everything and the air was keen  hes out there on the cold groundwith only one blanket  what a shame tell him to come insideim not afraid of him  neither am ibut i dont believe hell come its most morning anywayperhaps id better not disturb him  take one of these quilts to himthat will help some  mrs adams lifted one of the coverlets and stealing softly up was spreading it over the sleeper when he woke with a start a wild glare of alarm in his eyes  oh its you he said in relief then he added as he felt the extra cover thats mighty white of you sure you dont need it  we can spare it but wont you come inside im sorry we drove you out of your cabin  thats all right im used to this good night im just about dead for sleep  thus dismissed peggy went back and lay down beside alice he says hes quite comfortable she remarked and i hope he is but he doesnt look it  when she woke again it was broad daylight and alice was turning restlessly on her hard bed in the blaze of the sun all the mystery of the night vanished the incident of the return of the ranger to his cabin was as natural as the coming of dawn  he probably makes regular trips through here said mrs adams  but the wounded girl silently differed for she had read in the mans eyes and voice a great deal more than belonged to the commonplace character of a forestranger that first vision of his face burned deep  she had seen on the wall of the station at the road the description of a trainrobber which tallied closely with this mans general appearance and the conviction that she was living in the hidden hut of an outlaw grew into a certainty i must not let him suspect my discovery she thought  mrs adams who had not read the placard treated the young fellow as if he were one of the forest wardens manifesting complete confidence in him  he deftly helped her about breakfast and when she invited him into the cabin he came readily almost eagerly but he approached alices bed with a touch of hesitation and his glance was softer and his voice gentler as he said  well how do you stack up this morning  much better thank you  must have been a joltmy coming in last night the way i did  i guess the jolt was mutual you looked surprised  he smiled again a faint swift halfsmile surprised thats no name for it for a minute i thought id fallen clear through i hope you didnt get a backset on account of it  oh no thank you  how many men are in your party  six counting the guides  who are the men  she named them and he mused darkly his eyes on her face i reckon i cant wait to make their acquaintance im going on down the green river today im sorry to miss em they must be a nice bunchto leave two women alone this way  he ate heartily but with a nicety which betrayed better training than is usual to men in his position he remained silent and in deep thought though his eyes were often on alices face  as he rose to go he said to peggy would you mind doing up a little grub for me i dont know just when ill strike another camp  why of course ill be glad to do you have to go  yes i must pull out he replied and while she was preparing his lunch he rolled a blanket and tied it behind his saddle at last he reentered the cabin and again advancing to alices bedside musingly remarked i hate to leave you women here alone it doesnt seem right are you sure your party will return tonight  either tonight or tomorrow professor ward intends to climb frémont peak  then you wont see him for three days his tone was that of one who communes with himself i reckon id better stay till tomorrow i dont like the feeling of the air  she explained that gage one of the guides would return in case the professor wished to remain in the heights  well ill hang around till toward night anyhow  he went away for half an hour and upon his return presented a cleanly shaven face and a much less savage look and bearing he hovered about the door apparently listening to peggys chatter but having eyes only for the wounded girl he seized every slightest excuse to come in and his voice softened and his manner changed quite as markedly and at last while mrs adams was momentarily absent he abruptly said  you are afraid of me i can see it in your eyes i know why you think you know who i am  yes im sure of it  what makes you think so  i saw your picture in the railway station  he regarded her darkly well i trust you you wont give me away im not so sure of her he nodded his head toward the open door  what would be the good of my betraying you  two thousand dollars reward is a big temptation  nonsense if i toldit would be for other reasons if i were to betray your hidingplace it would be because society demands the punishment of criminals  im not a criminal i never lifted a cent from any man i didnt get a dollar from the express companybut i triedi want you to know anyway he continued that i wouldnt rob an individualand i wouldnt have tried this only i was blind drunk and desperate i needed cash and needed it bad  what did you need it for asked alice with a steady look  he hesitated and a flush crept across his brown face his eyes wavered well you see the old home was mortgagedand mother was sick  oh bosh tell me the truth she demanded the papers said you did it for a girl why not be honest with me  i will he responded impulsively yes thats right i did it for a girland afterward when i was on the run what did she do threw me down told everything she knewthe little coyoteand here i am hunted like a wolf on account of it his face settled into savage lines for a moment but even as he sat thus another light came into his eyes his gaze took account of alices lips and the delicate rounded whiteness of her neck and chin her like he had never met before the girls he had known giggled this one smiled his sweetheart used slang and talked of cattle like a herder but this womans voice so sweet and flexible made delightfully strange music to his ears  peggys return cut short his confidence and while she was in the cabin he sat in silence his eyes always on the girl he seized every opportunity to speak to her and each time his voice betrayed increasing longing for her favor  mrs adams who had conceived a liking for him ordered him about as freely as though he were a hired guide and he made himself useful on the slightest hint  alice on her part was profoundly interested in him and whenever her foot would permit her to think of anything else she pitied him in the madness of his need his love he had committed an act which made all the world his enemy and yet as she studied his form and expression her heart filled with regret he was very attractive in the western way with nothing furtive or evasive about him  with a directness quite equal to his own she questioned him about his reckless deed  why did you do it she exclaimed in despair of his problem  i dont know hanged if i do especially now since seeing you i think i was crazycrazy as a loon if id done it for you now it wouldnt have been so wild youre worth a mans life id die for you  this outburst of passion so fierce and wild thrilled the girl she grew pale with comprehension of his mood it meant that the sight of her lying there had replaced the old madness with a new one she was unprepared for this furious outflaming of primitive admiration  you mustnt talk like that to me she protested as firmly as she could  he sensed her alarm dont you be scared he said gently i didnt mean to jar you i only meant that i didnt know such women as you were in the world id trust you youve got steady eyes youd stick by the man that played his whole soul for you i can see that i come of pretty good stock i reckon thats why you mean so much to me you get hold of me in a way i cant explain  why dont you fly she asked him every minute you spend here increases your danger the men may return at any moment  thats funny too he answered and a look of singular musing tenderness fell over his face id rather sit here with you and take my chances  but you must not you are imperiling your life for nothing  youre mistaken there im getting something every minutesomething that will stay with me all my life after i leave you it doesnt matter i came into the hills just naturally the way the elk does after that girl reported me life didnt count seeing you has changed me it matters a whole lot to me this minute and when i leave you its stormy sunset for me sure thing  alice gazed upon him with steady eyes but her bosom rose and fell with the emotion which filled her heart she debated calling for mrs adams but there was something in the droop of the outlaws head in the tone of his voice which arrested her however sudden and frenzied his admiration might seem to others it was sincere and manly of that she was persuaded nevertheless she was deeply perturbed  i wish you would go she entreated at last huskily i dont want to see you taken you have made yourself a criminal and i ought not to find excuses for you but i do youre so young it doesnt seem as if you knew what you were doing why dont you ride away into the wild north country and begin a new life somewhere cant you escape to canada  he seized eagerly upon her suggestion will you write to me if i do  no i cannot promise that  why cant i play the ranger here and wait upon you till the men return  because professor ward read that placard with me he will know you instantly i wish youd go gage may come at any moment now  peggy came in with disturbed look it looks like rain she announced the clouds are settling down all over the peaks  the outlaw sprang up and went to the door it looked bad when i got up he said as he studied the sky i guess were in for trouble it may be snow  his fears were soon realized rain began to fall in a thin drizzle and at four oclock the first faint flakes of snow began to flash amid the gray veils of the waterdrops the women looked at each other in alarm as the cabins interior darkened with the ominous shadow of the storm  i dont like this a bit said peggy after a while this is no mountain squall i wish the men were here  it cant be anything that will last replied alice it isnt time for the winter snows  i know replied peggy but its snowing perfect feather beds now and no wind lucky this forestranger is here the men may get lost in this storm  mercy dont speak of such a thing exclaimed alice but she knew just the same that ward and his party were high in the peaks far far above the cabin and that the storm there would be proportionately fiercer she listened with growing thankfulness to the outlaws blows upon the dry limbs of wood that he was chopping for the fire he was very capable and would not desert themof that she felt assured  as the man worked on the women both came to keen realization of the serious view he took of the storm he mounted his horse and with his rope dragged great bundles of fagots from the thickets as he came up laden with one of his bundles of hardwon fuel mrs adams asked  you dont think it will keep this up do you  you never can tell what will happen in these mountains it doesnt generally snow much till later but you cant bank on anything in this range  alice called to him and he stepped inside what do you think wed better do she asked  there isnt a thing you can do miss its just a case of stick it out it may let up by sundown but as it is your party cant get back tonight and if you dont mind ill camp down just outside the door and keep the fire going  you will be a comfort to us she replied but i feel thatthat you ought to be going isnt it dangerous for you i mean you will be shut in here  if im shut in others are shut out he answered with a grim smile my job is to keep fire with these words he returned to his work of breaking limbs from the dead firs  alice said if it does turn out as thisthis ranger saysif the storm keeps up you mustnt let him sleep out in the snow  of course not said peggy he can sleep inside i trust him perfectlyand besides you have your revolver  alice smiled a little wondering how peggys trust would stand the strain of a fuller knowledge concerning their guardians stirring career   iii  in spite of her knowledge of the mountains and her natural intrepidity of character the wounded girls heart sank as the snow and the night closed down over the tiny cabin in its covert of firs to be on foot in such gloom in the heart of such a wilderness was sufficiently aweinspiring but to be helpless on a hard bed was to feel the utter inconsequence of humankind suppose the storm blocks the trails so that the men cannot return for a week what will we do for food  each time she heard the outlaw deliver his burden of wood her heart warmed to him he was now her comfort and very present stay if it should happen that the trails become impassable he alone will stand between us and death she thought  the outlaw came in to say abruptly if you werent hurt and if i werent in such a hurry id rather enjoy this  he slashed his sombrero against his thigh as he spoke and mrs adams answered his remark without knowledge of its inner meaning  you mustnt think of sleeping outdoors tonightmr  smith i belong to the big family the smiths he promptly replied  why dont you take away that improvised table by the wall and make your bed there  well need the table he responded in a matteroffact tone ill just crawl under it whats giving me most trouble is the question of grub they didnt leave you any too much did they  but you can kill game cant you asked peggy  were pretty high up for elk and the blue grouse are scarce this year but i reckon i can jump a deer or a groundhog we wont starve anyway  alice perceived in his voice a note of exultation he was glad of his reprieve and the thought of being her protector at least for the night filled him with joy she read his mind easily and the romance of this relationship stirred her own heart the dramatic possibilities of the situation appealed to her at any moment the men might return and force her into the rôle of defender on the other hand they might be confined for days together in this little cabin and in this enforced intimacy peggy was sure to discover his secret and his adoration  the little hovel was filled with the golden light of the blazing fagots and through the open door alice could see the feathery crystals falling in a wondrous glittering curtain across the night the stream roared in subdued voice as though oppressed by the snows and the shadow of the fugitive as he moved about the fire had a savage primal significance which awed the girl into silence  he was very deft in camp work and cooked their supper for them almost as well as they could have done it themselves but he refused to sit at the table with peggy ill just naturally stick to my slicker if you dont mind im wet and my hands are too grimy to eat with a lady  alice continued to talk to him always with an undercurrent of meaning which he easily read and adroitly answered this care this double meaning drew them ever closer in spirit and the girl took an unaccountable pleasure in it  after supper he took his seat in the open doorway and the girl in the bunk looked upon him with softened glance she had no fear of him now on the contrary she mentally leaned upon him without him the night would be a terror the dawn an uncertainty the brave selfreliance of his spirit appeared in stronger light as she considered that for weeks he had been camping alone and that but for this accident to her he would be facing this rayless wintry night in solitude  he began again to question her i wish youd tell me more about yourself he said his dark eyes fixed upon her i cant understand why any girl like you should come up here with a bunch of rocksharps are you tied up to the professor  if peggy expected her patient to resent this question she must have been surprised for alice merely smiled as if at the impertinence of a child  mrs adams replied i can tell you that she isand a very fortunate girl her friends think her  he turned to her with unmoved face you mean hes got money i reckon  money and brains and good looks and a fine position  thats about the whole works aint itleastwise he will have it all when he gets you a man like that doesnt deserve what hes got hes a chump do you suppose id go off and leave you alone in a hole like this with a smashed leg id never bring you into such a country in the first place and i certainly wouldnt leave you just to study a shack of ice on the mountainside  i urged him to go and besides peggy is mistaken were not engaged  but he left you thats what sticks in my crop he cant be just right in his head if i had any chance of owning you id never let you out of my sight i wouldnt take a chance i dont understand these city fellows i reckon their blood is thinned with icewater if i had you id be scared every minute for fear of losing you id be as dangerous to touch as a silvertip if i had any place to take you id steal you right now  this was more than banter even mrs adams perceived the passion quivering beneath his easy lowtoned speech he was in truth playing with the conception of seizing this halfsmiling halfmusing girl whose helpless body was at once a lure and an inspiration it was perfectly evident that he was profoundly stirred  and so was alice what she dared ask herself will become of this   iv  to the outlaw in the rocky mountain cabin in that stormy night it was in every respect the climax of his life as he sat in the doorway looking at the fire and over into the storm beyond he realized that he was shaken by a wild crude lyric of passion here was to him the pure emotion of love all the beautiful things he had ever heard or read of girlhood of women of marriage rose in his mind to make this night an almost intolerable blending of joy and sorrow hope and despair  to stay time in its flight to make this hour his own to cheat the law to hold the future at baythese were the avid desires the vague resolutions of his brain so sure as the day came this happiness would end tomorrow he must resume his flight resigning his newfound jewel into the hands of another to this thought he returned again and again each time with new adoration for the girl and added fury and hate against his relentless pursuers and himself he did not spare himself gad what a fool ive beenand yet if i had been less a fool i would not be here and i would never have met her he ended with a glance toward alice  then he arose closed the door of the cabin and stood without beside the fire so that the women might prepare for bed his first thought of suicide came to him why not wait with his love as long as possiblestay till the laws hand was in the air above his head uplifted to strike and then in this last moment die with this latest most glorious passion as climax to his career to flee meant endless fear torment to be captured meant defeat utter and final dismay  a knock upon the door startled him and peggys voice cut short his meditation you can come in now mr smith she said  the broad crystals were still falling thickly and the fire was hissing and spluttering around a huge root which he had rolled upon it in its light the cabin stood hardly higher than a kennel and yet it housed the woman whose glance had transformed his world into something mystical a man of commonplace ancestry would have felt only an animal delight in shelter and warmth but this youth was stirred to a spiritual exaltation the girls bosom the rounded beauty of her neck appealed to him but so also did the steady candor of her gaze and the sweet courage of her lips her helplessness roused his protective instinct and her words the sound of her voice so precise so aliensweet filled him with bitter sadness and he reentered the house in such spirit of selfabasement as he had never known before  he lay down upon the hard floor in silence his audacity gone his reckless courage deepsunk in gloomy foreboding  alice on her part could not free her mind from the burden of his crime he was so young and so handsome to be hunted like a noxious beast she had at the moment more concern of him than of ward and in this lay a certain disloyalty she sighed deeply as she thought of the outlaw resuming his flight next day would it not be better for him to sacrifice himself to the vengeance of the state at once and so end it what right had she to shield him from the laws demand he is a criminal after all he must pay for his rash act  she could not sleep and when he rose to feed the fire she softly asked does it still storm  no he answered in a tone that voiced disappointment the sky is clear  isnt that cheering she exclaimed still in the same hushed voice  for you he replied for me its another story he felt the desire for a secret consultation which moved her and on his way back to his corner he halted and fixed his eyes upon her in hungry admiration of her firelit face then he spoke i should have pulled out before the storm quit they can trail me now but no matter ive known you  she still kept to ambiguous speech wouldnt it be better to give up and take yourmisfortune and begin again professor ward and i will do all we can to help you  thats mighty white of you he responded slowly but i cant stand the thought of confinement ive been free as an injun all my life every way of the wind has been open to me no just as long as i can find a wild spot i must keep moving if it comes to hands up i take the short cut he tapped his revolver as he spoke  you mustnt do that she entreated promise me you wont think of that  he made a stride toward her but a movement of her companion checked him  is it morning peggy sleepily asked  not quite answered the outlaw but its time for me to be moving id like to hear from you some time he said to alice and his voice betrayed his sadness and tenderness where could i reach you  she gave her address with a curious sense of wrongdoing  he listened intently ill remember that he said when ive forgotten everything else and now he reached his hand to her and she took it  poor boy im sorry for you she whispered  her words melted his heart dropping on his knees beside her bed he pressed her fingers to his lips then rose ill see you againsomewheresome time he said brokenly goodby  no sooner had the door closed behind the outlaw than peggy rose in her place beside alice and voiced her mystification now what is the meaning of all that  dont ask me replied the girl i dont feel like talking and my foot is aching dreadfully cant you get up and bathe it i hate to ask youbut it hurts me so  peggy sprang up and began to dress puffing and whistling with desperation as soon as she was dressed she ran to the door and opened it all was still a world of green and white the fire is almost out she reported and i can see mr smiths horses tracks   v  it was about ten oclock when a couple of horsemen suddenly rounded the point of the forest and rode into the clearing one of them a slender elderly man with gray curly beard and a skin like red leather dismounted and came slowly to the door and though his eyes expressed surprise at meeting women in such a place he was very polite  mornin maam he said with suave inflection  good morning peggy replied  fine snowy mornin  it is so she was a little irritated by the fixed stare of his round gray eyes  he became more direct may i ask who you are and how you happen to be here maam  you may im mrs adams i came up here with my husband professor adams  where is he  he has gone up the trail toward frémont he is a botanist  is that his horses tracks  alice called sharply peggy  mrs adams turned abruptly and went in  the stranger turned a slow gaze upon his companion well this beats me pears like were on the wrong trail bob i reckon weve just naturally overhauled a bunch of tourists  better go in and see whats inside suggested the other man slipping from his horse  all right you stay where you are  as he stepped to the door and rapped peggy opened it but alice took up the inquiry  what do you want she asked imperiously  the man after looking keenly about quietly replied im wonderin how you women come to be here alone but first of all i want to know who made them tracks outside the door  alice ignored the latter part of his question and set about satisfying his wonder we came up here with a geological survey but my horse fell on my foot and i couldnt ride so the men had to leave me behind  alone sharply interrogated the man  no one man stayed  what was his name  i dont know we called him smith  was he the man that rode away this morning  what does that matter to you asked the girl why are you so inquisitive  he maintained his calm tone of mild authority im the sheriff of uinta county maam and im looking for a man whos been hiding out in this basin i was trailin him close when the snow came on yesterday and i didnt know but what these tracks was his  peggy turned toward alice with an involuntary expression of enlightenment and the sheriff read it quickly slipping between the two women he said  jest a minute miss what sort of a looking man was this smith  alice took up the story he was rather small and darkwasnt he peggy  peggy considered i didnt notice him particularly yes i think he was  the man outside called hurry up cap its beginning to snow again  the sheriff withdrew toward the door youre both lying he remarked without heat but it dont matter well mighty soon overhaul this man on the horsewhoever he is if youve been harboring hall mccord well have to take you too with that threat as a farewell he mounted his horse and rode away  peggy turned to alice did you know that young fellow was an outlaw  yes i saw his picture and description on a placard in the railway station i recognized him at once  why didnt you tell me  well i liked his looks and besides i wanted to find out if he were really bad or only unfortunate  what has he done  they say he held up a train  merciful heavens a trainrobber whats his real name  the name on the placard was hall mccord  and to think he was in the same room with us last night and you were chumming with him i cant understand you are you sure he is the robber  yes he confessed to having tried to rob the express car  he seemed such a nice fellow how did he come to do it  alice concluded not to honor the other girl by bringing her into the discussion oh it is hard to say need of money i suppose poor boy i pity him  theyll get him sure they can follow his tracks as easy as anything i dont suppose i ought to say it but i hope hell get away dont you  yes i do was alices fervent response but see its snowing again it may cover his trail  peggy went to the door and gazed long and keenly at the peaks when she turned her face was solemn allie this is getting pretty serious for us if the men dont come today they may get snowed up entirely  alice stifled a wail oh if i were only able to walk i wouldnt mind i could help gather fuel and keep the fire going  theres plenty of wood for another day but im worried about the men suppose they are up on that glacier  im not worried about them but i know they are worrying about us theyll surely start back this morning but they may not be able to reach us till night  the light of the morning had turned gray and feeble the air was still and the forest soundless save now and then when a snowladen branch creaked with its burden  there was something majestic as well as menacing in this allpervading solemn hush  peggy went about her duties as cheerfully as she could but with a wider knowledge of mountaineering than alice had she was at heart quite terrified were going to miss our nice outlaw she remarked he was so effective as a purveyor of wood then she went to the door and looked out that sheriff will never keep his trail she said  whats that suddenly asked alice  both listened i hear it whispered peggy its a horsethere some one spoke  its freeman alice joyously called out coohoo  no one replied and peggy rushing to the door met the young outlaw who appeared on the threshold with stern set face  whos been here since i left your party  peggy recoiled in surprise and alarm and alice cried out why did you come back  two men on horseback have been here since i left who were they his voice was full of haste  one of them saidhe was thethe sheriff alice replied faintly  he smiled then a kind of terrifying humor in his eyes well the chances are he knew they took my trail of course and left in a hurry expected to overhaul me on the summit theyve got their work cut out for em  how did they miss you the girl asked huskily  well you see when i got up where i could view the sky i was dead sure we were in for a whooping big snowstorm and i just couldnt leave you girls up here all alone so i struck right down the cañon in the bed of the creekthe short cut i dont like to backtrail anyway its a bad habit to get into i like to leave as blind a trail as i can his face lighted up grew boyish again theyre sure up against a cold proposition about now theyll lose my track among the rocks but theyll figure ive hustled right on over into pine creek and if they dont freeze to death in the pass theyll come out at glovers haymeadow tomorrow night hows the woodpile holding out  please go cried alice take your chance now and hurry away  im not used to leaving women in such a fix the moment i saw that the blizzard was beginning all over again i turned back  you havent had any breakfast said peggy  nothing to speak of he replied dryly i wasnt thinking of breakfast when i pulled out  ill get you some  alice could not throw off the burden of his danger what will you do when my people return  i dont knowtrust to luck  you are very foolish they are certain to come today  they wont know who i am if you women dont give me away  im sure freemanprofessor wardwill know you for he also saw the placard  thats no sign suppose he doesmaybe he wont think it is his job to interfere anywayhere his voice became decisivei wont leave you in such a fix as this his eyes spoke to her of that which his tongue could not utter i wanted an excuse to come back anyway he concluded no matter what comes now my job is here to protect you  she did not rebuke him and peggythough she wondered at his tonewas too grateful for his presence even to question alices motive in permitting such remarks  as for alice she felt herself more and more involved in the tangled skein of his mysterious life his sudden and reckless abandonment of the old love which had ruined him and the new and equally irrational regard which he now professed for her filled her with a delicious marveling  he appealed to a womans imagination he had the spice of the unknown in her relationship with ward there was no danger no mysteryhis courtship narrowly escaped being commonplace she had accepted his attentions and expected to marry him and yet the thought of the union produced at its warmest merely a glow of comfort a sense of security whereas the hint of being loved and protected by this rob roy of the hills this reckless rough rider of the wilderness was instinct with romance of course his devotion was a crazy folly and yet lying there in her rough bunk with an impenetrable wall of snow shutting out the rest of the world it was hard not to feel that this man and his future had become an inescapable part of her lifea part which grew in danger and in charm from hour to hour  full two miles above the level of her own home surrounded by peaks unscalably wild and lonely deserted by those who should care for her was it strange that she should return this mans adoring gaze with something of the primal womans gratitude and submission  the noon darkened into dusk as they talked slowly with long pauses and one by one the stirring facts of the rovers life came out from his boyhood he had always done the reckless thing he had known no restraint till as a member of the rough riders he yielded a partial obedience to his commanders when the excitement of the campaigns was over he had deserted and gone back to the roundup wagon and the campfire  in the midst of his confidences he maintained a reserve about his family which showed more selfmastery than anything else about him that he was the black sheep of an honorable flock became increasingly evident he had been the kind of lad who finds in the west a fine field for daredevil adventure and yet there were unstirred deeps in the man he was curious about a small book which alice kept upon her bed and which she read from time to time with serene meditation on her face  what is that he asked  my bible  can i see it  certainly  he took it carefully and read the title on the back then turned a few of the leaves im not much on reading he said but ive got a sister that sends me tracts and the like he returned to the flyleaf is this your name  yes  alice mansfield he read beautiful name new york city thats pretty near the other side of the world to me he studied the address with intent look id like to buy this book how much will you take for it  ill trade it for your weapon she replied  he looked at her narrowly you mean something by that i reckon i follow you no i cant do thatnot now if i get into business over the line ill disarm but in this country a fellow needs to be protected i want this book  for the flyleaf  he smiled in return youve hit it  she hesitated ill give you the book if youll promise to read it  he clapped the covers together and put the volume in his pocket its mine ill read every word of it if it takes an age and heres my hand on it  she gave him her hand and in this clasp something came to her from his clutching fingers which sobered her she drew her hand away hastily and said if you read that bookand think about itit will change your whole world  he too lost his brightness well im not so anxious to keep up this kind of life but if anybody changes me it will be you  hush she warned with lifted finger  he fell back and after a little silence went out to wait upon the fire  it seems to me said peggy reprovingly that youre too gracious with this mountaineer hes getting presumptuous  he doesnt mean to be its his unsophisticated way anyhow we cant afford to be captious to our host  thats true admitted peggy  the night shut down with the snow still falling but with a growing chill in the air  the flakes are finer the outlaw announced as he came in a little later that is a good sign it is growing colder and the wind is changing it will pinch hard before sunup and the worst of it theres no way to warm the cabin we cant have the door open tonight im worried about you he said to alice if only those chumps had left a mansize ax  the two women understood that this night was to bring them into closer intimacy with the stranger than before he could not remain outdoors and though they now knew something of his desperate character they had no fear of him he had shown his chivalry no one could have been more considerate of them for he absented himself at peggys request instantly and without suggestion of jocularity and when he came in and found them both in bed he said  i reckon ill not make down tonightyoull need all your blankets before morning and thereupon without weighing their protests proceeded to spread the extra cover over them  alice looked up at him in the dim light of the candle and softly asked what will you do you will suffer with cold  dont worry about me im an old campaigner i still have a blanket to wrap around my shoulders ill snooze in a corner if you hear me moving around dont be worried im hired to keep the fire going even if it doesnt do us much good inside  the chill deepened the wind began to roar and great masses of snow dislodged from the tall trees above the cabin fell upon its roof with sounds like those of soft slow footfalls strange noises of creaking and groaning and rasping penetrated to alices ears and she cowered half in fear half in joy of her shelter and her male protector men were fine animals for the wild  she fell asleep at last seeing her knights dim form propped against the wall wrapped in a blanket indianwise his head bowed over the book she had given him a candle smoking in his hand  she woke when he rose to feed the fire and the current of cold air which swept in caused her to cover her mouth with the blanket he turned toward her  its all over for sure this time he said its cold and goin to be colder how are you standing it if your feet are cold i can heat a stone how is the hurt foot he drew near and looked down upon her anxiously  very much easier thank you  im mighty glad of that i wish i could take the pain all on myself  you have troubles of your own she answered as lightly as she could  thats true too he agreed in the same tone so many that a little one more or less wouldnt count  do you call my wound little  i meant the foot was little  she checked him  i didnt mean to make light of it it sure is no joke he added ive made a start on the book  how do you like it  i dont know yet he answered and went back to his corner  she snuggled under her warm quilts again remorseful yet not daring to suggest a return of the blanket he had lent when she woke again he was on his feet swinging his arms silently his candle had gone out but a faint light was showing in the room  is it morning she asked  just about he replied stretching like a cat  the dawn came gloriously the sun in farsplashing splendor slanted from peak to peak painting purple shadows on the snow and warming the boles of the tall trees till they shone like fretted gold the jays cried out as if in exultation of the ending of the tempest and the small stream sang over its icy pebbles with resolute cheer it was a land to fill a poet with awe and ecstatic praisea radiant imperial and merciless landscape trackless almost soundless the mountain world lay waiting for the alchemy of the sun   vi  the morning was well advanced when a far faint halloo broke through the silence of the valley the ranger stood like a statue while peggy cried out  its one of our men  alice turned to the outlaw with anxious face if its the sheriff stay in here with me let me plead for you i want him to know what youve done for us  the look that came upon his face turned her cold with fear if it is the sheriff he did not finish but she understood  the halloo sounded nearer and the outlaws face lightened its one of your party he is coming up from below  impatiently they waited for the newcomer to appear and though he seemed to draw nearer at every shout his progress was very slow at last the man appeared on the opposite bank of the stream he was covered with snow and stumbling along like a man half dead with hunger and fatigue  why its gage exclaimed peggy  it was indeed the old hunter and as he drew near his gaunt and bloodless face was like that of a starved and hunted animal his first word was an anxious inquiry how are ye  all well peggy answered  and the crippled girl  doing nicely thanks to mr smith here we did not freeze are you hungry  the guide looked upon the outlaw with glazed protruding eyes hungry im done ive been wallerin in the snow all night and im just about all in  where are the others called alice from her bed  gage staggered to the door theyre up at timberline i left them day before yesterday i tried to get here but i lost my bearins and got on the wrong side o the creek pears like i kept on the wrong side o the hogback then my horse gave out and that set me afoot i was plum scared to death about you folks i sure was  peggy put some food before him and ordered him into silence talk later she said  the outlaw turned to alice that explains it your professor ward trusted to this man to take care of you and stayed in camp you cant blame him  gage seemed to have suddenly become old almost childish i never was lost before he muttered sadly i reckon something must have went wrong in my head pears like im gettin old and foolish  alice exchanged glances with the outlaw it was plain that he was in no danger from this dazed and weakened old man who could think of nothing but the loss of his sense of direction  as the day advanced the sun burned clear at noon it was warm enough to leave the door open and alice catching glimpses of the flaming world of silver and purple and gold was filled with a desire to quit her dark corner  im going to get up she exclaimed i wont lie here any longer  dont try it protested peggy  im going to do it she insisted i can hobble to the door if you help me  ill carry you said the outlaw wrap her up and ill get her a seat  and so while mrs adams wrapped her patient in a blanket the outlaw dragged one of the rough axhewn benches to the door and covered it with blankets he put a stone to heat and then reentered just as alice supported by peggy was setting foot to the floor swiftly unhesitating and very tenderly he put his arms about her and lifted her to the bench in the doorway before the fire  it was so sweet to feel that wondrous body in his arms his daring to do it surprised her but her own silent acquiescence and the shiver of pleasure which came with the embarrassment of it confused and troubled her  thats better he said as he dropped to the ground and drew the blankets close about her feet ill have a hot stone for you in a minute  he went about these ministrations with an inward ecstasy which shone in his eyes and trembled in his voice but as she furtively studied his face and observed the tremor of his hands in tender ministration she lost all fear of him  after three days in her dark corner of the hut the sunshine was wondrously inspiring to the girl although the landscape on which she gazed was white and wild as december it was incredible that only a few hours lay between the flowerstrewn valley of her accident and this silent and desolate yet beautiful wilderness of snow and so as she looked into the eyes of the outlaw it seemed as though she had known him from spring to winter and her wish to help him grew with every hour of their acquaintanceship  she planned his defense before ward and adams when they know how kind and helpful he has been they can but condone his one rash deed she argued in conclusion  he was sitting at her feet careless of time the law content with her nearness and mindful only of her comfort when a distant rifleshot brought him to his feet with the swiftness of the startled stag  thats your expedition he said or some one who needs help  again the shots rang out one two threeone two three its a signal its your party  peggy uttered a cry of joy and rushed outside but alice turned an unquiet gaze on the outlaw youd better fly  what is the use he answered bitterly the snow is so deep there is no show to cross the range and my horse is weak and hungry  gage appeared at the door lemme take your gun stranger i want to answer the signal  wheres your own  i left it on my horse the old man answered sheepishly  the young fellow looked at alice with a keen glitter in his eyes ill make answer myself he said im very particular about my barkers  alice as she heard his revolvers answering word leap into the silent air and bound and rebound along the cliffs was filled with a sudden fear that the sheriff might be guided back by the soundand this indeed the fugitive himself remarked as he came back to his seat beside her  if hes anywhere on this side of the divide hell sure come back but ive done my best the lord god almighty has dropped the snow down here and shut me in with you and im not complaining  there was no answer to be made to this fatalism of utterance and none to the worship of his eyes  lift me up commanded alice i want to look out and see if i can see anybody  the outlaw took her in his arms supporting her in the threshold in order that she might see over the vast sea of white but no human being was to be seen  take me backinside alice said to the man who had her in his arms i feel cold here  once again and with a feeling that it was perhaps for the last time he carried her back to her bench and reenveloped her in her blankets  stay here with me now she whispered to him as she looked up into his face  and the outlaw filled with gladness and pride threw himself on the floor beside her   vii  the signal pistolshots came nearer and nearer but very slowly and as the outlaw sat beside alices couch he took her bible from his pocket and said  i made a stab at reading this last night  she smiled i saw you how did you like it  i didnt exactly get aboard someway  what was the trouble  i guess it was because i kept thinking of youand my own place in the game three days ago i didnt care what became of me but now i want a chance i dont see any chance coming my way but if i had it id make use of it he looked at her a moment in silence then with sudden intensity broke forth do you know what you mean to me when i look at your face and eyes im crazy hungry for you  she shrank from him and called to mrs adams  he went on oh you neednt be afraid i just wanted to say it thats all if there was only some other way to straighten myselfbut i cant go to jail i cant stand up to be clipped like a poodledog then put on striped clothing and walk lockstepi cant do it theyll put me in for ten years id be old when i got out he shuddered no i wont do that id rather die here in the hills  she grew white in sympathy it is a frightful price to pay for one insane act and yetcrime should be punished  im getting my punishment now he replied with darkly brooding glance theres a good old man and two women my sisters waitin for me down the slope if i could reach home id try to live straight but its a long and dangerous trail between here and there  peggy now ran into the cabin its the expedition she announced i can see freeman  i reckon this is where i get off said the outlaw in a tone of mingled relief and dismay  no no alice entreated stay till freeman comes he will help you let me explain to him i know he will not betray you  he looked at her again with that intent longing worship in his eyes and answered i accept the chance for the sake of one more hour with you  the outlaw stepped to the door and he saw a man at the head of his train midleg deep in snow leading his horse breaking the way for his followers who were all on foot crawling stumbling and twisting among the downtimber unmindful of the old trail  at sight of that big and resolute leader with flowing black beard and ruddy face the outlaw was filled with jealous sadness to find ward a man of superb physical prowess the kind that measures peaks for the fun of it was disturbing and without defining his feeling he was plunged into melancholy musing and when later ward entered and stooping over the couch kissed alice the end of his idyl seemed to him announced  in the bustle of the moment in the interchange of anxious hurried inquiries the outlaw stood aside in the corner unnoticed till alice caught wards arm and said  freeman this is mr smith to whom we owe a great deal he has taken the utmost care of us we would have frozen but for him  ward shook hands with the outlaw but wonderingly asked of alice but where was gage  the outlaw answered gage got lost and only turned up a couple of hours ago  ward turned to alice in horror good lord and you were here alonecrippledin this storm  nothats what im telling you mr smith came and took care of us he brought our wood he cooked for us he kept our fire going he gave up his bed even his blankets for us you should be very generous to him  ward again reached a hearty hand im tremendously obliged to you  the outlaw quailed under all this praise there was mighty little to do he answered i only shared my fire with them  ward studied him closer havent we met before  no i reckon not  im quite sure ive seen you somewhere what are you doing up in here  alice interposed what are we going to do  ward turned to the outlaw what would you advise ive only had one idea and that was to reach this cabin now what would you do  the outlaw was ready i would send a part of the men with the horses down the valley to grass and id wait here till miss mansfield is able to ride  will this snow go off  thats my notion  its certain we cant camp herethe horses must have grass  ill be able to ride in a day or two alice said bravely  we could frame up a portable bed and carry you suggested the outlaw but it cant be done tonight so youd better send your outfit down to the marsh to camp the horses are worn out and so are the men  will you guide them to grass and help them find shelter  the outlaw hesitated for an instant and alice interposed no no let gage do that i want mr smith to remain here  ward perceived in her entreaty something of anxiety and fear and after the men and horses had started down the slope he turned to the outlaw and said im mighty grateful to you mr smith it must have surprised you to find these women here  the outlaw dryly replied it did  alice added it was in the middle of the night too but mr smith was very nice about it he slept outdoors without a word of complaint  ward had figured the situation to conclusion smith is a poacher and though he had a savage dislike of these illicit gameslaughterers he could not but be glad of the presence of this particular outlaw and resolved to overlook his trade in gratitude for his cabin and service  the outlaw helped adams and ward to clear away the snow for a tent and alice seeing the three men thus amicably joined in her defense could not find it in her heart to condemn one of them as a criminal here in the white isolation of the peaks the question of crime and its punishment became personal to have this mans fate in her hand was like grasping the executioners sword for herself  if women had to punish criminals themselves with their own hand she asked how many of them would do it  peggy came in and whispered to her no one else seems to have recognized him he may get away safely i hope he will shall we tell the men who he is  yes we shall have to do that soon but im afraid they wont take the sentimental view of him that we do i tremble to think of what they will do when they know  ward explained to adams our friend smith here is a poacherbut as our account stands i dont feel it my duty to report him do you  no peggy tells me he has acted like a gentleman all through  in this spirit they made themselves comfortable for the night  the sun set gloriously but the air bit ever sharper and while peggy went about her cooking assisted by her husband and the outlaw alice pulled ward down to her bedside and hurriedly began  you remember that placard we read in the stationthe one about the trainrobber  yes  well this is the manour mr smith  ward looked at her a moment with reflective eyes then exclaimed youre right i thought id seen him somewhere  and the sheriff is after him he was here yesterday morning  here  yes you see mr smith stayed with us till he thought the storm was over then rode away intending to cross the divide but when the snow began again he turned back he said he couldnt leave us alone he left us just before dawn and four or five hours afterward the sheriff came of course he saw the poor fellows trail and instantly set off after him  but why didnt they meet  because mr smith came back a different way and then the blizzard came on and covered up his tracks he thinks the sheriff has gone on over the divide you must help him freeman help him to get away and find some way to give him a start nobody could have been more considerate and i cant see him taken by these coldblooded men who want that two thousand dollars reward he really could have escaped only for us he came back to protect us  ward pondered the problem is not so easy of solution a train robbery is a pretty serious matter im very grateful to him but to connive at his escape is itself a punishable act why did you tell me i could have passed it over  because im afraid the sheriff may come back at any moment  wards brow was troubled i could ignore his deed and pretend not to know who he is but definitely to assist a bandit to escape is a very serious matter  i know it is but remember he gave up his chance to cross the divide in order to keep us from suffering  i wish you hadnt told me he repeated almost in irritation if the sheriff only keeps on over the range smith can take care of himself  as the outlaw reentered the cabin alice acknowledged in him something worth a woman to love in the older man was power security moral mental and physical health the qualities her reason demanded in a husband but in the other was grace and charm something wildly admirable he allured as the warrior intrepid and graceful allured the maiden as the forest calls the householder something primordial and splendid and very sweet was in her feeling toward him there could be no peaceful wedlock there no security of home no comfort only the exquisite thrill of perilous union the madness of a few short weeksperhaps only a few swift days of selfsurrender and then surely disaster and despair to yield to him was impossible and yet the thought of it was tantalizingly sweet  when she looked toward ward she perceived herself sitting serenely in matronly grace behind a shining coffeeurn in a wellordered highly civilized breakfastroom facing a most considerate husband who nevertheless was able to read the morning paper in her presence when she thought of life with the outlaw all was dark stormy confused and yet the way was lit by his adoring eyes a magical splendor lay in the impulse his love sudden as it seemed was realshe was certain of that she felt the burning power the conjury of its flame and it made her future with ward at the moment seem dull and drab  why why could not such a man and such a passion come with the orderly and the ethical she asked herself  at the best he was fitted only for the mine or the ranch and the thought of life in a lonely valley even with his love to lighten it made her shudder on one side she was a very practical and farseeing woman the instant she brought her reason to bear on the problem she perceived that any further acquaintance with this man was dangerous they must part here at this moment and yet she could not let him go without in some way making him feel her wish to help him   viii  ward and the outlaw were discussing plans for getting out of the basin when adams came in to say a couple of other weary wanderers are turning up  the sheriff instantly exclaimed alice her face whitening in swift dismay  in that moment the forester was transformed with a weapon in his hand he stood aside his eyes on the door a scowl of battle on his face he resembled a wolf with bared fangs ready to die desperately  ward quick to read his purpose interposed wait he commanded stay here ill see them dont be rash  as he passed out into the firelight the outlaw without relaxing his vigilance said in a low voice well girl i reckon heres where i say good night  dont resist she pleaded dont fight please please what is the use oh its too horrible if you resist they will kill you  there was no fear in his voice as he replied they may not im handy with my gun  she was breathless chilled by the shadow of the impending tragedy but that would be worse to kill them would only stain your soul the deeper you must not fight  its selfdefense  but they are officers of the law  no matter i will not be taken alive  she moaned in her distress helplessly wringing her hands o god why should i be witness of this  you wont be if this is the sheriff i am going to open that door and make a dash what happens will happen outside you need not see it im sorry you have to hear it but i give you my wordif you must hear something i will see to it that you hear as little as possible  the latch clickedhe stepped back and again stood waiting silent rigid ready to act murderous in design  mrs adams entered quickly and closing the door behind her hurriedly whispered its the sheriff hide the men will hold them as long as they can hide  the outlaw looked about and smiled where he asked almost humorously im not a squirrel  under the bunk see there is room  he shook his head no i refuse to crawl i wont sneak i never have i take em as they come  for my sake pleaded alice i cant bear to see you killed hide yourself go to the door she said to peggy dont let them in tell freeman she rose and stood unsteadily forgetful of her own pain  mrs adams urged her to lie down but she would not the moments passed in suspense almost too great to be endured  listen commanded the outlaw theyre coming in  as they harkened wards voice rose clearly you cant miss the camp he was saying as if speaking to some one at a distance just keep the trail in the snow and youll find them im sorry we cant put you upbut you see how it is  theyre going exclaimed alice thank god theyre going  it cant be theyll go without searching the shack the fugitive muttered in no measure relaxing his attitude of watchful menace theyre playing a game on us  again the latch clicked and this time it was ward who confronted the outlaws revolver mouth  its all right ward called instantly understanding the situation theyre gone the old man was about played out for theyve been fighting snow all day but i told him we couldnt take care of them here and they have gone on down to the camp he thinks you got over the divide you are all right for the present  theyll come back replied the other it only puts the deal off a few hours theyll return trailin the whole camp after them what can i do my horse is down there in the herd  thats bad exclaimed ward i wonder if i could get him for you  if i had him hes weak and hungry and the high places are feet deep in drifts it doesnt signify im corralled any way you look at it and the only thing left is to fight  theres our trail to the glacier ward musingly suggested its a pretty deep furrowyou might make it that way  a spark of light leaped into the mans eyes how far up does it run where does it end  in glacier basin just at timberline  the outlaw pondered speaking his thought aloud from there across to the indian reservation there isnt a wolf track its a mans job crossing there almost sure death but its my only show he had replaced his weapon in his belt and was weighing his chance his eyes fixed on alices face to leave this shelter this warm circle of light this sweet girlish presence and plunge into the dark the cold and the snow was hard no one but a man of unconquerable courage would have considered it this man was both desperate and heroic its my only chance and ill take it he said drawing his breath sharply ill need your prayers he added grimly with eyes that saw only the girl if i fail youll find me up there i carry my sleepingpowder with me he touched his revolver as he spoke  alices mind sweeping out over that desolate expanse had a moments vision of him as he would appear toiling across those towering cliffs minute as a fly and her heart grew small and sick  why dont you stay and take your lawful punishment she asked you will surely perish up there in the cold wait for sunlight at least  i am ready to stay and to die here near you he replied with a significant glance  no no not that she cried out talk to him freeman persuade him to give himself up ive done my best to influence him dont let him uselessly sacrifice himself  ward perceived something hidden in her voice some emotion which was more than terror deeper than pity but his words were grave and kindly it is a frightful risk young man but the trail to the glacier is your only open road the sheriff is tired even if he finds out that you are here he may not come back tonight he will know you cannot escape you cant stir without leaving a telltale mark if you could only get below the snow on the west slope  whichever trail i take its goodby interrupted the fugitive still addressing alice if there was anything to live forif youd say the wordshe knew what he meantid stay and take my schooling he waited a moment and she looking from his asking face to wards calm brow could not utter a sound what could she promise the outlaws tone softened to entreaty if youll only say i may see you again on the other side of the range twill keep my heart warm cant you promise me that its mighty little  he was going to almost certain death and she could not refuse this you may write to me she faltered you know my address  he struck the little book in his pocket yes i have it safe then i may see you again  alice supported by mrs adams unsteadily rose yes yes only go they are coming back i can hear them  he took her hand goodby he said chokingly youve given me heart he bent swiftly and kissed her forehead ill win youll hear from me  hurry she wildly cried i hear voices  he caught up his hat and opened the door as he faced them his lips were resolute and his eyes glowing its only good night he said and closed the door behind him  hold shouted ward you must take some food he tore the door open wait  even as he spoke a pistolshot resounded through the night it cut through the deathly silence of the forest like a spiteful curse and was answered by anotherthen after a short pause a swifttearing volley followed  they are killing him cried alice                                       they brought him in and laid him at her feet he had requested this but when she bent to peer into his face he had gone beyond speech limp and bloody and motionless he lay with eyes of unfathomable regret and longing staring up at her and as the men stood about with uncovered heads she stooped to him forgetful of all else knelt to lay her hand upon his brow  poor boy poor boy she said her eyes blinded with tears  his hand stirred seeking her own and she took it and pressed it in both of hers jesus be merciful she prayed softly  he smiled faintly in acknowledgment of her presence and her prayer and in this consolation died  wonderingly with imperious frown she rose and confronted the sheriff how is it that you are unhurt did he not fight  thats what i cant understand miss he answered he fired only once and then into the air pears like he wanted to die  alice understood his thought was of her you shall hear as little as possible he had said  and you killed himas he surrendered she exclaimed bitterly and turned toward the dead man whose face was growing very peaceful now and with a blinding pain in her eyes she bent and laid a final caressing hand upon his brow  as she faced the sheriff again she said with merciless severity id rather be in his place than yours then with a tired droop in her voice she appealed to ward take me away from here im tired of this savage world     the leaser     the tenderfoot hayroller from the   prairiesstill tries his luck in some   abandoned tunnelsternly toiling for   his sweetheart far away     viii  the leaser   the only passenger in the car who really interested me was a burly young fellow who sat just ahead of me and who seemed to be something more than a tourist for the conductor greeted him pleasantly and the brakeman shook his hand we were climbing to cripple creek by way of the short line but as the sceneries were all familiar to me i was able to study my fellowpassengers  the man before me was very attractive although he was by no interpretation a gentle type on the contrary he looked to be the rough and ready american rough in phrase and ready to fight his corduroy coat hunched about his muscular shoulders in awkward lines and his broad face inclining to fat was stern and harsh he appeared to be about thirtyfive years of age  the more i studied him the more i hankered to know his history the conductor coming through hailed him with  well gettin back eh had a good trip  once or twice the minerhe was evidently a minerleaned from the window and waved his hat to some one on the crossing shouted a cheery how goes it and the brakeman asked  how did you find the east  from all this i deduced that the miner had been away on a visit to new york or boston or washington  as we rose the air became so cool so clear so crisp that we seemed to be entering a land of eternal dew and roses and as our car filled with the delicious scent of pine branches and green grasses the miner with a solemn look on his face took off his hat and turning to me said with deep intonation  this is what i call air this is good for what ails me  youve been away i stated rather than asked  ive been back eastback to see the old folksfirst time in eleven years  what do you call east i pursued  anything back of the missouri river he replied smiling a little in this case it was michigannear jackson  citizen of the camp i nodded up the cañon  yes im workin a lease on bull hill  hows the old camp looking  all shot to pieces half the houses empty and business gone to pot its a purty yellow proposition now  you dont say it was pretty slow when i was there last but i didnt suppose it had gone broke whats the matter of it  too many monopolists all the good properties have gone into one or two hands then these labor wars have scared operators away however im not complainin ive made good on this lease of mine he grinned boyishly ive been back to flash my roll in the old mans face you see i left the farm rather sudden one sunday morning eleven years ago and id never been back his face changed to a graver sweeter expression my sister wrote that mother was not very well and kind o grievin about me so as i was making good money i thought i could afford to surprise the old man by slapping him on the back you see when i left i told him id never darken his door againyou know the line of talk a boy hands out to his dad when hes madand for over ten years i never so much as wrote a line to any of the family  as he mused darkly over this period i insinuated another question what was the trouble  thats just it nothing to warrant anything more than a cussword and yet it cut me loose i was goin around now and then with a girl the old man didnt likeor rather my old man and her old man didnt hitchand besides her old man was a kind of shiftless cuss one o these men that raised sparrows in his beard and so one sunday morning as i was polishin up the buggy to go after nance who but dad should come out and growl  where ye goin with that buggy  none o your dam business i snaps back hot as hell in a secunt but just to touch you up ill tell you im goin over to see nance mcrae  well sir that set him off not with my horses says he and grabbin the buggy by the thills he sent it back into the shed then he turned on me  if you want to see that girl you walk i wont have you usin my tired animals to cart such trash  i stopped him right there he was a big rawboned citizen but i was a husky chunk of a lad myself and ready to fight  dont you speak a word against nance i says for if you do ill waller ye right here and now and as for your horse and buggy you may keep em till the cows come home heres where i get off youll never see me again  gee i was hot i went in packed up my grip and hit the first train for the west  just as thousands of other angry boys have done i said realizing to the minutest detail this scene they never think of going east  no the west is the only place for a man in troubleat least so it seems to me  where did you go what did you do  he mused again as if recalling his struggles i dropped off in kansas and got a job on a farm and fussed around there for the fall and winter then i got the minin fever and came to victor of course there wasnt anything for a grasscutter like me to do in the hills but swing a pick i didnt like underground work and so i went on a ranch again well i kept tryin the minin game off and on prospectin here and there and finally i got into this leasin business and two years ago i secured a lease on the red cent and struck it good and plenty oh i dont intend to say its any portlandbut it pays me and ive been stackin up some few dollars down at the commercial bank and feelin easy  the mans essential sturdiness of character came out as he talked and his face lost the heavy and rather savage look it had worn at first i had taken a seat beside him by this time and my sincere interest in his affairs seemed to please him he was eager to talk as one who had been silent for a long time  i led him back to the point of most interest to me and so at last you relented and went home i hope you found the old folks both alive did they know where you were  yes my sister saw my name in a paperwhen i made my stakeand wrote and mother used to send wordused to mention dad occasionally he laughed silently it sure is great fun this goin back to the home pasture with a fat wad in your pants pocketlord i owned the whole town  tell me about it i pleaded  he was ready to comply our house stood near the railway about four miles this side of jackson and you bet i had my head out of the winder to see if it was all there it was it looked just the same only the old man had painted it yellowand seemed like i could see mother settin on the porch id had it all planned to hire the best automobile in town and go up there in shape to heal sore eyesbut changed my plan  ill give em more of a shock if i walk out and pretend to be poor and kind o meek i says to myself  so i cached my valise at the station and i wallered out there through the dustit was june and a dry spell and hot judas priest i thought id sweat my wad into pulp before i got thereme just down from the high country on the way i got to wonderin about nancy is she alive i wonder  do you mean to say you left her without a word of goodby  he looked down at his knee and scratched a patch of grease there thats what i was so blame mad i cut loose of the whole outfit once or twice sis had mentioned nance in a casual kind of way but as i didnt biteshe had quit fishin and so i was all in the dark about her she might ave been dead or married or crazy for all i knew however now that i was on my way back with nineteen thousand dollars in the bank and a good show for more i kind o got to wonderin what she was sufferin at  i hope she was married to a banker in town and the owner of an electric brougham twould have served you right  he smiled again and resumed his story by the time i reached the old gate i was dusty as a stagecoach and this old corduroy suit made me look as much like a tramp as anybody as i came onto the old man he was waterin a span o horses at the well everything looked about the same only a little olderhe was pretty gray and some thinnerand i calls out kind o meeklike  can i get a job here mister  he looked me over a spell then says no for im purty well supplied with hands  what you need is a boss i says grinnin  then he knew me but he didnt do no fancy starthe just growled out kind o surly  im competent to do all the bossin on this place he says  you may think so i joshed him but if i couldnt keep a place lookin a little slicker n this id sell out and give some better man a chance  did that faze him not on your life he checked up both horses before he opened his mouth again  you dont look none too slick yourself how comes it youre trampin this hot weather  i see what he was driving at and so i fed him the dope he wanted  well ive had hard luck i says ive been sick  you dont look sick he snapped out quick as a flash you look tolerable husky you pear like one o these chaps that eat up all they earneat and drink and gamble he went on pilin it up i dont pity tramps a bit theyre all topers  i took it meek as moses  well i says im just out of the hospital and whilst i may seem husky i need a good quiet place and a nice easy job for a while moreover im terrible hungry  you go long up to the house he says and tell the girl in the kitchen to hand you out a plate of cold meat ill be along in a minute  and off he went to the barn leavin me shakin with his jolt he was game all right he figured me out as the prodigal son and want goin to knuckle he intended for me to do all the knee exercise i drifted along up the path toward the kitchen  judas but it did seem nice and familiar it was all so green and flowery after camp there aint a tree or a patch of green grass left in cripple but there in our old yard were lylocktrees and rosebushes climbin the porch and pinks and hollyhocksand beehives just as they used to setand clover say it nearly had me snifflin it sure did  the memory of it rather pinched his voice as he described it but he went on  of course i couldnt live down there nowits too low after a man has breathed such air as this  he looked out at the big clouds soaring round pikes peak  but the flowers and the grass they did kind o get me i edged round on the front side of the house and sure enough there sat mother just as she used toin the same old chair  cap i want to tell you i didnt play no circus tricks on her her head had grown white as snow and she looked kind o sad and feeble i began to understand a little of the worry id been to her i said good evening and she turned and looked at me then she opened her arms and called out my name  his voice choked unmistakably this time and it was a minute or two before he resumed  no jokes no lies doin there i opened right up to her i told her id done well but that i didnt want father to know it just yet and we sit there holdin hands when the old man hove round the corner  stephen says mother kind o solemn heres our son edward  did the old man wilt or climb the line fence and offer to shake hands nitsky he just shoved one hip onto the edge of the porch and remarked  does this dry spell reach as fur as where youve been  he broke into silent laughter again and i joined him this was all so deeply characteristic of the life i had known in my youth that i writhed with delight i understood the duel of wits and wills i could see it proceed as my companion chuckled  well sir we played that game all the evening i told of all the bad leases id tackledand how id been thrown from a horse and laid up for six months i brought out every setback and bruise id ever hadall to see if the old man would weaken and feel sorry for me  did he  not for a minute and sometimes as i looked at him i was sorry id come home but when i was with mother i was glad she phoned to sis who lived in jackson and sis came on the lope and we had a nice family party sis touched on nancy mcrae  you remember her she asked  i seem to i says kind of slow as if i was dredgin my mind to find something  well shes on the farm just the same as evertakin care of the old man her mothers dead  i didnt push that matter any farther but just planned to ride over the next morning and see how she looked  all that evening sis and i deviled the old man mother had told sis about my mineand so shed bring out every little while how uncertain the goldseekin business was and how if id stayed on the farm i could a been well offand shed push me hard when i started in on one of my hardluck stories i had to own up that i had walked out to save money and that i was travelin on an excursion ticket cause it was cheapand so on  the old mans mouth got straighter and straighter and his eyes colderbut i told mother not to say anything till next day and she didnt although he tossed and turned and grunted half the night he really took it hard but he finally agreed to harbor me and give me a chanceso mother told me next morningwhich was sunday i had planned to get home saturday night  next morning after breakfastand it was a breakfasti strolled out to the barn and the carriageshed door being open i pulled the old buggy outpeared like it was the very same one and i was adustin the cushions and fussin around when the old man came up  what you doin with that buggy he asks  i jest thought id ride over and see nance mcrae i says just as i did eleven years before  i reckon you better think again he says and rolls the buggy back into the shed just the way he did before if you want to see nance mcrae you can walk he says and i could see he meant it  all right i says and out i stepped without so much as saying goodby intendin to go for good this time  i went across the road to martins and got a chance to phone into jackson and in about twenty minutes i was whirlin over the road in a redcushioned automobile that ran smooth as oil and inside of half an hour i was rollin through mcraes gate  now up to this time i hadnt any notion of a program as to nancy i was all took up with gettin ahead of dad but when i found myself in front of old mcrae more down at the heel and raggeder in the seat than ever i was a whole lot set back what was i to say to him and to her i didnt know he was gappin at me with the eyes of an owl and so i opened up  i see you have no lightninrods i says in this day and age of the world you cant afford to go without lightninrods  he want no fool if he did wear rats in his hair and he says  i thought you was a creamseparator man

kink in rods asked the old cuss  these kind i sell i says are the kind that catch and store the electricity in a tank down cellar durin a thunderstorm you can save up enough to rock the baby and run the churn for a week or two  i want o know he says well we aint got a baby and no churnbut mebbe it would run a creamseparator  sure it would  all the time we was ajoshin this way he was astudyin

little early for a call i says and i aint in sunday clothes  that dont matter he says shell be glad to see you any time  youd a thought id been gone eleven weeks instead of eleven years  nance wasnt a bit like her dad she always looked shipshape no matter what she was adoin she was in the kitchen busy as a gasolinemotor when we busted through the door  nance the old man called out heres ed hatch  she didnt do any fancy stunts she just straightened up and looked at me kind o steady for a minute and then came over to shake hands  im glad to see you back ed she says  the stress of this meeting was still over him as i could see and hear and i waited for him to go on  she hadnt changed as much as mother she was older and sadder and kind o subdued and her hand felt calloused but id a known her anywhere she was dressed in a blue calico dress but she was sure handsome still and i said to her  you need a change of climate i says and a different kind of boss colorados where you ought to be i went on  for half an hour i kept banterin her like that and though she got pink now and then she didnt seem to understandor if she did she didnt let on she stuck to her work whilst the old man and me watched her seein her going about that kitchen that way got me locoed i always liked to watch mother in the kitchenand nance was a genuine housekeeper i always knew that  finally i says  i haint got any buggy nancethe old man wouldnt let me have one last sundayi mean eleven years agothats what threw me off the trackbut ive got a fortyhorsepower car out here suppose you put on your best apron and take a ride with me  she made some words as women will but she got ready and she did look handsomer than ever as she came out she was excited i could see that but she was all there no jugglin or fussin  climb in the front seat dad i says its me and nance to the private box turn on the juice i says to the driver  well sir we burned up all the grease in the box lookin up the old neighbors and the places we used to visit with horse and buggyand every time i spoke to the old man i called him dadand finally we fetched up at the biggest hotel in the town and had dinner together  then i says dad you better lay down and snooze nance and me are goin out for a walk  the town had swelled up some but one or two of the old stores was there and as we walked past the windows i says remember the time we stood here and wished we could buy things  she kind o laughed i dont believe i do  yes you do i says well we can look now to some account for ive got nineteen thousand dollars in the bank and a payin lease on a mine  up to this minute he had been fairly free to express his real feelingshypnotized by my absorbed gazebut now like most anglosaxons he began to shy he began to tell of a fourteendollar suit of clothes bought at this store which turned green in the hot sun  oh come now i insisted i want to know about nancy all this interests me deeply did she agree to come back with you  he looked a little bit embarrassed i asked her toright there in front of that window i said i want you to let me buy you that white dress  judas priest i cant let you do that she says  why not i said were goin to be married anyhow  is that so she asked i hadnt heard of it  oh she was no babe i tell you we went back to the hotel and woke up the old man and i ordered up the best machine in the shopa big sevenseated shiny one half as long as a pullman parlorcar with a top and brass housins and extra tires strapped on and a place for a trunkan outfit that made me look like a streetrailway magnate it set me back a whole lot but i wanted to stagger dadand i did as we rolled up to the door he came out with eyes you could hang your hat on  whats all this he asked  i hopped out  miss mcrae i says this is my father dad this is mister mcrae i think youve met before  he chuckled again that silent interior laugh and i was certainly grinning in sympathy as he went on  just help me with this trunk i says the horses bein tired i just thought id have a dray to bring up my duds  well sir i had him flat down he couldnt raise a grunt he stood like a post while i laid off my trunk but mother and sis came out and were both very nice to nance mother asked her to get out and she did and i took em all for a ride laterall but dad couldnt get him inside the machine nance stayed for supper and just as we were goin in dad said to me  how much does that red machine cost you an hour  about two dollars  i reckon you better send it back to the shop he says you can take nance home in my buggy  it was his surrender but i didnt turn a hair  i guess youre right i says it is a little expensive to spark inand a little too public too  the whistle of the engine announcing the station helped him out  heres victor and my mine is up there on the northwest side you can just see the chimney ive got another year on it and im goin to raise dirt to beat hell durin all the time there is left and then im goin to denver  and nance  oh shes comin out next week he said as he rose to take down his valise ive bought a place at the springs  good luck to you both said i as he swung from the train     the forest ranger         hardy son of the pioneersrepresenting the finer social       order of the future rides his lonely trail guarding with       singlehearted devotion the splendid heritage of us all     ix  the forest ranger   i  one april day some years ago when the rustling of cattle a picturesque name for stealing was still going on in one of our central mountain states abe kitsong a rancher on the shellfish meeting hanscom the forest ranger of that district called out  say mister do you know that some feller has taken a claim in our valley right bang up against your boundary line  yes replied hanscom ive an eye on him hes started a cabin already  i didnt know that land was open or id a took it myself who is the old chap anyway  i dont know where he comes from but his name is kauffmanpennsylvania dutch i reckon  watson will be hot when he runs agin the fence that fellers puttin up  well the mans in there and on the way to a clear title so what are you going to do about it  i dont plan for to do anything but watson will sure be sore repeated kitsong  the ranger smiled and rode on he was a native of the west a plainfeatured deliberate young fellow of thirty who sat his horse with the easy grace which marks the trailer while abe kitsong tall gaunt longbearded and sourfaced was a southerner a cattleman of bad reputation with the alfalfa farmers farther down the valley he was a notable survivor of the good old days of the range and openly resented the punkin rollers who were rapidly fencing all the lower meadows watson was his brotherinlaw and together they had controlled the upper waters of the shellfish making a last stand in the secluded valley  the claim in question lay in a lonely spot at the very head of a narrow cañon and included a lovely little meadow close clasped by a corner of the dark robe of forest which was hanscoms especial care and which he guarded with singlehearted devotion the new cabin stood back from the trail and so for several weeks its owner went about his work in undisturbed tranquillity occasionally he drove to town for supplies but it soon appeared that he was not seeking acquaintance with his neighbors and in one way or another he contrived to defend himself from visitors  he was a short man graymustached and somber but his supposed wife who dressed in the rudest fashion and covered her head face and shoulders with an oldfashioned gingham sunbonnet was reported by watson her nearest neighbor to be much younger than her husband and comely i came on her the other day without that dinged bunnit said he and shes not so badlooking but shes shy couldnt lay a hand on her  in spite of this report for a month or two the men of the region always alert on the subject of women manifested but a moderate interest in the stranger they hadnt much confidence in watsons judgment anyhow and besides the woman carried herself so ungracefully and dressed so plainly that even the saloondoor loafers cast contemptuous glances upon her as she hurried by the postoffice on her way to the grocery in fact they put the laugh on watson and he would have been buying the drinks for them all had not the postmaster come to his rescue  illustration the woman carried herself so ungracefully and dressed so plainly that even the saloondoor loafers cast contemptuous glances upon her  eds right said he shes younger than she looks and has a right nice voice  is it true that her letters come addressed in two different names queried one of the men  no her letters come addressed miss helen mclaren what that means i cant say but the old man spoke of her as his daughter  i dont take much stock in that daughters business said one of the loafers theres a mouse in the meal somewhere  thereafter this drab and silent female by her very wish to be left alone became each day a more absorbing topic of conversation she was not what she seemedthis was the verdict as for kauffman he was considered a man who would bear watching and when finally being pressed to it he volunteered the information that he was in the hills for his daughters health many sneered  came away between two days ill bet said watson and as fer the woman why should her mail come under another name from his does that look like she was his daughter  she may be a stepdaughter suggested the postmaster  more likely shes another mans wife retorted watson  during the early autumn kauffman published the fact that he had registered a brand and from time to time those who happened to ride up the valley brought back a report that he owned a small but growing herd of cattle watson did not hesitate to say that he had never been able to find where the newcomer bought his stockand in those days no man was quite free from the necessity of exhibiting a bill of sale  however the people of the town paid small attention to this slur for watson himself was not entirely above suspicion he was considered a dangerous character once or twice he had been forced at the mouth of a rifle to surrender calves that had as he explained got mixed with his herd in truth he was nearly always in controversy with some one  kauffman dont look to me like an enterprising roper hanscom reported to his supervisor and as for his wife or daughter or whatever she is ive never seen anything out of the way about her she attends strictly to her own affairs furthermore he added watson as you know is under woolfoot surveillance right now by the cattle raisers syndicate and i wouldnt take his word under oath  the supervisor shared the rangers view and smiled at the pot calling the kettle black and so matters drifted along till in one way or another the kitsongs had set the whole upper valley against the hermits and watson in his cups repeatedly said that fellow has no business in there thats my grass he stole it from me  his resentment grew with repetition of his fancied grievance and at last he made threats hes an outlaw thats what he isand as for that woman well im going up there some fine day and snatch the bunnit off her and see what she really looks like  better go slow urged one of his friends that chap looks to me like one of the old guard he may have something to say about your doings with his daughter  watson only grinned he aint in no position to object if she dontand i guess i can manage her he ended with drunken swagger  occasionally hanscom met the woman on the trail or in the town and always spoke in friendly greeting the first time he spoke she lifted her head like a scared animal but after that she responded with a low howdy sir and her voice coming from the shadow of her ugly headgear was unexpectedly clear and sweet although he was never able to see her face something in her bearing and especially in her accent pleased and stirred him  without any special basis for it he felt sorry for her and resolved to help her and when one day he met her on the street and asked in friendly fashion how are you today she looked up at him and replied very well thank you sir and he caught a glimpse of a lovely chin and a sad and sensitive mouth  shes had more than her share of trouble that girl has he thought as he passed on  thereafter a growing desire to see her eyes to hear her voice troubled him  kauffman stopped him on the road next day and said i am bavarian and in my country we respect the laws of the forest i honor your office and shall regard all your regulations i have a few cattle which will naturally graze in the forest i wish to take out a permit for them  to this hanscom cordially replied sure thing thats what im here for and if you want any timber for your corrals just let me know and ill fix you out  kauffman thanked him and rode on  as the weeks passed hanscom became more and more conscious of the strange womans presence in the valley he gave in truth a great deal of thought to her and twice deliberately rode around that way in the hope of catching sight of her he could not rid himself of a feeling of pity the vision of her delicately modeled chin and the sorrowful droop in the line of her lips never left him he wishedand the desire was more than curiosityto meet her eyes to get the full view of her face  gradually she came to the exchange of a few words with him and always he felt her dark eyes glowing in the shadow of her headdress and they seemed quite as sad as her lips she no longer appeared afraid of him and yet she did not express a willingness for closer contact that she was very lonely he was sure for she had few acquaintances in the town and no visitors at all no one had ever been able to penetrate to the interior of the cabin in which she secluded herself but it was reported that she spent her time in the garden and that she had many strange flowers and plants growing there but of this hanscom had only the most diffused hearsay  watsons thought concerning the lonely woman was not merely dishonoringit was ruthless and when he met her as he occasionally did he called to her in a voice which contained something at once savage and familiar but he could never arrest her hurrying step once when he planted himself directly in her way she bent her head and slipped around him like a partridge feeling in him the enmity that knows no pity and no remorse  his baseness was well known to the town for he was one of those whose tongues reveal their degradation as soon as they are intoxicated he boasted of his exploits in the city and of the women he had brought to his ranch and these revelations made him the hero of a certain type of loafer his cabin was recognized as a center of disorder and was generally avoided by decent people  as he felt his dominion slipping away as he saw the big farmers come in down below him and recognized the rule of the federal government above him he grew reckless in his roping and branding he had not been convicted of dishonesty but it was pretty certain that he was a rustler in fact the whole shellfish community was under suspicion as the ranger visited these cabins and came upon five or six big hulking sullen men he was glad that he had little business with them they were in a chronic state of discontent with the world and especially with the forest service  with the almost maniacal persistency of the drunkard watson now fixed his mind upon the mysterious woman at the head of the valley he talked of no one else and his vile words came to hanscoms ears watsons cronies considered his failure to secure even a word with the woman a great joke and reported that he had found the door locked when he finally followed her home  hanscom indignant yet helpless to interfere heard with pleasure that the old man had threatened watson with bodily harm if he came to his door again that with all his effrontery watson had not yet been able to set his foot across the threshold and that he had gone to denver on business hell forget that poor woman maybe he said  thereafter he thought of her as freed from persecution although he knew that others of the valley held her in view as legitimate quarry  his was a fine serious though uncultivated nature a genuine lover of the wilderness he had reached that time of life when love is cleansed of its devastating selfishness and his feeling for the lonely woman of the shellfish held something akin to great poetry  his own solitary vigorous employment his constant warfare with wind and cloud had made him a little of the seer and something of the poet woman to him was not merely the female of his species she was a marvelous being created for the spiritual as well as for the material need of man  in this spirit he had lived and being but a plain rather shy farmer and prospector he had come to his thirtieth year with very little love history to his credit or discredit he was therefore peculiarly susceptible to that sweet disease of the imagination which is able to transform the rudest woman into beauty in this case the very slightness of the material on which his mind dwelt set the wings of his fancy free he brooded and dreamed as he rode his trail as well as when he sat beside his rude fireplace at night listening to the wind in the high firs in all his thought he was honorable   ii  one day in early autumn as he was returning to his station hanscom met abe kitsong just below watsons cabin riding furiously down the hill drawing his horse to a stand the rancher called out  just the man i need  whats the trouble  ed watsons killed  hanscom stared incredulously no wherewhen  last night i reckon you see ed had promised to ride down to my place this morning and help me to raise a shed and when he didnt come i got oneasy and went up to see what kept him and the first thing i saw when i opened the door was him layin on the floor shot through and through here his voice grew savage and by that kauffman woman  hold on abe called the ranger sharply go slow on that talk what makes you think that womanany womandid it  well it jest happened that ed had spilled some flour along the porch and in prowling around the window that woman jest naturally walked over it you can see the print of her shoes where she stopped under the window youve got to go right up thereyoure a goverment officerand stand guard over the body while i ride down the valley and get the coroner and the sheriff  all right consider it done said hanscom and kitsong continued his frenzied pace down the valley  the ranger his blood quickening in spite of himself spurred his horse into a gallop and was soon in sight of the shellfish ranch where watson had lived for several years in unkempt unsavory bachelorhood for the reason that his wife had long since quit him and only the roughest cowboys would tolerate the disorder of his bed and board privately hanscom was not much surprised at the rustlers death although the manner of it seemed unnecessarily savage for he was quarrelsome and vindictive  the valley had not yet emerged from the violent era and every man in the hills went armed the cañons round about were still safe harbors for lonesome men and the herders of opposition sheep and cattle outfits were in bitter competition for free grass watson had many enemies and yet it was hard to think that any one of them would shoot him at night through an open window for such a deed was contrary to all the established rules of the border  upon drawing rein at the porch the ranger first examined the footsteps in the flour and under the window and was forced to acknowledge that all signs pointed to a woman assailant the marks indicated small pointed highheeled shoes and it was plain that the prowler had spent some time peering in through the glass  for fear that the wind might spring up and destroy the evidence hanscom measured the prints carefully putting down the precise size and shape in his notebook he studied the position of the dead man who lay as he had fallen from his chair and made note of the fact that a halfemptied bottle of liquor stood on the table the condition of the room though disgusting was not very different from its customary disorder  oppressed by the horror of the scene the ranger withdrew a little way lit his pipe and sat down to meditate on the crime  i cant believe a woman did it he said and yet he realized that under certain conditions women can be more savage than men if watson had been shot on a womans premises it wouldnt seem so much like slaughter but to kill a man at night in his own cabin is tolerably fierce  that the sad lonely woman in the ranch above had anything to do with this he would not for a moment entertain  he turned away from the problem at last and dozed in the sunshine calculating with detailed knowledge of the trail and its difficulties just how long it would take kitsong to reach the coroner and start back up the hill  it was nearly four oclock when he heard the feet of horses on the bridge below the ranch and a few minutes later kitsong came into view heading a motley procession of horsemen and vehicles it was evident that he had notified all his neighbors along the road for they came riding in as if to a feast their eyes alight with joyous interest  the coroner a young doctor named carmody took charge of the case with brisk important pomp seconded by sheriff throop a heavy man with wrinkled careworn brow who seemed burdened with a sense of personal responsibility for watsons death he was all for riding up and instantly apprehending the kauffmans but the coroner insisted on looking the ground over first  you study the case from the outside said he and ill size it up from the inside  as the dead man had neither wife nor children to weep for him mrs kitsong his sister a tall gaunt woman assumed the rôle of chief mourner while abe went round uttering threats about stringing the kauffmans up till the sheriff a good man and faithful officer jealous of his authority interfered  none of that lynching talk therell be no rope work in this county while i am sheriff he said with noticeable decision  in a few moments carmody having finished his examination of the body said to the sheriff go after this man kauffman and his daughter it seems theyve had some trouble with watson and i want to interrogate them search the cabin for weapons and bring all the womans shoes he added and while the sheriff rode away up the trail on his sinister errand hanscom with sinking heart remained to testify at the inquest  a coroner in the mountains seven thousand feet above the sealevel and twenty miles from a courthouse must be excused for slight informalities in procedure and carmody confidentially said to the ranger  i dont expect for a minute the sheriff will find the kauffmans if they did for watson they undoubtedly pulled out hotfoot but weve got to make a bluff at getting em anyway  to this the ranger made no reply but a sense of loss filled his heart  as soon as the jury was selected the condition of the body was noted and abe kitsong as witness was in the midst of his testimony and the shadows of the great peaks behind the cabin had brought the evening chill into the air when the sheriff reappeared escorting a mountain wagon in which kauffman and his daughter were seated  hanscom stared in mingled surprise and dismaysurprise that they had not fled and dismay at the girls predicamentand muttered now what do you think of that it takes an eastern tenderfoot to kill a man and then go quietly home and wait for results  kauffman glared about him defiantly but the face of the girl remained hidden in her bonnet only her bowed head indicated the despair into which she had fallen  with a deep sense of pity and regret hanscom went to meet her dont be scared he said ill see that you have a square deal  she peered down into his face as he spoke but made no reply and he conceived of her as one burdened with grief and shame and ready for any fate  the sheriff his face showing an agony of perplexity turned over to the coroner all the weapons and other plunder he had brought from the house and querulously announced that he couldnt find a shotgun anywhere around and only one small rifle and there wasnt a pointed shoe on the place he added forcibly  that proves nothing insisted abe theyve had time to hide em or burn em  well bring them both over here and lets get to business said the coroner its getting late  as hanscom assisted the accused woman from the wagon he detected youth and vigor in her arm dont be afraid he repeated i will see that you are treated right  her hand clung to his for an instant as she considered the throng of hostile spectators for she apprehended their hatred quite as clearly as she perceived the chivalrous care of the ranger and she kept close to his side as he led the way to the cabin  kauffman was at once taken indoors but the young woman under guard of a deputy was given a seat on the corner of the porch just out of hearing of the coroners voice  carmody who carried all the authority if not all the forms of a court into his interrogation sharply questioned the old man who said that his name was frederick kauffman and that he was a teacher of music  i was born near munich he added but i have lived in this country forty years mostly in cincinnati this young lady is my stepdaughter it is for her health that i came here she has been very ill  carmody nodded to the sheriff and throop with a deep sigh and most dramatic gesture lifted the shroud which concealed the dead man approach the body commanded the coroner and the jurors watched every motion with wide excited eyes as though expecting involuntary signs of guilt but kauffman calmly gazed upon the still face beneath him  do you recognize this body demanded the coroner  i do said kauffman  when did you see him last  oh two or three days ago answered kauffman  you may be seated said the coroner  under close interrogation the old man admitted that he had had some trouble with watson once i forced him to leave my premises he said he was drunk and insulting  did you employ a weapon  only this here he lifted a sturdy fistbut it was sufficient i have not forgotten my gymnastic training  prompted by kitsong who had assumed something of the attitude of a prosecuting attorney the coroner asked has your daughter ever been in an asylum  although this question plainly disturbed him kauffman replied after a moments hesitation no sir  where were you last night  at home  was your daughter there  yes  all the evening  yes sir  are you sure she did not leave the house  perfectly sure  the coroner took up a small rifle which the sheriff had leaned against the wall is this your rifle  the old man examined it i think soyes sir  have you another  no sir  that is all for the present mr kauffman sheriff ask miss kauffman to come in  as the woman without the disfiguring headdress which she habitually wore stepped to the center of the room a murmur of surprise arose from the jury and the few spectators who were permitted to squat along the walls she not only appeared young she was comely her face though darkly tanned was attractive and her hair combed rigidly away from her brow was abundant and glossy the line of her lips was firm yet sweet and her long straight nose denoted the excellence of her strain even her hands reddened and calloused by labor were well kept and shapely but it was through her bearing that she appealed most strongly to the ranger and the coroner she was very far from being humble on the contrary the glance which she directed toward carmody was remote and haughty she did not appear to notice the still sheeted shape in the corner  in answer to a query she informed the jury that her name was helen mclaren that she was a native of kentucky and twentysix years of age i came to the mountains for my health she said curtly  you mean your mental health queried the coroner  yes i wanted to get away from the city for a while i needed rest and a change  the coroner deeply impressed with her dignity and grace leaned back in his chair and said now before i ask the next question miss mclaren i want to tell you that what you say in answer may be used against you in court and according to law you need not incriminate yourself you understand that do you  yes sir i think i do  very well now one thing more it is usual in cases of this kind to have some one to represent you and if you wish mr hanscom the forest ranger will act for you  the glance she turned on hanscom confused him but he said im no lawyer but ill do my best to see that you are treated fairly  she thanked him with a trustful word and the coroner began  you have had a great sorrow recently i believe  yes sir  a very bitter bereavement  yes sir  have you any near relatives living  yes sir a sister and several aunts and uncles  do they know where you are  no sirat least not precisely they know i am in the mountains  will you give me the names and addresses of these relatives  i would rather not if you please i do not care to involve them in any troubles of mine  well i wont insist on that at this point but i would like to understand whether if i require it you will furnish this information  certainly only i would rather not disturb them unnecessarily  her manner not only profoundly affected the coroner it soon softened the prejudices of the jury although four of them were immediate friends and neighbors of kitsong they all were manifestly astonished at the candor of her replies  the coroner himself rose and solemnly disclosed the corpse do you recognize this man he asked  she paled and shrank from the face which was brutal even in death but answered quietly i do  did you know him when alive  i did not  this answer surprised both the coroner and his jury  your stepfather testified that he came to your home  so he did but i refused to see him my stepfather met him outside the door i never spoke to him in my life  you may be seated again said carmody and after a slight pause proceeded why did you dislike the deceased was he disrespectful to you  he was  in what way  she hesitated and flushed he wrote to me  more than once  yes several times  have you those letters  no i destroyed them  could you give me an idea of those letters  hanscom interposed she cant do that mr coroner it is evident that they were vile  the coroner passed this point you say he called at your househow many times  two or three i think  was your father at home each time  once i was alone  did you meet watson then  no i saw him coming in the gate and i went inside and locked the door  what happened then  he beat on the door and when i failed to reply he went away  was he drunk  he might have been he seemed more like an insane man to me  kitsong broke in i dont believe all this  when was that  night before last at about this time or a little earlier  was he on foot  no he came on horseback  did he ride away on horseback  yes though he could scarcely mount i was surprised to see how well he was able to manage his horse  did you tell your father of this  no  why not  she hesitated he would have been veryvery much disturbed  you mean he would have been angry  yes  the coroner suddenly turned the current of his inquiry do you always wear shoes such as you now have on  every eye in the room was directed toward her feet which were shod in broadtoed lowheeled shoes  she was visibly embarrassed but she answered composedly i doyes sir in fact i go barefoot a great deal while working in the garden the doctor ordered it and besides the ordinary highheeled shoes seem foolish up here in the mountains  will you be kind enough to remove your shoe i would like to take some measurements from it  she flushed slightly but bent quickly untied the laces and removed her right shoe  the coroner took it please remain where you are miss mclaren then to the jury who appreciated fully the importance of the moment we will now compare this shoe with the footprints  dont be disturbed miss whispered the ranger i know the size and shape of those footprints  the sheriff cleared the way to the porch where the little patch of flour had been preserved by ropes stretched from post to post and the outside crowd pressing closer watched breathlessly while the jury bent together and compared the shoes and the marks  it required but a few moments examination to demonstrate that the soles of the accused womans shoes were larger and broader and entirely different in every way  she may have worn another shoe kitsong put in  of course well find that out retorted the coroner  as they returned to the room hanscom said to the witness now be very careful what you reply take plenty of time before you answer if you are in doubt say nothing  in the sympathy of his glance her haughty pose relaxed and her eyes softened you are very kind she said  i dont know a thing about law he added apologetically but i may be able to help you  the coroner now told the jury that mr hanscom as representing the witness at the hearing would be allowed to ask any questions he pleased before the end of the hearing  but i must insist upon taking measurements of your bare feet miss mclaren  the jury grinned and the girl flushed with anger but at a word from the ranger yielded and drew off her stocking  hanscom while assisting the coroner in measurements said im sorry miss but it is necessary  the examination proved that her bare foot was nearly two sizes wider and at least one size longer than the footprints in the flour furthermore it needed but a glance for the jury as well as the doctor to prove that she had been going barefoot as she claimed for many weeks her foot was brown and her toes showed nothing of the close confinement of a pointed shoe  carmody returning to his seat conferred with the jury designating the difference between the telltale marks on the porch and the feet of the witness and hanscom argued that the woman who made the telltale tracks must have been small  miss mclaren could not possibly wear the shoe that left those marks in the flour he said  we are on the wrong trail i guess one of the jury frankly stated i dont believe that girl was ever on the place if she or the old man had been guilty they wouldnt have been hanging around home this morning theyd have dusted out last night  and to this one other agreed four remained silent  the ranger seized on these admissions there is nothing absolutely nothing to connect the tracks in the flour with the person who did the shooting it may have been done by another visitor at another time  well decided the coroner its getting dark and not much chance for hotel accommodations up here so i guess wed better adjourn this hearing he turned to helen thats all miss mclaren  as hanscom handed back her shoe he said i hope you wont worry another minute about this business miss the jury is certain to report for persons unknown  im very grateful for your kindness she answered feelingly i felt so utterly helpless when i came into the room  youve won even the jurys sympathy he said  nevertheless as she left the room he followed closely for the kitsongs who had been denied admittance were openly voicing their dissatisfaction with the coroners verdict she ought to be held and the old man ought to be held they insisted  one or the other of them shot watson declared abe to carmody no matter if the girls foot doesnt just exactly fit the tracks she could jam her foot into a narrow shoe if she tried couldnt she if you let that girl pull the wool over your eyes like that you aint fit to be coroner  carmodys answer was to the point the thing for your crowd to do is to quit chewing the rag and get this body down the valley and decently buried i cant stand around here all night listening to amateur attorneys for the prosecution  vamose called the sheriff and in ten minutes the crowd was clattering down the trail in haste to reach food and shelter leaving the kauffmans to take their homeward way alone  hanscom helped the girl into the wagon and rode away up the valley close behind her his mind filled with the singular story which she had so briefly yet powerfully suggested that she was a lady masquerading in rough clothing was evident even before she spoke and the picture she made sitting in the midst of that throng of rough men and slatternly women had profoundly stirred his imagination he longed to know more of her history and it was the hope of still further serving her which led him to ride up alongside the cart and say  heres where my trail forks but i shall be very glad to go up and camp down at your gate if you feel at all nervous about staying alone  kauffman who had regained his composure answered we have no fear but we are deeply grateful for your offer  the ranger dismounted and approached the wagon as if to bring himself within reach and the girl looking down at him from her seat with penetrating glance said  yes we are greatly indebted to you  if i can be of any further help at any time the young forester said a little hesitatingly i hope you will let me know his voice so sincere his manner so unassuming softened her strained mood  you are very kind she answered with gentle dignity but the worst of this trial is over for us i cannot conceive that any one will trouble us further but it is good to know that we have in you a friend the valley has always resented us  he was not yet satisfied i wish youd let me drop around tomorrow or next day and see how you all are it would make me feel a whole lot better  the glance which she gave him puzzled and at the moment daunted him she seemed to search his soul as if in fear of finding something unworthy there at last she gave him her strong brown hand  come when you can we shall always be glad to see you   iii  hanscom rode away up the trail in a singularly exalted mood the girl with whom he had been so suddenly related in a coroners inquest filled his mind to the exclusion of all else he saw nothing heard nothing of the forest helens sadness her composure her aloofness engaged his imagination  shes been sick and shes been in trouble he decided shes out here to get away from somebody or something  over and over again he recounted her words lingering especially upon the sweetness of her voice and the searching quality of that last look she had given him he unsaddled his horse mechanically and went about his cabin duties with listless deftness  lonely cut off from even the most formal intercourse with marriageable maidens he was naturally extremely susceptible to the charm of this cultivated woman the memory of her handsome foot the clasp of her strong fingers the lines of her lovely neckall conspired to dull his appetite for food and keep him smoking and musing far into the night and these visions were with him as he arose the next morning to resume his daily duties in the forest they did not interrupt his work they lightened it  as the hours went by the desire to see her grew more and more intense and at last a couple of days later while riding the trail not far above the kauffman ranch he decided that it was a part of his days work to scout round that way and inquire how they were all getting on he was strengthened in this determination by the reports which came to him from the ranchers he met no other clue had developed and the kitsongs highly incensed at the action of the jury not only insisted that the girl was the murderess but that the doctor was shielding her for reasons of his ownand several went so far as to declare their intention to see that the kauffmans got their just punishment  it is true the jury admitted that they were divided in their opinion but that the coroners attitude brought about a change of sentiment the fact that the woman didnt wear and couldnt wear so small a shoe was at the moment convincing it was only later when the kitsong sympathizers began to argue that they hesitated  mrs abe kitsong was especially bitter and it was her influence which brought out an expression of settled purpose to punish which led to the rangers decision to go over and see if the old german and his daughter were undisturbed  as he turned in at the kauffman gate he caught a glimpse of the girl hoeing in the garden wearing the same blue sunbonnet in which she had appeared at the inquest she was deeply engaged with her potatoes and did not observe him till upon hearing the clatter of his horses hoofs upon the bridge she looked up with a start seeing in him a possible enemy she dropped her hoe and ran toward the house like a hare seeking covert as she reached the corner of the kitchen she turned fixed a steady backward look upon him and disappeared  hanscom smiled he had seen other women hurrying to change their workaday dress for visitors and he imagined helen hastily putting on her shoes and smoothing her hair he was distinctly less in awe of her by reason of this girlish actionit made her seem more of his own roughandready world and he dismounted at her door almost at his ease although his heart had been pounding furiously as he rode down the ridge  she surprised him by reappearing in her workinggown but shod with strong lowheeled shoes good evening mr forest ranger she said smiling yet perturbed i didnt recognize you at first wont you picket and come in she said this in the tone of one consciously assuming the vernacular  thank you i believe i will he replied with candid heartiness i was riding one of my lower trails today so i just thought id drop down and see how you were all coming on  we are quite well thank you daddys away just this minute one of our cows hid her calf in the hills and hes trying to find it wont you put your horse in the corral  no hes all right hes a good deal like meworks better on a small ration a standing siesta will just about do him  a gleam of humor shone in her eyes neither of you pear to be suffering from lack of food but come in please and have a seat  he followed her into the cabin keenly alive to the changes in her dress as well as in her manner she wore her hair plainly parted as at the hearing but it lay much lower about her brow and rippled charmingly she stood perfectly erect also and moved with a fine stride and the lines of her shoulders even under a rough gray shirtwaist were strong and graceful though not skilled in analyzing a womans outfit the ranger divined that she wore no corset for the flex of her powerful waist was like that of a young man  her speech was noticeably southern in accent as if it were a part of her masquerade but she brought him a chair and confronted him without confusion in this calm dignity he read something entirely flattering to himself  evidently she considers me a friend as well as an officer he reasoned  i hope you are a little hungry she said id like to have you break bread in our house you were mighty kind to us the other day  oh im hungry he admitted meeting her hospitality halfway seems like im always hungry you see i cook my own grub and my bill of fare isnt what youd call extensive and besides a mans cooking never relishes the way a womans does anyhow  ill see what i can find for you she said and hurried out  while waiting he studied the room in which he sat with keenest interest it was rather larger than the usual livingroom in a mountain home but it had not much else to distinguish it the furniture was of the kind to be purchased in the nearby town and the walls were roughly ceiled with cypress boards but a few magazines some books on a rude shelf a fiddlebox under the table and a guitar hanging on a nail gave evidence of refinement and taste and spoke to him of pleasures which he had only known afar the guitar especially engaged his attention i wonder if she sings he asked himself  musing thus in silence he heard her moving about the kitchen with rapid tread and when she came in a few minutes later bearing a tray he thought her beautifulso changed was her expression  i didnt wait for the coffee she smilingly explained you said you were hungry and so i have brought in a little snack the coffee will be ready soon  snack he exclaimed lady this is a feast and as she put the tray down beside him he added this puts me right back in aunt marys house at circle bend nebraska i dont rightly feel fit to sit opposite a spread like that  she seemed genuinely amused by his extravagance its nothing but a little cold chicken and some light bread i made the bread yesterday and the raspberry jam is mine also  illustration the author and a forest ranger  its angels food to me he retorted as he eyed the dainty napkins and the silver spoons and forks you dont know what this means to a man who lives on rice and prunes and kittle bread i have a guilty feeling i do indeed seems like im getting all this thanksgiving treat under false pretenses perhaps you think im an english nobleman in disguise but im notim just a plain dub of a forest ranger ninety dollars a month and board myself  she laughed at his disclaimer and yet under her momentary lightness he still perceived something of the strong current of bitter sadness which had so profoundly moved him at the inquest and which still remained unexplained therefore he hesitated about referring to the watson case  as he ate she stood to serve him but not with the air of a servingmaid on the contrary though her face was bronzed by the winds and her hands calloused by spade and hoe there was little of the rustic in her action her blouse cut sailor fashion at the throat displayed a lovely neck also burned by the sun and she carried herself with the grace of an athlete her trust and confidence in her visitor became more evident each moment  no she said in answer to his question we hardly ever have visitors now and then some cowboy rides past but you are almost the only caller we have ever had the settlers in the valley do not attract me  i should think youd get lonesome  she looked away and a sterner older expression came into her face i do sometimes she admitted then she bravely faced him but my health is so much betterit was quite broken when i camethat i have every reason to be thankful after all health is happiness i ought to be perfectly content and i am when i think how miserable i once was  health is cheap with me he smilingly replied but i get so lonesome sometimes that i pretty near quit and go out do you intend to stay here all winter  we expect to  he thought it well to warn her the snow falls deep in this valleyterribly deep  she showed some uneasiness i know it but im going to learn to snowshoe  i wish youd let me come over and teach you  can you snowshoe i thought rangers always rode horseback  he smiled youve been reading the opposition press a forest ranger who is on the job has got to snowshoe like a canuck or else go down the valley after the snow begins to fall it was five feet deep around my cabin last year i hate to think of your being here alone if one of you should be sick it would betough unless you absolutely have to stay here i advise you to go down the creek  perhaps our neighbors and not the snow will drive us out she replied theyve already served notice  he looked startled what do you mean by that  without answering she went to the bookshelf and took down a folded sheet of paper here is a letter i got yesterday she explained as she handed it to him  it was a rudely penciled note but entirely plain in its message spite of what the coroner found most folks believe you killed ed watson it began abruptly some of us dont blame you much others do and they say no matter what the jury reports youve got to go i dont like to see a woman abused so youd better take warning and pull out do it right away it was signed a friend  the ranger read this through twice before he spoke did this come through the mail  yesaddressed to me  he pretended to make light of it i wouldnt spend much time over that its only some smart alecks practical joke  i dont think so she soberly replied it reads to me like a sincere warningfrom a woman i havent shown it to daddy yet and i dont know whether to do so or not i thought of going over to see you but i was not sure of the way im glad providence sent you round today for i am uncertain about what to do  im a little uneasy about that warning myself he confessed after a pause i hear the kitsong gang is bitterly dissatisfied with the result of the inquest thus far they still insist on connecting you in some way with the shooting fact is i came over today to see if they had made any new move  all the lightness had gone out of his face now and in the girls eyes the shadow deepened as she said  it seems to me that i have drawn more than my share of trouble i came out here hoping to find a sanctuary and i seem to have fallen into a den of wolves these people would hang me if they could i dont understand their hate of us they resent our being here sometimes i feel as if they were only trying to drive us from our little ranch  of course all this talk of violence is nonsense he vigorously went on they can make you a whole lot of discomfort but you are in no danger  her glance was again remote as she said i cannot take that murder case seriously it all seems a thousand miles away from me now and yet i am afraid for daddys sake why connect me with it is there no other woman to accuse do you suppose a woman did the shooting i dont  no i think the footprints were accidental i figure the killing was done by some man who had it in for watson he was always rowing with his help and there are two or three mexicans who have threatened to get him at the same time i dont like this letter theyre a tough lot in this valley he mused a moment yes i guess youd better plan to go  her gaze wandered i hate to leave my garden and my flowers she said sadly after all ive had some very peaceful hours in this nook her face brightened she became the genial hostess again if you have finished your lunch i wish you would come out and see my crops  he followed her gladly and their talk again became cheerfully impersonal truly she had done wonders in a small space and in a short time flowerbeds glowed beside the towering rocks small ditches supplied the plants with water and from the rich red soil luscious vegetables and fragrant blooms were springing  all animation now she pointed out her victories this is all my work she explained proudly daddy isnt much of a hand with the spade or the hoe therefore i leave the riding and the cows to him i love to paddle in the mud and it has done me a great deal of good  what will you do with all this truck  daddy intends to market it in town  hes away a good deal i take it  yes im alone often all day but hes always home before dark  he voiced his concern i dont like to think of your being alone even in the daytime he spoke as one who had been swiftly advanced from stranger to trusted friend ill tell you what ill do he continued as if moved by a sudden thought ill go into camp across the creek for tonight and then if anything goes wrong ill be within call  oh no dont think of doing that you must not neglect your duties daddy is a pretty good marksman and i have learned to handle a rifle and besideshere her tone became ironicin the chivalrous west a woman need not fear  there is a whole lot of hot air about that western chivalry talk he retorted bad men are just as bad here as anywhere and theyre particularly bad on the shellfish but anyhow youll call on me if i can be of any use wont you  i certainly shall do so she responded heartily and there was confidence and liking in her eyes as well as in the grip of her hand as she said goodby  when in the saddle and ready to ride away he called to her you wont mind my coming over here again on saturday will you  no indeed only it is so far  oh the ride is nothing i dont like to think of your being here alone  im not afraid but we shall be glad to see you just the same  and in appreciation of her smile he removed his hat and rode away with bared head  the young ranger was highly exalted by this visit and he was also greatly disturbed for the more he thought of that warning letter and the conditions which gave rise to it the more menacing it became it was all of a piece with the tone and character of the shellfish gang for this remote valley had long borne an evil reputation and watson and kitsong had been its dominating spirits for more than twenty years and deeply resented kauffmans settlement in the cañon  it would be just like old kit to take the law into his own hands the ranger admitted to himself and the writing in that letter looked to me like mrs abe kitsongs  instead of going up to the heart lake sheepcamp as he had planned to do he turned back to his station moved by a desire to keep as near the girl as his duties would permit for the next few days id better be within call he decided they may decide to arrest herand if they do shell need me  he went about his evening meal like a man under the influence of a drug and when he sat down to his typewriter his mind was so completely filled with visions of his entrancing neighbor that he could not successfully cast up a column of figures he lit his pipe for a diversion but under the spell of the smoke his recollection of just how she looked how she spoke how she smiled that sad halflighting of her face set all his nerves atingle he grew restless  whats the matter with me he asked himself sharply but dared not answer his own question he knew his malady his unrest was that of the lover thereafter he gave himself up to the quiet joy of reviewing each word she had uttered and in doing so came to the conclusion that she was in the mountains not so much for the cure of her lungs or throat as to heal the hurt of some injustice what it was he could not imagine but he believed that she was getting over it as she gets over it shell find life on the shellfish intolerable and shell go away he reasoned and the thought of her going made his country lonesome empty and of no account  i wish she wouldnt go about barefoot he added with a tinge of jealousy and she mustnt let any of the shellfish gang see her in that dress he was a little comforted by remembering her sudden flight when she first perceived him coming across the bridge and he wondered whether the trustful attitude she afterward assumed was due entirely to the fact that he was a federal officerhe hoped not some part of it sprang he knew from a liking for him  the wilderness was no place for a woman it was all well enough for a vacation but to ask any woman to live in a little cabin miles from another woman miles from a doctor was out of the question he began to perceive that there were disabilities in the life of a forester his world was suddenly disorganized life became complex in its bearings and he felt the stirrings of new ambitions new ideals civilization took on a charm which it had not hitherto possessed  he was awakened at dawn the following morning by the smell of burning pinea smell that summons the ranger as a drum arouses a soldier rushing out of doors he soon located the fire it was off the forest and to the southeast but as any blaze within sight demanded investigation he put a pot of coffee on the fire and swiftly roped and saddled one of his horses in thirty minutes he was riding up the side of a high hill which lay between the station and otter creek a branch of the shellfish at the mouth of which some miles below stood kitsongs ranch  it was not yet light the smoke was widely diffused and the precise location of the blaze could not be determined but it appeared to be on the shellfish side of the ridge just below watsons pasture hence he kept due south over the second height which divided the two creeks it was daylight when he reached the second hogback and the smoke of the fire was diminishing but he thought it best to ride on to renew his warning against the use of fire till the autumn rains set in and he had in mind also a plan to secure from mrs kitsong a specimen of her handwriting and to pick up whatever he could in the way of gossip concerning the feeling against the kauffmans  he was still some miles from the ranch and crossing a deep ravine when he heard the sound of a rifle far above him halting he listened intently another shot rang out nearer and to the south and a moment later the faint reports of a revolver this sent a wave of excitement through his blood a rifleshot might mean only a poacher a volley of revolvershots meant battle  reining his cayuse sharply to the right and giving him the spur he sent him on a swift zigzagging scramble up the smooth slope a third rifleshot echoed from the cliff and was answered by a smaller weapon much nearer and with his hair almost on end with excitement he reached the summit which commanded the whole valley of the otter just in time to witness the most astounding drama he had ever known  down the rough logging road from the west a team of horses was wildly galloping pursued at a distance by several horsemen whose weapons spitting smoke at intervals gave proof of their murderous intent in the clattering tossing wagon a man was kneeling rifle in hand while a woman standing recklessly erect urged the flying horses to greater speed nothing could have been more desperate more furious than this running battle  my god its the kauffman team he exclaimed and with a shrill shout snatched his revolver from its holster and fired into the air with intent to announce his presence to the assailing horsemen even as he did so he saw one of the faroff pursuing ruffians draw his horse to a stand and take deliberate aim over his saddle at the flying wagon the off pony dropped in his traces and the vehicle swinging from the road struck a boulder and sent the man hurtling over the side but the girl crouching low kept her place almost before the wheels had ceased to revolve she caught up the rifle which her companion had dropped and sent a shot of defiance toward her pursuers  brave girl shouted hanscom for he recognized helen hold the fort but his voice husky with excitement failed to reach her  she heard the sound of his revolver however and believing him to be only another of the attacking party took aim at him and fired the bullet from her rifle flew so near his head that he heard its song  again her rifle flashed this time at the man above her and again the forester shouted her name in the midst of the vast and splendid landscape she seemed a minute brave insect defending itself against invading beasts her pursuers recognizing the rangers horse wheeled their ponies and disappeared in the forest  hanscom spurred his horse straight toward the girl calling her name but even then she failed to recognize him till lifting his hat from his head he desperately shouted  dont shoot girldont shoot its hanscomthe ranger  she knew him at last and dropping her rifle to the ground awaited his approach in silence  as he leaped from his horse and ran toward her she lifted her hands to him in a gesture of relief and welcome and he took her in his arms as naturally as he would have taken a frightened child to his breast  great god whats the meaning of all this he asked are you hurt  she was white but calm no but daddy is and they hastened to where the old man lay crumpled up beside a rock  hanscom knelt to the fallen man and examined him carefully hes alivehe isnt wounded he said hes only stunned wait ill bring some water  running down to the bank he filled his hat from the flood and with this soon brought the bruised and sadly bewildered rancher back to consciousness  upon realizing who his rescuer was kauffmans eyes misted with gratitude my friend i thank god for you we were trying to find you we were on our way to claim your protection we lost our road and then these bandits assaulted us  the girl pieced out this explanation she told of being awakened in the night by a horses hoofs clattering across the bridge some one rode rapidly up to the door dismounted pushed a letter in over the threshold and rode away i rose and got the letter she said it warned us that trouble was already on the way get out it said i roused daddy we harnessed the horses and left the house as quickly as we could we dared not go down the valley so we tried to reach you by way of the mill we took the wrong road at the lake our pursuers trailed us and overtook us as you saw  it was all so monstrous that the ranger could scarcely believe it trueand yet there lay the dead horse and here was the old man beside the stone he did not refer to his own narrow escape and apparently helen did not associate him with the horseman at whom she had fired with such bewildering zeal   iv  it was a rugged and barren setting for loves interchange and yet these two young souls faced each other across the disabled old man with spirits fused in mutual understanding helens face softened and her eyes expressed the gratitude she felt at the moment the rangers sturdy frame and plain strongfeatured face were altogether admirable to her she relied upon him mentally and physically as did kauffman whose head was bewildered by his fall  hanscom roused himself with effort well now lets see whats to be done next one of your horses appears to be unhurt but the other is down he went to the team and after a moments examination came back to say one is dead ill harness my own saddler in with the other and in that way well be able to reach my cabin you must stay there for the present  quickly deftly he gathered the scattered goods from the ground restored the seat to the wagon untangled the dead beast from its harness and substituted his own fine animal while helen attended to kauffman he recovered rapidly and in a very short time was able to take his seat in the wagon and so they started down the road toward the valley  its a long way round by the wagon road hanscom explained but we can make the cabin by eleven and then we can consider the next move  to this helen now made objection we must not bring more trouble upon you they will resent your giving us shelter take us to the railway help us to leave the state i am afraid to stay in this country another night i want to get away from it all today  a shaft of pain touched the rangers heart at thought of losing her so soon after finding her and he said i dont think that is necessary they wont attempt another assaultnot while you are under my protection id like the pleasure of defending you against them he added grimly  but im afraid for daddy im sure he wounded one of them and if he did they may follow us you are very good and brave but i am eager to reach the train i want to get away  to this kauffman added his plea yes yes let us go he said bitterly i am tired of these lawless savages we came here thinking it was like switzerland a land inhabited by brave and gentle people lovers of the mountains we find it a den of assassins if you can help us to the railway dear friend we will ask no more of you and we will bless you always  the ranger could not blame them for the panic into which they had fallen and frankly acknowledged that it was possible for kitsong to make them a great deal of trouble reluctantly he consented  i am sorry to have you go but i reckon youre justified there is a way to board the northbound train without going to town and if nothing else happens well make the eastbound express that will take you out of the state with only one stop  conditions were not favorable for any further expression of the deep regret he felt for the road was rough and with only one seat in the wagon he was forced to perch himself on his upended saddle and so urging the team to its best he spoke only to outline his plan  ill drive you to the clear creek siding he explained all trains stop there to take on water and no 3 is due round about one we can make it easily if nothing happens and unless the kitsong gang get word from some of these ranches we pass you will be safely out of the country before they know youve gone  they rode in silence for some time but as they were dropping down into the hot dry treeless foothills the ranger turned to explain im going to leave the main road and whip out over the mesa just above the blackbird ranch so dont be surprised by my change of plan they are a dubious lot down there at the blackbird and have a telephone so id just as soon they wouldnt see us at all they might send word to abe itll take a little longer and the road is rougher but our chances for getting safely away are much better  we are entirely in your hands she answered with quiet confidence her accent her manner were as new to him as her dress she no longer seemed a young girl masquerading but a womanone to whom life was offering such stern drama that all her former troubles seemed suddenly faint and far away  kauffman was still suffering from his fall and it became necessary for helen to steady him in his seat her muscles ached with the strain but she made no complaint for she feared the ranger might lessen the speed of their flight  upon turning into the rough road which climbed the mesa the horses fell into a walk and the ranger leaping from the wagon strode alongside close to the seat on which the girl sat  all this is not precisely in the service book he remarked with a touch of returning humor but i reckon it will be accounted giving aid and succor to settlers in time of need  she was studying him minutely at the moment and it pleased her to observe how closely his every action composed with the landscape his dusty boots clamped with clinking spurs his weatherbeaten gray hat his keen glance flashing from point to point nothing escaped him his every word and gesture denoted the man of outdoor life selfreliant yet selfunconscious hardy practical yet possessing something that was reflective as well as brave her heart went out to him in tenderness and trust her shadow lifted  he had no perception of himself as a romantic figure on the contrary while pacing along there in the dust he was considering himself a sad esquire to the woman in whose worshipful service he was enlisted he was eager to know more about her and wondered if she would answer if he were to ask her the cause of her exile each moment of her company each glimpse of her face made the thought of losing her more painful will i ever see her again was the question which filled his mind  at the top of the mesa he again mounted to his seat on the upturned saddle and kept the team steadily on the trot down the swiftly descending road the sun was high above them now and every mile carried them deeper into the heat and dust of the plain but the girl uttered no word of complaint her throat was parched with thirst but she did not permit him to know even this for to halt at a well meant delay they rode in complete silence save now and again when the ranger made some remark concerning the character of the ranches they were passing  we are down among the men of the future now he saidthe farmers who carry spades instead of guns  once they met a boy on horseback who stared at them in openmouthed absorbed interest and twice men working in the fields beckoned to them primitively curious to know who they were and where they were going  but hanscom kept his ponies to their pace and replied only by shouting got to catch the train in such wise he stayed them in their tracks reluctant but helpless at last pointing to a small wavering speck far out upon the level sod he called with forceful cheerfulness theres the tank well overhaul it in an hour then he added ive been thinking what shall i do about the cabin shall i pack the furniture and ship it to you  no no take it yourself or give it away i care very little for most of the things except daddys violin and my guitar those you may keep until we send for them  i shall take good care of the guitar he asserted with a look which she fully understood what about the books  you may keep them also wed like you to have themwouldnt we daddy  yes yes said kauffman there is nothing there of much value but such as they are they are yours  i shall store everything the young fellow declared firmly in the hope that some day you will come back  that will never be my life here is ended she asserted  you will not always feel as you do now he urged all the people of the county are not of watsons stripe  that is true she said i shall try not to be unjust but i see now that in seeking seclusion in that lonely cañon we thrust ourselves among the most lawless citizens of the state and cut ourselves off from the very people we should have known however i have had enough of solitude my mind has changed this weeks experience has swept away the fog in my brain i feel like one suddenly awakened i see my folly and i shall go back to my peopleto the city  the ranger recognizing something inflexible in this made no further appeal  there was nothing at the tank but a small brown cottage in which the wife of the mexican section boss lived and to her hanscom committed his charges and turned to the care of his almost exhausted team the train was late the guard at the tank said and in consequence the ranger was torn between an agony of impatience and a dread of parting  it was probable that some of the kitsongs were in the raiding party and if they were hurt the kauffmans were not safe till the state line was passed it would be easy to head them off by a wire it was a hideous coil to throw about a young girl seeking relief from some unusual sorrow and though he longed even more deeply to keep her under his protection he made no objection to her going  returning to the sectionhouse he shared with her the simple meal which the reticent smiling little mexican woman had prepared and did his best to cheer kauffman with a belief in the early arrival of the train  it will be here soon i am sure he said  helen detected the lack of elation in his tone and understood in some degree the sense of loss which made him heartsick and yet she could not bring herself to utter words of comfort  at the close of the meal as they set out to walk across the sand to the switch he said to her am i never to see you again  i hope sosomewhere somehow she replied evasively  i wish youd set a time and place he persisted i cant bear to see you go you cant realize how i shall miss you  a fleeting gleam of amusement lighted her face you have known me only a few days  oh yes i have ive known you all summer you kept me busy thinking about you the whole country will seem empty now  she smiled i didnt know i filled so much space in the landscape i thought i was but a speck in it she hesitated a moment then added i came out to lose myself in nature i had come to hate men and to despise women i was sick of my kind i wanted to live like a savage a part of the wild and soforget  animals sometimes live alone savages never do he corrected unless they are outlawed from their tribe  thats what i tried to dooutlaw myself from my tribe i wanted to get away from foolish comment from malicious gossip  are you ready to go back to it nowi mean to the city  no not quite and yet this weeks experience has shaken me and helped me you have helped me and i want to thank you for it i begin to believe once more in good brave simple manhood you and daddy have revived my faith in men  some man must have hurt you mighty bad he said simply then added i cant understand that i dont see how any man could do anything but just naturally worship you  she was moved by the sincerity of his adoration but she led him no farther in that direction at first i thought i had won a kind of peace i was almost content in a benumbed way then came my arrestand you it was a rough awakening but i begin to see that i still live that i am young that i can become breathless with excitement this raid this ride has swept away all that deathlike numbness which had fallen upon me ive had my lesson now i can go back i must get away from here  under the spell of her intense utterance the rangers mind worked rapidly filling in the pauses yes youd better go away but im not going to let you pass out of my lifenot if i can help it im going to resign and go where you go  she laid a protesting hand upon his arm no no she said dont do that dont resign dont change your plans on my account im not worth such a sacrifice such risk  youre worth any risk he stoutly retorted with some part of her own intensity in his voice i cant think of letting you go i need you in my business he smiled wanly im only a forest ranger at ninety dollars per month but im going to be something else one of these days i wont mind a long rough trail if i can be sure of finding you at the end of it  the faraway whistle of the train spurred him into fierce demand youll let me write to you and you will reply once in a while wont you it will give me something to look forward to you owe me that much he added  yes i will write she promised but i think it better that you should forget me i hope we have not involved you in any trouble with your neighbors or with the coroner  i am not worrying about that he answered i am only concerned about you i would go to jail in a minute to save you any further worry  you are putting me so deeply in your debt that i can never repay you she replied  a letter now and then will help he suggested  the train panting wheezing hot with speed came to a creeping halt and the conductor swinging out upon the side track greeted the ranger pleasantly hello hans what are you doing here  hanscom returned his greeting gravely billy here are some friends of mine just down from the hills take good care of them for me will you  sure thing major said the conductor he helped kauffman aboard then turned to helen now lady he said holding out a hand im sorry the step is so high but  the ranger stooping took the girl in his arms and set her feet on the lower step goodby he said huskily then added for now write me soon  she turned and looked down upon him with a faint smile on her lips and a tender light in her eyes i promise goodby she said and entered the car  the ranger stood for a long time gazing after the train then languidly walked away toward his team                                       hanscom turned his face toward the forest with a full knowledge that his world had suddenly lost its charm at one moment his thought went anxiously forward with the fugitives at another it returned to confront the problem of his own desires his act in thus assisting the main witness to escape might displease the court and would undoubtedly intensify the dislike which kitsong had already expressed toward him my stay in the district is not likely to be as quiet as it has been he said to himself  however his own safety was not a question of grave concern the mystery of watsons death yet remained and until that was solved helen was still in danger of arrest his mind at last settled to the task of discovering and punishing the raiders who was watsons assassin what fierce desire for revenge had prompted that savage assault  there was no necessary connection between that small footprint and the shooting and yet until it was proved to be the work of another suspicion would point to helen as the only woman of the vicinity who had the motive for the deed to some the coroners failure to hold her was almost criminal  his return to the hills was equivalent to running the gantlet from every ranchgate men and boys issued walleyed with curiosity they of course knew nothing of the raidingparty of the morning but they understood that something unusual had taken place for was not the rangers saddle in his wagon and his saddlehorse under harness not to mention a streak of blood along the flanks of its mate the eyes of these solitary cattlemen are as analytical as those of trained detectives nothing material escapes them being taught to observe from infancy they had missed little of the rangers errand  who were you taking to the train they asked  hanscoms defense was silence and a species of jocular curt evasion and he succeeded at last in getting past them all without resort to direct and violent lying as he had reason to suspect that one at least of the riflemen of the morning belonged to the blackbird outfit he decided to avoid that ranch altogether  it would be absurd to claim that his nerves were perfectly calm and his heart entirely unhurried as he crept across the mesa and dropped into the wooded cañon just above the pasture fence although sustained by his authority as a federal officer he was perfectly well aware that it was possible for him to meet with trouble when the gang found out what he had done  another disturbing thought began to grow in his mind if those raiders watched me go down the hill they may consider it a clever trick to drop in on the kauffman place and loot the house they know it is unguarded perhaps i ought to throw the saddle on old baldy and ride over there to make sure about it  the more he considered this the more uneasy he became theyre just about sure to run off the stock or be up to some other devilment he said they might set fire to the house in the end he roped his extra horse and set out  even by the cutoff it was a stiff ride and it was nearly midnight as he topped the last ridge and came in sight of the cabin hello he exclaimed somebody has moved in im just in time  a light was gleaming from the kitchen window and the rangers mind worked quickly no one but members of the raidingparty would think of taking possession of this cabin so promptly no one else would know that the kauffmans were away that being the case he said musingly it stands me in hand to walk light and shifty and he kept on above the ranch in order to drop down through the timber of the cañon  after tethering his horse upon a little plot of grass just west of the garden he adjusted his revolver on his thigh at the precise point where it was handiest and moved forward with care they mustnt have time even to think fight he decided  as he rounded the corner of the stable he heard the voice of a girl singing and the effect of this upon him was greater than any uproar it was uncanny it made him wonder what kind of woman she could be who could carol in the midst of the band of raiders she might be more dangerous than the men she certainly added another complication to the situation  listening closely he was able to detect the voices of at least two men as they joined discordantly in the refrain of the song it was evident that all felt entirely secure and the task to which the ranger now addressed himself was neither simple nor pleasant to take these raiders unaware to get the upper hand of them and to bring them to justice was a dangerous program but he was accustomed to taking chances and did not hesitate very long  keeping close to the shadow he crept from the corral to the garden fence and from the covert of a clump of tall sunflowers was able to peer into the cabin window with almost unobstructed vision a woman was seated on a low chair in the middle of the floor playing a guitar and singing a lively song he could not see the men i wonder if that door is locked he queried if it isnt the job is easy if it is ill have to operate through a screen window  he remembered that both doors front and back were very strong for kauffman had been careful to have them heavily hinged and doublebarred they could not be broken except with a sledge the screen on the windows could be ripped off but to do that would make delay at the precise moment when a quarter of a second would be worth a lifetime no ive got to gamble on that door being unlocked he concluded with the fatalism of the mountaineer to whom danger is an everpresent sidepartner  with his revolver in his hand he slid through the garden and reached the corner of the house unperceived the woman was now playing a dance tune and the men were stamping and shouting and under cover of their clamor the ranger stooping low passed the window and laid his hand on the knob the door yielded to his pressure and swiftly almost soundlessly he darted within and stood before the astounded trio like a ghostan armed and very warlike ghost  whats going on here he demanded pleasantly as with weapon in complete readiness he confronted them  he had no need to command quiet they were all schooled in the rules of the game he was playing and understood perfectly the advantage which he held over them they read in his easy smile and jocular voice the deadly determination which possessed him  the woman was sitting in a low chair with the guitar in her lap and her feet stretched out upon a stool her companions two young men hardly more than boys were standing near a table on which stood a bottle of liquor all had been stricken into instant immobility by the sudden interruption of the ranger each stared with open mouth and dazed eyes  hanscom knew them all the girl was the wilful daughter of a basque rancher over on the porcupine one of the boys was henry kitsong a nephew of abe and the other a herder named busby who had been at one time a rider for watson  having a pleasant time arent you the ranger continued still retaining his sarcastic intonation from where he stood he could see the bottom of the girls upturned shoes and his alert brain took careful note of the size and shape of the soles a flush of exultation ran over him those are the shoes that left those telltale footprints in the flour he said to himself  you lads had better let me have your guns he suggested busby ill take yours first  the young ruffian yielded his weapon only when the ranger repeated his request with menacing intonation you next henry he said to kitsong and having thus cut the claws of his young cubs his pose relaxed you thought the owners of the place safely out of reach didnt you you saw me go down in the valley with them well i had a hunch that maybe youd take advantage of my absence so i just rode over i was afraid you might drop down here and break things up you see im responsible for all these goods and i dont want to see them destroyed that musicbox for instance he addressed the girl i happen to know thats a highpriced instrument and i promised the owner to take good care of it that bottle you fellows dug up i didnt know anything about but i guess ill confiscate that also it aint good for little boys he turned sharply on kitsong henry was your father in that band of sharpshooters this morning  no he wasnt blurted the boy and i wasnt either  well see about that in the morning which of you rode a blazefaced sorrel neither answered and hanscom said contentedly oh well well see about that in the morning  hanscom had drawn close to the girl who remained as if paralyzed with fright señorita i reckon ill have to borrow one of your shoes for a minute as he stooped and laid hold of her slipper busby fell upon him with the fury of a tiger  hanscom was surprised for he had considered the fellow completely cowed by the loss of his revolver he could have shot him dead but he did not he shook him off and swung at him with the big sevenshooter which he still held in his hand the blow fell upon the young fellows cheekbone with such stunning force that he reeled and fell to the floor  young kitsong cried out youve killed him  what was he trying to do to me retorted hanscom now you take that kerchief of yours and tie his hands behind him if either of you makes another move at me youll be sorry get busy now  young kitsong obeyed awed by the rangers tone and busby was soon securely tied he writhed like a wildcat as his strength came back but he was helpless for hanscom had taken a hand at lashing his feet together there was something bestial in the boys fury he would have braved the rangers pistol unhesitatingly after his momentary daze had passed for he had the blind rage of a trapped beast and his strength was amazing  during all this time the girl remained absolutely silent her back against the wall as if knowing that her capture would come next hanscom fully expected her to take a hand in the struggle but he was relievedgreatly relievedby her attitude of nonresistance  now henry he said with a breath of relief i cant afford to let either you or the señorita out of my sight i reckon youll both have to sit right here and keep me company till morning mebbe the señorita will bustle about and make a pot of coffeethatll help us all to keep awake but first of all i want both her slippers bring em to me henry  kitsong obeyed and the girl yielded the slippers the soles of which seemed to interest hanscom very deeply  he continued with polite intonation well all start down the valley at daybreak  what do you want of me asked the girl hoarsely  i want you as a witness to the assault busby made on me and then you see youre all housebreakershe waved his hand toward the front window from which the screen had been torn and the glass brokenand housebreaking is pretty serious business even in this country furthermore you were all concerned in that raid and im going to see that you all feel the full weight of the law  all the time he was talking so easily and so confidently he was really saying to himself to take you three to jail will be like driving so many wolves to marketbut its got to be done  he was tired irritable and eager to be clear of it all his own cabin at the moment seemed an ideally peaceful retreat only his belief that in this girls small shoe lay the absolute proof of helens innocence nerved him to go on with his selfimposed duty his chief desire was to place these shoes in the coroners hands and so end all dispute concerning the footprints in the flour  the girl whose name was rita sullenly made coffee and as she brought it to him he continued his interrogation  how did you get here  i rode  over the trail across the divide  yes  were you in the raid this morning  what raid i dont know of any raid  he knew she was lying but he only said when did you leave home  three days ago  where have you been  in camp  where  she pointed up the stream  how long have you been acquainted with this man busby  here he struck upon something stubborn and hard in the girls nature she refused to reply  when were you over here last  a warning word from busby denoted that he understood the course of the rangers questioning and was anxious to strengthen her resistance  hanscom had several hours in which to ponder and soon arrived at a fairly accurate understanding of the whole situation he remembered vaguely the report of a row between watson and busby and he was aware of the reckless cruelty of the dead man it might be that in revenge for some savagery on his part some graceless act toward rita this moody halfinsane youth had crept upon the rancher and killed him  he turned to young kitsong i havent seen you lately where have you been  over on the porcupine  working on gonzaless ranch  yes part of the time  does your father know you are back in the valley  noyes he does too  you fired that shot that killed the horse didnt you  young kitsong betrayed anxiety i dont know what you are talking about  which of you rode the blazefaced sorrel  in spite of himself the boy glanced quickly at the girl who shook her head  hanscom addressed himself to her señorita which of your friends rode the blazefaced sorrel  her head dropped in silent refusal to answer  oh well said the ranger well find out in the course of time my eyesight is pretty keen and i can swear that it was the man on the sorrel horse that fired the shot that stopped the kauffman team now one or the other of you will have to answer to that charge his voice took on a sterner note what were you doing on watsons porch last saturday  the girl started and flushed i wasnt on his porch  oh yes you were you didnt know you left your footprints in some flour on the floor did you  her glance was directed involuntarily toward her feet as if in guilty surprise it was a slight but convincing evidence to the ranger who went on  who was with youbusby or henry  nobody was with me i wasnt there i havent been in the valley before for weeks  you didnt go there alone you wouldnt dare to go alone in the night and the man who was with you killed watson  she sat up with a gasp and young kitsong stared their surprise was too genuine to be assumed whats that you say watson killed  yes watson was shot monday night didnt you know that where have you been that you havent heard of it  young kitsong was all readiness to answer now weve been up in the hills we have a camp up there  oh said hanscom kind of a robbers den eh has busby been with you  sure thing weve all been fishing and hunting here he stopped suddenly for to admit that he had been hunting out of season was to lay himself liable to arrest as a poacher on the forest he went on we all came down here together  what were you doing chasing that team what was the game in that  well he shot at us first answered the boy  and busby shouted from his position in the corner on the floor shut up you fool  the ranger smiled oh its got to all come out busby i saw the man on the sorrel horse fire that shotdont forget that and i know who made the tracks in the flour but i am beginning to wonder if you had anything to do with warning the kauffmans to get out  he had indeed come to the end of his questioning for his captives refused to utter another word and he himself fell silent his mind engaged with the intricacies of this problem it might be that these young daredevils just happened to meet kauffman on the road and decided to hold him up it was possible that they knew nothing of the warnings which had been sent but in that case who pushed that final warning under the door who let them know of trouble from above  dawn was creeping up the valley and calling young kitsong from the doze into which he had fallen he said now henry im going to take this bunch down to the sheriff and you might as well make up your mind to it first as last you go out and saddle up while the señorita heats up some more coffee and well get ready and start  hanscom was by no means as confident as his voice sounded and as the young fellow rose to go only half expected him to show his face again well let him slip he said to himself ill be safer without him  busby spoke up from the floor you stay with the game hank and you ride your own horse  you bet ill ride my own horse kitsong violently retorted from the doorway  the girl who understood the significance of this controversy interposed ill ride the sorrel hes my horse anyway  hanscom mockingly chimed in thats mighty fine and selfsacrificing but it wont do the rider who fired that shot was a man but ill leave it to henry bring around the horses and remember if you slip out with that bay horse ill know you rode the sorrel yesterday  the situation had become too complicated for the girl who fell silent while busby cursed the ranger in fierce set terms what right have you got to arrest us anyhow  all the right i need that shooting began inside the forest boundary and its my duty to see that you are placed in the hands of the law here his voice took on a note of grim determination and i want you to understand there will be no funny business on the way down  how can i ride all tied up like this demanded the ruffian  oh im going to untie you and you are going to come along quietlyeither as live stock or freightyou can take your choice  busby subdued by several hours on the floor was disposed to do as he was told and hanscom unbound his legs and permitted him to rise  as young kitsong brought the horses around in front of the cabin hanscom was not disappointed in finding the girls saddle on the sorrel he made no comment  now busby well mount you first he said and slipped the bridle from the horse you see to make sure of you i am going to lead your pony he then untied the youths hands climb on he commanded  busby silently mounted to his saddle the girl took the sorrel and at command kitsong started down the trail  you go next said hanscom to the girl now you busby he added and with the rope across the horses rumpthe trick of a trained trailerhe started down the trail  sinister as this small procession really was it would have appeared quite innocent to a casual observer as it went winding down the hill no one at a little distance would have been able to tell that in the silent determination of the horseman in the rear lay the only law the only bond which kept these four riders in line neither busby nor kitsong nor the girl doubted for an instant that if any of them made a deflection a rush for freedom they would be shot they knew that as a federal officer he had certain authority just how much authority they could not determine but they were aware that the shooting had begun in the forest which was his domain  as they sighted watsons cabin hanscom was curious to know whether nearing the scene of the crime would have any perceptible effect on busby will he betray nervousness he asked himself  quite the contrary as he came opposite the house busby turned in his saddle and asked when was watson killed  nobody knows exactly some time monday night answered the ranger  a few miles down the road they met a rancher coming up the valley with a timberwagon and to him the ranger explained briefly the nature of his expedition and said  now tom i reckon youll have to turn around and help me take these youngsters to the sheriff i would rather have them in your wagon than on horseback  the rancher consented with almost instant readiness  the prisoners were transferred to the wagon and in this way the remainder of the trip was covered   v  the county jail was a square brick structure standing in the midst of a grove of small cottonwoodtrees planted in painful rows and the sheriffs office and his wifes parlor situated on opposite sides of the hall occupied the front part of the first story while the rear and the basement served as kitchen and dungeon keep generally the lockup was empty and the building quite as decorous as any other on the street although at certain times it resounded with life on this day it was quiet and throop and his wife who served as matron were sitting under a tree as the ranchers wagon halted before the gate  it was about three oclock in the afternoon and hanscoms prisoners were dusty tired and sullen as they filed up the walk toward the sheriff who awaited their approach with an inquiring slant to his huge head mrs throop retreated to the house  when at close range hanscom with a weary smile said ive brought you some new boarders mr sheriff  so i see said the officer as he motioned them to enter the door whats it all about  its a long story replied the ranger and of course i cant go into it here but i want you to take charge of these people while i see carmody and find out what he wants done with them i think hell find them valuable witnesses incidentally i may say theyve been shooting a horse and breaking and entering a house  the sheriff was deeply impressed with this charge well well he said studying with especial care the downcast face of the girl i thought it might be only killing game out of season stealing timber or some such thing he called a deputy here tom take these men into the guardroom and mrs throop you look after this girl while i go over the case with mr hanscom  dont let em talk with anybody warned the ranger  the sheriff passed the word to the deputy thats right tom  in deep relief the ranger followed the sheriff into his private office and dropped into a seat jeerusalem im tired he exclaimed that was a nervous job  cut loose said the sheriff  hanscom then related as briefly as he could the story of the capture at the end he confessed that he had hardly expected to reach town with all of them i had no authority to arrest them i just bluffed them as well as the rancher who drove the wagon into thinking i had i wanted them for carmody to question and i hung to the girl because i believe she can absolutely clear kauffman and his daughter of any connection  throop who had listened intently now broke out well i hope so that old man and his girl sure are acquiring all kinds of misery kitsong got carmody to issue a warrant for them yesterday and i wired the authorities at lone rock and had them both taken from the train  the rangers face stiffened as he stared at the officer you did  i did and theyre on their way back on no 6  how could carmody do that hanscom demanded hotly he told them to goi heard him  he says not he says he just excused the girl for the time being he declares now that he expected them both to stay within call and when he heard they were running away  how did he know they were running away  search me some one on the train must have wired back  more likely the blackbird ranch phoned in they are all related to watson i was afraid of them he rose well that proves that abe and his gang were at the bottom of that raid  maybe so but i dont see how carmody can go into thathis job is to find the man or woman who killed watson  well theres where i come in ive got the girl who made those tracks on the floor  the sheriff was thoughtful i guess youd better call up carmodyhes the whole works till his verdict is rendered and he ought to be notified at once  a moments talk with the doctors office disclosed the fact that he was out in the country on a medical trip and would not return till late reckon well have to wait said the sheriff  the rangers face fell after a pause he asked when does that train get in  about six its an hour late  and theyll be jailed  sure thing no other way carmody told me to take charge of them and see that they were both on hand tomorrow  hanscoms fine eyes flamed with indignation its an outrage that girl is as innocent of watsons killing as you are i wont have her humiliated in this way  you seem terribly interested in this young lady remarked throop with a grin  hanscom was in no mood to dodge i amand im going to save her from coming here if i can he started for the door ill see judge brinkley and get her released carmody has no authority to hold her  i hope you succeed said the sheriff sympathetically but at present im under orders from the coroner its up to him so you think youve got the girl who made them tracks  i certainly do and i want you to hold these prisoners till carmody gets home dont let anybody see them and dont let them talk with one another theyll all come before that jury tomorrow and they mustnt have any chance to frame up a lie  all right i see your point go ahead your prisoners will be here when you come back  hanscom went away raging against the indignity which threatened helen at carmodys office he waited an hour hoping the coroner might return and in despair of any help from him set out at last for brinkleys office resolute to secure the judges interference  the first man he met on the street stopped him with a jovial word hello hans say you want to watch out for abe kitsong he came bilin in half an hour ago and is looking for you says you helped that dutchman and his girl or wife or whatever she is to get away and that youve been arresting henry his nephew without a warrant and he swears hell swat you good and plenty on sight  hanscoms voice was savage as he replied you tell him that im big enough to be seen with the naked eye and if he wants me right away hell find me at judge brinkleys office  the other man also grew serious all the same hans keep an eye out he urged abe is sure to make you trouble hes started in drinking and when hes drunk hes poisonous as a rattler  all right im used to rattlersill hear him before he strikes hes a noisy brute  the ranger could understand that ritas father might very naturally be thrown into a fury of protest by the news of his daughters arrest but kitsongs concern over a nephew whom he had not hitherto regarded as worth the slightest care did not appear especially logical or singularly important  brinkley was not in his office and so hanscom went out to his house out on the north bend of the river in a large lawn set with young trees  the judge seated on his porch in his shirtsleeves exhibited the placid ease of a man whose office work is done and his grass freshly sprinkled  good evening hanscom he pleasantly called come up and have a seat and a smoke with the gardener  i have but a moment the ranger replied and plunged again into the story which served in this instance as a preface to his plea for intervention you must help me judge miss mclaren must not go to jail to arrest her in this way a second time is a crime shes a lady judge and as innocent of that shooting as a child  you surprise me said brinkley according to all reports she is very very far from being a lady  hanscom threw out his hands in protest theyre all wrong judge i tell you she is a lady and young and handsome  handsome and young the judges eyes took on a musing expression well well that accounts for much but what was she doing up there in the company of that old dutchman  i dont know why she came west but im glad she did im glad to have known her that old dutchman as you call him is her stepfather and a fine chap  but carmody has arrested her what caused him to do that  i dont know i cant understand it it may be that kitsong has put the screws on him some way  the judge reflected as the only strange woman in the valley the girl naturally falls under suspicion of having made those footprints  i know it judge but you have only to see herto hear her voiceto realize how impossible it is for her to kill even a coyote all i ask now is that you save her from going to jail  i dont see how i can interfere brinkley answered with gentle decision as coroner carmody has the case entirely in his hands till after the verdict but dont take her imprisonment too hard he added with desire to comfort him throop has a good deal of discretion and ill phone him to make her stay as little like incarceration as possible you see while nominally shes only a witness for the state actually shes on trial for murder and till you can get your other woman before the jury shes a suspect if you are right the jury will at once bring in a verdict against other parties known or unknown and she will be freeexcept that she may have to remain to testify in her own case against the raiders dont worry my dear fellow it will come out all right  hanscom was now in the grasp of conflicting emotions in spite of brinkleys refusal to interfere he could not deny a definite feeling of pleasure in the fact that helen was returning and that he was about to see her again anyhow i have another opportunity to serve her he thought as he turned down the street toward the station perhaps after the verdict she will not feel so eager to leave the country   vi  meanwhile the fugitives on the westbound express were nearing the town in charge of the marshal of lone rock and helen who had telegraphed her plight to hanscom and had received no reply was in silent dread of the ordeal which awaited her her confidence in the ranger had not failed but realizing how difficult it was to reach him she had small hope of seeing his kindly face at the end of her journey  he may be riding some of those lonely heights this moment she thought and wondered what he would do if he knew that she was returning a prisoner he would come to me she said in answer to her own question and the thought that in all that mighty spread of peak and plain he was the one gracious and kindly soul lent a kind of glamour to his name after all a loyal soul like his is worth more than any mine or mountain she acknowledged  the marshal a small quaint middleaged person with squinting glance and bushy hair was not only very much in awe of his lovely prisoner but so accustomed to going about in his shirtsleeves that he suffered acutely in the confinement of his heavy coat nevertheless in spite of his discomfort he was very considerate in a lefthanded way and did his best to conceal the official relationship between himself and his wards he not only sat behind them all the way but he made no attempt at conversation and for these favors helen was genuinely grateful only as they neared the station did he venture to address her  now the sheriff will probably be on hand he said and if he is ill just naturally turn you over to him but in case he isnt ill have to take you right over to the jail im sorry but thats my orders so if youll kindly step along just ahead of me people may not notice youre in my charge  helen assured him that she would obey every suggestion and that she deeply appreciated his courtesy  kauffmans spirit was sadly broken his age the rough usage of the day before and this unwarranted second arrest had combined to take away from him a large part of his natural courage he insisted that helen should wire her eastern friends stating the case and appealing for aid  we need help now he said we are being persecuted  helen however remembering carmodys kindness said dont be discouraged daddy it may be that we are only witnesses and that after we have testified we shall be released wait until tomorrow i hate to announce new troubles to my relatives  but we shall need money he said anxiously we have only a small balance  it was nearly six oclock as they came winding down between the grassy buttes which formed the gateway to the town and the girl recalled with a wave of selfpity the feeling of exaltation with which she had first looked upon that splendid purplewalled cañon rising to the west it had appealed to her at that time as the gateway to a mystic sanctuary now it was but the lair of thieves and murderers ferocious and obscene only one kindly human soul dwelt among those majestic forested heights  she was pale sad but entirely composed and to hanscom very beautiful as she appeared in the vestibule of the long daycoach but her face flushed with pleasure at sight of him and as she grasped his hand and looked into his fine eyes something warm and glowing flooded her heart  oh how relieved i am to find you here she exclaimed and her lips trembled in confirmation of her words i did not expect you i was afraid my telegram had not reached you  did you telegraph me he asked i didnt get itbut im here all the same he added and fervently pressed the hands which she had allowed him to retain  oblivious of the curious crowd she faced him in a sudden realization of her dependence upon him and her gratitude for his stark manliness was so deep so full she could have put her hands about his neck how dependable how simple how cleareyed he was  he on his part found her greatly changed in both face and voice she seemed clothed in some new strange dignity and yet her glance was less remote less impersonal than before and her pleasure at sight of him deeply gratifying in spite of himself his spirits lightened  i have a lot to tell you he began but the sheriff courteously interposed  put her right into my machineyou go too hanscom  i couldnt prevent this he began sorrowfully as he took a seat beside her but you will not be put into a cell mrs throop will treat you as a guest  the selfaccusation in his voice moved her to put her hand on his arm in caressing reassurance please dont blame yourself about that she said i dont mind its only for the night anyway let us think of tomorrow  the ride was short and mrs throop a tall dark rather gloomy woman came to the door to meet her guests with the air of an oldfashioned village hostess serious but kindly  mrs throop said her husband this is miss mclaren and her father mr kauffman make them as comfortable as you can  mrs throop greeted helen with instant kindly interest i am pleased to know you come right in you must be tired  i am confessed the girl very tired and very dusty i hope you always put your prisoners under the hose  ill give you my spare chamber replied the matron with abstracted glance its next the bathroom im sorry but i guess your fatherll have to go down below  what do you mean by that  the sheriff explained the cells are below  helen was instantly alarmed oh no she protested my father is not at all well please give him my room ill go down below  it wont be necessary for either of you to go below interposed the sheriff hanscom ill put kauffman in your charge you can take him to your boardinghouse if you want to  youre very kind said helen with such feeling that the sheriff reacted to it i hope it wont get you into trouble  oh i dont think it will he said cheerily so long as i know hes safe it dont matter where he sleeps  well youd better all stay to supper anyhow said mrs throop its ready and waiting  no one but helen perceived anything unusual in this hearty offhand invitation to hanscom it was just another instance of western hospitality and to the sheriff a common service and so a few minutes later they all sat down at the generous table in such genial mood with mrs throop doing her best to make them feel at home that all their troubles became less than shadows  although disinclined to go into a detailed story of his return to the hills hanscom described the capture of the housebreakers and in spite of a careful avoidance of anything which might sound like boasting disclosed the fact that at the moment when he threw open the door of the cabin he had exposed himself to the weapons of a couple of reckless young outlaws and might have been killed  you shouldnt have risked that helen protested our poor possessions are not worth such cost  i couldnt endure the notion of those hoodlums looting the place he explained  at the thought of rita who was occupying a cell in the womens ward helen grew a little sad for according to the rangers own account she was hardly more than a child and had been led away by her first passion  at the close of the meal upon mrs throops housewifely invitation they all took seats in the front room and helen quite forgot that she was a prisoner and the ranger almost returned to boyhood as he faced the marbletopped table the cabinet organ and the enlarged family portraits on the walls for of such quality were his mothers adornments in the old home at circle bend something vaguely intimate and a little confusing filled his mind as he listened to the voice of the woman before him only by an effort could he connect her with the cabin in the high valley she was becoming each moment more alien more aloof but at the same time more desirable like the girls he used to worship in the church choir  speech was difficult with him and he could only repeat it makes me feel like a rabbit to think i could not keep you from coming here and the worst of it is i had nothing to offer as security all i have in the world is a couple of horses a saddle and a typewriter  it really doesnt matter she replied in hope of easing his mind see how they treat us they know were unjustly held and that we shall be set free tomorrow  strange to say this did not lighten his gloom and thenyou will go away he said soberly  yes we cannot remain here  and i shall never see you again he pursued  her face betrayed a trace of sympathetic pain dont say that never is such a long time  and youll forget us all out here  i shall never forget what you have done be sure of that she replied  nevertheless despite the tenderness of her tone and her gratitude openly expressed something disconcerting had come into her eyes and voice she was more and more the lady and less and less the recluse and as she receded and rose to this higher plane the ranger lost heart almost without knowing the cause of it  at last he turned to kauffman i suppose wed better go he said you look tired  i am tired the old man admitted is it far to your hotel  only a little way  good night said helen extending her hand with a sudden light in her face which transported the trailer well meet again in the morning  he took her hand in his with a clutch in his throat which made reply difficult but his glance expressed the adoration which filled his heart                                       kauffman left the house walking like a man of seventy my bones are not broken but they are weary he said dejectedly i fear i am to be ill  oh youll be all right in the morning responded the ranger much more cheerily than he really felt  is it not strange that any reasonable being should accuse my daughter and me of that monstrous deed  that is because no one knows you when the townsfolk come to know you and her they will think differently that is why i am glad the coroner is to hold his court here in the town  well if only we are set freewe shall be set free eh  surely but what will you do then where will you go  i hope helen will return to her people he sighed deeply it was all very foolish to come out here but it was natural she was stricken and sensitiveso morbidly sensitiveto pity to gossip then too a romantic notion about the healing power of the mountains was in her thought she wished to go where no one knew herwhere she could live the simple life and regain serenity and health she said i will not go to a convent i will make a sanctuary of the green hills  something very sorrowful must have happened said hanscom hesitatingly  the old mans voice was very grave as he replied not sorrow but treachery he said a treachery so cruel a betrayal so complete that when she lost her lover and her most intimate girl friend one nearer than a sister she lost faith in all men and all womenalmost in god i cannot tell you more of her story he paused a moment then added she believes in youshe already trusts youand some time perhaps she herself will tell the story of her betrayal till then you must be content with thisshe is here through no fault or weakness of her own  the ranger pondering deeply dared not put into definite form the precise disloyalty which had driven a brokenhearted girl to seek the shelter of the hills but he understood her mood hating her kind and believing that she could lose herself in the immensity of the landscape she had come to the mountains only to be cruelly disillusioned the kitsongs had taught her that in the wilderness a woman is more noticeable than a peak  just why she selected the shellfish for her retreat remained to be explained and to this question kauffman answered we came here because a friend of ours a poet who had once camped in the valley told us of the wonderful beauty of the place it is beautifulquite as beautiful as it was reportedbut a beautiful landscape it appears does not make men over into its image it makes them seem only the more savage  hanscom refraining from further question helped the old man up the stairway to his bed and then returned to the barroom in which several of the regular boarders were loafing one or two greeted him familiarly and it was evident that they all knew something of the capture and were curious to learn more his answers to their questions were brief youll learn all about it tomorrow he said  simpson the proprietor of the hotel jocosely remarked well hans as near as i can figure it out tomorrow is to be your busy day but youd better lay low tonight the kitsongsll get ye if ye dont watch out  ill watch out what do you hear  the whole of shellfish valley is coming in to see that your dutchman and his girl gets whats coming to them abe has just left here looking for you hes turribly wrought up says you had no right to arrest them youngsters and hell make you sorry you did  one of the clerks dryly remarked theys a fierce interest in this inquest carmody will sure have to move over to the courthouse gee but he feels his feed for one day anyhow hes bigger than the entire county court  the ranger had a clearer vision of his own as well as helens situation as he replied well im going over to see him when it comes to a showdown hes on my side for he needs the witnesses ive brought him  abe sure has got it in for you hans your standing up for the dutchman and his woman was bad enough but for you to arrest hank without a warrant has set the old man apoppin he glanced at the rangers empty belt better take your gun along  no im safer without it he replied i might fly mad and hurt somebody  the loafers though eager to witness the clash did not rise from their chairs till after hanscom left no one wished to betray unseemly haste  therell be something doing when they meet said simpson lets follow him up and see the fun  as he walked away in the darkness the ranger began to fearnot for himself but for helen the unreasoning ferocity with which the valley still pursued her was appalling for the first time in his life he strongly desired money he felt his weakness his ignorance in the face of the trialwhich should mean complete vindication for the girl but which might prove to be another hideous miscarriage of justicehe was of no more value than a child carmody had seemed friendly but some evil influence had evidently changed his attitude  what can i do the ranger asked himself and was only able to answer nothing  from a sobersided capable boy content to do a thing well he had developed at thirty into a serious but singularly unambitious man loving the outdoor life and being sufficiently resourceful to live alone in a wilderness cabin without becoming morbid he had naturally drifted into the forest service without being slothful he had been foolishly unaspiring and he saw that now i must bestir myself he said sharply i must wake up i must climb i must get somewhere  he took close grip on himself carmody must squeeze the truth out of these youngsters tomorrow and i must help him do it if brinkley cant help i must have somebody else and yet deep in his heart was the belief that the sight of helen as she took the witnesschair would do more to clear her name than any lawyer could accomplish by craft or passionate speech  at the door of carmodys office he came upon kitsong and a group of his followers waiting for him abe was in a most dangerous mood and his hearers also in liquor were listening with approval to the description of what he intended to do to the ranger  you cant arrest a man without a warrant he was repeating hanscoms no sheriffhes only a dirty deputy gamewarden ill make him wish he was a goat before i get through with him  although to advance meant war hanscom had no thought of retreating he kept his way and as the band of light which streamed from the saloon window fell on him one of the watchers called out theres the ranger now  kitsong turned and with an oath of savage joy advanced upon the forester youre the man i have been waiting for he began with a menacing snarl  well hanscom retorted here i am what can i do for you  his quiet tone instantly infuriated the ruffian shaking his fist close to the rangers nose he shouted ill do for you you loafer what right had you to arrest them kids what right had you to help them witnesses to the train youre off your beat and youd better climb right back again  righteous wrath flamed hot in the rangers breast you keep your fist out of my face or ill smash your jaw he answered and his voice was husky with passion get out of my way he added as kitsong shifted ground deliberately blocking his path  you cant bluff me roared the older man im going to have you jugged for false arrest youll find you cant go round taking people to jail at your own sweet will  the battle song in the old mans voice aroused the street his sympathizers pressed close all their longfelt halfhidden hatred of the ranger as a federal officer flamed from their eyes and hanscom regretted the absence of his revolver  though lean and awkward he was one of those deceptive men whose muscles are folded in broad firm flakes like steel springs a sense of danger thrilled his blood but he did not show ithe could not afford to show it therefore he merely backed up against the wall of the building and with clenched hands awaited their onset  something in his silence and selfcontrol daunted his furious opponents they hesitated  if you werent a government officer blustered abe id waller yebut ill get ye ill put ye where that dutchman and his  hanscoms fist crashing like a hammer against the ranchers jaw closed his teeth on the vile epithet which filled his mouth and even as he reeled stunned by this blow the rangers left arm flashed in another savage swing and abe stunned by the swift attack would have fallen into the gutter had not one of his gang caught and supported him  kill him kill the dog shouted one of the others and in his voice was the note of the murderer  eli kitsong whipped out his revolver but the hand of a friendly bystander clutched the weapon none of that the man is unarmed he said  at this moment the door of the saloon opened and five or six men came rushing eager to see quick to share in a fight believing them to be enemies hanscom with instant rush struck the first man a heavy blow caught and wrenched his weapon from his fist and so armed and desperate faced the circle of inflamed and excited men  hands up now he called  dont shoot hans shouted the man who had been disarmed were all friends  in the tense silence which followed the sheriff attracted by the noise emerged from the coroners door with a shout and hurled himself like an enormous ram into the crowd pushing men this way and that he reached the empty space before the rangers feet  whats the meaning of all this he demanded with panting intensity put up them guns the crowd obeyed now whats it all about he said addressing abe  he jumped me complained kitsong i want him arrested for that and for taking henry without a warrant  wheres your warrant asked throop  abe was confused i havent any yet but ill get one  throop addressed the crowd which was swiftly augmenting clear out of this now vamose every man of you or ill run you all in clear out i say the throng began to move away for the gestures with which he indicated his meaning were made sinisterly significant by the weapon which he swung the leaders fell back and began to move away throop said to the ranger hans you come with me the coroner wants you  hanscom returned the revolver to the man from whom he had snatched it im much obliged pete he said with a note of humor hope i didnt do any damage i didnt have time to see who was coming i wouldnt have been so rough if id known it was you  the other fellow grinned peared to me like youd made a mistake but i couldnt blame you feller has to act quick in a case like that  bring your prisoner here called carmody from his open door ill take care of him  ill get you yet called kitsong venomously ill get you tomorrow  go along out o here repeated the sheriff hustling him off the walk youre drunk and disturbing the peace go home and go to bed  with a sense of having made a bad matter worse the ranger followed the coroner into his office and closed the door   vii  dr carmody who had held the office of coroner less than a year had a keen sense of the importance which this his first murder case had given him his procedure at the cabin had been easy and rather casual it is true but contact with the townfolk and a careful perusal of the state code had given him a decided tone of authority and an air of judicial severity which surprised and somewhat irritated hanscom fresh from his encounter with kitsong  what was the cause of that row out there demanded the doctor resuming his seat behind his desk with the expression of a police magistrate  the ranger still hot with anger looked at his questioner with resentful eyes kitsong and his gang were laying for me and i stood em offthats all old abe was out for trouble and he got it i punched his jaw and the other outlaws started in to do me up  carmody softened a bit well youre in for it hell probably have you arrested and charged with assault and battery  if he can interposed throop hell find some trouble gettin a warrant issued in this town tonight  carmody continued his accusing interrogation what about this report of your helping the kauffmans to leave the country is that true  hanscoms tone was still defiant as he replied it is but i wonder if you know that they were being chased out of the country at the time  chased out  yes after receiving several warnings they got one that scared them and so they hitched up and started over early in the morning to find me on the way they were waylaid by an armed squad and chased for several miles i heard the shooting and by riding hard across the black hogback intercepted them and scared the outlaws off but the kauffmans were in bad shape one of the horses had been killed and kauffman himself was lying on the ground hed been thrown from the wagon and was badly bruised the girl was unhurt but naturally she wanted to get out of the country at once she wasnt scared she was plain disgusted she wanted me to take them to the train and i did any decent citizen would have done the same i didnt know you wanted them again and if i had i wouldnt have tried to hold them at the time for i was pretty well wrought up myself  carmody was less belligerent as he said what about arresting these young people how did that happen  well on the way back from the station i got to thinking about those raiders and it struck me that it would be easy for them to ride down to the kauffman cabin and do some damage and that id better go over and see that everything was safe it was late when i got home but i saddled up and drove across good thing i did for i found the house all lit up and henry kitsong young busby and old pete cuneos girl were in full possession of the place and having a gay time i arrested the boys for breaking into the house on the theory that they were both in that raid furthermore im sure they know something about watsons death thats what abe and eli were fighting me about tonighttheyre afraid henry was mixed up in it he and watson didnt get on well  the vigor and candor of the rangers defense profoundly affected carmody you may be right he said thoughtfully anyhow ill bring them all before the jury tomorrow of course i cant enter into that raid or the housebreakingthats out of my jurisdictionbut if you think this cuneo girl knows something  i am certain she does she made those tracks in the flour  the coroner turned sharply what makes you think so  hanscom then told him of the comparison he had made of her shoes with the drawings in his notebook and the coroner listened intently  thats mighty important he said at last you did right in bringing her down ill defend your action  hanscom persisted you must make it clear to that jury that helen mclaren never entered watsons gate in her life  carmody was at heart convinced dont worry said he ill give you a chance to get all that evidence before the jury and for fear abe may try to arrest you and keep you away from the session i reckon id better send you home in charge of throop he smiled and the sheriff smiled but it was not so funny to the ranger  never mind about me he said i can take care of myself kitsong is only bluffing  all the same youd better go home with throop persisted the coroner youre needed at the hearing tomorrow and miss mclaren will want you all in one piece he said  hanscom considered a moment all right im in your hands till tomorrow good night  good night replied carmody take good care of him he added to the sheriff as he rose  he wont get away replied throop as he stepped into the street he perceived a small group of kitsongs sympathizers still hanging about the door of the saloon what are you hanging around here for he demanded  waiting for abe hes gone after a warrant and the city marshal one of them explained  youre wasting time and so is abe you tell him that the coroner has put hanscom in my custody and that i wont stand for any interference from anybodynot even the county judgeso you fellers better clear off home  the back streets were silent and as they walked along throop said im going to lose you at the door of the hotel but youd better turn up at my office early tomorrow  hanscom said good night and went to his bed with a sense of physical relaxation which should have brought slumber at once but it didnt on the contrary he lay awake till long after midnight reliving the exciting events of the day and the hour upon which he spent most thought was that in mrs throops front room when he sat opposite helen and discussed her future and his own  when he awoke it was broad day and as kauffman who occupied a bed in the same chamber was still soundly slumbering the ranger dressed as quietly as possible and went out into the street to take account of a dawn which was ushering in the most important morning of his lifea day in which his own fate as well as that of helen mclaren must be decided  the air was clear and stinging and the mountain wall lit by the direct rays of the rising sun appeared depressingly bald and prosaic like his own past life the foothills in whose minute wrinkle the drama of which he was a vital part had taken place resembled a crumpled carpet of dull gold and olivegreen and for the first time in his experience l j hanscom wilderness trailer acknowledged a definite dissatisfaction with his splendid solitude  what does my life amount to he bitterly inquired what am i headed for where is my final campingplace i cant go on as im going if i were sure of some time getting a supervisors job or even an assistant supervisors position the outlook would not be so hopeless but to get even that far means years of work years of riding and then as he thought of his lonely cabin so unsuited to a womans life he said no i must quit the service thats sure  returning to the hotel he wrote out his resignation with resolute hand and dropped it into the mailbox there he told himself now youre just naturally obliged to hustle for a new job and strange to say a feeling of elation followed this decisive action  kauffman was afoot and dressing with slow and painful movements as hanscom reentered saying cheerily well uncle how do you feel by now  with a wan smile the old man answered much bruised and very painful but i am not concerned about myself i am only afraid for you i hope you will not come to harm by reason of your generous aid to us  dont you fret about me responded hanscom sturdily im hard to kill and dont make the mistake of thinking that the whole country is down on you for it isnt abe and his gang are not much better than outlaws in the eyes of the people down here in the valley and as soon as the town understands the case the citizens will all be with youandhelen he hesitated a little before speaking her name and the sound of the word gave him a little pang of delightbrought her nearer someway but lets go down to breakfast you must be hungry  the old man did not reply as cheerily as the ranger expected him to do on the contrary he answered sadly no i do not feel like eating but i will go down with you perhaps i shall feel better for it  the diningroom was filled with boarders and all betrayed the keenest interest in kauffman it was evident also that the rangers punishment of kitsong was widely known for several spoke of it and simpson warningly said  abe intends to have your hide hes going to slap a warrant on you as soon as youre out of carmodys hands and have you sent down the line for assault with intent to kill  all this talk increased kauffmans uneasiness and on the way over to the jail he again apologized for the trouble they had brought upon him  dont say a word of last nights row to helen warned hanscom throop promised to keep it from her and dont consider kitsong he cant touch me till after carmody is through with me  the deputy who let them in said that the sheriff was at breakfasta fact which was made evident by the savory smell of sausages which pervaded the entire hall and a moment later throop hearing their voices came to the diningroom door napkin in hand come in he called come in an have a hot cake  thank you weve had our breakfast hanscom replied  oh well you can stand a cup of coffee anyway and miss helen wants to see you  the wish to see helen brought instant change to the rangers plan putting down his hat he followed kauffman into the pleasant sunlit breakfastroom with a swiftly pounding heart  helen smiling cheerily rose to meet her stepfather with a lovely air of concern dear old daddy how do you feel this morning  very well indeed he bravely falsified  she turned to hanscom with outstretched hand isnt it glorious this morning she exclaimed rather than asked  the sheriff like the good boomer that he was interrupted the rangers reply oh we have plenty of mornings like this  she protested please dont say that i want to consider this morning especially fine i want it to bring us all good luck  evidently throop had kept his promise to hanscom for helen said nothing of the battle of the night before and with sudden flare of confidence the ranger said  youre right this is a wonderful morning and i believe this trial is coming out right but just to be prepared for anything that comes i think id better get a lawyer to represent you i dont feel able properly to defend your interests  but you must be there she quickly answered you are the one sure friend in all this land  his sensitive face flushed with pleasure for beneath the frank expression of her friendship he perceived a deeper note than she had hitherto expressed and yet he was less sure of her than ever for in ways not easily defined by one as simple as he she had contrived to accent overnight the alien urban character of her training she no longer even remotely suggested the hermit he had once supposed her to be a gown of graceful lines a different way of dressing her hair had effected an almost miraculous change in her appearance she became from moment to moment less of the mountaineer and more of the city dweller and realizing this the trailers admiration was tinged with something very like despair he was not a dullard he divined that these outer signs of change implied corresponding mental reversals her attitude toward the mountains toward life had altered  she is turning away from my world back to the world from which she came was his vaguely defined conclusion  meanwhile the sheriff was saying well now carmody opens court in the townhall at ten this morning and hans you are to be on hand early ill bring miss mclaren up in the car about a quarter to ten and have her in the doctors office which is only a few doors away  how is the cuneo girl asked hanscom  she seems rested and fairly chipper but i can see shes going to be a bad witness  helens face clouded poor girl i feel sorry for her  mrs throop was less sympathetic she certainly has made a mess of it i cant make out which of these raiders she ran away with  shes going to defend them both said throop and shes going to deny everything id like to work the third degree on her id bet id find out what she was doing down at watsons  helen who knew the value which her defenders placed on the correspondence between ritas shoes and the footprint was very grave as she said i hope she had no part in the murder mrs throop says she is hardly more than a child  well warned the sheriff were not the court its up to carmody and his jury  they said no more about the trial and hanscom soon left the room with intent to find a lawyer who would be willing for a small fee to represent the kauffmansa quest in which he was unsuccessful  the sheriff followed him out reckon id better take you up to carmodys office in my car he said kitsong may succeed in clapping a warrant on your head   viii  the valley had wakened early in expectation of an exciting day the news of the capture of busby and his companions had been telephoned from house to house and from ranch to ranch and the streets were already filled with farmers and their families adorned as for a holiday the entire population of shellfish cañon had assembled voicing high indignation at the rangers interference led by abe and eli who busily proclaimed that the arrest of henry and his companions was merely a trick to divert suspicion from the kauffman woman they advanced upon the coroner  abe had failed of getting a warrant for the ranger but boasted that he had the promise of one as soon as the inquest should be ended furthermore he said old louis cuneo is on his way over the range and ill bet something will start the minute he gets in  carmody who was disposed to make as much of his position as the statutes permitted had called the hearing in a public hall which stood a few doors south of his office and at ten oclock the aisles were so jammed with expectant auditors that throop was forced to bring his witnesses in at the back door nothing like this trial in the way of free entertainment had been offered since the day jim nolan was lynched from the railway bridge  hanscom was greatly cheered by the presence of his chief supervisor rawlins who came into the coroners office about a quarter to ten he had driven over from cambria in anxious haste greatly puzzled by the rumors which had reached him he was a keen young marylander a college graduate with considerable experience in the mountain west he liked hanscom and trusted him and when the main points of the story were clear in his mind he said  you did perfectly right hans and ill back you in it im something of a dabster at law myself and ill see that kitsong dont railroad you into jail what worries me is the general opposition now being manifested with the whole shellfish valley on edge your work will be hampered it will make your position unpleasant for a while at least  hanscom uneasily shifted his glance that doesnt matter im going to quit the work anyhow  oh no youre not  yes i am i wrote out my resignation this morning  rawlins was sadly disturbed i hate to have you let this gang drive you out  it isnt that replied hanscom somberly the plain truth is jack ive lost interest in the work if miss mclaren is clearedand she will beshell go east and i dont see myself going back alone into the hills  the supervisor studied him in silence for a moment and his voice was gravely sympathetic as he said i see this girl has made your cabin seem a long way from town  shes done more than that jack shes waked me up shes shown me that i cant afford to ride trail and camp and cook and fight fire any more ive got to get out into the world and rustle a home that a girl like her can be happy in im started at last i want to do something im as ambitious as a ward politician  the supervisor smiled i get you im sorry to lose you but i guess you are right if youre bent on winning a woman youre just about obliged to jump out and try something else but dont quit until i have time to put a man in your place  hanscom promised this although at the moment he had a misgiving that the promise might prove a burden and together they walked over to the hall  the crowded room was very quiet as the ranger and his chief entered and took seats near the platform on which the coroner and his jury were already seated it was evident even at a glance that the audience was very far from being dominated or even colored by the shellfish crowd and yet as none of the spectators men or women really knew the kauffmans they could not be called friendly they were merely curious  hanscom was somewhat relieved to find that the jury was not precisely the same as it had been on the hillside an older and better man had replaced steve billop a strong partisan of kitsongs but to counterbalance this a discouraging feature developed in the presence of william raines a dark oily whiskysoaked man of sixty a lawyer whose small practice lay among the mountaineers of watsons type  hes here as kitsongs attorney whispered the ranger who regretted that he had not made greater efforts to secure legal aid however the presence of his chief a man of education and experience reassured him in some degree  carmody rejoicing in his legal supremacy and moved by love of drama opened proceedings with all the dignity and authority of a judge explaining in sonorous terms that this was an adjourned session of an inquest upon the death of one edward watson a rancher on the shellfish  new witnesses have been secured and new evidence has developed he said in closing and mr l j hanscom the forest ranger who has important testimony to give will first take the stand  though greatly embarrassed by the eyes of the vast audience and somewhat intimidated by the judicial tone of carmodys voice hanscom went forward and told his story almost without interruption and at the end explained his own action  of course i didnt intend to help anybody sidestep justice when i took the kauffmans to the station because i heard the coroner say he had excused them  what about those raiders asked one of the jurors did you recognize the man who shot kauffmans horse  carmody interrupted we cant go into that that has no connection with the question which we are to settle which is who killed watson  seems to me there is a connection remarked rawlins if those raiders were the same people hanscom arrested in the cabin wouldnt it prove something as to their character  sure thing answered another of the jurors  a man who would shoot a horse like that might shoot a man pears to me said a third  all right said carmody mr hanscom you may answer did you recognize the man who fired that shot  no he was too far away but the horse he rode was a sorrelthe same animal which the cuneo girl rode  raines interrupted will you swear to that  no i wont swear to it but i think  raines was savage mr coroner we dont want what the witness thinkswe want what he knows  tell us what you know commanded carmody  i know this retorted hanscom the man who fired that shot rode a sorrel blazefaced pony and was a crack gunman to drop a running horse at that distance is pretty tolerable shooting and it ought to be easy to prove who the gunner was ive heard say henry kitsong  i object shouted raines and carmody sustained the objection  passing now to your capture of the housebreakers said he tell the jury how you came to arrest the girl  well as i entered the cabin the girl rita was sitting with her feet on a stool and the size and shape of her shoe soles appeared to me about the size and shape of the tracks made in the flour and i had just started to take one of her shoes in order to compare it with the drawings i carried in my pocketbook when busby jumped me i had to wear him out before i could go on but finally i made the comparison and found that the soles of her shoes fitted the tracks exactly then i decided to bring her down too  a stir of excited interest passed over the hall but raines checked it by asking did you compare the shoes with the actual tracks on the porch floor  no only with the drawings i had made in my notebook  raines waved his hand contemptuously that proves nothing we dont know anything about those drawings  i do retorted carmody and so does the jury but we can take that matter up later you can step down mr hanscom and well hear james b durgin  durgin a bent graybearded old rancher took the stand and swore that he had witnessed a hot wrangle between kauffman and watson and that he had heard the dutchman say ill get you for this  hanscom realizing that durgin was kitsongs chief new witness was quick to challenge his testimony and finally forced him to admit that watson had also threatened kauffman so that the total effect of his testimony was rather more helpful than harmful  is it not a matter of common report mr coroner demanded the ranger that watson has had many such quarrels i am told that he had at least one fierce row with busby  well come to that interjected carmody as durgin left the chair have you ritas shoes mr sheriff throop handed up a pair of womens shoes and carmody continued you swear these are the shoes worn by margarita cuneo when you took charge of her  i do  mr hanscom will you examine these shoes and say whether they are the ones worn by rita cuneo when you arrested her  hanscom took them i think they are the same but i cannot tell positively without comparing them with my drawings  the jury deeply impressed by this new and unexpected evidence minutely examined the shoe soles and compared them with the drawings while the audience waited in tense expectancy  they sure fit said the spokesman of the jury  raines objected even if they do seem to fit that is not conclusive we dont know when the tracks were made they may have been made after the murder or before  call rita cuneo said carmody to the sheriff  the girl came to the stand looking so scared so pale and so small that some of the women without realizing the importance of her testimony clicked their tongues in pity dear dear how young she is they exclaimed  carmody by means of a few rapid questions gently expressed drew out her name her age and some part of her family history and then with sudden change of manner bluntly asked  how did you happen to be in that cabin with those two men  pitifully at a loss she finally stammered out an incoherent explanation of how they were just riding by and saw the door standing open and went in not meaning any harm she denied knowing watson but admitted having met him on the road several times and hotly insisted that she had never visited his house in her life  where have you been living since leaving home  in the hills  where  at the sawmill  how long had you been there when you heard of watsons death  about two weeks  were you in camp  no we were staying in the old cabin by the creek  you mean busby and kitsong and yourself  yes sir  well now which one of these men did you leave home withbusby or kitsong  her head drooped and while she wavered raines interposed arguing that the question was not pertinent but carmody insisted and soon developed the fact that she was much more eager to defend busby than kitsong she denied that he had ever cursed watson or threatened to do him harm but the coroner forced her to admit that busby had told her of having had trouble with the dead man and then thrusting a pair of shoes at her he sternly asked  are these your shoes  no sir she firmly declared  her answer surprised hanscom and dazed the sheriff who exclaimed beneath his breath the little vixen  carmodys tone sharpened do you mean to tell me that these are not the shoes you wore in town yesterday  no i dont mean that  what do you mean  i mean theyre not my shoes they belong to that kauffman girl i found them in that cabin  hanscom sprang to his feet shes lying your honor  sit down shouted raines  the entire audience rose like a wave under the influence of the passion in these voices the sheriff shouted for silence and order and carmody hammered on his desk commanding everybody to be seated at last when he could be heard he rebuked hanscom  youre out of order he said and turning to raines requested him to take his seat  raines shook his fist at the ranger you cant address such remarks to a witness you sit down  hanscom was defiant i will subside when you do  sit down both of you roared carmody  they took seats but eyed each other like animals crouching to spring  carmody lectured them both and as he cooled hanscom apologized im sorry i spoke he said but the ownership of those shoes has got to be proved i know they belong to this girl  well come to that dont you worry said carmody and he turned to rita who was cowering in the midst of this uproar like a mountain quail who told you to deny the ownership of these shoes  nobody  just reasoned it out yourself eh he asked with acrid humor well youre pretty smart  the girl perceiving the importance of her denial enlarged upon it telling of her need of new shoes and of finding this dry warm pair in a closet in the cabin she described minutely the wornout places of her own shoes and how she had thrown them into the stove and burned them up and the audience listened with renewed conviction that the strange woman was the midnight prowler at the watson cabin and that rita and her companions were but mischievous hoodlums having no connection with the murder  hanscom filled with distrust of carmody demanded that the sheriff be called to testify on this point for he had made search of the cabin in the first instance  we proved at the other session that miss mclaren was unable to wear the shoes which made the prints  we deny that asserted raines that is just the point we are trying to make we dont know that this kauffman woman is unable to wear those shoes  carmody decided to call young kitsong and throop led rita away and soon returned with henry who came into the room looking like a trapped fox bewildered yet alert he was rumpled and dirty like one called from sleep in a corral but his face appealed to the heart of his mother who flung herself toward him with a piteous word of appeal eager to let him know that she was present and faithful  the sheriff stopped her and her husbandwhose parental love was much less vitalcalled upon her not to make a fool of herself  the boy gave his name and age and stated his relationship to the dead man but declared he had not seen him for months i didnt know he was dead till the ranger told me he said he denied that he had had any trouble with watson he is my uncle he added  ive known relatives to fight commented the coroner with dry intonation and several in the audience laughed for it was well known to them that the witness was at outs not only with his uncle but with his father  now henry said the coroner severely we know this girl rita made a night visit to watsons cabin we have absolute proof of it she did not go there alone who was with her did you accompany her on this trip  no sir  she never made that trip alone some man was with her if not you it must have been busby  a sullen look came into the boys face well it wasnt mei know that  was it busby  he paused for a long time debating what the effect of his answer would be he may of i cant say  carmody restated his proof that rita had been there and said one or the other of you went now which was it  the witness writhed like a tortured animal and at last said he did and mrs eli sighed with relief  carmody drew from him the fact that watson owed busby money and that he had vainly tried to collect it he would not say that rita left camp with busby but his keen anxiety to protect her was evident to every one in the room he admitted that he expected busby to have trouble with watson  mrs kitsong who saw with growing anxiety the drift of the coroners questioning called out tell him the truth henry the whole truth  raines silenced her savagely and carmody said so busby had tried to collect that money before had he  tell him yes henry shouted eli who was now quite as eager to shield his son as he had been to convict helen  carmody warned him to be quiet youll have a chance very soon to testify on this very point he said and repeated his question busby had had a fight with watson hadnt hea regular knockdown row  henry sweating with fear now confessed that busby had returned from watsons place furious with anger and this testimony gave an entirely new direction to the suspicions of the jurors several of whom knew busby as a tough customer  dismissing henry for the moment carmody recalled margarita you swear you never visited watsons cabin he began well suppose that i were to tell you that we know you did would you still deny it she looked at him in scared silence trying to measure the force of his question while he went on you mounted the front steps and went down the porch to the right pausing to peer into the window you kept on to the east end of the porch where you dropped to the ground and continued on around to the back door do you deny that  amazed by the accuracy of his information and awed by his tone the girl struggled for an answer while the audience waited as at a crisis in a powerful play  then the coroner snapped out well what were you doing there  she looked at henry then at mrs eli i went to borrow some blankets she confessed in a voice so low that only a few heard her words  was watson at home  yes  did you see him  yes  what did he say  at this point she became tearful and the most that could be drawn from her was a statement that watson had refused to loan or sell her any blankets she denied that busby was with her and insisted that she was alone till carmody convinced her that she was only making matters worse by such replies  your visit was at night he said you would never have walked in that flour in the daytime and you wouldnt have gone there alone in the night busby wouldnt have permitted you to go to watsons alonehe knew watson too well the force of this remark was felt by nearly every person in the room  hanscom said mr coroner this girl is trying to shield busby and i want her confronted by him and i want eli kitsong called  by this time many admitted that they might have been mistaken in accusing the kauffmans of the deed  busby a powerful young fellow made a bad impression on the stand his face was both sullen and savage and the expression of his eyes furtive he was plainly on guard even before raines warned him to be careful  my name is hart busby he said in answer to carmody im twentysix years old i was born in the east ive been here eight years here he stopped refusing to say where his parents lived or when he first met margarita he flatly denied having had any serious trouble with watson and declared that he had not seen him for almost a year  what were you doing in the kauffmans cabin demanded hanscom you wont deny my finding you there will you  he told the same story that rita had sworn to we were riding by and saw that the place was deserted and so we went in to look around  when did you first hear of watsons death asked carmody  the witness hesitated a look of doubt of evasion in his eyes why the ranger told us  which of you owns that sorrel horse asked one of the jury  raines again interposed you neednt answer that he warned thats not before the court  carmody went on now busby you might as well tell us the truth henry and rita both state that watson had refused to pay you and that you had a scrap and watson kicked you off the place is that true  raines rescued him you dont have to answer that he said and the witness breathed an almost inaudible sigh of relief  a violent altercation arose at this point between the coroner and the lawyer carmody insisted on his right to ask any question he saw fit and raines retorted that the witness had a right to refuse to incriminate himself  you stick to your bread pills and vials he said to the coroner and dont assume a knowledge of the law you become ridiculous when you do  i know my powers retorted carmody in high resentment and you keep a civil tongue in your head or ill fine you for contempt i may not know all the ins and outs of court procedure but im going to see justice done and im going to see that you keep your place  you cant steamroll me roared raines  the argument became so hot that throop was forced to interfere and in the excitement and confusion of the moment busby mad a dash for the door and would have escaped had not hanscom intercepted him the room was instantly in an uproar several of busbys friends leaped to his aid and for a few minutes it seemed as if the coroners court had resolved itself into an arena for battling bears busby fought desperately and might have gained his freedom after all had not rawlins taken a hand  at last throop came into action stop that he shouted and fetched busby a blow that ended his struggles for the moment let go of him hanscom he said ill attend to him  hanscom and rawlins fell back and throop placing one huge paw on the outlaws shoulder shoved the muzzle of a revolver against his neck  now you calm right down young man and remember youre in court and not in a barroom  raines still unsubdued shouted out you take your gun away from that man you big stiff  silence bellowed carmody ill have you removed if you utter another word  i refuse to take orders from a pillpusher like you  sheriff seat that man commanded carmody white with wrath  throop thrusting busby back into his chair advanced upon raines with ponderous menace sit down you old skunk  dont you touch me snarled the lawyer  out you go said throop with a clutch at the defiant mans throat  raines reached under his coattails for a weapon but rawlins caught him from behind and throop throwing his arms around his shoulders in a bearlike hug carried him to his chair and forced him into it  now will you be quiet  the whole room was silent now silent as death with a dozen men on their feet with weapons in their hands waiting to see if raines would rise  breaking this silence carmody lifted by excitement to unusual eloquence cried out gentlemen i call upon you to witness that i am in no way exceeding my authority the dignity of this court must be upheld he turned to the jury who were all on end and warlike i call upon you to witness the insult which mr raines has put on this court and unless he apologizes he will be ejected from the room  raines saw that he had gone too far and with a wry face and contemptuous tone of voice muttered an apology which was in spirit an insult but carmody accepted the letter of it with a warning that he would brook no further displays of temper  when the coroner resumed his interrogation of busby whose sullen calm had given place to a look of alarm and desperation he refused to speak one word in answer to questions and at last carmody ordering him to take a seat in the room called mrs eli kitsong to the chair  she was a thin pale little woman with a nervous twitch on one side of her face and the excitement through which she had just passed rendered her almost speechless but she managed to tell the jury that busby and watson had fought and that she had warned her son not to run with hart busby  i knew hed get him into trouble she said i told henry not to go with him but he went away with him in spite of all i could say  did you actually see the fight between busby and watson  no i only heard ed tell about it  did he say busby threatened to kill him  yes he did but he laughed and said he was not afraid of a fool kid like him  busby was deeply disturbed he sat staring at the floor moistening his lips occasionally with the tip of his tongue as the coroner called one after another of his neighbors to testify against him the feeling that carmody was on the right track spread through the audience but abe insisted that the kauffmans be called to the stand and to this hanscom added  i join in that demand call miss mclaren i want the ownership of these shoes settled once and for all  in the tone of one making a concession carmody said very well mr sheriff take busby out and ask miss mclaren to step this way  as the young ruffian was led out rita sprang up as if to follow him but carmody restrained her stay where you are i want you to confront miss mclaren  a stir a sigh of satisfaction passed over the room and every eye was turned toward the door through which helen must approach not one of all the townfolk and few of the countryfolk had ever seen her face or heard her voice to them she was a woman of mystery and for the most part a woman of dark repute capable of any enormity they believed that she had been living a hermit life simply and only for the reason that she had been driven out of the east by the authorities and most of them believed that the man she was living with was her paramour  every preconception of her was of this savage sort and so when the sheriff reappeared ushering in a tall composed and handsome young woman whose bearing as well as her features suggested education and refinement the audience stared in dumb amazement  hanscom and rawlins both rose to their feet and carmody moved by a somewhat similar respect and admiration followed their example he went further he indicated with a bow the chair in which she was to sit while the jurors with open mouths followed her every movement they could not believe that this was the same woman they had examined at the previous session of the court  hanscom without considering her costume as designed to produce an impressionhe was too loyal for thatexulted in its perfectly obvious effect on the spectators and glowed with confidence over the outcome  she looked taller fairer and younger in her graceful gown and her broad hatwhich was in sharpest contrast to the sunbonnet which had so long been her disguiselent a girlish piquancy to her glance mrs brinkley expressed in one short phrase the change of sentiment which swept almost instantly over the room why shes a lady she gasped  carmody while not so sure the witnesss costume was unpremeditated nevertheless acknowledged its power he opened his examination with an apology for thus troubling her a second time and explained that new witnesses and new evidence made it necessary  she accepted his apology with grave dignity and in answer to questions by raines admitted that kauffman had told her of his clash with watson over some cattle  but he never threatened to shoot watson he is not quarrelsome on the contrary he is very gentle and patient and only resented watsons invasion of our home  upon being shown the shoes which rita cuneo had worn she sharply answered  no they are not mine i could not wear them they are much too small for me  this answer though fully expected by hanscom and the coroner sent another wave of excitement over the audience and when carmody said almost apologetically miss mclaren will you kindly try on these shoes the women in the room rose from their seats in access of interest and loud cries of down in front arose from those behind them  seemingly without embarrassment yet with heightened color helen removed one of her shoesa plain low walkingshoeand handed it to carmody who received it with respectful care and handed it to the foreman of the jury asking him to make comparison of it with the footprints  the jurors two by two examined measured muttered while the audience waited in growing impatience for their report most of the onlookers believed this to be a much more important test than it really was and when at last the foreman returned the shoe saying this aint the shoe that made the tracks the courtroom buzzed with pleased comment  raines was on his feet mr coroner we demand that the witness try on that other pair of shoes we are not convinced that she cannot wear them  carmody yielded and the room became very quiet as helen with noticeable effort wedged her foot into the shoe  i cannot put it on it is too small she said to carmody and rita who sat near bent a terrified gaze upon her  raines then called out shes playing off have her stand up  hanscom furious at this indignity protested that it was not necessary but helen rose and drawing aside the hem of her skirt calmly offered her foot for inspection  i cant possibly walk in it she said addressing the jury  one by one the jury clumsily knelt and examined her foot then returned to their seats and when the foreman said that never was her shoe a part of the audience applauded his utterance as conclusive  that will do miss mclaren said carmody you may step down and turning sharply to where rita sat with open mouth and dazed glance he demanded do you know what the court calls your testimony its perjury thats what it is do you know what we can do to you we can shut you up in jail these shoes are yours are you ready to say so now  she shrank from him and her eyes fell  raines intervened you are intimidating the witness he protested  carmody repeated his question are these your shoes  yes sir she faintly answered a sigh of relief a ripple of applause again interrupted the coroner  hanscom rose mr coroner in view of this testimony i move miss mclaren be excused from further attendance on this court  the unmistakable rush of sympathy toward helen moved carmody to dramatize the moment miss mclaren he said with judicial poise i am convinced that you are not a material witness in this case you are dismissed  the hearty handclapping of a majority of the auditors followed and helen was deeply touched her voice was musical with feeling as she said  thank you sir i am very grateful is my father also excused  unless the jury wishes to question him  the jurors conferred and finally the spokesman said i dont think well need him  very well then you are both free  mrs brinkley a roundfaced freshcomplexioned little woman who had been sitting near the front seat made a rush for helen eager to congratulate her and invite her to dinner others both men and women followed and for a time all business was suspended it was evident that helen had in very truth been on trial for murder and that the coroners dismissal was in effect her acquittal hanscom on the edge of the throng waited impatiently for an opportunity to present rawlins raines and kitsong excitedly argued  meanwhile the jury and the coroner were in conference and at last carmody called for the finding we believe that the late edward watson came to his death at the hands of one hart busby with henry kitsong and margarita cuneo knowing to it and we move that they be held to the grand jury for trial at the next term of court drawled the foreman and sat down  no one applauded now but a murmur of satisfaction passed over the room eli and abe sprang up in excited clamor and raines made violent protest against the injustice of the verdict  its all irregular he shouted  carmody remained firm this finding will stand he said the court is adjourned  raines immediately made his way to hanscom and laid a hand on his shoulder in that case he said ill take you into camp mr sheriff i have a warrant for this mans arrest  hanscom was not entirely surprised but he resented their haste to humiliate him before the crowdand before helen dont do that now he protested wait an hour or two wait till i can get miss mclaren and her father out of the country i give you my word ill not run away  carmody seeing raines with his hand on the rangers arm understood what it meant and hurried over to urge a decent delay let him put the girl on the train he said  ill give him two hours said raines and not a minute more  hanscom glanced at helen and was glad of the fact that being surrounded by her women sympathizers she had seen and heard nothing of the enemys new attack upon him   ix  helen and the ranger left the room together and no sooner were they free from the crowd than she turned to him with a smile which expressed affection as well as gratitude  how much we owe to you and dr carmody and what a sorry interruption weve caused in your work  he protested that the interruption had been entirely a pleasure but she while knowing nothing of his impending arrest was fully aware that he had undergone actual hardship for her sake and her plan for hurrying away seemed at the moment most ungracious yet this after all was precisely what she now decided to do  is there time for us to catch that eastbound express she asked  her words chilled his heart with a quick sense of impending loss but he looked at his watch yes if it should happen to be late as it generally is then forgetting his parole in a voice which expressed more of his pain than he knew he said i hate to see you go cant you wait another day  his pleading touched a vibrant spot in her but she was resolved i have an almost insane desire to get away she hurriedly explained i am afraid of this country its people scare me a quick change in her voice indicated a new thought i hope the kitsongs will not continue in pursuit of you  they wont have a chance to do that he replied gloomily im leaving too i have resigned  oh no you mustnt do that  i turned in my papers this morning he suddenly recalled his parole i shall soon be freei hopeto go anywhere and do anythingand id like to keep in touch with youif youll let me  she evaded him i shall be very sorry if we are the cause of your leaving the service  well you arebut not in the way you mean you have made me discontented with myself thats all and im going to get out of the tall timber and see if i cant do something in the big world i want to win your respect  i respect you now your work as a forester seems to me very fine and honorable  the work is all right but im leaving it just the same i cant see a future in it fact is i begin to long for a home that lunch in your cabin started me on a new line of thought  the memory of his visit to her garden in the valley seemed now like a chapter in the story of a faroff community and she could hardly relate herself to the hermit girl who served the tea but the foresterwhom she recognized as a loverwas becoming every moment nearer more insistent a time of reckoning was at hand and because she could not meet it she was eager to escapeto avoid the giving of pain his face and voice had become dearand might grow dearer therefore she made no comment on his statement of a desire for a home and he asked  dont you feel like going back to your garden once more  no she answered sharply i never want to see the place again it is repulsive to me  again a little silence intervened i hate to think of your posies perishing for lack of care he said with gentle sadness if i can ill ride over once in a while and see that they get some water  his words exerted a magical power she began to weaken in resolution it was not an easy thing to sever the connection which had been so strangely established between herself and this good friend who seemed each moment to be less the simple mountaineer she had once believed him to be western he was forthright and rough hewn but he had shown himself a man in every emergencya candid strong man her throat filled with emotion but she walked beside him in silence  he had another care on his mind youd better let me round up your household goods he suggested  oh no let them go theyre not worth the effort  he insisted i dont like to think of any one else having them it made me hot just to see that girl playing your guitar ill have em all brought down and stored somewhere you may want em some time  she was rather glad to find they had reached the door of carmodys office and that further confidences were impossible for she was discovering herself to be each moment deeper in his debt and correspondingly less able to withstand his wistful shy demand  mrs carmody a short fat excited person met them in the hall with a cackle of alarm im awfully glad youve come she exclaimed your father has been taken with a cramp or something  helen paled with apprehension of disaster for she knew that her father had been keenly suffering all the morning here i am daddy she cheerily called as she entered the room its all right the inquest is over and we are free to go  kauffman who was lying on a couch in a corner of the office turned his face and bravely smiled im glad he weakly replied i was afraid they would call me to the stand again  kneeling at his side she studied his face with anxious care are you worse daddy has your pain increased  yes nellie it is worse i fear i am to be very ill  she took his hand in hers a pang of remorseful pity wrenching her heart dont say that daddy she gently chided keep your good courage she looked up at the ranger who stood near with troubled brow mr hanscom will you please find dr carmody and tell him my father needs him  with a quick word of assurance he hurried away and the girl bending to the care of her stepfather suffered from a full realization of the fact that he had been brought to this condition by the strength of his devotion to her for my sake he exiled himself for me he has been assaulted wounded arrestedand looking down upon him in the light of her recovered sense of values she became very humble  dear old daddy she wailed its all my fault what can i do to make amends youve sacrificed so much for me  sick as he was the old man did his best to comfort her but she was still sitting on the floor with head bowed in troubled thought when hanscom and carmody hurried in her relief made manifest by the instant movement with which she gave way to him was almost childlike  oh doctor im glad to see you she cried out i was afraid your legal duties might keep you  luckily my legal duties are over he replied quickly and im glad of it i hope i neverll have another such case  a brief examination convinced him that the sick man should be put to bed and he suggested the palace hotel which stood but a few doors away  he cant travel today he added knowing that helen had planned to take the train  kauffman insisted on going i can walk he said firmly i feel a little dizzy but ill be all right in the coach  hanscom was at his side supporting him youd better wait a day he said gently and helen understood and sided with him  together they helped the sick man to the door and into the doctors car and in a few minutes kauffman was stretched upon a good bed in a pleasant room with a deep sigh of relief he laid his head upon the soft pillow  i am glad not to entrain today he said tomorrow will be better for us all  never mind about tomorrow said hanscom you rest as easy as you can  helen followed carmody into the hall tell me the truth she demanded is he injured internally  its hard to say what his injuries are he cautiously replied hes badly bruised and feverish but it may be nothing serious however he cant travel for a few days thats certain  she was not entirely reassured by his reply and her voice was bitterly accusing as she said if he should die i would never forgive myself he came here on my account  theres no immediate danger he seems strong and will probably throw this fever off in a few hours but he must be kept quiet and cheerful  there was a rebuke in his final words and she accepted it as such ill do the best i can doctor she replied and returned to her duty  hanscom divining some part of the passion of selfaccusation into which the girl had been thrown eagerly asked is there something more i can do  if you will have our bags brought i shall be grateful we may not be able to leave for several days  ill attend to them at once buthe looked aside as if afraid of revealing somethingi may be called away during the afternoon on business and if i am dont think im neglecting you  how long will you be gone  i cant tellfor a day or two perhaps  the thought of his going gave her a sharp pang of prospective loneliness i know you must return to your work she said slowly but i shall feel very helpless without you and the voicing of her dependence upon him added definiteness and power to her regret  he hastened to say i wont go if i can possibly help it be sure of that but something has come up which may make it necessary for me toto take a trip ill return as soon as i can ill hurry away now and bring your baggage that much i can surely do and he went out leaving her greatly troubled by something unexplained in the manner of his going  stopping at carmodys hanscom again thanked him for his kindness and warned him not to say one word to helen about his fight with abe nor about the warrant that was hanging over him  she has enough to worry about as it is he said and if they get me as they will i want you to look after her and let me know how she gets on  carmody did not attempt to minimize the seriousness of the opposition abe can make a whole lot of trouble for you in one way and another and even if you shake him off youre in for a settlement with old cuneo who will reach here tonight as near as i can discover hes one of those popeyed foreigners whod just as soon use a knife as not and abe will do his best to spur him into jumping you  well looks like hell have hard work reaching me for unless somebody goes my bail im likely to be safe in the cooler when he gets here  carmody had been decidedly friendly all through this troublesome week and here was a good place for him to say ill go your bail hans but he didnthe couldnt he was poor and not very secure in his position so he let hanscom go out and took up his own work with a feeling that he was playing a poor part in a rough game  the news of kauffmans illness reached kindly mrs brinkley and moved her to call upon helen to offer her services and in the midst of her polite condolences she said mr hanscoms arrest must have infuriated you it did me  helen turned a startled glance upon her visitor i didnt know he was arrested  didnt you well he is said mrs brinkley  why that cant be true he was here less than an hour ago  hes just been arrested for assaulting kitsong  helen still unable to believe in this calamity stammered but i dont understand when did hewhen was kitsongassaulted  last night replied her visitor with relish and you were the cause of itin a way  i  so the story goes it seems abe got nasty about you and mr hanscom resented it they had a fight and abe was hurt unless somebody bails him out the poor ranger will have to go to jail  the memory of the rangers last look completed helens understanding of the situation and she listened abstractedly while her visitor rattled on  of course the judge cant do anything much as he likes mr hanscom and i really dont see who is to go on his bond he hasnt any relatives here  at this point helen raised her head and interrupted her guests commiserating comment yes you can do something for me i wish you would ask mr willing the vicepresident of the first national bank to come over here i want to consult him on a most important business matter and i cannot leave my father will you do this  certainly with pleasure i was hoping to be of use said mrs brinkley and she went away greatly wondering what this strange young woman could possibly want of mr willing  helen with eyes fixed on her fathers still form went over every look and word the ranger had uttered and understood at last that the little trip he feared was a sentence to the county jail she was still in profound thought when mr willing was announced he was a neat small man whose position in the bank was largely social being a friend of mrs brinkley and keenly interested in the reports of helens romantic appearance in the courtroom he came to her door in smiling and elaborate courtliness  helen coldly checked his gallant advances mr willing she said with businesslike brevity i have an account with the walnut hills trust company of cincinnati and i want a part of that money transferred by telegraph to my credit in your bank can it be done  it is possibleyes  i need these funds at once i must have them will you please wire mr paul lyford president of the company and have five thousand dollars transferred to my credit in your bank  mr willing was cautious he took the name and address i will see what can be done he said noncommittally is there anything else i can do  yes i have just heard that mr hanscom has been arrested if this is true i want him bailed out as soon as possible i dont know how these things are done but i want to go on his bond he should have a lawyer also he has fallen into this trouble entirely on my account and i cannot permit him to suffer he must be defended  ill do what i can responded willing but of course the matter of release on bail lies with the judge  what judge  probably judge brinkley  i am glad of that mr hanscom knows judge brinkley as soon as you hear from mr lyford let me know please  meanwhile hanscom had been stopped while bringing the valises to the hotel and was now in throops care each hour seemed to involve the ranger deeper ever deeper in his slough of troubles for it was reported that cuneo had phoned in from the cambria powerdam saying he would reach the town in two hours and one who had talked with him said the receiver burned his ear so hot was the sheepmans wrath  helen greatly troubled in an agony of impatience awaited willings return and the housekeeper of the hotel who came to offer her advice did not help to tranquillity  its a good thing the rangers locked up she said for old cuneo father of the girl is in town and on the rangers trail with blood in his eye  of course the eager gossip did not know that the ranger and this handsome girl were something more than acquaintances hence she felt free to enlarge upon and embroider each scrap of rumor after the fashion of her kind and helen had great difficulty in concealing her increasing anxiety and selfaccusation  dont say any of these things in my fathers hearing she sharply urged he must be kept free from excitement  it was a singular a most revealing experience for helen to find that her deepening care for her stepfather and a grave sense of responsibility toward hanscom were bringing out decision and determination in her own character she increased in vigor and perception they shall not persecute this man because he is poor and alone she declared recalling with keen sense of pity his frank statement that all his property consisted of a couple of ponies a saddle and a typewriter  she could not leave her father till a nurse came and as there was no telephone in her room she could only waitwait and think and in this thinking she gave large space to the forester her apathy her bitterness were both gone she was no longer the recluse the mood which had made her a hermit now seemed both futile and morbidand yet she was not ready to return to her friends and relatives in the east that life she had also put away what if i were to make a new homesomewhere in the west she said and in this speculation the worshipful face of the ranger came clear before her eyes  she was restless and aching with inaction when a hallboy announced the return of mr willing and stepping into the hall she discovered an entirely different mr willing he was no longer gallant he was quietly respectful with congratulatory word he handed to her two telegrams one addressed to her the other to the bank one was from the president of the walnut hills trust company it read place five thousand dollars to miss mclarens credit see that she wants for nothing report if she needs help her family is greatly alarmed any information concerning her will be deeply appreciated ask her to report at once  the other was to helen from mr lyford whom she had known for many years as she read her face flushed and her eyes misted then a glowing tide of power a sense of security swept over her  after all i am alive and young and rightful owner of this money she said to herself i will claim it and use it for some good purpose and at this moment what better purpose than to see that a brave good man shall not lie in prison and thanking the banker for his aid she added if mr rawlins the supervisor is still in town i wish you would find him and ask him to come to me tell him i want to see him immediately  willing took occasion as he went through the hotel office downstairs to call the proprietor aside and say anything miss mclaren wants youd better supply shes able to pay  the landlord who had shared the general suspicion abroad in the community stared are you sure of that i was just wondering about these folks they have the reputation of being as poor as jobs off ox  you neednt worry the girl has a balance in our bank of several thousand dollars  you dont tell me exclaimed the landlord  willing went on smoothly better give her the parlor and put an extension phone in for her use she needs a trained nurse but ill attend to that if youll see to the phone  in theory we all despise money in fact we find it of wondrous potency behold this hotelkeeper mentally taking his feet from his desk and removing his hat when he learned that one of these hermits had unlimited credit at the bank mr willings cashier was also deeply impressed and puzzled  what did such a girl mean by living away up there with that shellfish gang of rustlers and counterfeiters whats the idea he asked irritably she certainly has acted like a flybynight up to this time  well shes established herself now her connections are first class willing rejoined heres another telegram from louisville asking full information concerning miss mclaren and arnold kauffman they dont stop at expense evidently they have all been in the dark about the girls whereabouts and want the facts some story to put into a telegram but ill do my best  dont scare em cautioned knight say shes all right and surrounded by friends  willing took his turn at smiling didnt look that way this morning did it but shes all right nowexcept that shes terribly wrought up over hanscoms predicament  well no wonder as near as i can figger hes stood by her like a brotherinlaw and the least she can do is to stick around and help him out  conditions between helen and the ranger were now precisely reversed it was she who was eagerly trying to save him from the prison cell she was alarmed also by the prediction made by the housekeeper that if the ranger were released on bail he would only be out of the fryingpan into the fire for old cuneo would surely meet him and demand satisfaction  perhaps if i were to see cuneo she thought i could persuade him that mr hanscom had no wish to involve margaritathat her arrest was only in a way incidental to busbys capture  she said nothing of this resolution but sent a note to throop requesting him to let rawlins know that she was ready to bail hanscom it will be a great injustice if he is held on my account  throop replied in person for he liked helen and was eager to do hanscom a favor yes he said hans is in jail but not in a cell and i think rawlins will succeed in reaching the judge and so get out the writ this afternoon  is there not some way for me to help how much bail is needed  well all depends on the judge the charge the kitsongs bring is pretty serious they call it assault with a deadly weapon and ill have to testify that hans was armed when i came into the scrapand yet simpson says he left the hotel without his gunsimpson declares hanscom said im safer without it i might fly mad and hurt somebody with it as i say i didnt see the beginning of the battle but when i broke into it peared to me more like a dozen armed men were attacking hans they had him jammed up against the wall he was fighting madi must admit that and later he had a gun where he got it i dont know however that shouldnt count against him for he was only defending himself as any citizen has a right to do  surely the judge will take that into account  he will but you see the witnesses are mostly all abes friends and then hans did begin ithe admits he jolted abe however the case will come up before brinkley and hes friendly hell do all he can  could i see himi mean the judge  better not judges are fairly testy about being seen it would look badespecially after it got noised around that you had money to spend on the case  anyhow mr rawlins must let me relieve him of the financial part of the burden it may not be easy for him to sign such a bond  it isnt easynow thats the truth admitted throop you see hes only a young fellow on a salary and it means a whole lot to a man just starting a home he might have to pledge his entire outfit  dont let him do thathe mustnt do that tell him that i will assume all the hazard  throop extended a big paw in a gesture of admiration and his throat needed clearing before he spoke youre all right he said hans is in big luck to have you on his side  she submitted to his grip with a fine glow in her face i must be on his side for he has been on my side all along he was the one soul in all this land that i could trust  throops statement concerning rawlins was right to put up a thousanddollar bond was a serious matter it meant pledging his whole fortune and the case was made the more serious by reason of the probable disapproval of the district office and yet he liked hanscom too well not to do all he could for him hanscom who realized quite clearly his former chiefs predicament urged him not to sign  the office wont like it jackespecially as i have quit the work  they were in the midst of a heated discussion of this point in throops office when the sheriff returned from his interview with helen he entered wearing a broad smile  ive got something for you mr supervisor ive got you a date with the handsomest girl in the county  rawlins remained calm theres only one girl in the world for me and shes in cambria getting supper for me however im interested who is the lady  throop dropped his humorous mask miss mclaren wants to see you shes fairly anxious about hanswants to go on his bond with you or instead of you  hanscom gazed at the sheriff in silence but rawlins exclaimed bless the girl thats fine of her but does she realize what going on this bond means  she does and shes willing to back hans with two thousand dollars if necessary  rawlins frankly astonished asked two thousand dollars has she got it  she has and a good deal more willing of the first national has been in touch with her people back east and apparently theres no end to what theyre ready to do for her somebody a brother or cousin has come to her rescue like a savingsbank hans you do beat the devil for luck i was ready to congratulate you beforenow i am just plumb lowdown envious  so far from filling the forester with joy this news threw him into dark despair if helen turned out to be rich his case was even more hopeless than he had imagined it to be it was sweet to be so defended so rescued but it was also disheartening with wealth added to the grace which he adored in her she was lifted far beyond his reach  dont let her go on the bond he said at last its splendid of her but if she does that she will be kept here and i know she is crazy to get away and we must not let her any deeper into this muss of mine  rawlins rose well ill go see her anyway im for letting her help out if shes able and feels like it  throop followed him out and down the walk that girls getting terribly interested in hansand she has a right to be no man could have put in better work for a woman than he did for her she says its all her faultand so it is in a way he chuckled rather dashes him to find out shes a moneyed person dont it but whats the odds he neednt complain if she dont  helens deepening interest in the forester expressed itself in the pleasure she took in discussing with rawlins the means of setting him free  all you have to do the supervisor explained is to appear before the judge deposit a certified check and sign the paper which the law demands  let us go at once she said my father is sleeping now and the housekeeper will sit with him i can slip away for an hour  the sooner the quicker agreed rawlins  while she was gone on a cautious inspection of the sickroom a messengerboy came to the door with a telegram gee but the company is doing business today he remarked to rawlins with a grin heres another fat one  rawlins gently pushed him into the hall thatll do for you son he said fat or thin you deliver your goods and keep still  the message was indeed a fat one and came helen said from a sister in chicago and expressed great anxiety to know exactly what conditions were do you need me the writer demanded if you do i will start at once let us hear from you we are all very anxious  though visibly affected by this appeal helens reply was brief no need of you i am well and returning east soon have all i need  this she handed in to the operator herself as she and rawlins were on the way to judge brinkleys office and then with the thought of possibly getting away in a day or two she asked of rawlins when will mr hanscoms trial come off  not for several weeks i fear unless we can do something to have it put forward you see theyve all conspired to make it a case for the county court but the judge may be able to throw it back into the justice court where it really belongs at the worst hans should only be fined but of course we cant say a word we can only wait till the hearing  a few hours ago she would have been fiercely impatient at this prospect of delay but now most strangely she found herself accepting without protest a further stay in the town for it came as a part of her pledged service in the aid of an unselfish young man and she was definitely distinctly moved at the thought of helping him  by the way mr rawlins i notice you call mr hanscom hans is that his christian name  oh no thats only his nickname he signs his reports l j hanscom i think his real name is lawrence i dont know why everybody calls him hansprobably because he is so friendly and helpful everybody likes him except that shellfish valley crowd and they feel i suppose that i put him down here to keep tab on them which is the fact theyre a nest of bad onesa lot of holdovers from the pastand would have frozen him out long ago if they could  knowing the rangers first name seemed to bring him still nearer and she began to feel a little uneasy about the way in which he might take her share in his liberation suppose he should misread it  on the street corner near the judges office they encountered a dozen men grouped around a small dark middleaged citizen with very black hair a long mustache and a fumedoak complexion who seemed to be monologuing for the enlightenment of the crowd he looked like a mexican or some exile from the south of europe and as helen and rawlins paused for a moment they heard him say in a voice of pathetic softness i blame nobody but heem hart busby he steal my girl away i have no fight with any one else  this was the dreaded cuneo the father of margarita whose coming promised death to the ranger the imaginary savage with ready knife the infuriated giant with blazing eyes gave place to the actuality of this gentle stricken melancholy little sheepherder who had no insane desire to avenge himself on any one much less on hanscom helens resolution to meet and placate the dreaded basque gave place to pity and a sense of relief  rawlins viewed the matter humorously and laughed softly hans neednt worry about that little mongrel  he has sufferedhe is suffering now helen replied i wish he might have his girl and take her home  judge brinkleys chambers consisted of two large rooms stacked with lawbooks to the ceiling and in the outer one a couple of roughlooking men and a discouragedlooking little woman were sitting waiting for an interview ordinarily helen would have passed the woman without a second thought now she wondered what her legal troubles might be  the judge gave precedence to helen and the supervisor and invited them to his private office at once although he had some inkling of the romantic attachment between the ranger and this fine young woman he did not presume upon it in any way even in his answer to her questions  i hardly think a serious case can be made out against hanscom he said but you will soon know for a preliminary hearing will be granted within a day or two meanwhile he added i am very glad to issue an order for his liberation on bond  helen thanked him most warmly and with the writ of release in hand rawlins asked if she would not like to present it to the sheriff himself at first she declined thinking of her own embarrassment but as she recalled the unhesitating action with which hanscom had always acted in her affairs she changed her mind and consented and with her consent came a strong desire to let him know that her gratitude had in it something personal secretly she acknowledged a wish to see his rugged serious face light up with the relief which the release would bring his mouth she remembered was singularly refined and his smile winning  on the way rawlins spoke of hanscoms resignation in terms of sincere regret if he will only stay in the service i am sure he will be promoted but i cannot blame him for feeling lonely  at the jail door helens selfconsciousness increased mightily her resolution almost failed her  what will he think of me coming to him in this way was the question which disturbed her and she was deeply flushed and her pulse quickened as rawlins quite unconscious of her sudden panic led the way into the sheriffs office and with eager haste presented her to throop who greeted her with the smile and gesture of an old acquaintance  the supervisor lost no time weve come on business he said we want hanscom mr sheriff this young lady has gone on his bond in my stead and here is an order for his release signed by judge brinkley  throop was genuinely pleased hah im glad of that he said as he took the paper after a moments glance at it he said all right you can have the body go into the parlor and ill send him in to you  helen obeyed silently knowing that rawlins would remain in the officewhich he didleaving her to receive the ranger alone  he came in with eyes alight with worship im heartily obliged to you he said boyishly i thought i was in for a week or two of cell life and reflection  she met his gratitude with instant protest please dont thank me i am only repaying a little of our debt wont you be seated she added acting the part of hostess in her embarrassment of course i dont mean that you must be anxious to leave this place  i was but im not so anxious now how is mr kauffman  much easier he was sleeping when i left  im glad of that hes had a hard week and so have you and yethe hesitatedyou are looking well in spite of it all  that is the strange part of it she admitted i am stronger and happier than i have been for two years i have just heard from my family in the east  his eyes became grave then you will go back to them  i think so but not at oncenot till after your trialit would be grossly ungrateful for me to go now i shall wait till you are free  his fine clear serious eyes were steadily fixed upon her face as she said this and she knew that he was extracting from every word and tone their full meaning and it frightened her a little  at last he said in a voice which was tense with emotion then i hope i shall never be free  she hastened to lessen this tension the judge has promised to grant you a hearing soon mr rawlins thinks it only a case for justice court anyway she rose but let me see mrs throop for a few minutes and then we will go  wait a moment he pleaded but she would not stay her courseshe dared not  they found mrs throop in the hall discussing the interesting situation with rawlins and when helen extended her hand and began to thank her again for her kindness the matron cut her short never mind that now i want you should all stay to supper  helen expressed regret and explained that it was necessary to return to the bedside of her father and so they managed to get away although mrs throop followed them to the door inviting them both to come again she saw no humor in this though the men had their joke about it  rawlins discreetly dropped back into the office and the two young people passed on into the street  you must let me watch with your father tonight hanscom said ive been a nursealong with the rest of my experiences  if i need you i shall certainly call upon you and if you need money you must call upon me  there was something warmer than friendship in her voice but the ranger was a timid man in any matter involving courtship and he dared not presume on anything so vague as the change of a tone or the quality of a smile nevertheless he said  i cannot imagine how it happens that you are here in this rough country but i am glad you are i shall be glad all my lifeeven if you go away and forget me  i shall not forget you she replied not for what youve done but for what you are and in this declaration lay a profound significance which the man seized and built upon  i am not even a forest ranger now i am nothing but a duband youthey say are richbut some day im going to be something else i havent any rightto ask anything of younot a thing but i musti cant think of you going entirely out of my life i want you to let me write to you may i do that  her answer was unexpected you once spoke of getting a transfer to a forest near denver if you should do that you might see me occasionallyfor i may make my home in colorado springs  he stopped and they faced each other does that mean that you want me to stay in the service  her face was pale but her eyes were glowing yes  his glance penetrated deeper and you will wait for me  as long as you think it necessary she answered with a smile whose meaning did not at once make itself felt but when it did he reached his hand as one man to another she took it smiling up at him in full understanding of the promise she had made  right here i make a new start he said  i shall begin a new life also she replied and they walked on in silence     afterword   have you seen sunsets so beautiful that your heart ached to watch them fade so my heart aches to see the trails fading from the earth  as i reenter the mountain forest i am a reactionary i would restore every hillstream to its former beauty if i could i would carry forward every sign every symbol of the border in order that the children of the future should not be deprived of any part of their nations epic westward march  i here make acknowledgment to the trail and the trailmakers they have taught me much i have lifted the latchstring of the lonely shack and broken bread with the red hunter i know the varied voices of the coyote wizard of the mesa the trail has strung upon it as upon a silken cord opalescent dawns and ruby sunsets my campingplaces return in the music of gold and amber streams the hunter the miner the prospector have been my companions and my tutorsand what they have given me i hold with jealous hand  the high trail leads away to shadowdappled pools it enables me to overtake the things vanishing to enter the deserted cabin to bend to the rude fireplace and to blow again upon the embers gray with ashes till a flame leaps out and shadows of mournful beauty dance upon the wall  i am glad that i was born early enough to hear the songs of the trailers and to bask in the light of their fires  illustration signature hamlin garland
