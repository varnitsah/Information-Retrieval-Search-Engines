chapter i  the arrangements   gentlemen and ladies at the hotels in london generally dine about six or seven oclock each party or family by themselves in their own private parlor one evening about eight oclock just after the waiter had removed the cloth from the table where rollos father and mother with rollo himself and his cousin jennie had been dining and left the table clear mr holiday rose and walked slowly and feeblyfor he was quite out of health though much better than he had beentowards a secretary which stood at the side of the room  now said he we will get out the map and the railway guide and see about the ways of getting to france  rollo and jennie were at this time at the window looking at the vehicles which were passing by along the strand the strand is a street of london and one of the most lively and crowded of them all as soon as rollo heard his father say that he was going to get the map and the railway guide he said to jane  lets go and see  so they both went to the table and there kneeling up upon two cushioned chairs which they brought forward for the purpose they leaned over upon the table where their father was spreading out the map and thus established themselves very comfortably as spectators of the proceedings  children said mr holiday do you come here to listen or to talk  to listen said rollo  o very well said mr holiday then i am glad that you have come  in obedience to this intimation rollo and jane took care not to interrupt mr holiday even to ask a question but looked on and listened very patiently and attentively for nearly half an hour while he pointed out to mrs holiday the various routes and ascertained from the guide books the times at which the trains set out and the steamers sailed for each of them and also the cost of getting to paris by the several lines if the readers of this book were themselves actually in london and were going to paris as rollo and jennie were they would be interested perhaps in having all this information laid before them in full detail as it is however all that will be necessary probably is to give such a general statement of the case as will enable them to understand the story  by looking at any map of europe it will be seen that england is separated from france by the english channel a passage which though it looks quite narrow on the map is really very wide especially toward the west the narrowest place is between dover and calais where the distance across is only about twentytwo miles this narrow passage is called the straits of dover it would have been very convenient for travellers that have to pass between london and paris if this strait had happened to lie in the line or nearly in the line between these two cities but it does not it lies considerably to the eastward of it so that to cross the channel at the narrowest part requires that the traveller should take quite a circuit round to go by the shortest distance it is necessary to cross the channel at a place where dieppe is the harbor on the french side and new haven on the english there are other places of crossing some of which are attended with one advantage and others with another in some the harbors are not good and the passengers have to go off in small boats at certain times of tide to get to the steamers in others the steamers leave only when the tide serves which may happen to come at a very inconvenient hour in a word it is always quite a study with tourists when they are ready to leave london for paris to determine by which of the various lines it will be best for their particular party under the particular circumstances in which they are placed to go  after ascertaining all the facts very carefully and all the advantages and disadvantages of each particular line mr holiday asked his wife what she thought they had better do  the cheapest line is by the way of new haven said mrs holiday  thats of no consequence i think now said mr holiday the difference is not very great  for our whole party it will make four or five pounds said mrs holiday  well said mr holiday i am travelling to recover my health and every thing must give way to that if i can only get well i can earn money fast enough when i go home to replace what we expend the only question is which way will be the pleasantest and the most comfortable  then said mrs holiday i think we had better go by the way of dover and calais where we have the shortest passage by sea  i think so too said mr holiday so that point is settled  father said rollo i wish you would let jennie and me go to paris by ourselves alone some other way  the reader who has perused the narrative of rollos voyage across the atlantic will remember that through a very peculiar combination of circumstances he was left to make that voyage under his own charge without having any one to take care of him he was so much pleased with the result of that experiment and was so proud of his success in acting as jennies protector that he was quite desirous of trying such an experiment again  o no said his father  why father i got along well enough in coming over replied rollo  true said his father and if any accident or any imperious necessity should lead to your setting out for paris without any escort i have no doubt that you would get through safely but it is one thing for a boy to be put into such a situation by some unforeseen and unexpected contingency and quite another thing for his father deliberately to form such a plan for him  rollo looked a little disappointed but he did not reply in fact he felt that his father was right  but ill tell you added mr holiday if your uncle george is willing to go by some different route from ours you may go with him  and jennie inquired rollo  why jennie repeated mr holiday hesitating let me think yes jennie may go with you if she pleases if her mother is willing  jennie always called mrs holiday her mother although she was really her aunt  are you willing mother asked rollo very eagerly  mrs holiday was at a loss what to say she was very desirous to please rollo and at the same time she wished very much to have jennie go with her however she finally decided the question by saying that jennie might go with whichever party she pleased  rollos uncle george had not been long in england he had come out from america some time after rollo himself did so that rollo had not travelled with him a great deal mr george was quite young though he was a great deal older than rollotoo old to be much of a companion for his nephew rollo liked him very much because he was always kind to him but there was no very great sympathy between them for mr george was never much interested in such things as would please a boy besides he was always very peremptory and decisive though always just in his treatment of rollo whenever he had him under his charge rollo was however very glad when his father consented that he and his uncle george might go to paris together  mr george was out that day and he did not come home until rollo had gone to bed rollo however saw him early the next morning and told him what his father had said  well said mr george after hearing his story and what do you propose that we should do  i propose that you and jennie and i should go by the way of new haven and dieppe replied rollo  why said mr george  you see it is cheaper that way said rollo we can go that way for twentyfour shillings it costs two and three pounds by the other ways  thats a consideration said mr george  for the pound you would save said rollo you could buy a very handsome book in paris  rollo suggested these considerations because he had often heard his uncle argue in this way before he had himself another and a secret reason why he wished to go by the new haven route but we are all very apt when giving reasons to others to present such as we think will influence them and not those which really influence us  mr george looked into the guide book at the pages which rollo pointed out and found that it was really as rollo had said  well said he ill go that way with you  so that was settled too  a short time after this conversation rollos father and mother and also jennie came in mr holiday rang the bell for the waiter to bring up breakfast jennie when she found that it was really decided that her father and mother were to go one way and her uncle george and rollo another was quite at a loss to determine which party she herself should join she thought very justly that there would probably be more incident and adventure to be met with in going with rollo but then on the other hand she was extremely unwilling to be separated from her mother she stood by her mothers side leaning toward her in an attitude of confiding and affectionate attachment while the others were talking about the details of the plan  i rather think there is one thing that you have forgotten said mr holiday and which it strikes me is a decided objection to your plan and that is that the steamer for tomorrow from new haven leaves at midnight  thats the very reason why i wanted to go that way said rollo  why rollo exclaimed his mother  yes mother said rollo there would be so much fun in setting out at midnight think jennie added rollo addressing his cousin we should sit up till midnight and then to see all the people going on board by the light of lanterns and torches i wonder if therell be a moon lets look in the almanac and see if therell be a moon  but george said mrs holiday you will not wish to set off at midnight i think you had better change your plan after all  but mr george did not seem to think that the midnight departure of the boat was any objection to the new haven plan he had noticed that that was the time set for leaving new haven the next night and he thought that on the whole the arrangement would suit his plans very well he would have a good long evening to write up his journal which he said was getting rather behindhand the water too would be more likely to be smooth in the night so that there would be less danger of seasickness besides he thought that both rollo and himself would become very sleepy by sitting up so late and so would fall directly to sleep as soon as they got into their berths on board the steamer and sleep quietly till they began to draw near to the coast of france the distance across the channel at that point was such that the steamer in leaving at midnight would not reach dieppe till five or six oclock the next morning  accordingly the arrangements were all made for rollos departure the next day with his uncle george for new haven jennie finally decided to go with her father and mother the idea of sailing at midnight determined her for such an adventure attractive as it was in rollos eyes seemed quite formidable in hers rollo had a very pleasant ride to new haven amusing himself all the way with the beauties of english scenery and the continual novelties that every where met his eye when they at last arrived at new haven they found that the harbor consisted merely of a straight artificial canal cut in from the sea where probably some small stream had originally issued the sides of this harbor were lined with piers and on one of the piers was a great hotel forming a part as it were of the railway station there were a few houses and other buildings near but there was no town to be seen the railway was on one side of the hotel and the water was on the other when the train stopped one of the railway servants opened the door for mr george and rollo to get out and mr george went directly into the hotel to make arrangements for rooms and for dinner while rollo eager to see the ships and the water went through the house to the pier on the other side he found that there was a pretty broad space on the pier between the hotel and the water with a shed upon it for merchandise and extra tracks for freight trains the water was quite low in the harbor and the few vessels that were lying at the pier walls were mostly grounded in the mud there was one steamboat lying opposite the hotel but it was down so low that at first rollo could only see the top of the smokepipe rollo went to the brink of the pier and looked down the steamer appeared very small it was painted black there were very few people on board rollo had a great mind to go on board himself as there was a plank leading down from the pier to the top of the paddle box but it looked rather steep and so rollo concluded to postpone going on board till mr george should come out with him after dinner  rollo looked about upon the pier a few minutes and then went into the hotel he passed through a spacious hall and then through a passage way from which he could look into a large room the sides of which were formed of glass so that the people who were in the room could see out all around them the front of the room looked out upon the pier the back side upon the passage way a third side was toward the vestibule and the fourth toward the coffee room there were shelves around this room within and tables and desks and people going to and fro there in fact it seemed to be the office of the hotel  rollo advanced to one of the openings that was toward the passage way and asked which was the way to the coffee room the girl pointed to the door which led to it and rollo went in  he found a large and beautiful room with several tables set for dinner in different parts of it and sideboards covered with silver and glasses against the walls on one side there were several large and beautiful windows which looked out upon the pier and opposite to each of these windows was a small dinner table large enough however for two persons mr george had taken one of these tables and when rollo came in he was sitting near it reading a newspaper  come rollo said he i have ordered dinner and we shall just have time to arrange our accounts while they are getting it ready  so saying mr george took out his pocket book and also a small pocket inkstand and a pen and put them all upon the table  your fathers plan he continued is this he is to pay all expenses of transportation at the same rate that he pays for himself so that whatever you save by travelling in cheap ways is your own  yes said rollo smiling i mean to walk sometimes and save it all  he is also to pay the expense of your lodgings  yes said rollo  generally of course you will have lodgings with him but sometimes you will be away from him as for instance tonight in such cases i pay for your lodgings on your fathers account  yes said rollo i understand that  he also pays the expense of all casualties  so he said replied rollo but i dont understand what he means by that very well  why you may meet with accidents that will cost money to repair or get into difficulties which will require money to get out of for instance you may lose your ticket and so have to pay twice over or you may get lost yourself in paris and so have to hire a man with a carriage to bring you home for all such things the money is not to come from your purse your father will pay  suppose it is altogether my fault said rollo then i think i ought to pay  but your father said that he was sure you would not be to blame for such accidents though i think he is mistaken there i have no doubt myself that nearly all the accidents that will happen to you will come from boyish heedlessness and blundering on your part  well see said rollo  yes said mr george well see  then as to your board continued mr george your father said that you might do as you pleased about that he would pay it or you might and be allowed five francs a day for it  five francs is about a dollar is it not asked rollo  yes replied mr george very nearly but you had better not reckon by dollars now at all but by francs altogether thats a franc  so saying mr george took a silver coin out of his pocket and showed it to rollo it was nearly as large as a quarter of a dollar or an english shilling but not quite a quarter of a dollar is worth twentyfive cents an english shilling twentyfour and a franc about twenty cents  you can have five of those a day to pay your own board with  and how much would it cost me at a boarding house in paris to pay my board asked rollo  why we dont board at boarding houses in paris said mr george we have rooms at a hotel and then we get breakfast and dinner wherever we please at coffee rooms and dining rooms all over the city wherever we happen to be or wherever we take a fancy to go you can get a very excellent breakfast for a franc and a half a beefsteak or an omelet and bread and butter and coffee  thats enough for breakfast said rollo and then dinner  you can get a firstrate dinner for two francs or even less that makes three francs and a half  and tea  they never take tea in paris said mr george the french dont take tea  why not asked rollo  i dont know replied mr george unless it is because the english do whatever is done in london you generally find that just the contrary is done in paris  dont we have any thing then after dinner asked rollo  yes said mr george the french generally go and take a seat at a little round table on the sidewalk and have a little glass of brandy and a cigar  here rollo threw his head back and laughed loud and long he was greatly amused at the idea of his making an allowance in calculating how far his five francs would go for a glass of brandy and a cigar mr george himself sedate as he was could not but smile  the fact is said he at length there are only two meals to calculate for and they will not cost upon an average more than three francs and a half if we are prudent and economical and go to plain and not expensive places but then there is the immense amount that you will be always wishing to spend for cakes and candy and oranges and nuts and bonbons of all sorts and kinds there is an endless variety of such things in paris you will find half a dozen cake shops in every street with fifty different kinds of gingerbread and cake in them all of the richest and most delicious description  yes said rollo i shall want some of those things  no doubt said mr george you will make yourself sick eating them ill venture to say before you have been in paris twentyfour hours  no said rollo shaking his head resolutely and i think i had better take the five francs and pay my own board  very well said mr george and that provides for every thing except incidentals your father said that i might pay you five francs a day for incidentals and pocket money that is to include all your personal expenses of every kind except what we have already provided for there will be excursions and tickets to concerts and shows and carriage hire and toys that you will want to buy and all such things the amount of it is that your father pays all your expenses for transportation for lodging and for casualties you pay every thing else and are allowed ten francs a day for it i am to be treasurer and to have the whole charge of your funds except so far as i find it prudent and safe to intrust them to you and you are to buy nothing at all against my consent  nothing at all asked rollo  no said mr george nothing at all you are not to expend a single centime in any way that i object to  what is a centime asked rollo  it is of the value of less than one fourth of a cent replied mr george  but i should think i might buy such little things as that would come to of myself said rollo suppose i should wish to buy a small piece of gingerbread for a cent  say for a soua replied mr george there are no cents in paris  a pronounced soo  well rejoined rollo suppose i should wish to spend a sou for gingerbread and eat it and you should object to it  very well replied mr george and suppose you were to wish to spend a sou for poison and drink it  but i should not be likely to buy poison said rollo laughing  nor should i be likely to object to your buying gingerbread rejoined mr george a boy however may it is clear do mischief with a little money as well as with a great deal and therefore the power in his guardian should be absolute and entire at any rate so it is in this case if i see fit to forbid your expending a single sou for any thing whatever i can and you will have no remedy till we see your father again and then you can ask him to put you under some other persons care until he does this however the control is absolute and entire in my hands i would not take charge of a boy on any other terms  well said rollo i agree to it  and now said mr george i am ready to begin your account  mr george then took a small account book from his pocket book as he said this and opening it at the beginning he wrote across the top of the two pages which came together the words  rollo holiday in account with his father  on the corner of the lefthand page he wrote dr which stands for debtor and on that of the righthand page cr which stands for creditor  there said he now i shall enter from time to time on the creditor side all the money that becomes due to you and on the debtor side all that i pay to you then by striking a balance we can always tell how much of your money there is in my hands  let me see continued mr george your father and mother concluded finally to go by the way of folkstone the fare that way is two pound eleven this way it is one pound four i am to pay you the difference the difference is one pound seven and one pound seven in francs islet me see how much  mr george made a calculation with a pencil and paper and found that it amounted to thirtythree francs seventyfive centimes  i dont understand reckoning by francs and centimes very well said rollo  no replied mr george that is your misfortune and youll have to bear it as well as you can till you get out of it  so mr george entered the francsthirtythree seventyfivein rollos book  you have got thirtythree francs to begin with said he thats a pretty good stock  now there is your allowance of ten francs per day i will enter that weekly there are three days in this week including today and sunday that makes thirty francs  so mr george entered the thirty francs  there said he the whole amount due you up to monday morning is sixtythree francs seventyfive centimes that is sixtythree francs and three fourths a hundred centimes make a franc  and now continued mr george i will make you a payment so as to put you in funds and that must be put down on the other side how much would you like  i dont know said rollo a few francs i suppose  have you got a purse asked mr george let me see it  so rollo took out a small leather bag which he had bought in london  thats it said mr george ill give you ten francs when you want more you can have itthat is provided it is due to you  here mr george rang a bell and a waiter came in immediately mr george handed the waiter a sovereign and asked him to get change for it in french money the waiter took the money and presently came in with five fivefranc pieces these he presented very respectfully to mr george mr george took two of them and gave them to rollo the others he put into his own pocket the fivefranc pieces were very bright and new and they were of about the size of silver dollars rollo was very much pleased with his portion and put them in his purse quite proud of having so much spending money  and you say that i must not spend any of it without first asking you said rollo  o no replied mr george i have not said any such thing that would be a great deal of trouble both for you and for me  but i thought you said that i was not to spend any thing without your consent  illustration the dinner at new haven  no said mr george i said against my consent i may forbid your spending whenever i think proper but i shall not do so so long as i find you always ask me in doubtful cases spend for yourself freely whenever you are sure it is right when you are not sure ask me if i find you abuse the privilege i shall have to restrict you otherwise not  rollo was well satisfied with this understanding of the case and just then the waiter came in bearing a handsome silver tureen containing soup which he put down upon the table between mr george and rollo so the writing materials and the purses were put away and the two travellers were soon occupied very busily in eating their dinner     chapter ii  crossing the channel   mr holiday had two reasons for making the arrangements described in the last chapter in respect to rollos expenses in the first place it would gratify rollo himself who would feel more independent and more like a man he thought in being allowed thus in some measure to have the charge and control of his own expenditures but his second and principal reason was that he might accustom his son in early life to bear pecuniary responsibilities and to exercise judgment and discretion in the use of money many young men never have any training of this sort till they become of age before that time whenever they wish for money they go to their father and ask for it they take all they can get and when that is gone they go and ask for more they have no direct personal motive for exercising prudence and economy and they have no experience of the evils that result from thriftlessness and prodigality it is much better for all children that they should have pecuniary responsibilities such as are suited to their years thrown upon them in their youth when the mistakes they make in acquiring their experience are of little moment the same mistakes made after they become of age might be their ruin  in carrying the system into effect in rollos case there seemed to be something very abrupt at least if not positively harsh in mr georges mode of dealing with him and yet rollo did not dislike it he felt that his uncle was treating him more like a man on this account or rather more like a large boy and not like a child in fact a part of the rough handling which rollo got from his uncle was due to this very circumstancemr george having observed that he did not mind being knocked about a little  after dinner rollo proposed to his uncle that they should go out and take a walk  i will go with you a few minutes said mr george and then i must return to my room and write up my journal  say half an hour rejoined rollo  well replied mr george we will say half an hour  so they sallied forth upon the pier behind the hotel mr george took a general survey of the harbor and of the vessels that were lying in it and also of the peaks and headlands which were seen at the mouth of it toward the sea  i should like to be on that hill said mr george to look off over the channel and see if i could discern the coast of france from it  lets go there said rollo  that would take more than half an hour replied mr george  well at any rate lets go on board the steamer said rollo  so taking mr george by the hand he led him along to the brink of the pier mr george looked over and saw the steamer lying at rest in its muddy bed below  is it possible said mr george in a tone of great astonishment  can it be possible repeated mr george  what inquired rollo what is it that surprises you so much  why to find such a steamer as this for the travel on one of the great thoroughfares between england and france lets go down on board  so mr george led the way and rollo followed down the plank the plank landed them on the top of the paddle box from that place a few steps led to the deck they walked along the deck a short distance toward the stern and there they found a door and a small winding staircase leading down into the cabin they descended these stairs one before the other for the space was not wide enough to allow of their going together and when they reached the foot of them they found themselves in a small cabin with one tier of berths around the sides the cabin was not high enough for two there were berths for about twenty or thirty passengers the cabin was very neatly finished and there was a row of cushioned seats around it in front of the berths in one corner by the side of the door where mr george and rollo had come in was a small desk with writing materials upon it this rollo supposed must be the captains office  while mr george sat surveying the scene and mentally comparing this insignificant boat to the magnificent steamers on the hudson river in america with their splendid and capacious cabins on three different decks their promenade saloons sometimes one hundred and fifty feet long with ranges of elegant state rooms on either hand and sofas and couches and t√™te√†t√™tes without number in the middle his perplexity increased  i do not understand it at all said he to rollo i thought that there would at least be as much travelling between london and paris the two greatest cities in the world as between new york and albany and yet there are half a dozen steamers every day on the north river carrying from five hundred to one thousand passengers while here on the most direct and cheapest route between london and paris is one single steamer that could not possibly carry one hundred passengers and she only goes once in two days  just then a young man who seemed to be the clerk of the boat came down the cabin stairs and seeing mr george and rollo there he asked them if they had taken their berths they said that they had not but they immediately proceeded to choose their berths or rather their places for there were no divisions separating the sleepingplaces from each other except what was formed by the cushions there was a long cushion for each sleeper covered with crimson velvet or plush and a round cushion shaped like a bolster and covered in the same way for his head on these cushions the passengers were expected to lie down without undressing placing themselves in a row head to head and feet to feet mr george chose two of these sleepingplaces one for himself and the other for rollo and the clerk marked them with a ticket  our two travellers then went up on deck again and from the deck they ascended the plank to the pier it was now nearly sunset and it was a very pleasant evening they sauntered slowly along the pier until they came to a place where some steps led down to the water there were several small boats at the foot of the steps and in one of them was a man doing something to the rudder rollo saw that on the other side of the water was another long staircase leading down from the bank there so as to form a landingplace for small boats at all times of tide he also looked up and down the harbor but he could see no bridge and so he supposed that this must be a sort of ferry for the people who wished to cross from one side to the other  as soon as the man who was in the boat saw mr george and rollo standing upon the pier he rose up in his boat and touching his hat at the same time or rather making a sort of jerk with his hand which was meant to represent a touch of the hat he asked him if he would like to be rowed across to the other side  why i dont know said mr george whats the ferriage  thats just as the gentleman pleases said the man with another jerk at his hat  and how much do they generally please said mr george whats the common custom  o gentlemen gives us what they likes said the man we always leaves it to them entirely  mr george was silent after a moments pause the boatman said again  would you like to go sir very nice boat  not on those terms said mr george if you will tell me what the usual ferriage is i can then tell you whether we wish to go or not  well sir replied the man gentlemen usually gives us about twopence apiece  twopence apiece very well we will go  mr george did not wait to ask rollo whether he would like to go before he decided the question he would have considered this a mere waste of time for rollo was always ready to go no matter where  so they got into the boat and were rowed across the water they ascended the stairs on the other side and walked a little way in a smooth road which led along the bank rollo wished to go farther but mr george said that his time had expired and that he must go back but you may stay said he to rollo as long as you please provided that you come back before dark  rollo was much pleased with this permission as he wished to go to the top of the hill at the outlet of the harbor and look at the prospect he promised to return before dark  have you any change said mr george to pay your ferriage back  no said rollo i have nothing but my fivefranc pieces  then i will lend you twopence said mr george you can pay me the first change you get in france  but i cannot get any pennies in france said rollo  true said mr george you will get sous there you must pay me four sous a penny is equal to two sous  i will pay your bill at the hotel too continued mr george as i suppose they will make out yours and mine together and you can pay me your share tomorrow when we land here is your ticket however you must take charge of that  but suppose i lose it asked rollo  then you will have to pay over again said mr george that is all you will lose about twenty francs unless indeed he continued your father should call it a casualty  so mr george went back to the boat and rollo continued his walk thinking on the way of the question which his uncle had suggested whether his father would consider the loss of his ticket a casualty or not he determined however very resolutely that he would not lose it and so he put it away safely in his wallet and then went on the road was very smooth and pleasant to walk in being bordered by green fields on the one hand and the water of the harbor on the other rollo came at length to the hill there were successive terraces with houses built upon them on the sides of the hill and paths leading to the summit rollo had a fine view of the sea and of the vessels and steamers which were passing slowly in the offing on their way up and down the channel but though he looked long and eagerly for the coast of france it was not to be seen  rollo rambled about the hill for a considerable time for at that season of the year the twilight continued very long and it did not become dark till quite late when at length the shadows of the evening began to shut in upon the landscape he returned to the ferry and the ferryman rowed him back again to the hotel  it was now nearly nine oclock and of course three hours remained before the time of embarkation would arrive rollo was not sorry for this as he thought that there would be enough to amuse and occupy him all this time on and around the pier his first duty however was to go and report himself to mr george as having returned from his walk this he did he found his uncle very busy in his room writing his journal  now rollo said mr george it is three hours before we are to leave what are you going to do all that time  o i shall find plenty to amuse myself with said rollo  very well said mr george you may play about wherever you are sure it is safe dont go near the edge of the pier unless there is somebody at hand to pull you out of the water with a boathook if you fall in amuse yourself as long as you can and when you are tired of taking care of yourself come to me and i will tell you what to do  rollo having received these instructions left his uncle to his work and went away he descended the stairs and went out upon the pier again and after amusing himself by examining every thing there he concluded to go on board the steamer a train of cars had arrived from london while he and his uncle had been on the other side of the water and there were now several new passengers in the cabin who were choosing and marking their berths or talking together about the voyage  rollo thought that in order to make sure that his ticket was all right he would climb up into his berth and see and then when he was there it seemed to him a very funny place to sleep in so he laid down his head upon the round cushion to try it while he was in this position his attention was attracted by the sound of childrens voices on the stairs talking french presently these children came into the cabin their mother was with them there were two of them and they were not more than five or six years old rollo was exceedingly astonished to hear such little children talk french so well rollo listened to see if he could understand what they said he had studied french himself for a year or two and could say a great many things in fact he had been accustomed to consider himself quite a good french scholar but he now found that all his acquisitions dwindled into utter insignificance when compared with the power over the language possessed by those little girls  the french party did not remain very long in the cabin where rollo was but passed at once through a door which led to a small ladies cabin near there were other persons however continually coming and going and rollo was interested in watching their movements and in listening to the fragments of conversation which he heard he found his position very comfortable too and the sounds around him produced so lulling an effect that before long he insensibly closed his eyes in a word in less than fifteen minutes after he climbed up into his berth to see what sort of a place it was he had put it fully to the test of experiment by going fast asleep in it  in about half an hour after this mr george coming to the end of a paragraph in his journal laid down his pen drew a long breath looked out the window and then rang the bell in a few minutes the chambermaid came  mary said he i wish to ask the porter to go out and look about on the pier and in the packet and see if he can see any thing of that boy that came with me  very well sir said mary with a quick courtesy and she immediately disappeared  in about five minutes she came back and said that the young master was in his berth in the packet sound asleep  very well said mr george in his turn much obliged to you he then went on with his writing  the first thing that rollo himself was conscious of after falling asleep in his berth was a feeling of some one pulling him gently by the shoulder he opened his eyes and saw before him a face that he did not exactly know and yet it was not entirely strange the man had his hand upon rollos shoulder and was endeavoring to wake him  your ticket if you please sir  rollo stared wildly a minute first at the man and then about the cabin it was night lamps were burning and the cabin was full of people some were in their berths some in groups on the seats and one or two were just preparing to lie down the engine was in motion and the ship was evidently going fast through the water in fact the steamer was rocking and rolling as she went on indicating that she was already far out at sea  your ticket if you please sir repeated the clerk  rollo glanced around to his uncles berth and there he saw his uncle lying quietly in his place his head being on a cushion close to the one on which rollos head had been lying  uncle george said rollo he wants my ticket  well said mr george without moving give him your ticket  rollo then recollected that he had his ticket in his wallet so after fumbling for a time in his pocket he brought out his wallet and produced the ticket and handed it to the clerk  thank you sir said the clerk taking the ticket at the same time he put two other tickets in rollos wallet in the place of the one which he had taken out as he did this he pointed to one of the small ones saying  thats for the landing  rollo shut up his wallet and put it in his pocket  a shilling if you please said the clerk  rollo had no shilling and was still not much more than half awake so he turned to his uncle again  uncle george said he he wants a shilling  well pay him a shilling then said mr george  rollo now felt for his purse and taking out one of his fivefranc pieces he gave it to the clerk who in return gave him back a quantity of change rollo attempted to count the change but he soon perceived that his ideas of francs and shillings were all in confusion so he turned the change all together into his purse put the purse back into his pocket lay his head down upon his cushion again shut his eyes and in one minute was once more fast asleep  some hours afterward he woke again of his own accord he opened his eyes and looked about him and perceiving that it was morning he climbed down from his berth and then went up upon the deck the coast of france was all before him in full view and the steamer was rapidly drawing near to it he went to the bow of the vessel to get a nearer view he saw directly before him a place where there were piers and batteries and other constructions indicating a town while on either hand there extended long ranges of cliffs with smooth green slopes of land above and broad sandy shores below in half an hour more the steamer arrived at the entrance of the harbor which was formed of two long piers built at a little distance from each other and projecting quite into the sea the steamer glided rapidly along between these high walls of stone until at length it entered a broad basin which was bordered by a continuation of these walls and hemmed in on every side beyond the walls of the pier with ranges of the most quaint and queer and picturesquelooking buildings that rollo ever saw  illustration entering dieppe  these buildings were not close to the pier but were back far enough to leave room for a street between them and the water such a street is called a quayb quays are built in almost all the cities of europe where there are rivers or basins of water for shipping and they are very pleasant streets to walk in having usually large and elegant buildings on one side and vessels and steamers on the other  b pronounced kee  by the time that the steamer had entered the port almost all the passengers had come up from below and mr george among the rest mr george came expecting to find that as they were now about to land the baggage would be brought out and that the several passengers would be called upon to select their own but there was no movement of this kind the baggage had all been put down into the hold the night before and now the hatches were still closed and there seemed to be no signs of any preparation to open them  in the mean time the steamer gradually drew near to the pier the engine was stopped ropes were thrown out people in queer dresses some of them soldiers who were standing on the pier caught the ropes and fastened them the steamer was thus brought to her place and secured there  there was now however no rush to get on shoresuch as rollo had always been accustomed to witness on board an american steamer on her arrivalbut every thing was quiet and still by and by a plank was laid then the passengers were called upon to get out their tickets then they began to walk over the plank each one giving up his landing ticket as he passed  when mr george and rollo reached the pier they found on looking around them that they were not yet at liberty on the opposite side of the quay was a building with a sign over it in french meaning customhouse office for packet boats and there were two long ropes stretched one from the stem and the other from the stern of the steamer to the opposite sides of the door of this building so as to enclose a space on the quay in front of the building in such a manner as to hem the passengers in and make it necessary for them to pass through the custom house the ropes were guarded by soldiers dressed in what seemed to rollo the queerest possible uniforms they all talked frencheven those who had talked english when they came on board the packet boat on the other side  i cant understand a word they say said rollo  nor i said mr george but we can watch and see what they will do  it did not require long watching for no sooner had mr george said these words than he observed that the passengers were all going toward the door of the customhouse and that as they went they were taking their passports out nobody can enter france without a passport a passport is a paper given to the traveller by his own government this paper tells the travellers name describes his person and requests that the french government will allow him to pass through their country frenchmen themselves must have a passport too though this is of a little different kind all must have a passport of some kind or other and all this machinery of ropes and soldiers was to make it sure that every one of the passengers had the proper document  the passengers accordingly took out their passports as they went into the customhouse door and there passed in single file before an officer seated at a desk who took them in turn opened them copied the names in his book and then gave them back to the owners mr george and rollo followed on in the line when their passports had been given back to them they went on with the rest until they came out from the customhouse at another door which brought them upon the quay outside of the ropes  whats to be done next said rollo  i am sure i dont know said mr george i suppose we shall see  there was an omnibus standing near marked for the iron roadthat being the french name for railroadbut nobody seemed to be getting into it in fact the passengers as fast as they came out from the customhouse seemed all very quiet as if waiting for something a great many of them seemed to be french people and they fell into little groups and began to talk very volubly together some finding friends who had come down to the quay to meet them and others making friends apparently for the occasion of the soldiers and idlers that were standing around  could not you ask some of them said rollo what we are to do next  i dont believe they would understand my french said mr george i am sure i dont understand theirs in a moment however he turned to a young man who was standing near who seemed to be a waiter or servant man belonging to the place  do you speak english  yes sir said the man in a very foreign accent but yet in a very pleasant tone  what are we waiting for asked mr george  you will wait sir for the baggages and then for the visit of the baggages  how long said mr george  twenty minutes said the man he also gave mr george to understand that he and rollo might go and have some breakfast if they chose but mr george thought it was not safe for them to go away from the spot so they waited where they were  in a few minutes the hatches were opened on board the vessel and the sailors began to hoist out the trunks as fast as they were brought up to the decks men took them on shore and carried them into the customhouse by the same door where the passengers had entered when all the baggage was carried in the ropes were taken down and the passengers went to the customhouse door again to attend to the examination of the baggage a soldier stood at the door to prevent too many going in at a time mr george and rollo followed the rest and at length it came their turn to have their trunks examined this was done very quickthe officers appearing to think from the appearance of the travellers that they would not be likely to have any smuggled goods in their possession the officer accordingly just looked into the trunks and then shut down the lids and marked them passed a porter then took them out at the side door there on mr georges telling them in french that they were going to paris by the railroad the trunks were put upon a cart while mr george and rollo got into the omnibus and then they were very soon driving along the quay in the direction as they supposed of the paris railway station     chapter iii  journey to paris   the omnibus which mr george and rollo had entered contained several other passengers some of whom had carpet bags and valises with them as if they too were going to paris besides the driver there was a conductor whose place was upon the step of the omnibus behind the conductor opened and shut the doors for the passengers when they wished to get in or out and took the fare  how much is the fare said rollo to mr george  i dont know said mr george shaking his head he spoke however in a very unconcerned tone as if it were of very little consequence whether he knew or not  what are you going to do about it then said rollo  i shall say how much to him when we get out and then if i do not understand his answer i shall give him a large piece of money and let him give me back as much change as he likes  rollo resolved that he would do so too  next to mr george and rollo in the omnibus there sat a gentleman and lady who seemed to be as they really were a newmarried pair they were making their bridal tour the lady was dressed plainly but well in travelling costume and she had a handsome morocco carriage bag hanging upon her arm the gentleman was quite loaded with shawls and boxes and umbrellas and small bags which he had upon his lap or at his feet besides this the lady had a trunk which together with that of her husband had been left behind to come on the cart she was very anxious about this trunk for it contained all her fine dresses her husband was interested in the novel sights and scenes that presented themselves to view in passing along the street but she thought only of the trunk  what strange costumes estelle said he look see that woman what a funny cap  yes said estelle but charley dont you think it would have been better for us to have brought our trunks with us on the omnibus  i dont know said her husband it is too late to think of that now ive no doubt that they are safe enough where they are look theres a girl with wooden shoes on those are the wooden shoes we have read about so often in books look  estelle glanced her eyes for an instant toward the wooden shoes and then began to look back along the street again watching anxiously for the trunks  at length the omnibus approached the station it entered through a magnificent portal under an arch there was a soldier walking back and forth with his musket in his hand bayonet fixed to guard the entrance none but actual travellers were allowed to enter the omnibus having entered the court stopped before a splendid portico where there was a door leading into the building the passengers paid their fares and got out on entering the building they found themselves in a spacious apartment with a great variety of partitions offices enclosures and railings presenting themselves on every hand the meaning of all which it was very difficult to understand there were also signs marked first class and second class and third class and placards of notices to travellers and time tables and various similar things on the back side of the room were doors and windows looking out to a platform where the train of cars was seen apparently all ready to set off but the partitions and railings which were in the way prevented the company from going out there  there were a number of travellers in this room several parties having arrived there before the omnibus came many of these persons were waiting quietly talking in little groups or resting themselves by sitting upon their carpet bags others were looking about eagerly and anxiously wondering what they were to do or trying to find somebody who could tell them about the baggage estelle was the most restless and uneasy of all she went continually to the door to look down the road to see if the cart was coming  charles said she what a shame it is that they dont come with the trunks the train is all ready and will go off before they come  o no said her husband i think not dont be anxious about them ive no doubt they will be here in time come with me and let us look about the station and see how it differs from ours  but estelle would not allow her thoughts to be diverted from her trunk she remained on the steps looking anxiously down the road some of the other passengers who were unused to travelling seeing her look so anxious and not understanding what she said supposed that some accident had happened or that some unusual delay had occurred and they began to be anxious too just then a bell began to ring out upon the platform  there exclaimed estelle the train is going what shall we do why cant you ask somebody charles  why i cant speak french said charles and they would not understand me if i ask in english  yes they would said estelle im sure they would there are so many english travellers going on these roads now that it must be that they have men here that speak english theres a man said she pointing to a person in livery who was standing within a sort of enclosure  mr charles thus urged walked across the hall to the railing though very reluctantly and asked the man if he could tell him why the trunks did not come  sir said the man in french and looking as if he did not understand  do you speak english asked mr charles  there said the man pointing across the room mr charles looked and saw another man who by the livery or uniform which he wore seemed to be a porter belonging to the station standing by a window he accordingly went across to ask the question of him  do you speak english sir said he  yes sare replied the man speaking with great formality and in a very foreign accent making at the same time a very polite bow  what is the reason that our baggage does not come asked mr charles  yes sare replied the porter speaking in the same manner  why does not it come asked mr charles again we put it upon a cart at the customhouse and why does not it come  yes sare replied the porter with another very polite bow  mr charles perceiving that the porters knowledge of english consisted apparently in being able to say yes sir and mortified at the absurd figure which he made in attempting to make useless inquiries in such a way bowed in his turn and went back to estelle in a state of greater alienation of heart from her than he had ever experienced before and as this book may perhaps be read sometimes by girls as well as boys i will here for their benefit add the remark that there is no possible way by which a lady can more effectually destroy any kind feeling which a gentleman may entertain for her than by forcing him to exhibit himself thus in an awkward and ridiculous light by her unreasonable exactions on journeys or rides or walks or excursions of any kind that they may be taking together  rollo and his uncle george had witnessed this scene and had both been much interested in watching the progress of it rollo did not know but that there was some real cause for solicitude about the baggage especially as several of the lady passengers who were standing with estelle at the door seemed to be anxiously looking down the road  do you feel any anxiety about our trunks coming asked rollo  not the least said mr george quietly  why not asked rollo are you sure that they will come  no said mr george but there are a good many excellent reasons why i should not feel any anxiety about them in the first place i have some little confidence in the railway arrangements made in this country the french are famous all the world over for their skill in systematizing and regulating all operations of this kind so that they shall work in the most sure and perfect manner it does not seem at all probable to me therefore that they can manage so clumsily here on one of the great lines between england and france as to get all the trunks of a whole steamer load of passengers upon a cart and then loiter with it on the way to the station and let the train go off without it  well said rollo thats a good reason but you said there were several  another is that if they are capable of managing so clumsily as to have such a thing happen we cannot help it and have nothing to do but to bear it quietly we put our trunks in the proper place to have them brought here we could not have done otherwise with propriety for that was the regular mode provided for conveying the baggage and if there is a failure to get it here we are not to fret about it but to take it as we would a storm or a break down or any other casualtythat is take it quietly  yes said rollo thats a good reason are there any more  there is one more said mr george and that is i am not anxious about the trunks coming in season for i dont care a fig whether they come or not  o uncle george exclaimed rollo  i do not said mr george for if they do not come the only consequence will be that we shall have to wait two or three hours for the next train which will give us just time to ramble about a little in this queerlooking town of dieppe and get some breakfast and perhaps have some curious adventures in trying to talk french in fact i rather hope the baggage wont come  mr george was destined to be disappointed in this rising desire for while he and rollo were talking estelle came running in to her husband with a countenance full of joy saying that the cart had come and urging him to come and get their trunks off as quick as possible her eagerness was increased by hearing the bell again which now began to toll leading her to think that the train was going off immediately the porters however whose business it was to carry the trunks in did not seem to be at all disturbed by the sound but began to take off the trunks one by one and convey them up into the station here they were placed upon a sort of counter from whence they were taken off on the other side and weighed in a curiously contrived pair of scales placed there for the purpose if any trunk weighed over a certain number of poundsthe amount which according to the regulations of the road each passenger was allowed to carrythen the surplus had to be paid for there was a little office close to the weighing machine and as fast as the trunks were weighed the result was reported to the clerk who made out a bill for the surplus whatever it was and the passenger paid it through an opening if there was no surplus weight then they gave the passenger a similar bill which was to be his check for his trunk at the end of the journey every thing was however so admirably arranged that all this was done very rapidly  mr charles when he found that the trunks were all to be weighed proposed to go with estelle to the cars so as to get a good seat for her but estelle chose to remain and make sure that her trunk was attended to it happened that mr georges trunk and rollos were weighed among the first and as soon as they got their checks mr george said  now for our seats in the cars  but which way are we to go said rollo  i dont know said mr george go and show that man your ticket and ask him where we are to go  in french said rollo  yes said mr george  so rollo went to the man who was standing by a sort of gateway which led through a partition railing as if he were there to guard the passage and holding up his little pasteboard ticket he said in french  where to go  the man looked at the ticket and seeing that first class was printed upon it he pointed in a certain direction and said something in french speaking however in so rapid and voluble a manner that rollo could not understand a single word he however understood the sign  this way uncle george said rollo he says we must go this way  following the indication which the man had given mr george and rollo passed out upon the platform where they found the train ready for them there were various attendants upon the platform dressed in a quaint sort of uniform the livery as it were of the railroad company one of them looked at rollos ticket and then opened the door of a firstclass car the cars were made like those in england in separate compartments each compartment being like a large coach with one front seat and one back facing each other there were four places that is room for four passengers on each seat of course only those at the ends were near the window rollo and mr george took the two seats nearest the window on the side where they got in as one of the seats at the opposite side was already occupied by a gentleman the gentleman seemed to be an englishman for he was reading the london times  rollo and mr george had been seated only two or three minutes before estelle and her husband came along estelle leading the way the attendant opened the door of the car and estelle followed by her husband got in they passed between mr george and rollo and stood there for a moment looking about for a good seat a freight train was slowly trundling by at this time on an adjoining track so that what they said was not very audible but still mr george and rollo could hear it  i want a seat by the window said estelle where i can look out and see the country ask that gentleman if he would not be willing to take a middle seat and let us sit together by the window  we had better go to some other car said her husband in an undertone he wishes to see the country probably himself and has come early perhaps so as to get a good seat  o no said estelle this is a very nice car and he would just as soon change as not i have no doubt ask him charley do  so estelle moved to one side for her husband to pass mr charles thus urged approached the gentleman and said in a very bland and respectful manner  should you have any objection sir to move your seat so as to let this lady sit by the window  the gentleman raised his eyes from his paper and looked at mr charles an instant and then answered quietly  i prefer this seat sir  he then went on with his reading as before  estelle pouted her lip and said though in a tone too low perhaps for the gentleman to hear what a rude man  we will give you these seats sir said mr george if you would like them  yes theyll do just as well said estelle speaking to her husband  mr george rose and saying come rollo he left the car  mr george had some trouble in looking for other seats but at length he succeeded in finding two that were as good as those which they had left  i think she might at least have thanked you for giving up your seat to accommodate her said rollo  i did not do it to accommodate her said mr george i did it to get out of the sight and hearing of her i would not ride from here to paris in the same car with such a fussmaker for all the prospects in france i had rather be shut up in a freight car  how much trouble she makes her husband said rollo  it is not the trouble said mr george it is the mortification and annoyance she is a perpetual torment if thats the way that young wives treat their husbands on the bridal tour im thankful that i am not a bridegroom  the train soon set out and mr george and rollo forgetting estelle soon began to enjoy the ride they were both extremely interested in the views which they obtained from their windows as they passed along and with the antique and quaint appearance of the countrythe ancient stone cottages with thatched roofs the peasants in their picturesque dresses the immense tracts of cultivated country divided in green and brown patches like the beds of a garden but with no fences or enclosures of any kind to be seen the great forests with trees planted closely in rows like the corn in an american cornfield and the roadways which they occasionally passedimmense avenues bordered on either hand with double rows of majestic trees and extending across the country as straight as the street of a city till lost in the horizon these and a thousand other things which were all the time presenting themselves to view kept the travellers continually full of wonder and delight  after going on thus for several hours the train stopped in a very spacious depot where there was a large refreshment room and as one of the attendants called out that there would be ten minutes of rest both mr george and rollo got out and went into the refreshment room they found a great multitude of cakes and meats spread out upon an immense counter and dishes of every kind all totally unknown to them they of course could not call for any thing but after taking a survey they helped themselves to what they thought looked as if it might be good and then paid in the same way by letting the girls that attended the tables help themselves to money which the travellers held out to them in their hands they then took their seats again in the car and soon afterward the train moved on  the place where they had stopped was rouen which as well as dieppe and paris the reader will find on examining any map of france in the course of the ride from rouen to paris mr george and rollo fell into quite a conversation in which rollo received a great deal of very good advice from mr george in respect to the care of himself when he should get to paris  i suppose that i should be sure to get lost said rollo if i should attempt to go out in such a great city alone  no said mr george not at all a person can walk about a great way sometimes in a strange city without getting lost all he has to do is to take care at first to go only in such directions as that he can keep the way home in his mind  i dont know what you mean exactly by that said rollo  why suppose you were in a great city and you come out at the door of your hotel and there you find a long straight street you walk along that street half a mile then dont you think you could find your way home  yes said rollo  certainly said mr george because you have it in your mind that the way home is directly back by that same street till you come to the hotel now suppose that after going along in that street for half a mile you should come to a great church upon a corner and should turn there to the right and go for some distance in another street leading off from the first one dont you think you could then find your way home  yes said rollo i should go back to the church and then turn to the left and so go home  very well said mr george by proceeding cautiously in that way carrying your way home in your mind with you all the time you can ramble a great deal about a strange city without getting lost and go farther and farther every day  then besides if you do get lost it is of no consequence you can always ask the way back or if worst comes to worst you can take a cab and tell the man to drive you home  yes said rollo i suppose i could always do that  only you must be sure said mr george not to forget the name of your hotel once i was walking about in paris and i saw a colored girl on the sidewalk before me who seemed to be inquiring something of the people that she met without appearing to get any satisfactory answer i thought she was an american girl and so i went to her and asked her in french what she wanted to knowfor i observed that she was speaking french she said she wished to know what was the name of the hotel where most of the americans lodged i could not speak french very well myself and so i could not ask her for any explanations but i supposed that she belonged to some american party and had lost her way in going somewhere of an errand and had forgotten the name of the hotel so i told her the names of two or three hotels where americans were accustomed to lodge and she went away  did she find her own hotel asked rollo  i dont know said mr george i never knew what became of her  how did she learn french do you suppose asked rollo  i presume she came from new orleans replied mr george where nearly all the people speak french  thus our two travellers beguiled their journey by talking sometimes about the novel and curious objects which presented themselves to view in the landscape as the train rolled rapidly along on its way and sometimes about what they expected to see and to do on their arrival in paris at length the indications that they were approaching the great capital began to multiply on every hand the villages were more frequent villas parks and palaces came into view and here and there an ancient castle reposed on the slope of a distant hill or frowned from its summit at length rollo turning his head to the window opposite to the one where he had been looking out exclaimed suddenly  look there uncle george whats that  mr george said that that was napoleons famous triumphal arch that forms the grand entrance to paris on the way to the royal palaces it was a large square building splendidly adorned with sculptures and architectural ornaments and towering high into the air out of the midst of a perfect sea of houses streets avenues trees gardens and palaces which covered the whole country around it stood upon a commanding elevation which made its magnitude and its height seem all the more impressive through the centre of it was a magnificent archway wide enough for four carriages to pass abreast  it is the triumphal arch said mr george by which all grand processions enter paris on great public days of rejoicing we will go out and see it some day it is called the triumphal arch of neuilly because it is on the road that leads to neuillyc  c it is also called the arc de letoile etoile means star and the french give that name to a place where several roads diverge from one point roads so diverging form a sort of star the reader will find this arch on any map of paris with the roads diverging from it  by this time the triumphal arch had passed out of view and presently the train of cars began to be shut in by buildings and the usual indications appeared of the approach to a great station queerlooking signals of mysterious meaningsome red some blue some round some squareglided by and men in strange and fantastic costumes stood on the right hand and on the left with little flags in their hands and one arm extended as if to show the locomotive the way  at length the convoy as the french call a railway train came to a stand and an attendant in uniform opened the door of the car mr george and rollo got out and looked about quite bewildered with the magnificence of the scene around them the station was very extensive and was very splendid in its construction and there were immense numbers of people going and coming in it in all directions still every thing was so well regulated that there was no disorder or confusion there was a line of carriages drawn up in a certain place near the platform but the coachmen remained quietly by them awaiting calls from the passengers instead of vociferously and clamorously offering their services as is customary at the stations in america nor was there any pushing or crowding for trunks and baggage in fact the trunks were all to be examined before they could go into the city for there are separate duties for the city of paris in addition to those for france the baggage was therefore all taken from the baggage car and arranged in an immense apartment on counters which extended all around the sides and up and down the middle and then when all was ready the passengers were admitted and each one claimed his own mr george and rollo easily found their trunks and on presenting their tickets an officer required them to open the trunks that he might see if there was any thing contraband inside as soon however as he perceived that mr george and rollo were foreigners and that their trunks had come from beyond sea he shut down the lids again saying it is well a porter then took the trunks and carried them out to a carriage  hotel of the rhine place vendome said mr george in french to the coachman by way of directing him where to go  illustration the arrival  yesyesyesyes said the coachman  it is so natural and easy for the french to talk that they generally use all the words they can to express their meaning besides an infinity of gestures thus when they wish to say yes they often repeat the yes four or five times in a very rapid manner thus  yesyesyesyes  mr george got into the coach and rollo followed him as they drove along the streets rollo tried to look out the window and see but the window was so small and the streets were so narrow and the coachman moreover drove so fast that he had very little opportunity to make observations at length he caught a momentary glimpse of a monstrous column standing in the middle of an open square and immediately afterward the carriage drove in under an archway and came to a stand in a small open court surrounded with lofty buildings this was the hotel there was a small room which served as a porters lodge in this court near where the coach stopped a girl came to the door of this lodge to receive the guests she bowed to mr george and rollo with great politeness and seemed glad to see them mr george spoke to her in french to say what rooms he wished to engage what he said literally translated was this  we want two chambers for ourselves at the third and an apartment of three pieces at the second for a gentleman lady and their young girl whom we attend tomorrow  the girl who was very neatly and prettily dressed and was very agreeable in her manners immediately said very well and rang a bell a servant man came at the summons and taking the trunks showed mr george and rollo up to their rooms     chapter iv  the garden of the tuileries   the first sunday that rollo spent in paris he met with quite a singular adventure  his father and mother had arrived the evening before and had established themselves quite comfortably in the apartment of three pieces which mr george had engaged for them an apartment according to the french use of the term is not a single room but a group of rooms suitable to be occupied by one family the number of pieces is the number of rooms  mr holidays three rooms were a small but beautifully furnished parlor where they had breakfast and two bed rooms one bed room was for himself and mrs holiday and the other was for jennie there were a great many splendid mirrors in these rooms and other elegant furniture the floors were not carpeted but were formed of dark and polished wood curiously inlaid with rugs here and there at the doors and before the sofas and chairs there was a small square rug before every chair and a large one before the sofa there were a great many other curious things to be observed in the arrangements of the room the fireplace for example was closed by plates of sheet iron which could be shoved up and down like the sashes of a window while the windows themselves opened like doors each having a great brass fastening like a latch in the middle and hinges at the sides  rollo had gone with his father and mother to church in the morning and at about one oclock they returned rollo and jennie remained at home after one for an hour or two waiting for their uncle george to come he had gone away somewhere and had not yet returned while thus waiting the children sat at the window of their parlor which they opened by swinging the two sides of the sash entirely back so that they could see out to great advantage the window opened down quite low but there was a strong iron bar passing across from side to side to keep them from falling out the children sat at this window amusing themselves with what they could see in the square the name of the square was the place vendome there was a very large and lofty column in the centre of it this column is very greatly celebrated for its magnitude and its beauty it is twelve feet in diameter and nearly a hundred and forty feet high but what is most remarkable is that the whole exterior of it enormous as the mass is is formed of brass the brass was obtained by melting up the cannons which napoleon took from his enemies at the end of one of his campaigns he found that he had twelve hundred cannons which he had taken from the russians and austrians with whom he had been at war and after reflecting for some time on the question what he should do with them he concluded to send them to paris and there to have them made into this enormous column to ornament the centre of the place vendome  the column though made of brass is not bright upon the outside but dark like bronze and the surface is ornamented with figures in what are called bas relief representing the battles and victories in which the cannon out of which the column was composed were taken from the enemy  rollo and jennie in looking at this column from the window of their hotel observed that around the foot of it there was a square space enclosed by an iron railing forming a sort of yard there was a gate in the front side of this railing this gate was open but there were two soldiers standing by it with guns in their hands as if to prevent any body from going in  the column itself as is usual with such columns did not stand directly upon the ground but upon a square pedestal which was built of massive blocks of granite resting on a deep and strong foundation and as the column itself was twelve feet in diameter the pedestal being necessarily somewhat larger was quite a considerable structure in the front of it opposite the gate in the iron railing was a door the door was open but nothing was to be seen but darkness within  i wonder what they do in there said rollo the gate is open and the door is open but i suppose the soldiers would not let any body go in to see do you suppose jennie that it can be possible that there is any way to get up to the top of the column by going in at that door  yes replied jennie and so saying she pointed eagerly to the top of the column and added for there are some boys up there now  rollo looked up to the top of the column there was a statue of napoleon upon the summit which appeared to be of about the ordinary size of a man though it is really about eight times as large as life being twice as large in every dimension it looks small on account of its being so high in the air beneath this statue and around the top of the column the children saw that there was a small gallery with a railing on the outside of it several persons were standing on this gallery leaning on the railing at first rollo thought that they were sculptured figures placed there like the statue of napoleon on the top for ornament but presently he saw some of them move about which convinced him that they were real men two of them were soldiers as was evident from the red uniform which they wore but they all looked exceedingly small  there must be a staircase inside said rollo or else some ladders if not how could those men get up  yes said jennie  i should like to go up there very much said rollo if i could only get by the soldiers  i should not dare to go up to such a high place said jennie shaking her head solemnly  at the foot of the column and outside of the railing which formed the enclosure around the pedestal was a very broad and smooth place as smooth as a floor and raised like a sidewalk above the street it was very broad and people walked over it in passing through the square there was only one way of passing through the square and that was from north to south from east to west there was no street but the ranges of houses and palaces continued on those sides unbroken these edifices presented a very fine architectural frontage toward the square and gave to the whole space which they enclosed a very rich and grand appearance over the doors of two or three of the houses there were small tricolored flags flying and wherever these flags were there were soldiers on the sidewalk below guarding the doors but neither rollo nor jennie was able to imagine what this could mean  about three oclock when rollo and jennie had began to be tired of looking at the column their mother came into the room she said that mr holiday was fatigued and was going to lie down and that neither he nor herself would go out again rollo then asked if he and jennie might go out and take a walk his mother seemed to hesitate about it but presently said that she would go and ask mr holiday if he thought it would be safe she accordingly went into the bed room and very soon returned saying that mr holiday thought it would be safe for them to go if he gave them some directions  he says added mrs holiday that you may get ready and then go into his room and he will give you the directions only you must not talk much with him for it hurts him to talk hear what he has to say and then come out immediately  so the children made themselves ready and then went into their fathers room they found him sitting in a great arm chair by a window where the sun was shining he looked pale and tired when the children came in however he turned to them with a smile and said  children i am glad you are going out to take a walk you can go very safely if you follow my directions  this is the place vendome there are only two ways of going out of it one leads to the north and the other to the south  if you take the road which goes to the north that is that way said mr holiday pointing you will go out by the street which is called the street of peaced the street of peace is straight and pretty broad and if you follow it to the end of it you will come to the boulevards  d mr holiday called this street of course by its french name but we give its name here in english for the convenience of the reader who may perhaps not be able to pronounce french  what are the boulevards asked rollo  hush said jennie gently touching rollo at the same time with her hand  boulevards said mr holiday means bulwarks a great many years ago there was a line of bulwarks or fortifications all around paris but at length when the city grew too large for them they levelled them down and made a very broad and handsome street where they had been and then afterward made a new line of fortifications farther out this broad and handsome street or rather series of streets is called the boulevards it extends almost entirely around the city of course when you get into the boulevards you are in no danger of losing yourselves for you can go on as far as you please either way and then come back to the street of peace again and then come home  yes said rollo i understand  here jennie gently touched rollo again to remind him that he was not to talk  you will know the boulevards at once when you come to them continued mr holiday they are so much broader and more beautiful than any of the other streets of paris even the sidewalks are as wide as many ordinary streets and there are rows of young trees along the edges of the sidewalks now if you choose you can go out from the place vendome on the northern side by the street of peace and so walk on till you come to the boulevards then you can walk along the boulevards as far as you please  or continued mr holiday you can take the opposite course you can go out of the place vendome on the southern side that will bring you directly in the garden of the tuileries  i should like to go into a garden said jennie and see the flowers  you will see continued mr holiday as soon as you begin to go out of the place vendome at a little distance before you perhaps as far as two or three blocks in new york a wall of green trees  a wall of green trees exclaimed rollo  yes said his father it is a thick row of trees growing in the garden and having the side toward the street trimmed smooth and straight like a wall the entrance through this range of trees opposite the gateway where you go into the garden looks like an archway in a green wall you will see it before you as soon as you turn the corner of this hotel into the street that leads that way you can walk straight on till you come to the place there you will find the entrance to the garden there is a very high iron palisade along the side of the garden toward the street with the rows of trees which i have spoken of inside of it there is a gateway through this palisade where you can go in there are two soldiers there to guard the gateway  then how can we get in asked jennie  o go right in replied mr holiday pay no attention to the soldiers they will not say any thing to you they are only sentinels  after you pass through the gateway you keep on in the same direction without turning to the right hand or to the left just as if you were going across the garden you go on in this way till you get to the middle alley which is a very wide alley that runs up and down the middle of the garden this alley is called the grand alley and it is a very grand alley indeed it is as broad as a very wide street and it is nearly two miles longa it begins at the palace of the tuileries in the middle of the city and extends through the whole length of the gardens of the tuileries and then passing out through great gates at the foot of the garden it extends through the elysian fields away out to the great triumphal arch of the star which you saw from the cars when you were coming into the city  now when you get into the grand alley which you will know by its being the broadest and smoothest and most splendid grand walk that you ever saw you must stop for a minute and look both ways ill tell you what you will see first if you turn to the left that is toward the east you will see at the end of the alley in that direction a long range of splendid buildings extending across from side to side in the opposite direction at the top of a long gentle slope a mile and a half away you will see the grand triumphal arch that is at the barrier of the city the view is not entirely open however out to the arch about midway in the centre of the grand alley is a tall obelisk standing on a high pedestal and farther along there are one or two fountains still you can see the triumphal arch very plainly it is so large and it stands so high  now the grand alley is nearly two miles long and wherever you may be in it you can always see the palace at one end the arch at the other and the egyptian obelisk in the middle so that as long as you walk back and forth in this alley keeping these things in sight you cannot lose your way  only i ought to say continued mr holiday that the garden does not extend all the way to the barrier the garden extends perhaps half a mile near the bottom of it is a great basin or pond of water with a stone margin to it all around you will have to go round this basin for the centre of it is exactly in the middle of the grand alley then you come very soon to the end of the garden and you will go out through great iron gates but still you will keep on in the same direction here you will come to a very large open square with the obelisk in the centre of it and fountains and statues in it all around still you will keep straight on across this square only you will have to turn aside to go round the obelisk after you pass through the square the grand alley still continues on though now it becomes a grand avenue leading through pleasure grounds with ranges of trees and of buildings on either side it becomes very wide here being as wide as two or three ordinary streets and will be filled with carriages and horsemen but there will be good broad sidewalks for you on either hand under the shade of the trees and you will know where you are all the time for you can always see the palace at one end of the view and the great triumphal arch at the other with the obelisk in the middle between them  the amount of it is added mr holiday speaking in a tone as if he were about finishing his instructions you can go out of the place vendome to the north and keep straight on till you come to the boulevards and walk there either way as far as you like or you can go south and keep straight on till you come to the middle of the grand alley of the garden of the tuileries and then walk in the grand alley and the grand avenue which forms the continuation of it as long as you like which way will you go  i would rather go to the garden said rollo looking toward jennie  yes said jennie and so would i  thus it was settled that they were to take the street which led toward the south from the place vendome and so bidding their father good by they went away before leaving the house however rollo went to a secretary which stood in the parlor and took down a map in order to show jennie the places which his father had mentioned and to make it sure that they understood the directions which they had received rollo found the place vendome very readily upon the map and the street leading to the gardens he also found the grand alley running through the garden and following this alley between the rows of trees he showed jennie a small circle which he thought must be the basin of water and the place where the obelisk stood and finally he pointed out the place where the grand alley widened out into the grand avenue and led on toward the barrier  jennie did not understand the map very well but she seemed satisfied with rollos assurances that he himself could find all the places  it is all right you may depend said rollo i can find the way you may be sure  so he put up the map bade his mother good by and then he and jennie sallied forth  the hotel was situated on the corner of the place vendome and the street which led toward the garden and as soon as the children had turned this corner after coming out from under the archway of the hotel they saw at some distance before them at the end of the street the iron palisade and the green wall of trees above it which formed the boundary of the garden  there it is exclaimed rollo there is the garden and the gateway and it is not very far  the children walked along upon the sidewalk hand in hand looking sometimes at the elegant carriages which rolled by them from time to time in the street and sometimes at the groups of ladies and children that passed them on the sidewalk at the first corner that they came to rollos attention was attracted by the sight of a man who had a box on the edge of the sidewalk with a little projection on the top of it shaped like a mans foot rollo wondered what it was for just before he reached the place however he saw a gentleman who then happened to come along stop before the box and put his foot on the projection immediately the man took out some brushes and some blacking from the inside of the box which was open on the side where the man was standing and began to brush the gentlemans boot  now how convenient that is said rollo if you get your shoes or your boots muddy or dusty you can stop and have them brushed  so saying he looked down at his own boots almost in hopes that he should find that they needed brushing in order that he might try the experiment but they looked very clean and bright and there seemed to be no excuse for having them brushed again  besides jennie was pulling him by the hand to hasten him along she said at the same time in an undertone  look rollo look see there is a blind lady walking along before us  blind repeated rollo  yes said jennie dont you see the little dog leading her  there was a little dog walking along at a little distance before the lady with a beautiful collar round his neck and a cord attached to it the lady had the other end of the cord in her hand  i dont believe she is blind said rollo  as the children passed by the lady she turned and looked at them or seemed to look and manifested no indications of being blind afterward jennie saw a great many other ladies walking with little dogs which they led or which led them by means of a cord which the owner of the dog held in her hand there were so many of these cases that jennie was compelled to give up the idea of their being blind but she said that she never knew any body but blind people led about by dogs before  at length the children arrived at the entrance to the garden it was on the farther side of a broad and beautiful street which ran along there just outside of the enclosure the palisades were of iron though the tops were tipped with gilding and they were very high they were more than twice as high as a mans head the lower ends of them were set firmly in a wall of very substantial masonry the gateway was very wide and it had sentry boxes on each side of it a soldier with his bayonet fixed was standing in front of each sentry box when jennie saw these soldiers she shrank back and seemed afraid to go in in fact rollo himself appeared somewhat disposed to hesitate in a moment however a number of persons who came along upon the sidewalk turned in at the gates and went into the yard the soldiers paid no attention to them rollo and jane seeing this took courage and went in too  on passing through the gates the children found themselves on a very broad terrace which ran along on that side of the garden the surface of the terrace was gravelled for a walk and it was very smooth and beautiful while standing on or walking upon it you could look on one side through the palisade and see the carriages in the street and on the other side you could look over a low wall down into the garden which was several feet below the descent into the garden was by a flight of stone steps the children after staying a little time upon the terrace went down the steps they came out upon a very broad avenue or alley which formed the side of the garden this alley was very broad indeed so broad that it was divided into three by orange trees which extended up and down in long rows parallel to the street almost as far as you could see and forming beautiful vistas in each direction these orange trees though very large were not set in the ground but were planted in monstrous boxes painted green and set on rollers the reason of this was so that they could be moved away in the winter and put in a building where they could be kept warm  this broad alley the great side alley of the garden on the side toward the city was called the alley of the oranges there is another similar alley on the opposite side of the garden which is toward the river and that is called the alley of the riverside  passing across the three portions of the alley of the oranges the children went on toward the centre of the garden instead however of such a garden as they had expected to see with fruits and flowers in borders and beds and serpentine walks winding among them as jennie had imagined the children found themselves in a sort of forest the trees of which were planted regularly in rows with straight walks here and there under them  what a strange garden said jennie  yes said rollo but we must not stop here we must go straight on through the trees until we come to the grand alley  in fact rollo could see the grand alley as he thought at some distance before him with people walking up and down in it there were several people too in the same walk with rollo and jane some going with them toward the grand alley and others coming back from it among these were two children just big enough to go alone who were prattling in french together very fluently as they walked along before their father and mother jennie said she wondered how such little children could learn to speak french so well another child somewhat older than these was trundling a hoop and at length unfortunately she fell down and hurt herself so leaving her hoop upon the ground she came toward the maid who had care of her crying and sobbing and uttering broken exclamations all in french which seemed to rollo and jane very surprising  at length the children came out into the grand alley they knew it immediately when they reached it by its being so broad and magnificent and by the splendid views which were presented on every hand  yes said rollo this is it i am sure there is the obelisk and there beyond it on the top of that long hill is the triumphal arch and there the other way is the palace of the tuileries here is a seat jennie lets go and sit down  so saying rollo led jennie to a stone seat which was placed on one side of the alley at the margin of the grove and there they sat for some time greatly admiring the splendid panorama which was spread out before them what happened to them for the remainder of their walk will be described in the next chapter     chapter v  the elysian fields   after sitting a little time upon the stone bench rollo and jennie rose and resumed their walk the alley was extremely broad and it was almost filled with parties of ladies and gentlemen and with groups of children who were walking to and fro some going out toward the triumphal arch and some returning rollo and jennie as they walked along said very little to each other their attention being almost wholly absorbed by the gay and gorgeous scene which surrounded them at length they perceived that at a little distance before them the people were separating to the right hand and to the left and going round in a sort of circuit and on coming to the place they found that the great basin or pond of water which mr holiday had described to them was there this pond was very large much larger than rollo had expected from his fathers account of it it was octagonal in form and was bordered all around with stone there were a number of children standing in groups on the brink at different places some were watching the motions of the gold fish that were swimming in the water and others were looking at a little ship which a boy was sailing on the pond the boy had a long thread tied to the bow of his ship and when the wind had blown it out upon the pond to the length of the string he would pull it back to the shore again and then proceed to send it forth on another voyage  rollo thought it strange that they should be thus employed on the sabbath for he had been brought up to believe that although it was very right and proper to take a quiet walk in a garden or in the fields toward the close of the day it was not right but would on the other hand be displeasing to god for any one old or young to spend any part of the day which god had consecrated to his own service and to the spiritual improvement of the soul in ordinary sports and amusements jennie too had the same feeling and accordingly after standing with rollo for a moment near the margin of the water looking at the fishes and the vessels and at the group of children that were there she began to pull rollo by the hand saying  come rollo i think we had better go along  rollo at once acceded to this proposal and they both walked on they soon found themselves passing out of the garden though the space on each side of the broad alley in which they were walking was bordered with so many walls palisades terraces statues and columns and the gateway which led out from the garden into the square was so broad and was so filled up moreover with the people who were going and coming that it was difficult to tell where the garden ended and the great square began at length however it began to be plain that they were out of the garden for the view instead of being shut in by trees became very widely extended on either hand it was terminated on one side by ranges of magnificent buildings and on the other by bridges leading across the river with various grand and imposing edifices beyond in the centre of the square the tall form of the obelisk towered high into the air gently tapering as it ascended and terminating suddenly at its apex in a point  the square though open was not empty besides the obelisk which stood in the centre of it on its lofty pedestal there were two great fountains and colossal statues of marble and lofty columns of bronze and gilt for the gaslights and raised sidewalks smooth as a floor formed of a sort of artificial stone which was continuous over the whole surface which was covered by it without fissure or seam there were roadways also crossing the place in various directions with carriages and horsemen upon them continually coming and going the great fountains were very curiously contrived the constructions were thirty or forty feet high they consisted of three great basins one above the other the smallest was at the top and was of course high in the air a column of water was spouting out from the middle of it and after rising a little way into the air the water fell back into the basin and filling it full it ran over the edge of it into the basin below  this was the middle basin and besides the water which fell into it from the basin above it received also a great supply from streams that came from the great basin below like the jets from the hose of a fire engine when a house is on fire there was a row of bronze figures shaped like men in the water of the lowest basin of all each holding a fish in his arms and the jets of water which were thrown up to the middle basin from the lower one came out of the mouths of these fishes the fishes were very large and they were shaped precisely like real fishes although they were made of bronze  the children looked at the fountains as they walked along and at length came to the foot of the obelisk they stopped a minute or two there and looked up to the top of it it was as tall as a steeple rollo was wondering whether it would be possible in any way to get to the top of it and he told jennie that he did not think that there was any way for he did not see any place where any body could stand if they should succeed in getting there while they both stood thus gazing upward they suddenly heard a wellknown voice behind them saying  well children what do you think of the obelisk of luxor  they turned round and beheld their uncle george they were of course very much astonished to see him he was walking with another young gentleman a friend of his from america whom he had accidentally met with in paris when the children had recovered from the surprise of thus unexpectedly meeting him he repeated his question  what do you think of the obelisk  i dont believe it is so high replied rollo as the column in the place vendome  no replied mr george it is not  nor so large added rollo  no said mr george  and i dont believe that there is any way to get to the top of it added rollo  no said mr george there is not the column in the place vendome is hollow and has a staircase inside but this obelisk is solid from top to bottom and is formed of one single stone that is the great wonder of it  illustration the obelisk  look up said mr george to the top of it it is as high as a steeple see how large it is too at the base think how enormously heavy such an immense stone must be what a work it must have been to lift it up and stand it on its end besides it does not rest upon the ground but upon another monstrous stone the pedestal of which is nearly thirty feet high so that in setting it up in its place the engineers had not only to lift it up on end but they had to raise the whole mass bodily twenty or thirty feet into the air i suppose it was one of the greatest lifts that ever was made  there is another thing that is very curious about the obelisk continued mr george and that is its history it was not made originally for this place it was made in egypt thousands and thousands of years ago nobody knows how long there are several others of the same kind still standing some years ago this one and another were given to the french by the government of egypt and the french king sent a large company of men to take this one down and bring it to paris they built an immense vessel on purpose for transporting it this vessel they sent to egypt it went up the nile as near to the place where the obelisk stood as it could go the place was called luxor the obelisk stood back at some distance from the river and there were several arab huts near it which it was necessary to pull down there were also several other houses in the way by the course which the obelisk must take in going to the river the french engineers bought all these houses and pulled them down then they made a road leading from the place where the obelisk stood to the river then they cased the whole stone in wood to prevent its getting broken or injured on the way then they lowered it down by means of immense machines which they constructed for the purpose and so proceeded to draw it to the river but with all their machines it was a prodigiously difficult work to get it along it took eight hundred men to move it and so slowly did it go that these eight hundred men worked three months in getting it to the landing there they made a great platform and so rolled it on board the float there was a steamer at hand to take it in tow and it was brought to france it then took five or six months to bring it across the country from the sea shore to paris  when at last they got it here it took them nearly a year to construct the machines for raising it they built the pedestal for it to stand upon which you see is as high as a twostory house and then appointed a day for the raising all the world almost came to see this whole square was full there were more than a hundred thousand persons here the king came and his family and all his generals and great officers it was the greatest raising that ever was seen  why there must have been just as great a raising said rollo when they first put it up in egypt  no said mr george because there it stood nearly upon the ground but here it is on the top of a lofty pedestal look there those are pictures of the machines which they raised it by  so saying mr george pointed to beautifully gilded diagrams which were sculptured upon one side of the pedestal there were beams and ropes and pulleys without number with the obelisk among them but rollo could not understand the operation of the machinery very well the obelisk itself was covered on all sides with ancient egyptian hieroglyphics deeply cut into the stone but the children could not understand the hieroglyphics any better than they could the machinery  after looking some time longer at the obelisk and the various objects of interest that were around it the whole party walked on together mr george said that he and his friend were going up the avenue of the elysian fields and that if rollo and jennie would walk along behind them they would not get lost jennie was very glad of this for the crowd of people that were coming and going was getting to be very great and she was a little afraid rollo on the other hand was rather sorry the triumphal arch at the farther end of the avenue was in full view and thus he felt sure of his way and he was ambitious of the honor of being the sole guide in the excursion which he and jane were taking he however could not well decline his uncles invitation so when the two gentlemen moved on rollo and jennie followed them  the grand avenue was a very broad and beautiful roadway gently ascending toward the barrier and now perfectly thronged with carriages and horsemen there were also two side avenues one on each side of the central one these were for foot passengers there were rows of trees between beyond the side avenues there extended on either hand a wood formed of large and tall trees planted in rows and standing close enough together to shade the whole ground they were however far enough apart to allow of open and unobstructed motion among them under these trees and in open spaces which were left here and there among them there were booths and stalls and tables and tents and all sorts of contrivances for entertainment and pleasure with crowds of people gathered around them in groups or moving slowly from one to the other there were men some dressed like gentlemen and others wearing blue cartmens frocks and women some with bonnets and some with caps and children of all ages and sizes and soldiers without number with blue coats and darkred trousers and funny caps without any brim except the visor in the midst of all these multitudes mr george and the gentleman who was with him slowly led the way up the side avenue rollo and jennie following them quite bewildered with the extraordinary spectacles which were continually presenting themselves to view on every hand the attention of the children was drawn from one object or incident to another with so much suddenness and so rapidly that they had no time to understand one thing before it passed away and something else came forward into view and diverted their thoughts and before they had recovered from the surprise which this second thing awakened they had come to a third more strange and wonderful perhaps than either of the preceding  a boy very young and very fantastically dressed came riding along through the crowd mounted on the smallest and prettiest black pony that rollo had ever seen and distributing as he passed along some sort of small printed papers to all who came near enough to get them rollo tried to get one of the papers to see what it was but he did not succeed  how i wish i had such a pony as that said rollo  so do i said jennie but what are the people doing in that ring  rollo saw a close ring of people all crowding around something on the ground there was a man inside the ring calling out something very loud and very incessantly rollo put his head between two of the spectators to see there was a man seated in the centre on the ground with a cloth spread out before him on which was a monstrous heap of stockings of all kinds and colors which he was selling as fast as possible to the men and women that had gathered around him he sold them very cheap and the people bought them very fast he put the money as fast as he received it in his cap which lay on the ground before him and served him for a cash box  come rollo said jane pulling rollo by the hand we must go along uncle george is almost out of sight  rollo turned back into the avenue again and began to walk along in a moment more he saw a large boy standing behind a curiouslooking stove in an open space near and baking griddle cakes there was a very nice table by his side covered with a white cloth and a plate on which the boy turned out the griddle cakes as fast as they were baked there were several children about him buying the cakes and eating them  ah jennie said rollo look at these cakes how i should like some of them if it were not that it is sunday i would go and buy some  o rollo exclaimed jennie look here see whats coming  rollo looked and saw that the ladies and gentlemen on the broad walk before them were moving to one side and the other to make room for a most elegant little omnibus drawn by six goats that were harnessed before it like horses the omnibus was made precisely like a large omnibus such as are used in the streets of paris for grown persons only this one was small just large enough for the goats to draw it was very beautifully painted and had elegant silken curtains it was full of children who were looking out the windows with very smiling faces as if they were enjoying their ride very much a very pretty little boy about seven years of age was holding the reins of the goats and appearing to drive but there was a large boy walking along by the side of the goats all the time to take care that they did not go wrong the omnibus belonged to his father who kept it to let children ride in it on their paying him a small sum for each ride  jennie was very much pleased with the omnibus but what followed it pleased her still more this was a carriage made in all respects like a real carriage and large enough to contain several children it was open like a barouche so that the children who were riding in it could see all around them perfectly well it had two seats inside besides a high seat in front for the coachman and one behind for the footman there were children upon all these seats there was one on the coachmans box to drive the carriage like the omnibus was drawn by goats only there were four instead of six the coachman drove them by means of long silken reins  as soon as the omnibus and the carriage had passed by and the crowd had closed again behind them so as to conceal them from view rollo and jennie looked about for mr george and the other gentleman but they were nowhere to be seen jane was quite frightened but rollo said he did not care  look there said rollo pointing back  what is it said jennie  the obelisk said rollo  jane saw the tall needlelike form of the obelisk towering into the air from the middle of the great square behind them and a part of the long front of the tuileries at the end of a vista of trees far beyond  as long as we have the obelisk in sight said rollo we cannot get lost  just then rollos attention was called to a broad sheet of paper fastened up upon a tree that he was passing by he stopped to see what it was a little girl about as old as jennie came up at the same time leading the maid who had the care of her by the hand this child began to read what was printed on the card she read aloud enunciating the words very slowly syllable by syllable and in a voice so clear and rich and silvery that it was delightful to hear her she seemed pleased to observe that rollo and jane were listening to her and when she got through she turned to them as if to apologize for not reading better and said in french and with a pleasant smile upon her countenance  i am learning to read but i cannot read too much yet you see  by too much she meant very well that being the way that the french express themselves in such a case  rollo understood what she said but he did not think it prudent to attempt to reply in the same language so he said simply in english  and yet i think my father would give five hundred dollars if i could read french like that hed be glad to do it  as rollo spoke these words the child looked earnestly in his face the smile gradually disappearing from her features and being replaced by a look of perplexity and wonder she then turned and led the maid away  there were a great many booths and stands about some in open spaces and some under the trees at one they had all sorts of cakes for sale at another toys of every kind such as hoops balls kites balloons rocking horses and all such things and at a third pictures some large some small some plain and some beautifully colored at one place by the side of the avenue where most of the people were walking there stood a man with a tall and gaylypainted can on his back it was covered with common drapery below but the top was bright and towered like a spire above the mans head there was a round bar like the leg of a chair which went from the bottom of the can to the ground to support it and take the weight off the mans shoulders when he was standing still the man was standing still now and was all the time tinkling a little bell to call the attention of the people to what he had to sell it was something to drink there were two kinds of drink in the can separated from each other by a division in the interior there were two small pipes one for each kind of drink leading from the bottom of the can round by the side of the man to the front with stopcocks at the end where he could draw out the drink conveniently there was also a little rack to hold the glasses there were three glasses for the man sometimes had three customers at a time while rollo and jane were looking at this man a boy came up for a drink the man took one of the glasses from the little rack and filled it by turning one of the stopcocks when the boy had taken his drink and paid the money the man wiped the glass with a towel which he kept for the purpose and then putting it back in its place on the rack he went on tinkling his little bell  in the mean time the crowd of people seemed to increase and it appeared to rollo and jennie when they came to observe particularly that they were nearly all walking one way and that was up the avenue as if there were some place in that direction where they were all going rollo supposed that of course it was a church he had been told by his father when they were travelling in england that when he was in any strange place on sunday and wished to find the way to church one good method was to observe in the streets whenever he saw any considerable number of people moving in the same direction and to join and follow them he would in such cases his father said be very sure to be conducted to a church and after going in he would generally find some one who would show him a seat rollo and jennie had often practised on this plan in fact they took a particular interest and pleasure in going to church in this way as there was something a little of the nature of adventure in it  when accordingly the children observed that the great mass of the people that filled the two side avenues as well as the carriages that were in the central one were all moving steadily onward together paying little attention to the booths and stalls and other places and means of amusement which were to be seen under the trees on either hand he concluded that while some of the people of paris were willing to amuse themselves with sports and exhibitions on sunday the more respectable portion would not stop to look at them but went straight forward to church and he and jennie resolved to follow their example  i should like to see all these things very much said rollo some other day but now we will go on jennie to the church where the rest of the people are going  jennie very cordially approved of this plan and so they walked on together it happened that at the time when they came to this determination there was walking just before them a party consisting apparently of a father and mother and their two children the father and mother walked together first and the two children hand in hand followed the oldest child was a girl of about jennies age the other was a very small boy just beginning to learn to talk rollo and jennie came immediately behind these children and were very much interested in hearing them talk together especially to hear the little one prattling in french he called his sister adrienne and she called him antoine thus rollo and jennie knew the names of the children but they had no way of finding out what were the names of the father and mother  now jennie said rollo in a low tone i think we had better follow this party and keep close to them all the time and then when we get to the church perhaps they will give us a seat  jennie liked this proposal very much and so she and rollo walked along after adrienne and antoine not too near them but so near as to keep them always in sight sometimes the party turned aside from the avenue to walk under the trees and sometimes they stopped a few minutes to look at some curious exhibition or spectacle which was to be seen at one place a man had a square marked off and enclosed with a line to keep the crowd back and in the middle he had an electrical machine with which he gave shocks to any of the bystanders who were willing to take them a boy kept turning the machine all the time at another place was a little theatre mounted on a high box so that all could see with little images about as large as dolls dancing on the stage or holding dialogues with each other the words were really spoken by a man who was concealed in the box below but as the little images moved about continually and made all sorts of gesticulations corresponding with what was said it seemed to the bystanders precisely as if they were speaking themselves besides this the images would walk about scold each other quarrel and fight each other run out at little doors and then come in again and do a great many other things which it was very wonderful to see such little figures do  there were places too where there were great whirling machines under splendid tents and canopies with horses and boats and ships and cradles at the circumference of them all of which were made to sail round and round through the air carrying the children that were mounted on the horses or sitting in the ships and boats there were also several places for shooting at a mark with little spring guns which were loaded with peas instead of bullets there were figures of bears lions tigers ducks deer and other animals at a little distance which were kept moving along all the time by machinery for the children to shoot at with the peas if they hit any of them they drew a prize consisting of cake or gingerbread or of some sort of plaything or toy of which great numbers were hanging up about the shooting place all these and a great many other similar contrivances for amusing people rollo and jane saw as they passed along but they did not stop to look at them excepting when the gentleman and lady stopped whom they were following this was seldom however and so they went on the whole very steadily forward up the long and gentle ascent until at length they reached the great triumphal arch at the neuilly barrier     chapter vi  a great mistake   as they approached the arch the children gazed upon it with astonishment being greatly impressed with its magnitude and height there were a great many men on the top of it their heads and shoulders were visible from below as they stood leaning over the parapet they however looked exceedingly small  rollo and jennie would have liked to stop and look longer at the arch but they did not wish to separate from adrienne and antoine who kept walking steadily on all the time with their father and mother rollo supposed as has been said before that this party were going to some church but they were not they were going to a place called the hippodrome  the hippodrome far from being a church is a place of amusement it is used for equestrian performances and feats of strength and agility and balloon ascension and all similar entertainments  the hippodrome is a long oval enclosure with eight or ten ranges of seats extending all around it and rising one above another like the seats of the coliseum at rome there is a roof extending all around over the seats but the area within is so large that it could not well be covered with a roof besides if there were a roof over it how could the balloons go up  then moreover the spectacles which are exhibited in the hippodrome appear to much better advantage when seen in the open light of day than if they were under the cover of a roof so long as the spectators themselves are protected from the sun and from any sudden showers  the area in the middle of the hippodrome is about one hundred yards long and fifty yards wide it is so large that there is room for a good wide road all around it and also for another road up and down the middle with little gardens of grass and flowers between at the very centre is a round area where there is a concealed canal of water to represent a stream this water is ordinarily covered with planks and the planks are covered with a very thick canvas carpet and this with sand so that the water is entirely concealed and the horsemen ride over it just as they do over any other part of the area when they wish to use it to show how the horses could leap over streams they take off the sand roll up the carpet and carry away the planks and there they have a very good representation of a stream  the performances at the hippodrome are very various sometimes whole troops of horse come in from between two great curtains at one end all elegantly caparisoned and mounted some by men and some by girls but all whether men or girls dressed in splendid uniforms these troops ride round and round the area and up and down in the middle of it performing a great variety of evolutions in the most rapid and surprising manner  then there are races of various kinds some are run by beautiful girls who come out mounted on elegant gray horses that are mottled like leopards each of the riders having a scarf over her shoulders of a different color from the rest so that they may be all readily distinguished from each other in the race then there are races of chariots three running at a time round and round the area and of small ponies with monkeys on them for riders there are various contrivances too for athletic and gymnastic feats such as masts and poles for climbers to ascend and other similar apparatus all these things give the interior of the hippodrome quite a gay and lively appearance and the area necessary for them is so large that the ranges of seats surrounding it are sufficient to accommodate ten thousand spectators  it was to this place that adrienne and antoine with their father and mother were going while rollo and jennie supposed that they were going to a church there was nothing to lead rollo to suspect his mistake in the aspect of the building as he approached the entrance to it for the sides of it were hidden by trees and other buildings and the portal though very large and very gayly decorated seemed still so far as rollo could get a glimpse of it through the crowds of people only to denote that it was the entrance to some very splendid public edifice without at all indicating the nature of the purposes to which it was devoted  the immense concourse of people which were pouring into the hippodrome divided themselves at the gates into two portions and passed up an ascent to enter at side doors rollo and jane following their guides went toward the right they observed that the father of adrienne and antoine stopped at a little window near the entrance to pay the price of admission for himself and wife and his two children and to get the tickets he paid full price for his two children and so took four full tickets rollo and jane did not see him pay the money they only observed that there was a crowd at the little window and they saw antoines father take the tickets they did not know what this meant however but they followed on when they all came to the doorway which led up to the ranges of seats the man whose duty it was to take the tickets supposed that the four children all belonged to the same family and that they had been admitted at half price and that accordingly two of the tickets were for the father and mother and the other two for the four children so he let them all pass on together especially as there was at that time such a throng of people crowding in that there was no time to stop and make any inquiries  rollo and jane were carried along by the current up a flight of stairs which came out among the ranges of seats and after moving along for some distance till they came to a vacancy they sat down and began to look around and survey the spacious and splendid interior into which they had entered they were at once overwhelmed with the magnificence of the spectacle which was presented to view instead of a church they found a vast open area extended before them surrounded with long ranges of seats and laid out in the interior in the most graceful and beautiful manner  jennie said rollo after gazing about for some moments almost bewildered if this is any kind of meeting at all i think it must be a camp meeting  jennie was completely bewildered and had no opinion on the subject whatever so she said nothing  thats the place for the choir i suppose said rollo pointing to a sort of raised platform with a balustrade in front which was built among the seats in the middle of one of the sides of the hippodrome but then he added after a moments pause i dont see any pulpit unless that is it  as he said this rollo pointed to a balcony with a rich canopy over it which was built up among the seats directly opposite to the musicians gallery on the other side of the arena this balcony was for the use of the emperor and his family and friends when they chose to come and witness the spectacles in the hippodrome  these speculations of rollos were suddenly interrupted by the striking up of martial music by a full band of trumpets drums clarinets hautboys and horns from the musicians gallery soon afterwards the curtains opened at the farther end of the arena and a magnificent troop of horse mounted by male and female riders all dressed in the gayest and most splendid costumes came prancing in as soon as rollo had recovered from his astonishment at this spectacle he turned to jennie and said  jennie it is not any church or meeting at all and i think we had better go home  i think so too said jennie  i should like to come here some other day added rollo and i mean to ask my father to let us come uncle george will come with us but now we had better go home  so the children rose from their seats and began to move toward the door it was some time before they could get out so great was the number of people still coming in they however finally succeeded and were quite relieved when they found themselves once more in the open air  they turned their steps immediately toward home jane however soon began to feel very tired and so rollo said he would stop the first omnibus that came along the avenue was full of carriages of every kind and pretty soon an omnibus headed down the obelisk appeared among them rollo made a signal for the conductor to stop and he and jennie got in  they had a very pleasant ride back through the elysian fields and around the great square where the obelisk stands they then entered the street which runs along by the side of the gardens of the tuileries and advanced in it toward the heart of the city rollo made a sign for the conductor to stop when the omnibus reached that part of the street which was opposite to the entrance into the garden where he and jennie had gone in this was of course also opposite to the street leading into the place vendome it was but a short walk from this place to the hotel about six oclock the children arrived at the hotel and the table was already set for dinner mr holiday was reclining on a couch in the room and mrs holiday had been reading to him rollos uncle george was also in the room mrs holiday laid down her book when the children came in rollo and jennie sat down upon a sofa not far from their fathers couch they were glad to rest  well children said mrs holiday have you had a pleasant walk  yes said rollo a very pleasant walk indeed we have seen a great many very curious things but i believe we made a mistake  what mistake asked mrs holiday  why we followed a great many people that we thought were going to church but instead of that they led us into a great place that i think was some sort of circus  here mr george looked up very eagerly and began to laugh  i declare said he i shouldnt wonder if you got into the hippodrome  i dont know what it was said rollo when we first went in we saw that it was not a church but we did not know but that it might be some sort of camp meeting but pretty soon they began to bring horses in and ride them around and so we came out  here mr george fell into a long and uncontrollable paroxysm of laughter during the intervals of which he said in broken language as he walked about the room endeavoring to get breath and recover his selfcontrol that it was the best thing he had heard since he landed at liverpool the idea of following the crowd of parisians in the champs elys√©es on sunday afternoon with the expectation of being conducted to church and then finally taking the hippodrome for a camp meeting rollo himself though somewhat piqued at having his adventure put in so ridiculous a light could not help laughing too and even his father and mother smiled  never mind rollo said his mother at length i dont think you were at all to blame though i am glad that you came out when you found what sort of a place it was  o no said mr george as he gradually recovered his selfcontrol you were not to blame in the least the rule you followed is a very good one for england and america but it does not apply to france going with the multitude sunday afternoons in paris will take you any where but to church  notwithstanding the concurrence of opinion between rollos mother and his uncle that he had done nothing wrong neither he nor jennie could help feeling some degree of uneasiness and some little dissatisfaction with themselves in respect to the manner in which they had spent the afternoon they had both been accustomed to consider the sabbath as a day solemnly consecrated to the worship of god and to the work of preparation for heaven it is true that the day sometimes seemed very long to them as it does to all children and though they had always been allowed to take quiet walks in the gardens and grounds around the house still they usually got tired before night came of being so quiet and still notwithstanding this however they had no disposition to break over the rule which as they supposed the law of god enjoined upon them they fully believed that god himself had ordained that there should be one day in seven from which all the usual occupations and amusements of life should be excluded and which should be consecrated wholly to rest to religious contemplation and to prayer and they were very willing to submit to the ordinance though it brought with it upon them as children burdens and restrictions which it was sometimes quite onerous for them to bear  when night came rollo found that he always felt much happier if he had kept the sabbath strictly than when he attempted either secretly or openly to evade the duty there was a sort of freshness and vigor too with which he engaged in the employments of the week on monday morning which though he had never stopped to account for it philosophically he enjoyed very highly and which made monday morning the brightest and most animated morning of the week so rollo was accustomed to acquiesce very willingly in the setting apart of the sacred day to religious observances and to rest thinking that the restraints and restrictions which it imposed were amply compensated for by the peace and comfort which it brought to his mind when he observed it aright and by the novelty and freshness of the charm with which it invested the ordinary pursuits and enjoyments of life when it was over  accordingly on this occasion feeling a little dissatisfied with himself and uneasy in mind in consequence of the manner in which he had spent the afternoon rollo determined to make all the atonement for his fault if fault it was that was now in his power accordingly when the family rose from the table after dinner which was about seven oclock and his father and mother went and sat upon the sofa together which stood in the recess of a window looking out upon the place vendome rollo said to jane in an undertone  jennie come with me  he said this in the tone of an invitation not of command and jennie understood at once from her experience on former occasions that rollo had some plan for her entertainment or gratification so she got down from her chair and went off with him very readily  they went out at a door which led into their mothers bed room  jennie said rollo as he walked along with her across the room i am going to get the bible and sit down here by the window and read in it would not you like to read with me  yes said jennie if you will find a pretty story to read about there are a great many toward the first part of the bible  yes said rollo i will  and let us go into my room to read said jennie i like my room the best  well said rollo i like your room best too  so rollo took the bible off from the table of his fathers room and then he and jennie went on together into jennies room this room was a little boudoir which opened from mr and mrs holidays room it was a charming little place and it was no wonder that jennie liked it it was hung with drapery all around except where the window was on one side and a large looking glass and a picture on two other sides there was even a curtain over the door so that when you were in and the door was shut and the curtain over it was let down you seemed to be entirely secluded from all the world this drapery was green and the room being entirely enclosed in it might have seemed sombre had it not been for the brilliancy and beauty of the furniture and the variegated colors and high polish of the floor there was an elegant bedstead and bed in the back part of the room with a carved canopy over it there was a bureau also with drawers where jennie kept her clothes and a little fireplace with a pretty brass fender before it and a marble mantel piece above with a clock and two vases of flowers upon it there were a great many other curious and beautiful articles of furniture in the room which gave it a very attractive appearance and made it in fact as pretty a place of seclusion as a lady could desire to have jennie enjoyed this room very much indeed but still after all notwithstanding the expensiveness and beauty of the decorations which adorned it i do not know that jennie enjoyed it any more than she did a little seat that she had under some lilac bushes near the brook at the bottom of her fathers garden at home  there was a small couch in the recess of the window in jennies boudoir and here she and rollo established themselves with the bible lying open before them upon a small table which they had placed before the couch to hold it they raised their own seats by means of large square cushions which were there so as to bring themselves to the right height for reading from the book while it lay upon the table and they put their feet upon a tabouret which belonged to the room the tabouret was made for a seat but it answered an admirable purpose for a footstool as soon as the two children were thus comfortably established they opened the bible and rollo began to turn over the leaves in the books of samuel and of kings in order to find something which he thought would interest jennie  at length he found a chapter which seemed so far as he could judge by running his eye along the verses to consist principally of narration and dialogue and so he determined to begin the reading at once  now said he jennie i will read one verse and then you shall read one and i will tell you the meaning of all the words that you dont know  jennie was much pleased with this arrangement and she read the verses which came to her with great propriety it is true that there were a great many words at which she was obliged to hesitate some little time before she could pronounce them and there were others which she could not pronounce at all rollo had the tact to wait just long enough in these cases by telling children too quick when they are endeavoring to spell out a word we deprive them of the pleasure of surmounting the difficulty themselves and by waiting too long we perplex and discourage them there are very few children who when they are hearing their younger brothers and sisters read have the proper discretion on this point in fact a great many fullgrown teachers fail in this respect most seriously and make the business of reading on the part of their pupils a constant source of disappointment and vexation to them when it might have been a pleasure  rollo too besides the patient and kind encouragement which he afforded to jane in her attempts to read her verses herself read those which fell to his share in a very distinct and deliberate manner keeping the place all the while with his finger so that jennie might easily follow him he stopped also from time to time to explain the story to jennie and to talk about the several incidents that were described in it in order to make it sure that jennie understood them all it would have been much easier for him to have taken the book himself and to have read the whole chapter off at once fluently but this would have defeated his whole object which was not to do what he could do most easily but to do good and help jennie if a boy were going up a high hill with his sister in his company it would be easier for him to go directly on and leave his sister behind a selfish boy would be likely to do this but a generousminded boy would prefer to go slowly and help his sister along over the rocks and up the steep places  rollo and jane both became so much interested in their reading that they continued it almost an hour it then began to be dark and so they put the book away their mother came in about that time and was very much pleased when she found how rollo and jennie had been employed and rollo and jennie themselves experienced a substantial and deeplyseated feeling of satisfaction and comfort that all the merrymaking of the elysian fields could never give if any of the readers of this book have any doubt of this let them try the experiment themselves at some time after they have been spending a portion of the sabbath in such a way as to give them an inward feeling of uneasiness and selfcondemnation let them engage for a time in the voluntary performance of some serious duty as rollo did and in the spirit and temper which he manifested and see how strongly it will tend to bring back their peace of mind and restore them to happiness to try the experiment more effectually still spend the whole sabbath in this manner and then see with what a feeling of quiet and peaceful satisfaction you will go to bed at night and with what a joyous and buoyant spirit you will awake on monday morning  before rollo left paris he went one tuesday afternoon with his mother and jennie and his uncle george to see the performances at the hippodrome and he enjoyed the spectacle very much indeed besides the performances which have already been described there were two others which astonished him exceedingly in one of these a man came into the middle of the area and there the assistants lifted up a large and heavy pole which they poised in the air and then set the lower end of it in a sort of socket which was made in an apron which the man wore which socket was fastened securely to the mans hips and shoulders by strong straps so that he could sustain the weight of the pole by means of them the pole was about thirty feet high and the top was branched like a pitchfork it was shaped in fact exactly like a pitchfork except that there was a bar across from the top of one branch to the top of the other and a rope hanging down from the middle of the bar half way down to the place of bifurcationthat is to the place where the straight part of the pole ended and the branches began things being thus arranged a boy who was about twelve years old apparently came out and leaping up upon the mans shoulders began to climb up the pole when he reached the top of it he took hold of the rope and by means of the rope climbed up to the bar here he began to perform a great variety of the most astonishing evolutions the man all the time poising the pole in the air the boy would climb about the bar in every way drawing himself up sometimes backwards and sometimes forward and swinging to and fro and turning over and over in every conceivable position he would hang to the bar sometimes by his hands and sometimes by his legssometimes with his head downward sometimes with his feet downward he would whirl round and round over the bar a great many times till rollo and jane were tired of seeing him and then he would rest by hanging to the pole by the back of his head without touching the bar with any other part of his body all this time the man who held the pole kept it carefully poised moving to and fro about the area continually in following the oscillations  illustration the hippodrome  the other performance was in some respects more extraordinary still there was a mast set up in the ground thirty or forty feet high at the ground ten feet from the foot of the mast there commenced an inclined plane formed of a plank about a foot or eighteen inches wide which ascended in a spiral direction round and round the mast till it reached the top a man ascended this plane by means of a large ball about two feet in diameter which he rolled up standing upon it and rolling it by stepping continually on the ascending side there was no ledge or guard whatever to keep the ball from rolling off the planenothing but a narrow plank ascending continually and winding in a spiral manner around the mast this experiment it was quite frightful to see several of the children who were sitting near mr georges party began to cry saying o he will fallhe will fall in fact jennie could not bear to look at him and so she shut her eyes and even mrs holiday looked another way but rollo watched it through and saw the man go on up to the very top of the mast and stand there on his ball on the top forty feet above the ground with his hands extended in triumph after remaining there a short time he came down as he had gone up and when he reached the ground he rolled his ball along keeping on it all the time till he came to a chariot which was waiting to receive him he stepped from the ball off to the chariot and was then driven all around the ring being received every where as he passed with the acclamations of the spectators     chapter vii  carlos   one morning just after breakfast when rollo and jennie were sitting at the window of their hotel looking at a band of about forty drummers that were arranging themselves on the asphaltum in the place vendome in front of the column preparatory to an exercise of practice on their instrument mr george came into the room mr george took up a newspaper which was lying upon the table and seating himself in a large arm chair which was near he read from it for a few minutes and then laying down the paper said  rollo how do you pronounce louvois  mr george did not speak the word but spelled it letter by letter  i dont know said rollo  because said mr george that is the name of the hotel where i have gone  what made you go away from this hotel uncle george asked jennie didnt you like it  yes replied mr george i liked it very much but i wanted to change the scene i had become very familiar with every thing in this part of the city and with the modes of life in this hotel so i thought i would change and go to some other quarter of the city where i could see paris and paris life in new aspects  i wish i had gone with you said rollo i wonder if my father would not let me go now is there a room for me at your hotel he added looking up eagerly  i dont know said mr george you can ask when you go there but to day i am going to see the garden of plants and you may go with me if you like  well said rollo i should like to go very much  and may i go too said jennie  yes said mr george if your mother is willing  well said jennie joyfully ill go and ask her only i wish it was a garden of flowers instead of a garden of plants  so jennie went to ask her mother if she might go with her uncle george she soon returned with her shawl and bonnet on and then mr george leading the way they all went together down stairs and got into a carriage which was waiting for them at the door the carriage was an open one with the top turned back so that they all had a fine opportunity to see the streets and the persons passing as they rode along  mr george directed the coachman to drive first to his hotel and the carriage leaving the place vendome on the northern side entered into a perfect maze of narrow streets through which it advanced toward the heart of the city  after a time they came to a long straight street which led across the city through the centre of it from the river to the boulevards and when they were about in the middle of this street the attention of the children was attracted by a very long and gloomylooking building which formed one side of the street for a considerable distance before them it had no windows toward the street but only a range of square recesses in the walls of the form of windows but without any glass jennie asked mr george if it was the prison  not exactly said mr george and yet there is one room in it where there are more than a hundred men and they are not permitted to speak a loud word  lets go and see them said rollo  very well said mr george we will  so saying he called upon the coachman to stop opposite to a great archway which opened through the building near the middle of it mr george and the children descended from the carriage and went in under the archway looking through they saw a large court yard with grass and trees and a fountain they did not however go on into this court yard but turned to the right to a very broad flight of steps which seemed to lead into the building there was a man in uniform with a cocked hat upon his head who stood in the passage way to guard the entrance he made no objection however to the partys going in and so they all went on up the stairway  after passing through a series of magnificent passages and vestibules with very broad staircases and massive stone balustrades and other marks of a very ancient and venerable style of architecture mr george led the way through an open door where the children saw extended before them as far as the eye could reach a long range of rooms opening into one another and all filled with bookshelves and books the rooms had windows only on one side that is on the side next the courtyard and the doors which led from one room to the other were all near that side of the room thus three sides of each room were almost wholly unbroken and they were all filled with bookshelves and books the doors which led from one room to another were all in a range so that standing at one end opposite to one of these doors the spectator could look through the whole range of rooms to the other end the distance was moreover so great that though there was a group of several persons standing at the farther end of the range of rooms at the time that rollo entered they looked so small and so indistinct that rollo could not count them to tell how many there were  it is a library said rollo  yes said mr george it is the national library of paris one of the largest libraries in the world the books have been accumulating here for ages  i dont see what can be the use of such a large library said rollo nobody can possibly read all the books  no said mr george they cannot read them all but they may wish to consult them there are often particular reasons for seeing some particular book which was published so long ago that it is not now to be found in common bookstores in such cases people come here and they are pretty sure to find the book in this collection  there were several parties of ladies and gentlemen to be seen at different distances walking along the range of rooms all of whom seemed to be visitors mr george himself walked on and the children followed him they passed from one apartment to another amazed at the number of books they were all neatly arranged on bookshelves which extended from the floor to the ceiling and were protected by a wire netting in front so that although the visitors could see the books they could not take them down  mr george and the children walked on until at length they came to the end of the range of rooms and there they found another range running at right angles to the first back from the street they turned and walked along through these rooms too the floors of all the rooms were very smooth and glossy being formed of narrow boards of darkcolored wood curiously inlaid and highly polished rollo told jennie that he believed he could slide on such floors as well as he could on ice if he thought they would let him try he knew very well however that it would not be proper to try besides he observed that there were standing at different distances along the range of rooms certain men in uniform who seemed to be officers stationed in the library to guard against any thing like irregularity or disorder on the part of the visitors  besides the books there were a great many other things to interest visitors in the rooms of the library such as models of buildings statues collections of coins medals and precious gems and other similar curiosities these things were arranged on tables and in cases made expressly for them and placed in the various rooms the tables and cases occupy generally the central parts of the rooms that they were placed in so as not to interfere with the use of the sides of the rooms for books in one place was a collection of some of the oldest books that ever were printed showing the style of typography that prevailed when the art of printing was first discovered mr george took great interest in looking at these rollo and jennie however did not think much of them and so while their uncle was examining these ancient specimens they went to the windows and looked out into the court yard this court formed a green and beautiful garden shaded with trees and adorned with fountains and walks the visitors could see that the buildings of the library extended in long ranges all around it  at length at the end of the second range of rooms the party came to a third range which was parallel to the first and which extended along the back side of the court yard the children could not go into these apartments for the entrance to them was closed by a glass partition they could however look through the partition and see what there was within they beheld a very long hall which was several hundred feet in length apparently and quite wide and it was lined on both sides with bookshelves and books long tables were extended up and down this hall with a great number of gentlemen sitting at them all engaged in silent study some were reading some were writing some were looking at books of maps or engravings there were desks at various places up and down the room with officers belonging to the library sitting at them and several messengers dressed in uniform going to and fro bringing books mr george explained to the children that there was another entrance to this room leading from the court yard by a separate staircase and that any person who wished to read or study might go in there and sit at those tables only he must be still and not disturb the studies of the rest if he wished for any book he could not go and get it from the shelves but must write the title of it in full on a slip of paper and carry it to one of the desks the officer would take the slip and give it to one of the messengers who would then go and get the book  after looking through the glass partition at this great company of readers and students until their curiosity was satisfied the children turned away and mr george conducted them back through the long ranges of rooms by the same way that they came when at length they got back to the staircase where they had come up mr george instead of going out where he had come in descended by another way through new corridors and passages until he came to a room where a considerable number of people were sitting at tables looking at books of engravings the sides of this room and of several others opening into it were filled with bound volumes of prints and engravings some plain and some colored but very beautiful many of the volumes were very large but however large they might be it was very easy to turn over the leaves and see the pictures for the tables or rather desks in the middle of the room were so contrived that a book placed upon them was held at precisely the right slope to be seen to advantage by persons sitting before it mr george told the children in a whisper that any one might ask for any book there was there and the attendants would place it on one of the tables for him where he might sit and look at the prints in it as long as he pleased  some day continued mr george we will come here and look over some of these books but today we must go to the garden of plants  mr george then led the children back to the carriage and ordered the coachman to drive to his hotel  the hotel was situated on the site of an open square which though by no means so grand and magnificent as the place vendome was still a very pleasant place  there was a fountain in the centre with a large basin of water around it outside of this basin the square was paved with asphaltum and was as hard and smooth as a floor the pavement was shaded with trees which were planted at equal distances all over it and under the trees there were seats where various persons were sitting there were many children too playing about under the trees some trundling hoop some jumping rope and some playing horses  the carriage stopped at the door of the hotel and mr george took the children up to his room it was a front room and it looked out upon the square the children went to the window and while mr george was getting ready to go they amused themselves by looking at the children that were playing on the square  among the other children there was a boy apparently about eight years of age who was sitting apart from the rest of the children on a bench by himself his complexion was dark and his hair very black and glossy he was very neatly and prettily dressed though in a very peculiar style his costume being quite different from any thing that rollo had ever before seen he had a ball in his hand which now and then he tossed into the air  he has not any body to play with said rollo to jennie i have a great mind to go down and play with him while uncle george is getting ready  very well said mr george you can go i shall not be ready for nearly half an hour we do not wish to get to the garden of plants before twelve oclock  rollo hesitated a little about going down and while he was hesitating the boy rose from his seat and came toward the hotel he entered under the archway and presently rollo heard him coming up the staircase he then determined to hesitate no longer so he went out into the passage way to see him  the boy had reached the top of the staircase when rollo went out and was just then coming along the hall he looked at rollo with a smile as he came toward him and this encouraged rollo to speak to him  cant you find any one to play with you said rollo  the boy shook his head but did not speak  he meant by this that he did not understand what rollo said but rollo thought he meant that he could not find any one to play with him  i will play with you said rollo and as he spoke he held out his hands with the wrists together and the palms open between them in a manner customary with boys for catching a ball  the boy understood the sign though he did not understand the words he tossed the ball to rollo and rollo caught it rollo then tossed it back again presently rollo made signs to the boy to sit down upon the floor at one end of the hall while he sat down at the other explaining his wishes also at the same time in words the boy talked too in reply to rollo accompanying what he said with signs and gestures they got along thus together in their play very well each one imagining that he helped to convey his meaning to the other by what he said while in fact neither understood a word that was spoken by the other and so took notice of nothing but the signs  rollo listened attentively once or twice to short replies that his new friend made to him in order to see if he could not distinguish some words in it that he could understand but he could not and he finally concluded that it must be some other language than french that the boy was speaking he was sorry for this for he could understand short sentences in french pretty well and could speak short sentences himself in reply when however he tried to speak to the boy in french he observed that he did not appear to understand him any better than when he spoke in english this confirmed him in the opinion that the boy must belong to some other nation  after playing together for some time with the ball the two boys began to feel quite acquainted with each other rollo wished very much to find out his new companions name so he asked him in english  what is your name  the boy smiled and throwing the ball across again to rollo as he spoke said something in reply but it was a great deal too much to be his name what he said was when interpreted into english my father bought this ball for me and gave two francs for it  then rollo thought he would try french so he translated his question and asked it in french  and i am going to carry it with me to switzerland and italy said the boy speaking still in the unknown tongue  that cant be your name either said rollo i am very sure  then after a moments pause he added in an eager voice and manner as if a new idea had suddenly struck him  we are going to the garden of plantsuncle george and jennie and i wouldnt you like to go too  the boy smiled and held out his hands for rollo to roll the ball to him saying something at the same time which to rollo seemed totally unmeaning  he does not understand me i suppose but i know how i can explain it to him  so he rose from the floor and by means of a great deal of earnest gesticulation and beckoning he induced the boy to get up too and follow him rollo led the way into his uncles chamber the boy seemed pleased though a little timid in going in  uncle george said rollo here is a boy that cannot talk are you willing that i should invite him to go with us to the garden of plants  yes said mr george though i dont see how you are going to do it  rollo led the boy to the window and pointed to the carriage which stood down before the door below then he opened a map of paris which lay upon the table and found the garden of plants laid down upon it and showed it to the boy then he pointed to his uncle george to jennie and to himself and then to the carriage then he made a motion with his hand to denote going by these gesticulations he conveyed the idea quite distinctly to his new acquaintance that they were all going to the garden of plants he then finally pointed to the boy himself and also to the carriage and looked at him with an inquiring look which he meant as an invitation to the boy to accompany them the boy paid close attention to all these signs and when rollo had finished instead of either nodding or shaking his head in token of his accepting or declining the invitation as rollo expected he would have done he took up the map and making certain mysterious gestures which rollo could not comprehend he walked off rapidly out of the room  rollo looked at his uncle george with an expression of great astonishment on his countenance  what does that mean said he  perhaps he has gone to ask his father or his mother suggested mr george  he has exclaimed rollo he has thats it im sure  so rollo went out immediately into the hall to wait till the boy came back  in a few minutes a door opened which led into a suite of apartments in the rear of the hotel and the boy with the map in his hand came into the hall nodding his head and looking very much pleased talking all the time moreover in a very voluble but perfectly unintelligible manner a moment after he came the door opened again and a very respectably dressed man of middle age came into the hall the boy pointed to rollo and said something to this man  are you going to the garden of plants said the man to rollo speaking in english though with a very decidedly foreign accent  yes sir said rollo  and did you invite carlos to go with you  yes sir said rollo only i did not know that his name was carlos he told me something very different from that what language is it that he talks is it french  no replied the man it is spanish he is a spanish boy he cannot understand a word of french or english but he may go with you to the garden of plants  are you his father sir asked rollo  no replied the man i am his fathers couriere  e a courier is a traveling servant a good courier understands all the principal languages of europe and is acquainted with all the routes and modes of travelling he takes all the care of the party that employs him makes bargains for them finds out good hotels for them to go to pays the bills obtains all necessary information and does every thing for them in fact which is required in making the tour of europe  so saying the man passed on leaving rollo and carlos together  come carlos said rollo let us go into uncle georges room and see if he is not ready to go  rollo beckoned as he spoke and carlos understanding his action though not his words immediately followed him in fact during all his subsequent intercourse with carlos rollo continued to talk to him just as if he could understand and carlos talked also in reply  it is true that if rollo had been asked whether he supposed that carlos understood what he said he would have answered no and yet he continually forgot to act upon this belief but talked on under the influence of a sort of instinctive feeling that good plain english such as he took care to speak could not fail to convey ideas to any boy that heard it under the influence of a similar feeling carlos talked spanish to rollo each imagining that the other understood him at least in some degree while in fact neither understood any thing but the signs and gestures which accompanied the language  just as they were about to set out one of mr georges friends called to see him and when he found that the party were going to the garden of plants he wished to go too there was scarcely room for so many in the carriage and so rollo proposed that he and carlos should go in an omnibus  there is an omnibus said he that goes there through the boulevards close by here and carlos and i will go in that and then we can find you in the garden  very well said mr george  come carlos come with me said rollo we are going to find an omnibus  carlos perceived that rollo was proposing that they should go somewhere together but he did not know where or for what nor did he care he was ready to assent to any thing so he and rollo leaving the rest of the party in the act of getting into the carriage walked along up the street which led to the boulevards     chapter viii  the garden of plants   rollo and carlos had not gone far before they came to a place where two children had set up what they called a chapel under the archway which led to the interior of the house where they lived a real chapel in catholic countries is any consecrated place large or small containing an altar and a crucifix and other sacred emblems where masses are said and other religious services are performed real chapels are made in the alcoves of churches in monuments over tombs and in other similar places and children have toy chapels to play with there are little crucifixes and candlesticks and communion cups and other similar things for sale at the toy shops sometimes the children buy these things and arrange them on a small table in a corner of the room for play just as in protestant countries they arrange a pulpit and chairs for a congregation and so make believe have a meeting sometimes the children bring out their chapel and set it near the sidewalk by the street and then hold out a little plate to ask the passers by for contributions there are almost always some people more good matured than wise who will give them a sou or two and thus they often made up quite a little purse of money  in this case as rollo and carlos were passing along the little girl who was very nicely dressed in holiday costume held out a small plate saying  one sou gentlemen if you please for the little chapel  rollo and carlos stopped to look at the chapel  what pretty little candles said rollo talking half to himself and half to carlos and how tall i wish i had some of them for jennie  i have got a chapel at home said carlos  she wants us to give her a sou continued rollo would you  and i will show it to you if you ever come to barcelona said carlos  i dont know whether to give her a sou or not said rollo would you carlos  my candlesticks are of real silver said carlos but these are not  rollo finally concluded to give the girl a sou thinking that he was in some measure bound to do it after having stopped so long to look at her chapel and then he and carlos walked on as before as they went on they continued to talk together from time to time rollo in english and carlos in spanish neither of them however paying any attention to what the other said this was a very good plan for there was a sense of companionship in this sort of conversation though it communicated no ideas they took the same kind of pleasure in it probably that birds do in the singing of their mates in fact it often happens when a group of children are talking together in a language which they all understand that each one talks for the pleasure of talking and none of them pay any attention to what the others say  presently the two boys reached the boulevard it was a very broad and magnificent street and the sidewalks were very wide the sidewalks wide as they were were thronged with foot passengers and the street itself was full of carriages very soon an omnibus came along but it was full there are a great many curious contrivances about a french omnibus one of which is that there is a sign with the word complete in french painted upon it in large letters the sign is placed directly over the door of the omnibus behind and is attached to the top of the coach by a hinge at the lower edge when the omnibus is full the conductor who rides on the step behind pulls up this sign by means of a cord attached to it and then all the people on the sidewalks can see that there is no room for them when any passengers get out so as to make room for others then the conductor lets this sign down and it lies flat upon the top of the coach out of sight until the omnibus gets full again when it is drawn up as before  complete said rollo pointing to the sign which was up and in full view that omnibus is full  yes said carlos i see him his cap is so high that he cant wear it in the omnibus and so he has to take it off  but there will be another one pretty soon said rollo  if i were a soldier said carlos i would never get into an omnibus at all i would have an elegant black horse with a long tail and i would go galloping through the streets on my horse  at length an omnibus came along which was not full and rollo and carlos got into it after meeting with various adventures on the way and changing from one omnibus to another according to the system which prevails in paris they finally reached the gates of the garden there was a sentry box on each side of the gates and soldiers with bayonets fixed guarding the entrance there were however a great many people going in the soldiers did not prevent them they had orders to allow all persons who were quiet and orderly and had no dogs with them to enter freely so rollo and carlos passed directly in  rollos first feeling was that of astonishment at the extent and variety of the scenes and prospects which opened before him instead of a small garden laid out in gravel walks and beds of flowers as he had imagined he found himself entering a perfect maze of winding walks which were bordered on all sides by an endless variety of enclosures groups of shrubbery groves huts cabins yards ponds of water and every other element of rural scenery the whole as it first burst upon rollos eye formed a most enchanting landscape and extended farther than he could see the walks meandered about in the most winding and devious ways the spaces between them were enclosed by neat little fences of lattice work and were divided into little parks or fields in each of which some strange and unknown animals were feeding there were ponds with a quantity of birds of the gayest plumage sailing upon them and green slopes with goats or deer or sheep of the most extraordinary forms and colors grazing in them at one place rollo stopped to look at a small basin of water with a broad stone margin all around it which was completely covered with turtles and tortoises of all colors and sizes the animals were lying there asleep basking in the sun a little farther on was a beautiful little yard almost surrounded with trees and shrubbery where three or four ostriches with long necks and heads higher than rollos were walking about with a very majestic air and farther still there was a little field the occupants of which excited the astonishment of the boys to a still higher degree they were three giraffes one of them with his head twenty feet in the air was cropping the leaves from the top of a tall tree the second was standing still quietly looking at the groups of visitors that were gazing upon him from without the paling while the third was amusing himself by galloping about the yard with a sort of rolling motion that it was most astonishing to see  rollo and carlos advanced among these scenes drawn from one to the other by the new objects which every where presented themselves to view and uttering to each other continual exclamations of astonishment in fact they talked incessantly to one another as they walked on pointing out each to the other whatever attracted their attention and making all sorts of comments upon what they saw  presently a low bellowing sound was heard among the trees at a little distance  hark said rollo in english putting his hand upon carloss shoulder whats that i hear a roaring  hark said carlos in spanish whats that i hear a roaring  neither of the boys understood the words which the other spoke but they knew very well that they were both listening to and talking about the roaring  lets go and see what it is said rollo  well go and see said carlos  so off they started together in the direction of the sound they walked along a short distance passing several beautiful little enclosures where quiet and gentlelooking animals of various forms were grazing in their mimic pastures or lying at rest before the doors of the thatchedroofed cabins that had been built for them instead of barns until at length they came to a place where a long range of buildings opened to view before them the fronts of which instead of showing doors and windows were formed of gratings of iron the interior of this range was divided into compartments each one of which formed an immense cage these cages were all filled with lions tigers panthers leopards hyenas and other ferocious beasts of prey some were walking to and fro restlessly in their narrow prisons others were lying down and others still were crouched in a corner of their cage where they remained motionless gazing with a sullen air upon the visitors who stood looking at them from without the grating  rollo and carlos walked back and forth in front of these cages several times looking at the animals they admired the beauty and grace of the tigers and leopards and the majestic dignity of the lions there were a lion and a lioness together in one cage the lioness was walking restlessly to and fro while the lion sat crouched in the back part of the cage with an expression upon his countenance in which the lofty pride and majesty of his character and the patience and submissiveness which pertained to his situation were combined  poor fellow said rollo if i had you and your cage in africa where you belong i would open the door and let you go  just at this moment the attention of both rollo and carlos was suddenly arrested by a most unearthly sound at a little distance from them which seemed to be intermediate between a scream and a roar it was so loud too as to be truly terrific  whats that said rollo suddenly in english  ah what a dreadful bray that is said carlos in spanish  would you go out there and see what it is said rollo  hark lets go there and see what it is said carlos  so the boys started together to go in the direction of the sound  it is impossible however for a stranger in the garden of plants to be sure of going any considerable distance in any one direction for the walks are meandering and circuitous beyond description they wind about perpetually in endless mazes and the little fields and parks and gardens that are enclosed between them are so enveloped in shrubbery and the view moreover is so intercepted with the huts and cabins built for the animals and with the palings and networks made to confine them that it is impossible to see far in any direction besides there is so much to attract the attention and to excite curiosity and wonder at every step that one is continually drawn away from one alley to another till he gets hopelessly bewildered  the huts and cabins which were made for the animals were very curious and many of them were so pretty with their rustic walls and thatched roof that rollo was extremely pleased with them he stopped before one of them which was the residence of a pair of beautiful lamas and told carlos that he meant to ask his uncle george to take particular notice how it was made and so make one for him for a playhouse when he got home  and i wonder said he where my uncle george and jennie are i dont see how we are ever to find them i did not know that this garden was so large and so full of trees and bushes  look there said carlos pointing through an opening in the shrubbery along the winding walk what are they doing there  rollo understanding the gesture though not the words turned in the direction that carlos indicated and saw that there was quite a crowd of men women and children at the place all engaged evidently in looking at something or other very intently  lets go and see said rollo  so the boys went along that way together they soon came in view of a very high and strong palisade which though it was half concealed by trees and shrubbery evidently enclosed quite a considerable area in the centre of which was a large stone building like a castle with projecting wings and towers and immense gateways opening into it on various sides this building was the residence of all the monstersthe elephants the giraffes the rhinoceros and the hippopotamus each of these species had its own separate apartment in the castle and the ground surrounding it within the great palisade was divided into as many yards as there were doors so that each kind of animal had its own proper enclosure in one of these enclosures the rhinoceros was walking about clothed in his plated and invulnerable hide and in the next there were two elephants the crowd of people were chiefly occupied in looking at the elephants the palisade was very heavy and strong being formed of timbers pointed at the top and nearly as high as the elephants could reach these palisades were however not close together they were far enough apart to allow of the elephants putting their trunks through to the people outside and also to give the people a good opportunity to look though these timbers were thus set at some distance apart from each other they wore still connected together and all held firmly in their places by two iron rails which passed through them all one near the top and the other near the bottom of the palisade all along the range they thus formed a fencing so heavy and strong that even the elephants could not break it down  the visitors could not come quite up to the elephants for outside of this great palisade at a distance of about three feet from it there was a high paling made expressly to keep the spectators back at the time when rollo and carlos came to the place the elephants were putting their trunks through to the people in order to be fed with nuts cake gingerbread and other such things which the people had ready to give them sometimes they would order the elephants to hold up their trunks and open their mouths and then the men would try to toss pieces of gingerbread in the elephants were always ready to do this when ordered though their mouths when they opened them were so small that the people very seldom succeeded in aiming the missile so that it would go in  rollo and carlos looked about among the crowd that were assembled at this place to see if mr george was among them but he was not and so after amusing themselves for some time with the elephants they walked along to see what else there was in the garden  there were a great many people in the garden besides those who seemed to have come to see the animals there were groups of children that seemed to belong in the vicinity playing in the walks some jumping ropes and others building little houses of gravel stones there were women seated on benches in various little shady nooks and corners some sewing others taking care of babies while others at little stands and stalls sold gingerbread and cakes at one place rollo stopped to look at two little children that were playing in the gravel and throwing the little pebble stones about their grandmother who was sitting near said something to them in french  what does she say asked carlos  she says replied rollo you must not throw gravel in your little sisters face  the question in this case and the answer fitted each other very well but it was a mere matter of accident for neither of the boys understood what the other had said  pretty soon the boys came to a place where a great number of people were standing on a sort of parapet and leaning upon an iron railing where they seemed to be looking down into some cavity they hurried to the place and stepping up upon the parapet they looked down too and found there a range of dens below the surface of the ground all full of bears these dens were sunken yards six or eight feet deep and enclosed with perpendicular walls all around so that the bears could not possibly get out there were iron railings around the top and a great many people were standing there looking down to the bears there were four or five of these yards all in a row and as there were many great trees overshadowing them the place was cool and pleasant some of the bears were walking about on the stone pavement which formed the bottom of the dens others were sitting on their hind legs and holding up their fore paws to catch the pieces of gingerbread which were thrown down to them by the people above there were a number of little birds hopping about there picking up the crums that were left though they took care to keep out of the way of the bears rollo and carlos bought some cakes of gingerbread of a woman who kept a stall near by and breaking them into pieces they threw them down to the bears they threw the most to a great white bear that was in one of the dens and who particularly attracted their attention rollo told carlos that he supposed this bear must have come from the north pole the boys were both by this time rather hungry but they were so much interested in seeing the bears try to catch the pieces of gingerbread that they did not think to eat any of it themselves but threw it all down to them all except one piece which rollo gave to a little girl who stood beside him to let her throw it because she had none of her own for this kindness the girl thanked rollo in french in a very polite and proper manner  after being satisfied with seeing the bears the boys wandered on wherever they saw the most to attract them until at length they came to what is called the palace of the monkeys which pleased them more than any thing they had seen this palace is an enormous round cage as high as a house and nearly a hundred feet in diameter with a range of stone buildings all around it on the back side these buildings have little rooms in them where the monkeys live in the winter and where they always sleep at night they go out into the cage to play the cage is formed of slender iron posts and railing so that the people standing outside can see the monkeys at their sports and gambols they play with each other in every possible way and frolic just as if they were in their native woods they climb up the smooth iron posts pursuing one another and then leaping across through the air they catch upon a rope from which they swing themselves across to the branch of a tree some of these branches have bells attached to them and the monkey when he gets upon such a one will spring it up and down till he sets the bell to ringing and then assisted by the return of the branch he bounds away through the air to some rope or pole or railing that he sees within his reach the agility which these animals display in these feats is truly astonishing  rollo and carlos watched their evolutions with great interest there was an excellent place to see for the land opposite the cage ascended in such a manner that those more remote could look over the heads of those that were nearer besides this there were quite a number of chairs under the trees at the upper part of this ascent and rollo perceiving that several of them were vacant sat down in one and made a sign to carlos to sit down in another they could now look at the monkeys and rest at the same time presently a woman came along and said to rollo in french  please pay the chairs sir  rollo recollected immediately that at all such places in paris chairs were kept to be let those who used them paying two sous apiece for the privilege so he took out four sous and gave the woman  i did not think of there being any thing to pay for these chairs said he to carlos but then i dont care it is worth four sous to get a good rest as tired as i am im pretty hungry too i wish i had not given all my gingerbread to the bears  carlos made no reply to this suggestion though there is no doubt that he would have readily assented to what rollo said if he had understood it the boys remained some time looking at the monkeys and then strolled away into other parts of the garden very soon they came to a place where rollo spied at some distance before him under some immense old trees in a sort of a valley what he thought was a restaurant  see these monstrous big trees said carlos and there are tables under them  the boys made all haste to the spot and found to their great joy that it was a restaurant there was a plain but very picturesquelooking house antique and venerable and before it on a green under the spreading branches of some enormous old trees a number of small tables with seats around them  now carlos said rollo we will have some bread and butter and a good cup of coffee  illustration the restaurant  so they sat down at one of the pleasantest tables and very soon a waiter came to see what they would have rollo called for coffee and bread and butter for two in a short time the waiter came bringing two great cups which he filled half with coffee and half with boiled milk he brought also a supply of very nice butter and a loaf of bread shaped like a stick of wood it was about as large round as rollos arm and twice as long the waiter laid this bread across the table for rollo and carlos to cut off as much from it as they might want this is what they call having bread at discretion  the boys enjoyed this banquet very much indeed besides the coffee they had water which they sweetened in the tumblers with large lumps of white sugar they talked all the time while they were eating each in his own language and laughed very merrily after all said rollo this is the very best place in the whole garden feeding the bears is very good fun but this is infinitely better  after remaining for half an hour at the table and eating till their appetites were completely satisfied they concluded to go back and see the monkeys again  in the mean time mr george and his friend with jennie had been engaged in an entirely different part of the garden for the whole enclosure is so large that it takes many days to see the whole on one side bordering on a street there is a long row of houses and gardens occupied by professors who give courses of lectures on the plants and animals which the garden contains on another is a magnificent range of buildings occupied as a museum containing endless collections of dried plants of minerals and shells of skeletons and the stuffed skins of birds and beasts then there is a very large tract of level land between two splendid avenues all laid out in beds of plants and flowers forming a series of parterres extending as far as the eye can reach and presenting the gayest and most beautiful combination of colors that can be conceived jennie was very much delighted with all these things as she walked about in these parts of the garden with her uncle though she was somewhat uneasy all the time because she could not see any thing of rollo  i dont believe said she at last to her uncle as they were standing on the margin of a beautiful little artificial pond full of lilies and other aquatic plants i dont believe that we can find him at all in such a large garden  yes said mr george therell be no difficulty there is one universal rule for finding boys in the garden of plants  what is that asked jennie  go to the places where they keep the monkeys and the elephants said mr george and if you dont find them there at once wait a few minutes and theyll be pretty sure to come  it was as mr george had predicted for on going to the palace of the monkeys there they found rollo and carlos laughing very heartily to see a big monkey holding a little one in its arms as a human mother would a baby  the party when thus united went together once more over the principal places where the two divisions of it had gone separately before so that all might have a general idea of the whole domain and then going out at a different gate from the one by which they had entered they went home all resolving to come again if possible at some future day     chapter ix  an excursion   one day about one oclock after rollo had been in paris about a fortnight he came into the hotel from a walk which he had been taking and there found his mother and jennie putting on their bonnets he asked them where they were going they said they were going to take a ride with mr george  may i go too asked rollo  whyyes said his mother hesitatingly i suppose there will be room or you may stay at home here with your father he is asleep in his room  it is generally the case with children both boys and girls when they are young that if they can get any sort of consent however reluctant from their parents to any of their requests they are satisfied and take the boon thus hesitatingly accorded to them as readily as if it had been granted to them in the freest and most cordial manner with gentlemen and ladies however it is different they generally have more delicacy and are seldom willing to accept of any favor unless circumstances are such that it can be granted in a very free and cordial manner they will scarcely ever in any case ask to be permitted to join any party that others have formed and when they do ask if they perceive the slightest doubt or hesitation on the part of their friends in acceding to their proposal they infer that it would be for some reason or other inconvenient for them to go and they accordingly at once give up all intention of going  rollo though still a boy was beginning to have some of the honorable sentiments and feelings of a man and when he perceived that his mother hesitated a little about granting his request he decided immediately not to go and ride besides he liked the idea of staying with his father  well said he i will stay here my father may wish for something when he wakes up  i dont suppose however after all added his mother that it is really necessary for you to stay on his account his bell is within reach and alfred will come immediately when he rings  but i should like to stay said rollo and besides i can get ahead one more day in my french  rollo was writing a course of french exercises and his task was one lesson for every day the rule was that he was to write this exercise immediately after breakfast unless he had written it before that is either on the same day before breakfast or on a previous day now rollo desired to be free after breakfast for that was a very pleasant time to go out besides there were often plans and excursions formed for that time which he was invited to join and he could not join them unless his lesson for the day had been written so he took pains to write his exercises as much as possible in advance whenever there came a rainy day he would write two or three lessons and sometimes he would write early in the morning he was now nearly a week in advance instead of being satisfied with this however he began to be quite interested in seeing how far ahead he could get this feeling was what led him to think that he would take this opportunity to write a french lesson  accordingly when his mother and jennie had gone he seated himself at his table and began his work the writing of the exercise took about an hour when the work was finished and while rollo was preparing to put his books away he heard a movement in his fathers room he got up from his seat and opened the door gently saying  father are you awake  yes said his father are you there rollo  rollo found his father sitting up in a great arm chair by the side of his bed he had a dressing gown on  how do you feel father said rollo  i think i feel better said mr holiday as he said this he put on his slippers and then stood up upon the rug that lay in front of his bed  yes said he i certainly feel bettera great deal better  i am very glad said rollo  where is your mother asked mr holiday as he walked across the room to the glass  she has gone out to take a ride said rollo with uncle george and jennie  thats right said mr holiday i am very glad that she has gone and have you been staying here to take care of me he asked  yes sir said rollo i have been writing another french lesson i have got them all written now to next friday  ah said mr holiday thats excellent thats what the farmers call being forehanded  now rollo said mr holiday after a little pause i feel so much better that i should like to go somewhere and take a ride myself i dont care much where if there is any where that you wish to go i will go with you come i will put myself entirely at your disposal let us see what you can do to give me a ride and entertain me  rollo was very much pleased indeed with this proposal he decided instantly what he would do he had seen that morning an affix as the french call it that is a placard posted on a wall among a hundred others setting forth that there was to be a balloon ascension that afternoon at the hippodrome at three oclock to be followed by various equestrian performances rollo immediately mentioned this to his father and asked him if he should be willing to go there his father said that he should adding that he would like to see the balloon go up very much  then when we come home said rollo you must ride slowly along through the elysian fields and let me see the booths and the games that they are playing there  very well said his father i will take some newspapers with me and i will sit still in the carriage while you go and see the booths and the games  this plan being thus resolved upon and all arranged alfred was summoned and ordered to get the carriage ready and to put the top down when alfred reported that the carriage was at the door mr holiday and rollo went down and got in and were soon in the midst of the stream of equipages that were going up the grand avenue of the elysian fields they arrived at the hippodrome in time to get an excellent seat and they remained there two hours they saw the balloon with a man and young girl in the car below it rise majestically into the air and soar away until it was out of sight the fearless aeronauts seemed entirely at their ease while they were ascending to the dizzy height they sat in the car waving banners and throwing down bouquets of flowers as long as they could be seen  after this there was a series of performances with horses which delighted rollo very much troops of men came out upon the arena mounted on beautiful chargers and armed with lances and coats of mail as in ancient times after riding their elegantly caparisoned horses round and round the ring several times they formed into squadrons and attacked each other with their lances in sham battles after this fences of hurdles were put up across the course in various places and girls mounted on beautiful white horses and elegantly dressed rode around leaping over the fences in a surprising manner these and similar performances continued until near five oclock and then the immense assembly broke up and the people some in carriages and some on foot moved away over the various roads and avenues which diverge from the star  rollo and his father got into their carriage which had been waiting for them all this time and passing the triumphal arch they entered the grand avenue of the elysian fields on their return to the city  they descended the slope which led down to the round point at a rapid rate here after passing the round point the road became level and the region of groves and booths and of games and frolicking began  now said rollo i should like to drive slowly so that if i come to any thing that i wish to get out and see i can see it  very well said his father give alfred your orders  alfred said rollo draw up as near as you can to the sidewalk on the right hand and walk the horses so that i can see what there is  and in the mean time said mr holiday i will read my papers  so mr holiday took his newspapers out of his pocket and began to read them while rollo standing up in the carriage began to survey the crowd that filled the walks and groves that bordered the avenue in order to select some object of attraction to be examined more closely  only i wish father said rollo that i had somebody here with me to go and see the thingsjennie or carlos i wish carlos was here  it is very easy to go and get him said his father with his eyes still on his newspaper  may i said rollo  any thing you please said mr holiday you are in command this afternoon you may give alfred any orders you please  then alfred said rollo drive to the hotel louvois as fast as you can  as he said this mr holiday folded up his paper and rollo took his seat while alfred turning the horses away from the sidewalk set them to trotting briskly along the avenue  only father said rollo i shall prevent your reading your papers  no matter for that said mr holiday i shall like a good brisk ride along the boulevards quite as well  the horses kept always by alfred in the very best condition trotted forward at a rapid rate leaving scores of omnibuses cabs and citadines behind and keeping pace with the splendid chariots of the french and english aristocracy that thronged the avenue presently rollo observed a peculiar movement among the carriages before them as if they were making way for something that was coming and at the same time he saw hundreds of people running forward from the groves and booths across the side avenues to the margin of the carriage way  the emperor said alfred drawing in his horses at the same time  an instant afterward rollo who on hearing alfreds words started from his seat and stood up in the carriage to look saw two elegantly dressed officers in splendid uniforms galloping along toward them in the middle of the avenue they were followed at a little distance by two others and then came a very beautiful barouche drawn by four glossy black horses magnificently caparisoned two gentlemen were seated in this carriage one of whom bowed repeatedly to the crowd that were gazing at the spectacle from the sides of the avenue as he rode rapidly along behind this carriage came another with a gentleman and a lady in it and afterward two more troopers the whole cavalcade moved on so rapidly that before rollo had had scarcely time to look at it it had passed entirely by  the emperor said alfred to rollo he is going out to take a ride  is that the emperor exclaimed rollo he looks like any common man but if i had four such beautiful black horses as he has got i should be glad i would drive them myself instead of having a coachman  the movement and the sensation produced by the passing of the emperor and his train along the avenue immediately subsided and the other carriages resumed their ordinary course alfreds horses trotted on faster than ever a thousand picturesque and striking objects glided rapidly bythe trees and the booths of the elysian fields the tall gilded lampposts and the spouting fountains of the place de la concorde omnibuses cabs wagons chariots and foot passengers without number and finally the tall column of the place vendome winding round in a graceful curve through this magnificent square the carriage rolled on in the direction of the boulevards and after going rapidly on for nearly half a mile in that spacious avenue it turned into the street which led to the hotel it stopped at length before the door and rollo got out while mr holiday remained in the carriage rollo went up stairs and after about five minutes he came down again bringing not only carlos with him but also his uncle george mr holiday invited mr george to go with them for the remainder of the ride this invitation mr george accepted and so the two gentlemen taking the back seat and rollo and carlos the front alfred took them all back to the elysian fields together  they remained nearly an hour in the elysian fields during this time rollos father and his uncle george staid in the carriage by the roadside talking together while rollo and carlos went in among the walks and groves to see the various spectacles which were exhibited there they would come back from time to time to the carriage in order that rollo might describe to his father what they found or ask permission to take part in some amusement for instance at one time he came and said very eagerly  father here is a great whirling machine with ships and horses going round and round carlos and i want to ride on it the horses are in pairs two together carlos can get on one of them in one of the pairs and i on the other we can go round twenty times for two sous  very well said his father  so rollo and carlos went back to the whirling machine it was very large and was very gayly painted and ornamented with flags and banners the vessels and the horses were attached to the ends of long arms which were supported by iron rods that came down from the top of the central post so that they were very strong the horses were as large as small ponies and the vessels were as big as little boatseach one having seats for four children when rollo and carlos went back the machine had just taken up its complement of passengers for one turn and was then commencing its rotation there were a great many persons standing by it pleased to see how happy the children were in going round so merrily there was an iron paling all around the machine to keep the spectators at a safe distance otherwise they might come too near and so be struck and perhaps seriously hurt by the horses or the boats when they were put in motion  as soon as the twenty turns had been taken the machine stopped and the children who had had their ride were taken off the horses and out of the boats all except a few who were going to pay again and have a second ride rollo and carlos then went inside the enclosure and going up some steps placed there for the purpose they mounted their horses very soon the machine began to revolve and they were whirled round and round twenty times with the greatest rapidity the arms of the machine too were long so that the circle which the horses and the vessels described was quite large and the whole twenty revolutions made quite a considerable ride  after finishing their circuit and dismounting from their horses the boys next came to a whirling machine which revolved vertically instead of horizontally that is instead of whirling the rider round and round near the level of the ground it carried them up over and down there was a great wheel which revolved on an axis like a vertical mill wheel this wheel was double and between the two circumferences the seats of the passengers were hung in such a manner that in revolving they swung freely so as to keep the heads of the people always uppermost these seats had high backs and sides and a sort of bar in front for the people to take hold of otherwise there would have been great danger of their falling out as it was they were carried so swiftly and so high and the seats swung to and fro so violently when the machine was in rapid motion that the men and girls who were in the seats filled the ear with their screams and shouts of laughter  rollo and carlos after seeing this machine revolve went to the carriage to ask if they might go in it the next time  no said mr holiday i am not sure that it is safe  so the boys went away from the carriage back under the trees again and walked along to see what the next exhibition might be the carriage moved on in the avenue a little way to keep up with them  the boys strolled along through the crowd a little while longer looking for a moment as they passed now at the stalls for selling gingerbread and cakes now at a display of pictures on a long linethe sheets being fastened to the line by pins like clothes upon a clothes linenow at a company of singers singing upon a stage under a canopy and now again at a little boy about seven or eight years old who was tumbling head over heels on a little carpet which he had spread on the ground and then carrying round his cap to the bystanders in hopes that some of them would give him a sou at length their attention was attracted by some large boys who were engaged at a stand at a little distance in shooting at a mark with what seemed to be small guns these guns however discharged themselves by means of a spring coiled up within the barrel instead of gunpowder and the bullets which they shot were peas rollo had seen these shootingplaces before when he went through the fields on the first sunday after he came so he did not stop long here but called carloss attention to something that he had never seen before which was going on at a place a little under a tree a little farther along a large boy seemed to be pitching quoits there were a number of persons around him looking on there was a sort of box placed near the tree the bottom of which was about two feet square it had a back next the tree and two sides but it had no front or top in fact it was almost precisely like a wheelbarrow without any wheel legs or handles  illustration singing in the open air  the bottom or floor of this box had a great many round and flat plates of brass upon it about four inches in diameter and about four inches apart from each other the player had ten other plates in his hand of the same size with those which were upon the bottom of the plate he took these one by one and standing back at a certain distance perhaps about as far as one good long pace pitched them as boys do quoits in upon the floor of the box what he tried to do was to cover up one of the disks in the box so that no part of it could be seen if he did so he was to have a prize and he paid two sous for the privilege of playing the prizes consisted of little articles of porcelain bronzes cheap jewelry images and other similar things which were all placed conspicuously on shelves against the tree above the box in view of the player  it seemed to the bystanders as if it would be not at all difficult to toss the disks so as with ten to cover one but those who tried seemed to find it very difficult to accomplish the object even if the disks which they tossed fell in the right place they would rebound or slide away and sometimes knock away those which were already well placed still after trying once the players wore usually unwilling to give up without trying a second and even a third and fourth time so that they generally lost six or eight sous before they were willing to stop especially as the man himself would now and then play the disks and he having made himself skilful by great practice found no difficulty in piling up his ten disks wherever he wished them to go  i could do it i verily believe said rollo i should like to try i mean to go and ask my father if i may  so rollo went to the carriage to state the case to his father and ask his permission to see if he could not pitch the disks so as to cover one of the plates on the board his father hesitated  so far as trying the experiment is concerned said mr holiday as a matter of dexterity and skill there is no harm but so far as the hope of getting a prize by it is concerned it is of the nature of gaming  i should think it was more of the nature of a reward for merit and excellence said mr george  no said mr holiday for in one or two trials made by chance passengers coming along to such a place the result must depend much more on chance than on adroitness or skill  i will tell you what you may do rollo continued mr holiday you may pay the man the two sous and try the experiment provided you determine beforehand not to take any prize if you succeed then you will pay your money simply for the use of his apparatus to amuse yourself with a gymnastic performance and not stake it in hope of a prize  well said rollo that is all i want and off he ran  it seems to me that that is a very nice distinction that you made said mr george as soon as rollo had gone and that those two things are very near the line  yes replied mr holiday it is a nice distinction but it is a very true one the two things are very near the line but then one of them is clearly on one side and the other on the other for a boy to pay for the use of such an apparatus for the purpose of trying his eye and his hand is clearly right but to stake his money in hopes of winning a prize is wrong for it is gaming it is gaming it is true in this case on an exceedingly small scale still it is gaming and so is the beginning of a road which has a very dreadful end is not it so  yes said mr george i think it is  as might have been expected rollo did not succeed in covering one of the disks the disks that he threw spread all over the board the money that he paid was however well spent for he had much more than two sous worth of satisfaction in making the experiment  rollo found a great many other things to interest him in the various stalls and stands that he visited but at length he got tired of them all and coming back to the carriage told his father that he was ready to go home  very well said his father i dont know but that your uncle george and i are ready too though we have not quite got through with our papers but we can finish them at home  so rollo and carlos got into the carriage and all the party went home to dinner     chapter x  rollos narrative   one evening when rollo had been making a long excursion during the day with his uncle george and had dined with him at the close of it at a restaurants in the boulevards he went home about eight oclock to the hotel to see his father and mother and jennie and tell them where he had been he found his mother in her room putting on her bonnet she said she was going to take a ride along the boulevards with a gentleman and lady who were going to call for her  and where is father said rollo  he has gone to bed and is asleep by this time you must be careful not to disturb him  and jennie asked rollo  she has gone to bed too said his mother but she is not asleep and i presume she will be very glad to see you you can go in her room  well i will said rollo but mother i should like to go and ride with you will there be room for me  yes said his mother there will be room i suppose in the carriage but it would not be proper for me to take you for i am going on an invitation from others the invitation was to me alone and i have no right to extend it to any body else  but this you can do if you please continued his mother you can take our carriage and let alfred drive you and so follow along after our party only in that case you would not have any company you would be in a carriage alone  never mind that said rollo i should like that i would put the top back and then i could see all around i should have a grand ride ill go i wish jennie had not gone to bed she could have gone with me  no replied his mother jennie is not well tonight she has got cold and she went to bed early on that account but she will be very glad to have you go and see her  so rollo went into jennies room as soon as he opened the door jennie pushed aside the curtains and said  ah rollo is that you i am very glad that you have come  i cant stay but a little while said rollo i am going to take a ride with mother  are you going with mother asked jennie  not in the carriage with her replied rollo but i am going in the same party i am going to have a carriage all to myself  o no rollo said jennie in a beseeching tone dont go away stay here with me please i am all alone and have not any body to amuse me  but you will go to sleep pretty soon said rollo  no replied jennie i am not sleepy the least in the world see  here jennie opened her eyes very wide and looked rollo full in the face by way of demonstrating that she was not sleepy  rollo felt very much perplexed when he pictured to himself in imagination the idea of being whirled rapidly through the boulevards on such a pleasant summer evening in a carriage which he should have all to himself with the top down so that he could see every thing all around him and of the brilliant windows of the shops the multitudes of ladies and gentlemen taking their coffee at the little round tables on the sidewalk in front of the coffee saloons the crowds of people coming and going and the horsemen and carriages thronging the streets the view was so enchanting that it was very hard for him to give up the promised pleasure he however determined to do it so he said  well jennie ill stay i will go out and tell mother that i am not going to ride and then i will come back  for the first half hour after mrs holiday went away rollo was occupied with jennie in looking over some very pretty french picture books which mrs holiday had bought for her that day to amuse her because she was sick jennie had looked them all over before but now that rollo had come it gave her pleasure to look them over again and talk about them with him jennie sat up in the bed leaning back against the pillows and bolsters and rollo sat in a large and very comfortable arm chair which he had brought up for this purpose to the bedside the books lay on a monstrous square pillow of down half as large as the bed itself which according to the french fashion is always placed on the top of the bed rollo and jennie would take the books one at a time and look them over talking about the pictures and showing the prettiest ones to each other thus the time passed very pleasantly at length however jennie having looked over all the books drew herself down into the bed and began to ask rollo where he had been that day  i have been with uncle george said rollo he said that he was going about to see a great many different places and that i might go with him if i chose though he supposed that most of them were places that i should not care to see but i did i liked to see them all  what places did you go to asked jennie  why first we went to see the workshops i did not know before that there were so many uncle george says that paris is one of the greatest manufacturing places in the world only they make things by hand in private shops and not in great manufactories by machinery uncle george says there must be as much as eight or ten square miles of these shops in paris they are piled up to six or eight stories high some of the streets look like ranges of chalky cliffs facing each other such as we see at some places on the sea shore  what do they make in the shops asked jennie  o all sorts of curious and beautiful things they have specimens of the things that they make up put up like pictures in a frame in little glass cases on the wall next the street we walked along through several streets and looked at these specimens there were purses and fringes and watches and gold and silver chains and beautiful portemonnaies and clocks and jewelry of all kinds and ribbons and opera glasses and dressing cases and every thing you can think of  yes said jennie i have seen all such things in the shop windows in the palais royal and in the boulevards  ah those are the shops where they sell the things said rollo but these shops that uncle george and i went to see are where they make them we went to one place where they were making artificial flowers and such beautiful things you never saw the rooms were full of girls all making artificial flowers  why did not you bring me home some of them asked jennie  whyi dont know replied rollo i did not think to ask if i could buy any of them  then after we had gone about in the workshops till we had seen enough we went to the louvre to see the paintings though on the way we stopped to see a cr√®che  rollo pronounced the word very much as if it had been spelled crash  a crash exclaimed jennie did a building tumble down  o no said rollo it was not that it was a place where they keep a great many babies the poor women who have to go out to work all day carry their babies to this place in the morning and leave them there to be taken care of and then come and get them at night there are some nuns there dressed all in white to take care of the babies they put them in high cradles that stand all around the room  were they all crying asked jennie  o no said rollo they were all still when we went in they were all just waking up the nuns put them to sleep all at the same time every cradle had a baby in it some were stretching their arms and some were opening their eyes and some were trying to get up as fast as they got wide awake the nuns would take them up and put them on the floor at a place where there was a carpet for them to creep upon and play  i wish i could go and see them said jennie  you can replied rollo any body can go and see them the nuns like to have people come they keep every thing very white and nice the cradles were very pretty  did they rock asked jennie  no replied rollo they were made to swing and not to rock they were up so high from the floor that they could not be made to rock very well we stayed some time in this place and then we went away  and where did you go next asked jennie  we went to the louvre to see the famous gallery of paintings it is a quarter of a mile long and the walls are covered with paintings on both sides the whole distance  except where the windows are i suppose said jennie  no replied rollo there are no interruptions for windows the windows are up high in the ceiling for the room is very lofty there is room for two or three rows of paintings below the windows it is a splendid long room  were the pictures very pretty asked jennie  not very said rollo at least i did not think so but uncle george told me it was a very famous gallery there were a great many other rooms besides all carved and gilded most magnificently and an immense staircase of marble wide enough for an army to go up and down there were several large rooms too full of ancient marble statues but i did not like them very much they looked very dark and dingy the paintings were prettier than they  there were a great many persons in the painting gallery at work copying the paintings continued rollo some were girls and some were young men there was one boy there not much bigger than i  i dont see how so small a boy could learn to paint so well said jennie  why he was not so very small said rollo he was bigger than i am and i am growing to be pretty large besides they have excellent schools here where they learn to draw and to paint we went to see one of them  did it look like one of our schools asked jennie  o no replied rollo it seemed to me more like a splendid palace than a school we went through an iron gate into a court and across the court to a great door where a man came to show us the rooms there were a great many elegant staircases and passage ways and halls with pictures and statues and models of cities and temples and ruins and every thing else necessary for the students  were the students there asked jennie  no replied rollo but we saw the room where they worked and we saw the last lesson that they had  what was it asked jennie  it was a subject which the professor gave them for a picture and all of them were to paint a picture on that subject each one according to his own ideas we saw the paintings that they had made there were twenty or thirty of them the subject was written on a sheet of paper and put up in the room where they could all see it  what was the subject asked jennie  it was something like this replied rollo an old chestnut tree in a secluded situation the roots partly denuded by an inundation from a stream cattle in the foreground on the right time sunset  and did all the pictures have an old chestnut tree in them asked jennie  yes said rollo and the roots were all out of the ground on one side and there were cows in the foreground of them all but the forms of the trees and the position of the cattle and the landscape in the back ground were different in every one  i should like to see them said jennie  then said rollo when we came away from this place we walked along on the quay by the side of the river looking over the parapet down to the bank below  was it a pretty place asked jennie  yes said rollo a very pretty place indeed there were great floating houses in the water for the baths with wheels turning in the current to pump up water and little flower gardens along the brink of the stream at least in some places there were flower gardens and in others there was a wall along the water with boys sitting on the edge of it fishing presently we came to a place where there was an opening in the parapet and stairs to go down to the water you go down two or three steps first and then the stairs turn each way at the turning there was a man who had fishing poles and nets and fishing lines to sell or let he had some to let for three sous an hour i proposed to uncle george that we should hire two of them and go down and fish a little while  and what did he say asked jennie  he laughed and said that for him to spend his time while he was in paris in fishing in the seine would be perfectly preposterous he said that his time in europe cost him not less than a dollar for every hour  a dollar for every hour exclaimed jennie  yes replied rollo he says that his two passages across the atlantic will have cost three hundred dollars and the other expenses of his tour as much as five hundred more which makes eight hundred dollars and that he will not have more than one hundred days probably from the time of his landing in england to the time of his sailing again that makes it about eight dollars a day now there are not more than eight hours in a day suitable for going about and seeing what is to be seen so that his time in the middle of the day costs him a dollar an hour and he could not afford he said to spend it in fishing  however continued rollo he said that i might look at the mans fishing apparatus and if i found that it was different from that which the boys used in america i might buy some of it to carry home  and did you asked jennie  yes replied rollo and so saying he put his hand in his pocket and took out a small parcel put up in a piece of french newspaper he unrolled this parcel and showed jennie what it contained jennie sat up in bed very eagerly in order to see it first there came out a small net  this net you see said rollo is to be put upon a hoop or a ring of wire when i get to america i did not buy a hoop because it would fill up my trunk too much but i can make one when i get home  then here are the fishing lines continued rollo i bought two of them they were very cheap  the fishing lines were very pretty each had a small round cork upon the end of a quill the corks were red touched with blue there was a sinker for each made of large shot  the man put in several spare sinkers for me resumed rollo in case these should come off so saying he opened a small paper and showed jennie several largesized shot each of which had a cleft in the side of it for putting in the line the intention was that the lead should be closed over the line after the line had been inserted in it by means of a light blow with a hammer and thus the sinker would be secured to its place  i like a net best to catch fishes with said jennie because that does not hurt them  true said rollo a net is a great deal better on that account you see i put a hoop around to keep the mouth of the net open and then fasten it to the end of a long handle then you stand on the bank of the brook and put the net down into the water and when a fish comes along you dip him up  yes said jennie that is an excellent way  then you could put him in a small pail of water said rollo and carry him home and then you could put him in a bowl and see him swim about  yes said jennie i wish you would give me this net  well said rollo i will i shall go down by the river again some day and then i can buy another for myself  so you can said jennie or if you dont get another i can lend you mine when you wish to fish with it  so rollo put up his fishing tackle again and then jennie asked him where else he went  why we walked along the quay said rollo a long way past several bridges until at last we came to a bridge leading over to an island in the river where there was a great cathedral church which uncle george said he wished to see it was the church of notre dame it was an immense great church with two towers very high but it was very old the outside of it seemed to be all crumbling to pieces  did you go in asked jennie  yes replied rollo it is open all the time and people are all the time going and coming we went in there was an old woman sitting just inside the door with a string of beads in her hands counting them there were two or three other old women there knitting i could not see much of the inside of the church when we first went in there were so many columns but i could hear the birds flying about and singing away up high among the vaults and arches  the birds inside the church said jennie i should think they would drive them out  i dont know how they could drive them out said rollo it was so high up to where they were flying the arch of the ceiling seemed like a stone sky there were so many pillars to keep up this roof that when we first went in we could not see any end to the church at all however we walked along and after a while we came to the end  there were a great many curious things to see in the church continued rollo there were a great many little chapels along the sides of it and curious images sculptured in stone and people doing curious things all about in different places we walked about there for half an hour at last we found a congregation  a congregation  yes said rollo we came to a place at last which was divided off by a kind of railing and there was a congregation there sitting in chairs some were kneeling in chairs and some were kneeling on the stone floor they were reading in little prayer books and looking about  was any body preaching to them asked jennie  no said rollo but there were some priests at the altar doing something there but i could not understand what they were doing we stopped there a little while and then we came away we walked along to another part of the church and at length we came to another enclosure where a great many people were collected mr george went up to see what it was and he said he believed it was a baptism but i could not get near enough to see  and what did you do next asked jennie  why we came out of the church and crossed over by a bridge to this side of the river and then walked down along the quay till we came to a place where there was a tall bronze column somewhat like this column in the place vendome uncle george said that he wished to see it because it stood on the place where a famous old castle and prison used to stand in former times called the bastile he said that the people made an insurrection and battered the old prison down because the government was so cruel in shutting up innocent prisoners in it they built fires against the doors and battered against them with heavy timbers until they broke them in and then they let the prisoners out and set the prison on fire uncle george said that i should take great interest in reading about it one of these days but i think i should like to read about it now  i should too said jennie  they afterward took away all the stones of the bastile continued rollo and made this tall bronze column in its place there is a figure of a man on it standing on tiptoe  i should think he would blow down in a high wind said jennie  i dont know why he does not i am sure rejoined rollo i wanted to go up to the top of the column and see how he was fastened there but uncle george said he was too tired so we came away in fact i was very willing to come away for i saw a great crowd at a certain broad place on the sidewalk not far from there and i wished to go and see what it was  and did you go asked jennie  yes replied rollo and i found it was a man who had made a great ring of people all about him and was trying to get them to give fifteen sous to see him shut himself up in a small box the box was on the pavement all ready it was quite small it did not seem possible that a man could be shut up in it  how big was it asked jennie  o i dont know exactly said rollo it was quite small  was it no bigger than that said jennie holding her two hands a few inches apart so as to indicate what she would consider quite a small box  o yes said rollo it was a great deal bigger than that it was only a little smaller than you would think a man could get into the box was square and was made of tin but painted black  illustration performance on the boulevards  there was an organ at one end of the ring with a man playing upon it to draw the crowd together in front of the organ was a woman with a baby in her arms and another little child playing about her the man said that this was his family and that he had to support them by his experiments in front of the woman was the box in front of the box was the man who stood there generally telling what he was going to do and calling upon the people to throw in their sous in front of the man was a carpet on the pavement and in the middle of the carpet a tin plate from time to time the people would throw sous over into the circle the man would then pick them up and put them into the plate and tell the people how many there lacked there must be fifteen he said or he could not perform the experiment he kept talking all the time to the people and saying funny things to make them laugh  at last all the fifteen sous were in and then the man went to the box he brought out a soldier who was standing among the people and placed him near the box so that he might shut the cover down when the man was in the man then stepped into the box the upper edge of it was not higher than his knees he then began to kneel down in the box crossing his legs under him and then he crouched his body down into it and curled in his head and then  jennie said rollo interrupting himself he observed that jennie was very still and he was not sure that she was listening  jennie did not answer she was fast asleep  shes gone to sleep said rollo without hearing the end of the story however the soldier put the lid down and shut the man entirely in  rollo thought that as he was so near the end he might as well finish the story even if his auditor was asleep     chapter xi  conclusion   rollos adventures in paris were brought at length for the time being to a somewhat abrupt termination by an invitation which he received suddenly at breakfast one morning from his uncle george to set off with him the next day for switzerland rollo was very eager to accept this invitation from the moment that it was offered him it is true that he was not at all tired of paris and there were a great many places both in the city and in the environs that he was still desirous to see  rollo had only one days notice of the proposed journey to switzerland and that day was spent almost entirely in getting the passports ready this business devolved on rollo himself as his uncle was engaged in some other way that day and he proposed therefore that rollo should undertake the work of getting the passports stamped rollo accordingly did so he took a carriage and went round to the various offices and attended to the business very well though he encountered some difficulties in doing it his uncle george was very much pleased when he came home that night and found that rollo had got the passports all ready carlos went with rollo to the passport offices for company though he could not of course render him any assistancef  f a full account of rollos adventures in getting the passports stamped will be given in the first chapter of rollo in switzerland  rollo dined that evening with his uncle george and carlos at a restaurant there are hundreds of these restaurants scattered all over the city of paris and many of them are furnished and decorated in a style of splendor that is magnificent beyond description mr george took rollo and carlos to one of the finest of them it was in the boulevards  the aspect of the room when rollo entered it was very imposing it was lined on all sides with mirrors with carved and gilded pilasters between them and a richly ornamented cornice above the ceiling overhead was panelled and was painted in fresco with the most graceful and elegant devices the floor was laid in a beautiful mosaic of wood brilliantly polished the room was filled with tables all set out for dinner in the nicest manner with silver plate elegant porcelain and glasses that reflected the light in the most resplendent manner a great many gay groups of ladies and gentlemen were seated at these tables taking dinner while the waiters with snowwhite napkins on their arms were walking about in a rapid but in a very gentle and noiseless manner to wait upon them at the back side of the room there sat two beautiful young women behind a sort of counter which was raised a little above the rest of the floor so that they could survey the whole scene it was the duty of these young women to keep the accounts of what was ordered at the several tables and to receive the money which was paid by the guests the waiters carrying it to them from the different parties at the tables when they paid these ladies were the presiding officers as it were in the saloon and the guests all bowed to them very respectfully both when they came in and when they went away  mr george selected a table for himself and the two boys and they had an excellent dinner there there was a printed book large though thin on every table giving a list of the different articlesmore than five hundred in all from these mr george and the boys selected what they liked and the waiters brought it to them  the party remained at this restaurant eating their dinner and taking their coffee after it for more than an hour and then they went away  that evening rollo went into his fathers room to bid his father good by for he expected to set off for switzerland the next morning very early he found his father sitting in an arm chair by a window reading a book mr holiday laid his book down and talked for some time with rollo about his proposed tour in switzerland and gave him a great deal of preparatory information about the mountains the glaciers the torrents the avalanches and other wonderful things that rollo expected to see rollo was very much interested in these accounts  i am very glad that uncle george invited me to go with him said he  so am i said his father  because added rollo i expect to have a very pleasant time  true replied his father but that is not the reason precisely why i am glad that he invited you  what is your reason then asked rollo  i am glad replied mr holiday because his asking you to go with him into switzerland is a sign that you have been a good boy while under his care here in france boys that are selfish troublesome and disobedient in one ride or journey find usually that their company is not desired a second time it is now two or three weeks since your uncle george invited you to come with him from london to paris and during all this time you have been mainly under his care and now he invites you to go with him on a still more extended tour i think you must have conducted yourself in a very considerate or gentlemanly manner and proved yourself a pleasant travelling companion or you would not have received this new invitation  rollo was very much gratified at hearing his father speak in this manner so he shook hands with him and bade him good by
