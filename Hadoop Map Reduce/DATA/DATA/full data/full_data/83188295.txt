from the via ostiensis by the porta san paolo the first object that meets the eye is a marble pyramid which stands close at hand on the left  there are many egyptian obelisks in rome—tall snakelike spires of red sandstone mottled with strange writings which remind us of the pillars of flame which led the children of israel through the desert away from the land of the pharaohs but more wonderful than these to look upon is this gaunt wedgeshaped pyramid standing here in this italian city unshattered amid the ruins and wrecks of time looking older than the eternal city itself like terrible impassiveness turned to stone  and so in the middle ages men supposed this to be the sepulchre of remus who was slain by his own brother at the founding of the city so ancient and mysterious it appears but we have now perhaps unfortunately more accurate information about it and know that it is the tomb of one caius cestius a roman gentleman of small note who died about 30 bc  yet though we cannot care much for the dead man who lies in lonely state beneath it and who is only known to the world through his sepulchre still this pyramid will be ever dear to the eyes of all englishspeaking people because at evening its shadows fall on the tomb of one who walks with spenser and shakespeare and byron and shelley and elizabeth barrett browning in the great procession of the sweet singers of england  for at its foot there is a green sunny slope known as the old protestant cemetery and on this a commonlooking grave which bears the following inscription      this grave contains all that was mortal of a young english poet who     on his deathbed in the bitterness of his heart desired these words     to be engraven on his tombstone here lies one whose name was writ in     water  february 24 1821  and the name of the young english poet is john keats  lord houghton calls this cemetery ‘one of the most beautiful spots on which the eye and heart of man can rest’ and shelley speaks of it as making one ‘in love with death to think that one should be buried in so sweet a place’ and indeed when i saw the violets and the daisies and the poppies that overgrow the tomb i remembered how the dead poet had once told his friend that he thought the ‘intensest pleasure he had received in life was in watching the growth of flowers’ and how another time after lying a while quite still he murmured in some strange prescience of early death ‘i feel the flowers growing over me’  but this timeworn stone and these wildflowers are but poor memorials 2 of one so great as keats most of all too in this city of rome which pays such honour to her dead where popes and emperors and saints and cardinals lie hidden in ‘porphyry wombs’ or couched in baths of jasper and chalcedony and malachite ablaze with precious stones and metals and tended with continual service  for very noble is the site and worthy of a noble monument behind looms the grey pyramid symbol of the world’s age and filled with memories of the sphinx and the lotus leaf and the glories of old nile in front is the monte testaccio built it is said with the broken fragments of the vessels in which all the nations of the east and the west brought their tribute to rome and a little distance off along the slope of the hill under the aurelian wall some tall gaunt cypresses rise like burntout funeral torches to mark the spot where shelley’s heart that ‘heart of hearts’ lies in the earth and above all the soil on which we tread is very rome  as i stood beside the mean grave of this divine boy i thought of him as of a priest of beauty slain before his time and the vision of guido’s st sebastian came before my eyes as i saw him at genoa a lovely brown boy with crisp clustering hair and red lips bound by his evil enemies to a tree and though pierced by arrows raising his eyes with divine impassioned gaze towards the eternal beauty of the opening heavens  and thus my thoughts shaped themselves to rhyme                                heu miserande puer      rid of the world’s injustice and its pain        he rests at last beneath god’s veil of blue        taken from life while life and love were new     the youngest of the martyrs here is lain     fair as sebastian and as foully slain        no cypress shades his grave nor funeral yew        but redlipped daisies violets drenched with dew     and sleepy poppies catch the evening rain      o proudest heart that broke for misery        o saddest poet that the world hath seen           o sweetest singer of the english land           thy name was writ in water on the sand        but our tears shall keep thy memory green     and make it flourish like a basiltree      rome 1877  note—a later version of this sonnet under the title of ‘the grave of keats’ is given in the poems page 157     keats’s sonnet on blue century guild hobby horse july 1886   during my tour in america i happened one evening to find myself in louisville kentucky  the subject i had selected to speak on was the mission of art in the nineteenth century and in the course of my lecture i had occasion to quote keats’s sonnet on blue as an example of the poet’s delicate sense of colourharmonies  when my lecture was concluded there came round to see me a lady of middle age with a sweet gentle manner and a most musical voice  she introduced herself to me as mrs speed the daughter of george keats and invited me to come and examine the keats manuscripts in her possession  i spent most of the next day with her reading the letters of keats to her father some of which were at that time unpublished poring over torn yellow leaves and faded scraps of paper and wondering at the little dante in which keats had written those marvellous notes on milton  some months afterwards when i was in california i received a letter from mrs speed asking my acceptance of the original manuscript of the sonnet which i had quoted in my lecture this manuscript i have had reproduced here as it seems to me to possess much psychological interest  it shows us the conditions that preceded the perfected form the gradual growth not of the conception but of the expression and the workings of that spirit of selection which is the secret of style  in the case of poetry as in the case of the other arts what may appear to be simply technicalities of method are in their essence spiritual not mechanical and although in all lovely work what concerns us is the ultimate form not the conditions that necessitate that form yet the preference that precedes perfection the evolution of the beauty and the mere making of the music have if not their artistic value at least their value to the artist  it will be remembered that this sonnet was first published in 1848 by lord houghton in his life letters and literary remains of john keats  lord houghton does not definitely state where he found it but it was probably among the keats manuscripts belonging to mr charles brown  it is evidently taken from a version later than that in my possession as it accepts all the corrections and makes three variations  as in my manuscript the first line is torn away i give the sonnet here as it appears in lord houghton’s edition      answer to a sonnet ending thus            dark eyes are dearer far     than those that make the hyacinthine bell 5                                                          by j h reynolds      blue  ’tis the life of heaven—the domain        of cynthia—the wide palace of the sun—     the tent of hesperus and all his train—        the bosomer of clouds gold grey and dun     blue  ’tis the life of waters—ocean        and all its vassal streams pools numberless     may rage and foam and fret but never can        subside if not to darkblue nativeness     blue gentle cousin of the forest green        married to green in all the sweetest flowers     forgetmenot—the bluebell—and that queen        of secrecy the violet what strange powers     hast thou as a mere shadow  but how great        when in an eye thou art alive with fate                                                                feb 1818  in the athenæum of the 3rd of june 1876 appeared a letter from mr a j horwood stating that he had in his possession a copy of the garden of florence in which this sonnet was transcribed  mr horwood who was unaware that the sonnet had been already published by lord houghton gives the transcript at length  his version reads hue for life in the first line and bright for wide in the second and gives the sixth line thus      with all his tributary streams pools numberless  a foot too long it also reads to for of in the ninth line  mr buxton forman is of opinion that these variations are decidedly genuine but indicative of an earlier state of the poem than that adopted in lord houghton’s edition  however now that we have before us keats’s first draft of his sonnet it is difficult to believe that the sixth line in mr horwood’s version is really a genuine variation  keats may have written                  ocean     his tributary streams pools numberless  and the transcript may have been carelessly made but having got his line right in his first draft keats probably did not spoil it in his second the athenæum version inserts a comma after art in the last line which seems to me a decided improvement and eminently characteristic of keats’s method  i am glad to see that mr buxton forman has adopted it  as for the corrections that lord houghton’s version shows keats to have made in the eighth and ninth lines of this sonnet it is evident that they sprang from keats’s reluctance to repeat the same word in consecutive lines except in cases where a word’s music or meaning was to be emphasized  the substitution of ‘its’ for ‘his’ in the sixth line is more difficult of explanation  it was due probably to a desire on keats’s part not to mar by any echo the fine personification of hesperus  it may be noticed that keats’s own eyes were brown and not blue as stated by mrs proctor to lord houghton  mrs speed showed me a note to that effect written by mrs george keats on the margin of the page in lord houghton’s life p 100 vol i where mrs proctor’s description is given  cowden clarke made a similar correction in his recollections and in some of the later editions of lord houghton’s book the word ‘blue’ is struck out  in severn’s portraits of keats also the eyes are given as brown  the exquisite sense of colour expressed in the ninth and tenth lines may be paralleled by      the ocean with its vastness its blue green  of the sonnet to george keats     dinners and dishes pall mall gazette march 7 1885   a man can live for three days without bread but no man can live for one day without poetry was an aphorism of baudelaire  you can live without pictures and music but you cannot live without eating says the author of dinners and dishes and this latter view is no doubt the more popular  who indeed in these degenerate days would hesitate between an ode and an omelette a sonnet and a salmis  yet the position is not entirely philistine cookery is an art are not its principles the subject of south kensington lectures and does not the royal academy give a banquet once a year  besides as the coming democracy will no doubt insist on feeding us all on penny dinners it is well that the laws of cookery should be explained for were the national meal burned or badly seasoned or served up with the wrong sauce a dreadful revolution might follow  under these circumstances we strongly recommend dinners and dishes to every one it is brief and concise and makes no attempt at eloquence which is extremely fortunate  for even on ortolans who could endure oratory  it also has the advantage of not being illustrated  the subject of a work of art has of course nothing to do with its beauty but still there is always something depressing about the coloured lithograph of a leg of mutton  as regards the author’s particular views we entirely agree with him on the important question of macaroni  ‘never’ he says ‘ask me to back a bill for a man who has given me a macaroni pudding’  macaroni is essentially a savoury dish and may be served with cheese or tomatoes but never with sugar and milk  there is also a useful description of how to cook risotto—a delightful dish too rarely seen in england an excellent chapter on the different kinds of salads which should be carefully studied by those many hostesses whose imaginations never pass beyond lettuce and beetroot and actually a recipe for making brussels sprouts eatable  the last is of course a masterpiece  the real difficulty that we all have to face in life is not so much the science of cookery as the stupidity of cooks  and in this little handbook to practical epicureanism the tyrant of the english kitchen is shown in her proper light  her entire ignorance of herbs her passion for extracts and essences her total inability to make a soup which is anything more than a combination of pepper and gravy her inveterate habit of sending up bread poultices with pheasants—all these sins and many others are ruthlessly unmasked by the author  ruthlessly and rightly  for the british cook is a foolish woman who should be turned for her iniquities into a pillar of salt which she never knows how to use  but our author is not local merely  he has been in many lands he has eaten backhendl at vienna and kulibatsch at st petersburg he has had the courage to face the buffalo veal of roumania and to dine with a german family at one o’clock he has serious views on the right method of cooking those famous white truffles of turin of which alexandre dumas was so fond and in the face of the oriental club declares that bombay curry is better than the curry of bengal  in fact he seems to have had experience of almost every kind of meal except the ‘square meal’ of the americans  this he should study at once there is a great field for the philosophic epicure in the united states  boston beans may be dismissed at once as delusions but softshell crabs terrapin canvasback ducks blue fish and the pompono of new orleans are all wonderful delicacies particularly when one gets them at delmonico’s  indeed the two most remarkable bits of scenery in the states are undoubtedly delmonico’s and the yosemité valley and the former place has done more to promote a good feeling between england and america than anything else has in this century  we hope the ‘wanderer’ will go there soon and add a chapter to dinners and dishes and that his book will have in england the influence it deserves  there are twenty ways of cooking a potato and three hundred and sixtyfive ways of cooking an egg yet the british cook up to the present moment knows only three methods of sending up either one or the other  dinners and dishes  by ‘wanderer’  simpkin and marshall     shakespeare on scenery dramatic review march 14 1885   i have often heard people wonder what shakespeare would say could he see mr irving’s production of his much ado about nothing or mr wilson barrett’s setting of his hamlet  would he take pleasure in the glory of the scenery and the marvel of the colour  would he be interested in the cathedral of messina and the battlements of elsinore  or would he be indifferent and say the play and the play only is the thing  speculations like these are always pleasurable and in the present case happen to be profitable also  for it is not difficult to see what shakespeare’s attitude would be not difficult that is to say if one reads shakespeare himself instead of reading merely what is written about him  speaking for instance directly as the manager of a london theatre through the lips of the chorus in henry v he complains of the smallness of the stage on which he has to produce the pageant of a big historical play and of the want of scenery which obliges him to cut out many of its most picturesque incidents apologises for the scanty number of supers who had to play the soldiers and for the shabbiness of the properties and finally expresses his regret at being unable to bring on real horses  in the midsummer night’s dream again he gives us a most amusing picture of the straits to which theatrical managers of his day were reduced by the want of proper scenery  in fact it is impossible to read him without seeing that he is constantly protesting against the two special limitations of the elizabethan stage—the lack of suitable scenery and the fashion of men playing women’s parts just as he protests against other difficulties with which managers of theatres have still to contend such as actors who do not understand their words actors who miss their cues actors who overact their parts actors who mouth actors who gag actors who play to the gallery and amateur actors  and indeed a great dramatist as he was could not but have felt very much hampered at being obliged continually to interrupt the progress of a play in order to send on some one to explain to the audience that the scene was to be changed to a particular place on the entrance of a particular character and after his exit to somewhere else that the stage was to represent the deck of a ship in a storm or the interior of a greek temple or the streets of a certain town to all of which inartistic devices shakespeare is reduced and for which he always amply apologizes  besides this clumsy method shakespeare had two other substitutes for scenery—the hanging out of a placard and his descriptions  the first of these could hardly have satisfied his passion for picturesqueness and his feeling for beauty and certainly did not satisfy the dramatic critic of his day  but as regards the description to those of us who look on shakespeare not merely as a playwright but as a poet and who enjoy reading him at home just as much as we enjoy seeing him acted it may be a matter of congratulation that he had not at his command such skilled machinists as are in use now at the princess’s and at the lyceum  for had cleopatra’s barge for instance been a structure of canvas and dutch metal it would probably have been painted over or broken up after the withdrawal of the piece and even had it survived to our own day would i am afraid have become extremely shabby by this time  whereas now the beaten gold of its poop is still bright and the purple of its sails still beautiful its silver oars are not tired of keeping time to the music of the flutes they follow nor the nereid’s flowersoft hands of touching its silken tackle the mermaid still lies at its helm and still on its deck stand the boys with their coloured fans  yet lovely as all shakespeare’s descriptive passages are a description is in its essence undramatic  theatrical audiences are far more impressed by what they look at than by what they listen to and the modern dramatist in having the surroundings of his play visibly presented to the audience when the curtain rises enjoys an advantage for which shakespeare often expresses his desire  it is true that shakespeare’s descriptions are not what descriptions are in modern plays—accounts of what the audience can observe for themselves they are the imaginative method by which he creates in the mind of the spectators the image of that which he desires them to see  still the quality of the drama is action  it is always dangerous to pause for picturesqueness  and the introduction of selfexplanatory scenery enables the modern method to be far more direct while the loveliness of form and colour which it gives us seems to me often to create an artistic temperament in the audience and to produce that joy in beauty for beauty’s sake without which the great masterpieces of art can never be understood to which and to which only are they ever revealed  to talk of the passion of a play being hidden by the paint and of sentiment being killed by scenery is mere emptiness and folly of words a noble play nobly mounted gives us double artistic pleasure  the eye as well as the ear is gratified and the whole nature is made exquisitely receptive of the influence of imaginative work  and as regards a bad play have we not all seen large audiences lured by the loveliness of scenic effect into listening to rhetoric posing as poetry and to vulgarity doing duty for realism  whether this be good or evil for the public i will not here discuss but it is evident that the playwright at any rate never suffers  indeed the artist who really has suffered through the modern mounting of plays is not the dramatist at all but the scenepainter proper  he is rapidly being displaced by the stagecarpenter  now and then at drury lane i have seen beautiful old front cloths let down as perfect as pictures some of them and pure painter’s work and there are many which we all remember at other theatres in front of which some dialogue was reduced to graceful dumbshow through the hammer and tintacks behind but as a rule the stage is overcrowded with enormous properties which are not merely far more expensive and cumbersome than scenepaintings but far less beautiful and far less true  properties kill perspective a painted door is more like a real door than a real door is itself for the proper conditions of light and shade can be given to it and the excessive use of builtup structures always makes the stage too glaring for as they have to be lit from behind as well as from the front the gasjets become the absolute light of the scene instead of the means merely by which we perceive the conditions of light and shadow which the painter has desired to show us  so instead of bemoaning the position of the playwright it were better for the critics to exert whatever influence they may possess towards restoring the scenepainter to his proper position as an artist and not allowing him to be built over by the property man or hammered to death by the carpenter  i have never seen any reason myself why such artists as mr beverley mr walter hann and mr telbin should not be entitled to become academicians  they have certainly as good a claim as have many of those ra’s whose total inability to paint we can see every may for a shilling  and lastly let those critics who hold up for our admiration the simplicity of the elizabethan stage remember that they are lauding a condition of things against which shakespeare himself in the spirit of a true artist always strongly protested     henry the fourth at oxford dramatic review may 23 1885   i have been told that the ambition of every dramatic club is to act henry iv  i am not surprised  the spirit of comedy is as fervent in this play as is the spirit of chivalry it is an heroic pageant as well as an heroic poem and like most of shakespeare’s historical dramas it contains an extraordinary number of thoroughly good acting parts each of which is absolutely individual in character and each of which contributes to the evolution of the plot  to oxford belongs the honour of having been the first to present on the stage this noble play and the production which i saw last week was in every way worthy of that lovely town that mother of sweetness and of light  for in spite of the roaring of the young lions at the union and the screaming of the rabbits in the home of the vivisector in spite of keble college and the tramways and the sporting prints oxford still remains the most beautiful thing in england and nowhere else are life and art so exquisitely blended so perfectly made one  indeed in most other towns art has often to present herself in the form of a reaction against the sordid ugliness of ignoble lives but at oxford she comes to us as an exquisite flower born of the beauty of life and expressive of life’s joy  she finds her home by the isis as once she did by the ilissus the magdalen walks and the magdalen cloisters are as dear to her as were ever the silver olives of colonus and the golden gateway of the house of pallas she covers with fanlike tracery the vaulted entrance to christ church hall and looks out from the windows of merton her feet have stirred the cumnor cowslips and she gathers fritillaries in the riverfields  to her the clamour of the schools and the dullness of the lectureroom are a weariness and a vexation of spirit she seeks not to define virtue and cares little for the categories she smiles on the swift athlete whose plastic grace has pleased her and rejoices in the young barbarians at their games she watches the rowers from the reedy bank and gives myrtle to her lovers and laurels to her poets and rue to those who talk wisely in the street she makes the earth lovely to all who dream with keats she opens high heaven to all who soar with shelley and turning away her head from pedant proctor and philistine she has welcomed to her shrine a band of youthful actors knowing that they have sought with much ardour for the stern secret of melpomene and caught with much gladness the sweet laughter of thalia  and to me this ardour and this gladness were the two most fascinating qualities of the oxford performance as indeed they are qualities which are necessary to any fine dramatic production  for without quick and imaginative observation of life the most beautiful play becomes dull in presentation and what is not conceived in delight by the actor can give no delight at all to others  i know that there are many who consider that shakespeare is more for the study than for the stage  with this view i do not for a moment agree shakespeare wrote the plays to be acted and we have no right to alter the form which he himself selected for the full expression of his work indeed many of the beauties of that work can be adequately conveyed to us only through the actor’s art  as i sat in the town hall of oxford the other night the majesty of the mighty lines of the play seemed to me to gain new music from the clear young voices that uttered them and the ideal grandeur of the heroism to be made more real to the spectators by the chivalrous bearing the noble gesture and the fine passion of its exponents  even the dresses had their dramatic value  their archæological accuracy gave us immediately on the rise of the curtain a perfect picture of the time  as the knights and nobles moved across the stage in the flowing robes of peace and in the burnished steel of battle we needed no dreary chorus to tell us in what age or land the play’s action was passing for the fifteenth century in all the dignity and grace of its apparel was living actually before us and the delicate harmonies of colour struck from the first a dominant note of beauty which added to the intellectual realism of archæology the sensuous charm of art  i have rarely seen a production better stagemanaged  indeed i hope that the university will take some official notice of this delightful work of art  why should not degrees be granted for good acting  are they not given to those who misunderstand plato and who mistranslate aristotle  and should the artist be passed over  no  to prince hal hotspur and falstaff dcl’s should be gracefully offered  i feel sure they would be gracefully accepted  to the rest of the company the crimson or the sheepskin hood might be assigned honoris causâ to the eternal confusion of the philistine and the rage of the industrious and the dull  thus would oxford confer honour on herself and the artist be placed in his proper position  however whether or not convocation recognizes the claims of culture i hope that the oxford dramatic society will produce every summer for us some noble play like henry iv  for in plays of this kind plays which deal with bygone times there is always this peculiar charm that they combine in one exquisite presentation the passions that are living with the picturesqueness that is dead  and when we have the modern spirit given to us in an antique form the very remoteness of that form can be made a method of increased realism  this was shakespeare’s own attitude towards the ancient world this is the attitude we in this century should adopt towards his plays and with a feeling akin to this it seemed to me that these brilliant young oxonians were working  if it was so their aim is the right one for while we look to the dramatist to give romance to realism we ask of the actor to give realism to romance     a handbook to marriage pall mall gazette november 18 1885   in spite of its somewhat alarming title this book may be highly recommended to every one  as for the authorities the author quotes they are almost numberless and range from socrates down to artemus ward  he tells us of the wicked bachelor who spoke of marriage as ‘a very harmless amusement’ and advised a young friend of his to ‘marry early and marry often’ of dr johnson who proposed that marriage should be arranged by the lord chancellor without the parties concerned having any choice in the matter of the sussex labourer who asked ‘why should i give a woman half my victuals for cooking the other half’ and of lord verulam who thought that unmarried men did the best public work  and indeed marriage is the one subject on which all women agree and all men disagree  our author however is clearly of the same opinion as the scotch lassie who on her father warning her what a solemn thing it was to get married answered ‘i ken that father but it’s a great deal solemner to be single’  he may be regarded as the champion of the married life  indeed he has a most interesting chapter on marriagemade men and though he dissents and we think rightly from the view recently put forward by a lady or two on the women’s rights platform that solomon owed all his wisdom to the number of his wives still he appeals to bismarck john stuart mill mahommed and lord beaconsfield as instances of men whose success can be traced to the influence of the women they married  archbishop whately once defined woman as ‘a creature that does not reason and pokes the fire from the top’ but since his day the higher education of women has considerably altered their position  women have always had an emotional sympathy with those they love girton and newnham have rendered intellectual sympathy also possible  in our day it is best for a man to be married and men must give up the tyranny in married life which was once so dear to them and which we are afraid lingers still here and there  ‘do you wish to be my wife mabel’ said a little boy  ‘yes’ incautiously answered mabel  ‘then pull off my boots’  on marriage vows our author has too very sensible views and very amusing stories  he tells of a nervous bridegroom who confusing the baptismal and marriage ceremonies replied when asked if he consented to take the bride for his wife ‘i renounce them all’ of a hampshire rustic who when giving the ring said solemnly to the bride ‘with my body i thee wash up and with all my hurdle goods i thee and thou’ of another who when asked whether he would take his partner to be his wedded wife replied with shameful indecision ‘yes i’m willin’ but i’d a sight rather have her sister’ and of a scotch lady who on the occasion of her daughter’s wedding was asked by an old friend whether she might congratulate her on the event and answered ‘yes yes upon the whole it is very satisfactory it is true jeannie hates her gudeman but then there’s always a something’  indeed the good stories contained in this book are quite endless and make it very pleasant reading while the good advice is on all points admirable  most young married people nowadays start in life with a dreadful collection of ormolu inkstands covered with sham onyxes or with a perfect museum of saltcellars  we strongly recommend this book as one of the best of wedding presents  it is a complete handbook to an earthly paradise and its author may be regarded as the murray of matrimony and the baedeker of bliss  how to be happy though married being a handbook to marriage  by a graduate in the university of matrimony  t fisher unwin     to read or not to read pall mall gazette february 8 1886   books i fancy may be conveniently divided into three classes  1  books to read such as cicero’s letters suetonius vasari’s lives of the painters the autobiography of benvenuto cellini sir john mandeville marco polo st simon’s memoirs mommsen and till we get a better one grote’s history of greece  2  books to reread such as plato and keats in the sphere of poetry the masters not the minstrels in the sphere of philosophy the seers not the savants  3  books not to read at all such as thomson’s seasons rogers’s italy paley’s evidences all the fathers except st augustine all john stuart mill except the essay on liberty all voltaire’s plays without any exception butler’s analogy grant’s aristotle hume’s england lewes’s history of philosophy all argumentative books and all books that try to prove anything  the third class is by far the most important  to tell people what to read is as a rule either useless or harmful for the appreciation of literature is a question of temperament not of teaching to parnassus there is no primer and nothing that one can learn is ever worth learning but to tell people what not to read is a very different matter and i venture to recommend it as a mission to the university extension scheme  indeed it is one that is eminently needed in this age of ours an age that reads so much that it has no time to admire and writes so much that it has no time to think  whoever will select out of the chaos of our modern curricula ‘the worst hundred books’ and publish a list of them will confer on the rising generation a real and lasting benefit  after expressing these views i suppose i should not offer any suggestions at all with regard to ‘the best hundred books’ but i hope you will allow me the pleasure of being inconsistent as i am anxious to put in a claim for a book that has been strangely omitted by most of the excellent judges who have contributed to your columns  i mean the greek anthology  the beautiful poems contained in this collection seem to me to hold the same position with regard to greek dramatic literature as do the delicate little figurines of tanagra to the phidian marbles and to be quite as necessary for the complete understanding of the greek spirit  i am also amazed to find that edgar allan poe has been passed over surely this marvellous lord of rhythmic expression deserves a place  if in order to make room for him it be necessary to elbow out some one else i should elbow out southey and i think that baudelaire might be most advantageously substituted for keble  no doubt both in the curse of kehama and in the christian year there are poetic qualities of a certain kind but absolute catholicity of taste is not without its dangers  it is only an auctioneer who should admire all schools of art     the letters of a great woman pall mall gazette march 6 1886   of the many collections of letters that have appeared in this century few if any can rival for fascination of style and variety of incident the letters of george sand which have recently been translated into english by m ledos de beaufort  they extend over a space of more than sixty years from 1812 to 1876 in fact and comprise the first letters of aurore dupin a child of eight years old as well as the last letters of george sand a woman of seventytwo  the very early letters those of the child and of the young married woman possess of course merely a psychological interest but from 1831 the date of madame dudevant’s separation from her husband and her first entry into paris life the interest becomes universal and the literary and political history of france is mirrored in every page  for george sand was an indefatigable correspondent she longs in one of her letters it is true for ‘a planet where reading and writing are absolutely unknown’ but still she had a real pleasure in letterwriting her greatest delight was the communication of ideas and she is always in the heart of the battle  she discusses pauperism with louis napoleon in his prison at ham and liberty with armand barbes in his dungeon at vincennes she writes to lamennais on philosophy to mazzini on socialism to lamartine on democracy and to ledrurollin on justice her letters reveal to us not merely the life of a great novelist but the soul of a great woman of a woman who was one with all the noblest movements of her day and whose sympathy with humanity was boundless absolutely  for the aristocracy of intellect she had always the deepest veneration but the democracy of suffering touched her more  she preached the regeneration of mankind not with the noisy ardour of the paid advocate but with the enthusiasm of the true evangelist  of all the artists of this century she was the most altruistic she felt every one’s misfortunes except her own  her faith never left her to the end of her life as she tells us she was able to believe without illusions but the people disappointed her a little  she saw that they followed persons not principles and for ‘the great man theory’ george sand had no respect  ‘proper names are the enemies of principles’ is one of her aphorisms  so from 1850 her letters are more distinctly literary  she discusses modern realism with flaubert and playwriting with dumas fils and protests with passionate vehemence against the doctrine of l’art pour l’art  ‘art for the sake of itself is an idle sentence’ she writes ‘art for the sake of truth for the sake of what is beautiful and good that is the creed i seek’  and in a delightful letter to m charles poncy she repeats the same idea very charmingly  ‘people say that birds sing for the sake of singing but i doubt it  they sing their loves and happiness and in that they are in keeping with nature  but man must do something more and poets only sing in order to move people and to make them think’  she wanted m poncy to be the poet of the people and if good advice were all that had been needed he would certainly have been the burns of the workshop  she drew out a delightful scheme for a volume to be called songs of all trades and saw the possibilities of making handicrafts poetic  perhaps she valued good intentions in art a little too much and she hardly understood that art for art’s sake is not meant to express the final cause of art but is merely a formula of creation but as she herself had scaled parnassus we must not quarrel at her bringing proletarianism with her  for george sand must be ranked among our poetic geniuses  she regarded the novel as still within the domain of poetry  her heroes are not dead photographs they are great possibilities  modern novels are dissections hers are dreams  ‘i make popular types’ she writes ‘such as i do no longer see but such as they should and might be’  for realism in m zola’s acceptation of the word she had no admiration  art to her was a mirror that transfigured truths but did not represent realities  hence she could not understand art without personality  ‘i am aware’ she writes to flaubert ‘that you are opposed to the exposition of personal doctrine in literature  are you right  does not your opposition proceed rather from a want of conviction than from a principle of æsthetics  if we have any philosophy in our brain it must needs break forth in our writings  but you as soon as you handle literature you seem anxious i know not why to be another man the one who must disappear who annihilates himself and is no more  what a singular mania  what a deficient taste  the worth of our productions depends entirely on our own  besides if we withhold our own opinions respecting the personages we create we naturally leave the reader in uncertainty as to the opinion he should himself form of them  that amounts to wishing not to be understood and the result of this is that the reader gets weary of us and leaves us’  she herself however may be said to have suffered from too dominant a personality and this was the reason of the failure of most of her plays  of the drama in the sense of disinterested presentation she had no idea and what is the strength and lifeblood of her novels is the weakness of her dramatic works  but in the main she was right  art without personality is impossible  and yet the aim of art is not to reveal personality but to please  this she hardly recognized in her æsthetics though she realized it in her work  on literary style she has some excellent remarks  she dislikes the extravagances of the romantic school and sees the beauty of simplicity  ‘simplicity’ she writes ‘is the most difficult thing to secure in this world it is the last limit of experience and the last effort of genius’  she hated the slang and argot of paris life and loved the words used by the peasants in the provinces  ‘the provinces’ she remarks ‘preserve the tradition of the original tongue and create but few new words  i feel much respect for the language of the peasantry in my estimation it is the more correct’  she thought flaubert too much preoccupied with the sense of form and makes these excellent observations to him—perhaps her best piece of literary criticism  ‘you consider the form as the aim whereas it is but the effect  happy expressions are only the outcome of emotion and emotion itself proceeds from a conviction  we are only moved by that which we ardently believe in’  literary schools she distrusted individualism was to her the keystone of art as well as of life  ‘do not belong to any school do not imitate any model’ is her advice  yet she never encouraged eccentricity  ‘be correct’ she writes to eugène pelletan ‘that is rarer than being eccentric as the time goes  it is much more common to please by bad taste than to receive the cross of honour’  on the whole her literary advice is sound and healthy  she never shrieks and she never sneers  she is the incarnation of good sense  and the whole collection of her letters is a perfect treasurehouse of suggestions both on art and on politics  letters of george sand  translated and edited by raphael ledos de beaufort  ward and downey     bÉranger in england pall mall gazette april 21 1886   a philosophic politician once remarked that the best possible form of government is an absolute monarchy tempered by street ballads  without at all agreeing with this aphorism we still cannot but regret that the new democracy does not use poetry as a means for the expression of political opinion  the socialists it is true have been heard singing the later poems of mr william morris but the street ballad is really dead in england  the fact is that most modern poetry is so artificial in its form so individual in its essence and so literary in its style that the people as a body are little moved by it and when they have grievances against the capitalist or the aristocrat they prefer strikes to sonnets and rioting to rondels  possibly mr william toynbee’s pleasant little volume of translations from béranger may be the herald of a new school  béranger had all the qualifications for a popular poet  he wrote to be sung more than to be read he preferred the pont neuf to parnassus he was patriotic as well as romantic and humorous as well as humane  translations of poetry as a rule are merely misrepresentations but the muse of béranger is so simple and naïve that she can wear our english dress with ease and grace and mr toynbee has kept much of the mirth and music of the original  here and there undoubtedly the translation could be improved upon ‘rapiers’ for instance is an abominable rhyme to ‘forefathers’ ‘the hated arms of albion’ in the same poem is a very feeble rendering of ‘le léopard de l’anglais’ and such a verse as      ’mid france’s miracles of art        rare trophies won from art’s own land     i’ve lived to see with burning heart        the fogbred poor triumphant stand  reproduces very inadequately the charm of the original      dans nos palais où près de la victoire     brillaient les arts doux fruits des beaux climats     j’ai vu du nord les peuplades sans gloire     de leurs manteaux secouer les frimas  on the whole however mr toynbee’s work is good les champs for example is very well translated and so are the two delightful poems rosette and ma république and there is a good deal of spirit in le marquis de carabas      whom have we here in conqueror’s rôle     our grand old marquis bless his soul     whose grand old charger mark his bone     has borne him back to claim his own     note if you please the grand old style     in which he nears his grand old pile     with what an air of grand old state     he waves that blade immaculate        hats off hats off for my lord to pass        the grand old marquis of carabas—  though ‘that blade immaculate’ has hardly got the sting of ‘un sabre innocent’ and in the fourth verse of the same poem ‘marquise you’ll have the bedchamber’ does not very clearly convey the sense of the line ‘la marquise a le tabouret’  béranger is not nearly well enough known in england and though it is always better to read a poet in the original still translations have their value as echoes have their music  a selection from the songs of de béranger in english verse  by william toynbee  kegan paul     the poetry of the people pall mall gazette may 13 1886   the countess martinengo deserves well of all poets peasants and publishers  folklore is so often treated nowadays merely from the point of view of the comparative mythologist that it is really delightful to come across a book that deals with the subject simply as literature  for the folktale is the father of all fiction as the folksong is the mother of all poetry and in the games the tales and the ballads of primitive people it is easy to see the germs of such perfected forms of art as the drama the novel and the epic  it is of course true that the highest expression of life is to be found not in the popular songs however poetical of any nation but in the great masterpieces of selfconscious art yet it is pleasant sometimes to leave the summit of parnassus to look at the wildflowers in the valley and to turn from the lyre of apollo to listen to the reed of pan  we can still listen to it  to this day the vineyard dressers of calabria will mock the passerby with satirical verses as they used to do in the old pagan days and the peasants of the olive woods of provence answer each other in amœbæan strains  the sicilian shepherd has not yet thrown his pipe aside and the children of modern greece sing the swallowsong through the villages in springtime though theognis is more than two thousand years dead nor is this popular poetry merely the rhythmic expression of joy and sorrow it is in the highest degree imaginative and taking its inspiration directly from nature it abounds in realistic metaphor and in picturesque and fantastic imagery  it must of course be admitted that there is a conventionality of nature as there is a conventionality of art and that certain forms of utterance are apt to become stereotyped by too constant use yet on the whole it is impossible not to recognize in the folksongs that the countess martinengo has brought together one strong dominant note of fervent and flawless sincerity  indeed it is only in the more terrible dramas of the elizabethan age that we can find any parallel to the corsican voceri with their shrill intensity of passion their awful frenzies of grief and hate  and yet ardent as the feeling is the form is nearly always beautiful  now and then in the poems of the extreme south one meets with a curious crudity of realism but as a rule the sense of beauty prevails  some of the folkpoems in this book have all the lightness and loveliness of lyrics all of them have that sweet simplicity of pure song by which mirth finds its own melody and mourning its own music and even where there are conceits of thought and expression they are conceits born of fancy not of affectation  herrick himself might have envied that wonderful lovesong of provence      if thou wilt be the falling dew        and fall on me alway     then i will be the white white rose        on yonder thorny spray     if thou wilt be the white white rose        on yonder thorny spray     then i will be the honeybee        and kiss thee all the day      if thou wilt be the honeybee        and kiss me all the day     then i will be in yonder heaven        the star of brightest ray     if thou wilt be in yonder heaven        the star of brightest ray     then i will be the dawn and we        shall meet at break of day  how charming also is this lullaby by which the corsican mother sings her babe to sleep      gold and pearls my vessel lade        silk and cloth the cargo be     all the sails are of brocade        coming from beyond the sea     and the helm of finest gold     made a wonder to behold        fast awhile in slumber lie        sleep my child and hushaby      after you were born full soon        you were christened all aright     godmother she was the moon        godfather the sun so bright     all the stars in heaven told     wore their necklaces of gold        fast awhile in slumber lie        sleep my child and hushaby  or this from roumania      sleep my daughter sleep an hour     mother’s darling gilliflower     mother rocks thee standing near     she

as a willow tall and slight     gentle as the ringdoves are     and be lovely as a star  we hardly know what poems are sung to english babies but we hope they are as beautiful as these two  blake might have written them  the countess martinengo has certainly given us a most fascinating book in a volume of moderate dimensions not too long to be tiresome nor too brief to be disappointing she has collected together the best examples of modern folksongs and with her as a guide the lazy reader lounging in his armchair may wander from the melancholy pineforests of the north to sicily’s orangegroves and the pomegranate gardens of armenia and listen to the singing of those to whom poetry is a passion not a profession and whose art coming from inspiration and not from schools if it has the limitations at least has also the loveliness of its origin and is one with blowing grasses and the flowers of the field  essays in the study of folksongs  by the countess evelyn martinengo césaresco  redway     the cenci dramatic review may 15 1886   the production of the cenci last week at the grand theatre islington may be said to have been an era in the literary history of this century and the shelley society deserves the highest praise and warmest thanks of all for having given us an opportunity of seeing shelley’s play under the conditions he himself desired for it  for the cenci was written absolutely with a view to theatric presentation and had shelley’s own wishes been carried out it would have been produced during his lifetime at covent garden with edmund kean and miss o’neill in the principal parts  in working out his conception shelley had studied very carefully the æsthetics of dramatic art  he saw that the essence of the drama is disinterested presentation and that the characters must not be merely mouthpieces for splendid poetry but must be living subjects for terror and for pity  ‘i have endeavoured’ he says ‘as nearly as possible to represent the characters as they probably were and have sought to avoid the error of making them actuated by my own conception of right or wrong false or true thus under a thin veil converting names and actions of the sixteenth century into cold impersonations of my own mind     ‘i have avoided with great care the introduction of what is commonly called mere poetry and i imagine there will scarcely be found a detached simile or a single isolated description unless beatrice’s description of the chasm appointed for her father’s murder should be judged to be of that nature’  he recognized that a dramatist must be allowed far greater freedom of expression than what is conceded to a poet  ‘in a dramatic composition’ to use his own words ‘the imagery and the passion should interpenetrate one another the former being reserved simply for the full development and illustration of the latter  imagination is as the immortal god which should assume flesh for the redemption of mortal passion  it is thus that the most remote and the most familiar imagery may alike be fit for dramatic purposes when employed in the illustration of strong feeling which raises what is low and levels to the apprehension that which is lofty casting over all the shadow of its own greatness  in other respects i have written more carelessly that is without an overfastidious and learned choice of words  in this respect i entirely agree with those modern critics who assert that in order to move men to true sympathy we must use the familiar language of men’  he knew that if the dramatist is to teach at all it must be by example not by precept  ‘the highest moral purpose’ he remarks ‘aimed at in the highest species of the drama is the teaching the human heart through its sympathies and antipathies the knowledge of itself in proportion to the possession of which knowledge every human being is wise just sincere tolerant and kind  if dogmas can do more it is well but a drama is no fit place for the enforcement of them’  he fully realizes that it is by a conflict between our artistic sympathies and our moral judgment that the greatest dramatic effects are produced  ‘it is in the restless and anatomizing casuistry with which men seek the justification of beatrice yet feel that she has done what needs justification it is in the superstitious horror with which they contemplate alike her wrongs and their revenge that the dramatic character of what she did and suffered consists’  in fact no one has more clearly understood than shelley the mission of the dramatist and the meaning of the drama     balzac in english pall mall gazette september 13 1886   many years ago in a number of all the year round charles dickens complained that balzac was very little read in england and although since then the public has become more familiar with the great masterpieces of french fiction still it may be doubted whether the comédie humaine is at all appreciated or understood by the general run of novel readers  it is really the greatest monument that literature has produced in our century and m taine hardly exaggerates when he says that after shakespeare balzac is our most important magazine of documents on human nature  balzac’s aim in fact was to do for humanity what buffon had done for the animal creation  as the naturalist studied lions and tigers so the novelist studied men and women  yet he was no mere reporter  photography and procèsverbal were not the essentials of his method  observation gave him the facts of life but his genius converted facts into truths and truths into truth  he was in a word a marvellous combination of the artistic temperament with the scientific spirit  the latter he bequeathed to his disciples the former was entirely his own  the distinction between such a book as m zola’s l’assommoir and such a book as balzac’s illusions perdues is the distinction between unimaginative realism and imaginative reality  ‘all balzac’s characters’ said baudelaire ‘are gifted with the same ardour of life that animated himself  all his fictions are as deeply coloured as dreams  every mind is a weapon loaded to the muzzle with will  the very scullions have genius’  he was of course accused of being immoral  few writers who deal directly with life escape that charge his answer to the accusation was characteristic and conclusive  ‘whoever contributes his stone to the edifice of ideas’ he wrote ‘whoever proclaims an abuse whoever sets his mark upon an evil to be abolished always passes for immoral  if you are true in your portraits if by dint of daily and nightly toil you succeed in writing the most difficult language in the world the word immoral is thrown in your face’  the morals of the personages of the comédie humaine are simply the morals of the world around us  they are part of the artist’s subjectmatter they are not part of his method  if there be any need of censure it is to life not to literature that it should be given  balzac besides is essentially universal  he sees life from every point of view  he has no preferences and no prejudices  he does not try to prove anything  he feels that the spectacle of life contains its own secret  ‘il crée un monde et se tait’  and what a world it is  what a panorama of passions  what a pellmell of men and women  it was said of trollope that he increased the number of our acquaintances without adding to our visiting list but after the comédie humaine one begins to believe that the only real people are the people who never existed  lucien de rubempré le père goriot ursule mirouët marguerite claës the baron hulot madame marneffe le cousin pons de marsay—all bring with them a kind of contagious illusion of life  they have a fierce vitality about them their existence is fervent and fierycoloured we not merely feel for them but we see them—they dominate our fancy and defy scepticism  a steady course of balzac reduces our living friends to shadows and our acquaintances to the shadows of shades  who would care to go out to an evening party to meet tomkins the friend of one’s boyhood when one can sit at home with lucien de rubempré  it is pleasanter to have the entrée to balzac’s society than to receive cards from all the duchesses in mayfair  in spite of this there are many people who have declared the comédie humaine to be indigestible  perhaps it is but then what about truffles  balzac’s publisher refused to be disturbed by any such criticism as that  ‘indigestible is it’ he exclaimed with what for a publisher was rare good sense  ‘well i should hope so who ever thinks of a dinner that isn’t’  balzac’s novels in english  the duchesse de langeais and other stories césar birotteau  routledge and sons     ben jonson pall mall gazette september 20 1886   as for mr symonds’ estimate of jonson’s genius it is in many points quite excellent  he ranks him with the giants rather than with the gods with those who compel our admiration by their untiring energy and huge strength of intellectual muscle not with those ‘who share the divine gifts of creative imagination and inevitable instinct’  here he is right  pelion more than parnassus was jonson’s home  his art has too much effort about it too much definite intention  his style lacks the charm of chance  mr symonds is right also in the stress he lays on the extraordinary combination in jonson’s work of the most concentrated realism with encyclopædic erudition  in jonson’s comedies london slang and learned scholarship go hand in hand  literature was as living a thing to him as life itself  he used his classical lore not merely to give form to his verse but to give flesh and blood to the persons of his plays  he could build up a breathing creature out of quotations  he made the poets of greece and rome terribly modern and introduced them to the oddest company  his very culture is an element in his coarseness there are moments when one is tempted to liken him to a beast that has fed off books  we cannot however agree with mr symonds when he says that jonson ‘rarely touched more than the outside of character’ that his men and women are ‘the incarnations of abstract properties rather than living human beings’ that they are in fact mere ‘masqueraders and mechanical puppets’  eloquence is a beautiful thing but rhetoric ruins many a critic and mr symonds is essentially rhetorical  when for instance he tells us that ‘jonson made masks’ while ‘dekker and heywood created souls’ we feel that he is asking us to accept a crude judgment for the sake of a smart antithesis  it is of course true that we do not find in jonson the same growth of character that we find in shakespeare and we may admit that most of the characters in jonson’s plays are so to speak readymade  but a readymade character is not necessarily either mechanical or wooden two epithets mr symonds uses constantly in his criticism  we cannot tell and shakespeare himself does not tell us why iago is evil why regan and goneril have hard hearts or why sir andrew aguecheek is a fool  it is sufficient that they are what they are and that nature gives warrant for their existence  if a character in a play is lifelike if we recognize it as true to nature we have no right to insist on the author explaining its genesis to us  we must accept it as it is and in the hands of a good dramatist mere presentation can take the place of analysis and indeed is often a more dramatic method because a more direct one  and jonson’s characters are true to nature  they are in no sense abstractions they are types  captain bobadil and captain tucca sir john daw and sir amorous la foole volpone and mosca subtle and sir epicure mammon mrs purecraft and the rabbi busy are all creatures of flesh and blood none the less lifelike because they are labelled  in this point mr symonds seems to us unjust towards jonson  we think also that a special chapter might have been devoted to jonson as a literary critic  the creative activity of the english renaissance is so great that its achievements in the sphere of criticism are often overlooked by the student  then for the first time was language treated as an art  the laws of expression and composition were investigated and formularized  the importance of words was recognized romanticism realism and classicism fought their first battles  the dramatists are full of literary and art criticisms and amused the public with slashing articles on one another in the form of plays  ‘english worthies’  edited by andrew lang  ben jonson  by john addington symonds  longmans green and co     mr symonds’ history of the renaissance pall mall gazette november 10 1886   mr symonds has at last finished his history of the italian renaissance the two volumes just published deal with the intellectual and moral conditions in italy during the seventy years of the sixteenth century which followed the coronation of charles the fifth at bologna an era to which mr symonds gives the name of the catholic reaction and they contain a most interesting and valuable account of the position of spain in the italian peninsula the conduct of the tridentine council the specific organization of the holy office and the company of jesus and the state of society upon which those forces were brought to bear  in his previous volumes mr symonds had regarded the past rather as a picture to be painted than as a problem to be solved  in these two last volumes however he shows a clearer appreciation of the office of history  the art of the picturesque chronicler is completed by something like the science of the true historian the critical spirit begins to manifest itself and life is not treated as a mere spectacle but the laws of its evolution and progress are investigated also  we admit that the desire to represent life at all costs under dramatic conditions still accompanies mr symonds and that he hardly realizes that what seems romance to us was harsh reality to those who were engaged in it  like most dramatists also he is more interested in the psychological exceptions than in the general rule  he has something of shakespeare’s sovereign contempt of the masses  the people stir him very little but he is fascinated by great personalities  yet it is only fair to remember that the age itself was one of exaggerated individualism and that literature had not yet become a mouthpiece for the utterances of humanity  men appreciated the aristocracy of intellect but with the democracy of suffering they had no sympathy  the cry from the brickfields had still to be heard  mr symonds’ style too has much improved  here and there it is true we come across traces of the old manner as in the apocalyptic vision of the seven devils that entered italy with the spaniard and the description of the inquisition as a belialmoloch a ‘hideous idol whose face was blackened with soot from burning human flesh’  such a sentence also as ‘over the dead sea of social putrefaction floated the sickening oil of jesuitical hypocrisy’ reminds us that rhetoric has not yet lost its charms for mr symonds still on the whole the style shows far more reserve balance and sobriety than can be found in the earlier volumes where violent antithesis forms the predominant characteristic and accuracy is often sacrificed to an adjective  amongst the most interesting chapters of the book are those on the inquisition on sarpi the great champion of the severance of church from state and on giordano bruno  indeed the story of bruno’s life from his visit to london and oxford his sojourn in paris and wanderings through germany down to his betrayal at venice and martyrdom at rome is most powerfully told and the estimate of the value of his philosophy and the relation he holds to modern science is at once just and appreciative  the account also of ignatius loyola and the rise of the society of jesus is extremely interesting though we cannot think that mr symonds is very happy in his comparison of the jesuits to ‘fanatics laying stones upon a railway’ or ‘dynamiters blowing up an emperor or a corner of westminster hall’  such a judgment is harsh and crude in expression and more suitable to the clamour of the protestant union than to the dignity of the true historian  mr symonds however is rarely deliberately unfair and there is no doubt but that his work on the catholic reaction is a most valuable contribution to modern history—so valuable indeed that in the account he gives of the inquisition in venice it would be well worth his while to bring the picturesque fiction of the text into some harmony with the plain facts of the footnote  on the poetry of the sixteenth century mr symonds has of course a great deal to say and on such subjects he always writes with ease grace and delicacy of perception  we admit that we weary sometimes of the continual application to literature of epithets appropriate to plastic and pictorial art  the conception of the unity of the arts is certainly of great value but in the present condition of criticism it seems to us that it would be more useful to emphasize the fact that each art has its separate method of expression  the essay on tasso however is delightful reading and the position the poet holds towards modern music and modern sentiment is analysed with much subtlety  the essay on marino also is full of interest  we have often wondered whether those who talk so glibly of euphuism and marinism in literature have ever read either euphues or the adone  to the latter they can have no better guide than mr symonds whose description of the poem is most fascinating  marino like many greater men has suffered much from his disciples but he himself was a master of graceful fancy and of exquisite felicity of phrase not of course a great poet but certainly an artist in poetry and one to whom language is indebted  even those conceits that mr symonds feels bound to censure have something charming about them the continual use of periphrases is undoubtedly a grave fault in style yet who but a pedant would really quarrel with such periphrases as sirena de’ boschi for the nightingale or il novello edimione for galileo  from the poets mr symonds passes to the painters not those great artists of florence and venice of whom he has already written but the eclectics of bologna the naturalists of naples and rome  this chapter is too polemical to be pleasant  the one on music is much better and mr symonds gives us a most interesting description of the gradual steps by which the italian genius passed from poetry and painting to melody and song till the whole of europe thrilled with the marvel and mystery of this new language of the soul  some small details should perhaps be noticed  it is hardly accurate for instance to say that monteverde’s orfeo was the first form of the recitativeopera as peri’s dafne and euridice and cavaliere’s rappresentazione preceded it by some years and it is somewhat exaggerated to say that ‘under the regime of the commonwealth the national growth of english music received a check from which it never afterwards recovered’ as it was with cromwell’s auspices that the first english opera was produced thirteen years before any opera was regularly established in paris  the fact that england did not make such development in music as italy and germany did must be ascribed to other causes than ‘the prevalence of puritan opinion’  these however are minor points  mr symonds is to be warmly congratulated on the completion of his history of the renaissance in italy  it is a most wonderful monument of literary labour and its value to the student of humanism cannot be doubted  we have often had occasion to differ from mr symonds on questions of detail and we have more than once felt it our duty to protest against the rhetoric and overemphasis of his style but we fully recognize the importance of his work and the impetus he has given to the study of one of the vital periods of the world’s history  mr symonds’ learning has not made him a pedant his culture has widened not narrowed his sympathies and though he can hardly be called a great historian yet he will always occupy a place in english literature as one of the remarkable men of letters in the nineteenth century  renaissance in italy the catholic reaction  in two parts  by john addington symonds  smith elder and co     mr morris’s odyssey pall mall gazette april 26 1887   of all our modern poets mr william morris is the one best qualified by nature and by art to translate for us the marvellous epic of the wanderings of odysseus  for he is our only true storysinger since chaucer if he is a socialist he is also a sagaman and there was a time when he was never wearied of telling us strange legends of gods and men wonderful tales of chivalry and romance  master as he is of decorative and descriptive verse he has all the greek’s joy in the visible aspect of things all the greek’s sense of delicate and delightful detail all the greek’s pleasure in beautiful textures and exquisite materials and imaginative designs nor can any one have a keener sympathy with the homeric admiration for the workers and the craftsmen in the various arts from the stainers in white ivory and the embroiderers in purple and gold to the weaver sitting by the loom and the dyer dipping in the vat the chaser of shield and helmet the carver of wood or stone  and to all this is added the true temper of high romance the power to make the past as real to us as the present the subtle instinct to discern passion the swift impulse to portray life  it is no wonder the lovers of greek literature have so eagerly looked forward to mr morris’s version of the odyssean epic and now that the first volume has appeared it is not extravagant to say that of all our english translations this is the most perfect and the most satisfying in spite of coleridge’s wellknown views on the subject we have always held that chapman’s odyssey is immeasurably inferior to his iliad the mere difference of metre alone being sufficient to set the former in a secondary place pope’s odyssey with its glittering rhetoric and smart antithesis has nothing of the grand manner of the original cowper is dull and bryant dreadful and worsley too full of spenserian prettinesses while excellent though messrs butcher and lang’s version undoubtedly is in many respects still on the whole it gives us merely the facts of the odyssey without providing anything of its artistic effect  avia’s translation even though better than almost all its predecessors in the same field is not worthy of taking rank beside mr morris’s for here we have a true work of art a rendering not merely of language into language but of poetry into poetry and though the new spirit added in the transfusion may seem to many rather norse than greek and perhaps at times more boisterous than beautiful there is yet a vigour of life in every line a splendid ardour through each canto that stirs the blood while one reads like the sound of a trumpet and that producing a physical as well as a spiritual delight exults the senses no less than it exalts the soul  it may be admitted at once that here and there mr morris has missed something of the marvellous dignity of the homeric verse and that in his desire for rushing and ringing metre he has occasionally sacrificed majesty to movement and made stateliness give place to speed but it is really only in such blank verse as milton’s that this effect of calm and lofty music can be attained and in all other respects blank verse is the most inadequate medium for reproducing the full flow and fervour of the greek hexameter  one merit at any rate mr morris’s version entirely and absolutely possesses  it is in no sense of the word literary it seems to deal immediately with life itself and to take from the reality of things its own form and colour it is always direct and simple and at its best has something of the ‘large utterance of the early gods’  as for individual passages of beauty nothing could be better than the wonderful description of the house of the phœacian king or the whole telling of the lovely legend of circe or the manner in which the pageant of the pale phantoms in hades is brought before our eyes  perhaps the huge epic humour of the escape from the cyclops is hardly realized but there is always a linguistic difficulty about rendering this fascinating story into english and where we are given so much poetry we should not complain about losing a pun and the exquisite idyll of the meeting and parting with the daughter of alcinous is really delightfully told  how good for instance is this passage taken at random from the sixth book      but therewith unto the handmaids goodly odysseus spake     ‘stand off i bid you damsels while the work in hand i take     and wash the brine from my shoulders and sleek them all around     since verily now this long while sweet oil they have not found     but before you nought will i wash me for shame i have indeed     amidst of fairtressed damsels to be all bare of weed’     so he spake and aloof they gat them and thereof they told the may     but odysseus with the river from his body washed away     the brine from his back and shoulders wrought broad and mightily     and from his head was he wiping the foam of the untilled sea     but when he had thoroughly washed him and the oil about him had     shed     he did upon the raiment the gift of the maid unwed     but athene zeusbegotten dealt with him in such wise     that bigger yet was his seeming and mightier to all eyes     with the hair on his head crisp curling as the bloom of the daffodil     and as when the silver with gold is o’erlaid by a man of skill     yea a craftsman whom hephæstus and pallas athene have taught     to be master over masters and lovely work he hath wrought     so she round his head and his shoulders shed grace abundantly  it may be objected by some that the line      with the hair on his head crisp curling as the bloom of the daffodil  is a rather fanciful version of      ουλας ηκε κόμας ύακινθίνω ανθει όμοιασ  and it certainly seems probable that the allusion is to the dark colour of the hero’s hair still the point is not one of much importance though it may be worth noting that a similar expression occurs in ogilby’s superbly illustrated translation of the odyssey published in 1665 where charles ii’s master of the revels in ireland gives the passage thus      minerva renders him more tall and fair     curling in rings like daffodils his hair  no anthology however can show the true merit of mr morris’s translation whose real merit does not depend on stray beauties nor is revealed by chance selections but lies in the absolute rightness and coherence of the whole in its purity and justice of touch its freedom from affectation and commonplace its harmony of form and matter  it is sufficient to say that this is a poet’s version of a poet and for such surely we should be thankful  in these latter days of coarse and vulgar literature it is something to have made the great seaepic of the south native and natural to our northern isle something to have shown that our english speech may be a pipe through which greek lips can blow something to have taught nausicaa to speak the same language as perdita  the odyssey of homer  done into english verse by william morris author of the earthly paradise  in two volumes  volume i  reeves and turner  for review of volume ii see mr morris’s completion of the odyssey page 65     russian novelists pall mall gazette may 2 1887   of the three great russian novelists of our time tourgenieff is by far the finest artist  he has that spirit of exquisite selection that delicate choice of detail which is the essence of style his work is entirely free from any personal intention and by taking existence at its most fierycoloured moments he can distil into a few pages of perfect prose the moods and passions of many lives  count tolstoi’s method is much larger and his field of vision more extended  he reminds us sometimes of paul veronese and like that great painter can crowd without overcrowding the giant canvas on which he works  we may not at first gain from his works that artistic unity of impression which is tourgenieff’s chief charm but once that we have mastered the details the whole seems to have the grandeur and the simplicity of an epic  dostoieffski differs widely from both his rivals he is not so fine an artist as tourgenieff for he deals more with the facts than with the effects of life nor has he tolstoi’s largeness of vision and epic dignity but he has qualities that are distinctively and absolutely his own such as a fierce intensity of passion and concentration of impulse a power of dealing with the deepest mysteries of psychology and the most hidden springs of life and a realism that is pitiless in its fidelity and terrible because it is true  some time ago we had occasion to draw attention to his marvellous novel crime and punishment where in the haunt of impurity and vice a harlot and an assassin meet together to read the story of dives and lazarus and the outcast girl leads the sinner to make atonement for his sin nor is the book entitled injury and insult at all inferior to that great masterpiece  mean and ordinary though the surroundings of the story may seem the heroine natasha is like one of the noble victims of greek tragedy she is antigone with the passion of phædra and it is impossible to approach her without a feeling of awe  greek also is the gloom of nemesis that hangs over each character only it is a nemesis that does not stand outside of life but is part of our own nature and of the same material as life itself  aleósha the beautiful young lad whom natasha follows to her doom is a second tito melema and has all tito’s charm and grace and fascination  yet he is different  he would never have denied baldassare in the square at florence nor lied to romola about tessa  he has a magnificent momentary sincerity a boyish unconsciousness of all that life signifies an ardent enthusiasm for all that life cannot give  there is nothing calculating about him  he never thinks evil he only does it  from a psychological point of view he is one of the most interesting characters of modern fiction as from an artistic he is one of the most attractive  as we grow to know him he stirs strange questions for us and makes us feel that it is not the wicked only who do wrong nor the bad alone who work evil  and by what a subtle objective method does dostoieffski show us his characters  he never tickets them with a list nor labels them with a description  we grow to know them very gradually as we know people whom we meet in society at first by little tricks of manner personal appearance fancies in dress and the like and afterwards by their deeds and words and even then they constantly elude us for though dostoieffski may lay bare for us the secrets of their nature yet he never explains his personages away they are always surprising us by something that they say or do and keep to the end the eternal mystery of life  irrespective of its value as a work of art this novel possesses a deep autobiographical interest also as the character of vania the poor student who loves natasha through all her sin and shame is dostoieffski’s study of himself  goethe once had to delay the completion of one of his novels till experience had furnished him with new situations but almost before he had arrived at manhood dostoieffski knew life in its most real forms poverty and suffering pain and misery prison exile and love were soon familiar to him and by the lips of vania he has told his own story  this note of personal feeling this harsh reality of actual experience undoubtedly gives the book something of its strange fervour and terrible passion yet it has not made it egotistic we see things from every point of view and we feel not that fiction has been trammelled by fact but that fact itself has become ideal and imaginative  pitiless too though dostoieffski is in his method as an artist as a man he is full of human pity for all for those who do evil as well as for those who suffer it for the selfish no less than for those whose lives are wrecked for others and whose sacrifice is in vain  since adam bede and le père goriot no more powerful novel has been written than insult and injury  injury and insult  by fedor dostoieffski  translated from the russian by frederick whishaw  vizetelly and co     mr pater’s imaginary portraits pall mall gazette june 11 1887   to convey ideas through the medium of images has always been the aim of those who are artists as well as thinkers in literature and it is to a desire to give a sensuous environment to intellectual concepts that we owe mr pater’s last volume  for these imaginary or as we should prefer to call them imaginative portraits of his form a series of philosophic studies in which the philosophy is tempered by personality and the thought shown under varying conditions of mood and manner the very permanence of each principle gaining something through the change and colour of the life through which it finds expression  the most fascinating of all these pictures is undoubtedly that of sebastian van storck  the account of watteau is perhaps a little too fanciful and the description of him as one who was ‘always a seeker after something in the world that is there in no satisfying measure or not at all’ seems to us more applicable to him who saw mona lisa sitting among the rocks than the gay and debonair peintre des fêtes galantes  but sebastian the grave young dutch philosopher is charmingly drawn  from the first glimpse we get of him skating over the watermeadows with his plume of squirrel’s tail and his fur muff in all the modest pleasantness of boyhood down to his strange death in the desolate house amid the sands of the helder we seem to see him to know him almost to hear the low music of his voice  he is a dreamer as the common phrase goes and yet he is poetical in this sense that his theorems shape life for him directly  early in youth he is stirred by a fine saying of spinoza and sets himself to realize the ideal of an intellectual disinterestedness separating himself more and more from the transient world of sensation accident and even affection till what is finite and relative becomes of no interest to him and he feels that as nature is but a thought of his so he himself is but a passing thought of god  this conception of the power of a mere metaphysical abstraction over the mind of one so fortunately endowed for the reception of the sensible world is exceedingly delightful and mr pater has never written a more subtle psychological study the fact that sebastian dies in an attempt to save the life of a little child giving to the whole story a touch of poignant pathos and sad irony  denys l’auxerrois is suggested by a figure found or said to be found on some old tapestries in auxerre the figure of a ‘flaxen and flowery creature sometimes wellnigh naked among the vineleaves sometimes muffled in skins against the cold sometimes in the dress of a monk but always with a strong impress of real character and incident from the veritable streets’ of the town itself  from this strange design mr pater has fashioned a curious mediæval myth of the return of dionysus among men a myth steeped in colour and passion and old romance full of wonder and full of worship denys himself being half animal and half god making the world mad with a new ecstasy of living stirring the artists simply by his visible presence drawing the marvel of music from reed and pipe and slain at last in a stageplay by those who had loved him  in its rich affluence of imagery this story is like a picture by mantegna and indeed mantegna might have suggested the description of the pageant in which denys rides upon a gailypainted chariot in soft silken raiment and for headdress a strange elephant scalp with gilded tusks  if denys l’auxerrois symbolizes the passion of the senses and sebastian van storck the philosophic passion as they certainly seem to do though no mere formula or definition can adequately express the freedom and variety of the life that they portray the passion for the imaginative world of art is the basis of the story of duke carl of rosenmold  duke carl is not unlike the late king of bavaria in his love of france his admiration for the grand monarque and his fantastic desire to amaze and to bewilder but the resemblance is possibly only a chance one  in fact mr pater’s young hero is the precursor of the aufklärung of the last century the german precursor of herder and lessing and goethe himself and finds the forms of art ready to his hand without any national spirit to fill them or make them vital and responsive  he too dies trampled to death by the soldiers of the country he so much admired on the night of his marriage with a peasant girl the very failure of his life lending him a certain melancholy grace and dramatic interest  on the whole then this is a singularly attractive book  mr pater is an intellectual impressionist  he does not weary us with any definite doctrine or seek to suit life to any formal creed  he is always looking for exquisite moments and when he has found them he analyses them with delicate and delightful art and then passes on often to the opposite pole of thought or feeling knowing that every mood has its own quality and charm and is justified by its mere existence  he has taken the sensationalism of greek philosophy and made it a new method of art criticism  as for his style it is curiously ascetic  now and then we come across phrases with a strange sensuousness of expression as when he tells us how denys l’auxerrois on his return from a long journey ‘ate flesh for the first time tearing the hot red morsels with his delicate fingers in a kind of wild greed’ but such passages are rare  asceticism is the keynote of mr pater’s prose at times it is almost too severe in its selfcontrol and makes us long for a little more freedom  for indeed the danger of such prose as his is that it is apt to become somewhat laborious  here and there one is tempted to say of mr pater that he is ‘a seeker after something in language that is there in no satisfying measure or not at all’  the continual preoccupation with phrase and epithet has its drawbacks as well as its virtues  and yet when all is said what wonderful prose it is with its subtle preferences its fastidious purity its rejection of what is common or ordinary  mr pater has the true spirit of selection the true art of omission  if he be not among the greatest prose writers of our literature he is at least our greatest artist in prose and though it may be admitted that the best style is that which seems an unconscious result rather than a conscious aim still in these latter days when violent rhetoric does duty for eloquence and vulgarity usurps the name of nature we should be grateful for a style that deliberately aims at perfection of form that seeks to produce its effect by artistic means and sets before itself an ideal of grave and chastened beauty  imaginary portraits  by walter pater ma fellow of brasenose college oxford  macmillan and co     a german princess woman’s world november 1887   the princess christian’s translation of the memoirs of wilhelmine margravine of baireuth is a most fascinating and delightful book  the margravine and her brother frederick the great were as the princess herself points out in an admirably written introduction ‘among the first of those questioning minds that strove after spiritual freedom’ in the last century  ‘they had studied’ says the princess ‘the english philosophers newton locke and shaftesbury and were roused to enthusiasm by the writings of voltaire and rousseau  their whole lives bore the impress of the influence of french thought on the burning questions of the day  in the eighteenth century began that great struggle of philosophy against tyranny and wornout abuses which culminated in the french revolution  the noblest minds were engaged in the struggle and like most reformers they pushed their conclusions to extremes and too often lost sight of the need of a due proportion in things  the margravine’s influence on the intellectual development of her country is untold  she formed at baireuth a centre of culture and learning which had before been undreamt of in germany’  the historical value of these memoirs is of course well known carlyle speaks of them as being ‘by far the best authority’ on the early life of frederick the great  but considered merely as the autobiography of a clever and charming woman they are no less interesting and even those who care nothing for eighteenthcentury politics and look upon history itself as an unattractive form of fiction cannot fail to be fascinated by the margravine’s wit vivacity and humour by her keen powers of observation and by her brilliant and assertive egotism  not that her life was by any means a happy one  her father to quote the princess christian ‘ruled his family with the same harsh despotism with which he ruled his country taking pleasure in making his power felt by all in the most galling manner’ and the margravine and her brother ‘had much to suffer not only from his ungovernable temper but also from the real privations to which they were subjected’  indeed the picture the margravine gives of the king is quite extraordinary  ‘he despised all learning’ she writes ‘and wished me to occupy myself with nothing but needlework and household duties or details  had he found me writing or reading he would probably have whipped me’  he ‘considered music a capital offence and maintained that every one should devote himself to one object men to the military service and women to their household duties  science and the arts he counted among the “seven deadly sins”’ sometimes he took to religion ‘and then’ says the margravine ‘we lived like trappists to the great grief of my brother and myself  every afternoon the king preached a sermon to which we had to listen as attentively as if it proceeded from an apostle  my brother and i were often seized with such an intense sense of the ridiculous that we burst out laughing upon which an apostolic curse was poured out on our heads which we had to accept with a show of humility and penitence’  economy and soldiers were his only topics of conversation his chief social amusement was to make his guests intoxicated and as for his temper the accounts the margravine gives of it would be almost incredible if they were not amply corroborated from other sources  suetonius has written of the strange madness that comes on kings but even in his melodramatic chronicles there is hardly anything that rivals what the margravine has to tell us  here is one of her pictures of family life at a royal court in the last century and it is not by any means the worst scene she describes      on one occasion when his temper was more than usually bad he told     the queen that he had received letters from anspach in which the     margrave announced his arrival at berlin for the beginning of may     he was coming there for the purpose of marrying my sister and one of     his ministers would arrive previously with the betrothal ring  my     father asked my sister whether she were pleased at this prospect and     how she would arrange her household  now my sister had always made a     point of telling him whatever came into her head even the greatest     hometruths and he had never taken her outspokenness amiss  on this     occasion therefore relying on former experience she answered him     as follows ‘when i have a house of my own i shall take care to have     a wellappointed dinnertable better than yours is and if i have     children of my own i shall not plague them as you do yours and     force them to eat things they thoroughly dislike’      ‘what is amiss with my dinnertable’ the king enquired getting very     red in the face      ‘you ask what is the matter with it’ my sister replied ‘there is     not enough on it for us to eat and what there is is cabbage and     carrots which we detest’  her first answer had already angered my     father but now he gave vent to his fury  but instead of punishing     my sister he poured it all on my mother my brother and myself  to     begin with he threw his plate at my brother’s head who would have     been struck had he not got out of the way a second one he threw at     me which i also happily escaped then torrents of abuse followed     these first signs of hostility  he reproached the queen with having     brought up her children so badly  ‘you will curse your mother’ he     said to my brother ‘for having made you such a goodfornothing     creature’    as my brother and i passed near him to leave the     room he hit out at us with his crutch  happily we escaped the blow     for it would certainly have struck us down and we at last escaped     without harm  yet as the princess christian remarks ‘despite the almost cruel treatment wilhelmine received from her father it is noticeable that throughout her memoirs she speaks of him with the greatest affection she makes constant reference to his “good heart”’ and says that his faults ‘were more those of temper than of nature’  nor could all the misery and wretchedness of her home life dull the brightness of her intellect  what would have made others morbid made her satirical instead of weeping over her own personal tragedies she laughs at the general comedy of life  here for instance is her description of peter the great and his wife who arrived at berlin in 1718      the czarina was small broad and brownlooking without the     slightest dignity or appearance  you had only to look at her to     detect her low origin  she might have passed for a german actress     she had decked herself out in such a manner  her dress had been     bought secondhand and was trimmed with some dirty looking silver     embroidery the bodice was trimmed with precious stones arranged in     such a manner as to represent the double eagle  she wore a dozen     orders and round the bottom of her dress hung quantities of relics     and pictures of saints which rattled when she walked and reminded     one of a smartly harnessed mule  the orders too made a great noise     knocking against each other      the czar on the other hand was tall and well grown with a handsome     face but his expression was coarse and impressed one with fear  he     wore a simple sailor’s dress  his wife who spoke german very badly     called her court jester to her aid and spoke russian with her  this     poor creature was a princess gallizin who had been obliged to     undertake this sorry office to save her life as she had been mixed     up in a conspiracy against the czar and had twice been flogged with     the knout                                              the following day the czar visited all the sights of berlin     amongst others the very curious collection of coins and antiques     amongst these last named was a statue representing a heathen god     it was anything but attractive but was the most valuable in the     collection  the czar admired it very much and insisted on the     czarina kissing it  on her refusing he said to her in bad german     that she should lose her head if she did not at once obey him  being     terrified at the czar’s anger she immediately complied with his     orders without the least hesitation  the czar asked the king to give     him this and other statues a request which he could not refuse  the     same thing happened about a cupboard inlaid with amber  it was the     only one of its kind and had cost king frederick i an enormous sum     and the consternation was general on its having to be sent to     petersburg      this barbarous court happily left after two days  the queen rushed     at once to monbijou which she found in a state resembling that of     the fall of jerusalem  i never saw such a sight  everything was     destroyed so that the queen was obliged to rebuild the whole house  nor are the margravine’s descriptions of her reception as a bride in the principality of baireuth less amusing  hof was the first town she came to and a deputation of nobles was waiting there to welcome her  this is her account of them      their faces would have frightened little children and to add to     their beauty they had arranged their hair to resemble the wigs that     were then in fashion  their dresses clearly denoted the antiquity of     their families as they were composed of heirlooms and were cut     accordingly so that most of them did not fit  in spite of their     costumes being the ‘court dresses’ the gold and silver trimmings     were so black that you had a difficulty in making out of what they     were made  the manners of these nobles suited their faces and their     clothes  they might have passed for peasants  i could scarcely     restrain my laughter when i first beheld these strange figures  i     spoke to each in turn but none of them understood what i said and     their replies sounded to me like hebrew because the dialect of the     empire is quite different from that spoken in brandenburg      the clergy also presented themselves  these were totally different     creatures  round their necks they wore great ruffs which resembled     washing baskets  they spoke very slowly so that i might be able to     understand them better  they said the most foolish things and it     was only with much difficulty that i was able to prevent myself from     laughing  at last i got rid of all these people and we sat down to     dinner  i tried my best to converse with those at table but it was     useless  at last i touched on agricultural topics and then they     began to thaw  i was at once informed of all their different     farmsteads and herds of cattle  an almost interesting discussion     took place as to whether the oxen in the upper part of the country     were fatter than those in the lowlands                                              i was told that as the next day was sunday i must spend it at hof     and listen to a sermon  never before had i heard such a sermon  the     clergyman began by giving us an account of all the marriages that had     taken place from adam’s time to that of noah  we were spared no     detail so that the gentlemen all laughed and the poor ladies     blushed  the dinner went off as on the previous day  in the     afternoon all the ladies came to pay me their respects  gracious     heavens  what ladies too  they were all as ugly as the gentlemen     and their headdresses were so curious that swallows might have built     their nests in them  as for baireuth itself and its petty court the picture she gives of it is exceedingly curious  her fatherinlaw the reigning margrave was a narrowminded mediocrity whose conversation ‘resembled that of a sermon read aloud for the purpose of sending the listener to sleep’ and he had only two topics telemachus and amelot de la houssaye’s roman history the ministers from baron von stein who always said ‘yes’ to everything to baron von voit who always said ‘no’ were not by any means an intellectual set of men  ‘their chief amusement’ says the margravine ‘was drinking from morning till night’ and horses and cattle were all they talked about  the palace itself was shabby decayed and dirty  ‘i was like a lamb among wolves’ cries the poor margravine ‘i was settled in a strange country at a court which more resembled a peasant’s farm surrounded by coarse bad dangerous and tiresome people’  yet her esprit never deserted her  she is always clever witty and entertaining  her stories about the endless squabbles over precedence are extremely amusing  the society of her day cared very little for good manners knew indeed very little about them but all questions of etiquette were of vital importance and the margravine herself though she saw the shallowness of the whole system was far too proud not to assert her rights when circumstances demanded it as the description she gives of her visit to the empress of germany shows very clearly  when this meeting was first proposed the margravine declined positively to entertain the idea  ‘there was no precedent’ she writes ‘of a king’s daughter and the empress having met and i did not know to what rights i ought to lay claim’  finally however she is induced to consent but she lays down three conditions for her reception      i desired first of all that the empress’s court should receive me at     the foot of the stairs secondly that she should meet me at the door     of her bedroom and thirdly that she should offer me an armchair to     sit on                                              they disputed all day over the conditions i had made  the two first     were granted me but all that could be obtained with respect to the     third was that the empress would use quite a small armchair whilst     she gave me a chair      next day i saw this royal personage  i own that had i been in her     place i would have made all the rules of etiquette and ceremony the     excuse for not being obliged to appear  the empress was small and     stout round as a ball very ugly and without dignity or manner     her mind corresponded to her body  she was terribly bigoted and     spent her whole day praying  the old and ugly are generally the     almighty’s portion  she received me trembling all over and was so     upset that she could not say a word      after some silence i began the conversation in french  she answered     me in her austrian dialect that she could not speak in that language     and begged i would speak in german  the conversation did not last     long for the austrian and low saxon tongues are so different from     each other that to those acquainted with only one the other is     unintelligible  this is what happened to us  a third person would     have laughed at our misunderstandings for we caught only a word here     and there and had to guess the rest  the poor empress was such a     slave to etiquette that she would have thought it high treason had     she spoken to me in a foreign language though she understood french     quite well  many other extracts might be given from this delightful book but from the few that have been selected some idea can be formed of the vivacity and picturesqueness of the margravine’s style  as for her character it is very well summed up by the princess christian who while admitting that she often appears almost heartless and inconsiderate yet claims that ‘taken as a whole she stands out in marked prominence among the most gifted women of the eighteenth century not only by her mental powers but by her goodness of heart her selfsacrificing devotion and true friendship’  an interesting sequel to her memoirs would be her correspondence with voltaire and it is to be hoped that we may shortly see a translation of these letters from the same accomplished pen to which we owe the present volume 63  memoirs of wilhelmine margravine of baireuth  translated and edited by her royal highness princess christian of schleswigholstein princess of great britain and ireland  david stott     a village tragedy   one of the most powerful and pathetic novels that has recently appeared is a village tragedy by margaret l woods  to find any parallel to this lurid little story one must go to dostoieffski or to guy de maupassant  not that mrs woods can be said to have taken either of these two great masters of fiction as her model but there is something in her work that recalls their method she has not a little of their fierce intensity their terrible concentration their passionless yet poignant objectivity like them she seems to allow life to suggest its own mode of presentation and like them she recognizes that a frank acceptance of the facts of life is the true basis of all modern imitative art  the scene of mrs woods’s story lies in one of the villages near oxford the characters are very few in number and the plot is extremely simple  it is a romance of modern arcadia—a tale of the love of a farmlabourer for a girl who though slightly above him in social station and education is yet herself also a servant on a farm  true arcadians they are both of them and their ignorance and isolation serve only to intensify the tragedy that gives the story its title  it is the fashion nowadays to label literature so no doubt mrs woods’s novel will be spoken of as ‘realistic’  its realism however is the realism of the artist not of the reporter its tact of treatment subtlety of perception and fine distinction of style make it rather a poem than a procèsverbal and though it lays bare to us the mere misery of life it suggests something of life’s mystery also  very delicate too is the handling of external nature  there are no formal guidebook descriptions of scenery nor anything of what byron petulantly called ‘twaddling about trees’ but we seem to breathe the atmosphere of the country to catch the exquisite scent of the beanfields so familiar to all who have ever wandered through the oxfordshire lanes in june to hear the birds singing in the thicket and the sheepbells tinkling from the hill  characterization that enemy of literary form is such an essential part of the method of the modern writer of fiction that nature has almost become to the novelist what light and shade are to the painter—the one permanent element of style and if the power of a village tragedy be due to its portrayal of human life no small portion of its charm comes from its theocritean setting  a village tragedy  by margaret l woods  bentley and son     mr morris’s completion of the odyssey pall mall gazette november 24 1887   mr morris’s second volume brings the great romantic epic of greek literature to its perfect conclusion and although there can never be an ultimate translation of either iliad or odyssey as each successive age is sure to find pleasure in rendering the two poems in its own manner and according to its own canons of taste still it is not too much to say that mr morris’s version will always be a true classic amongst our classical translations  it is not of course flawless  in our notice of the first volume we ventured to say that mr morris was sometimes far more norse than greek nor does the volume that now lies before us make us alter that opinion  the particular metre also selected by mr morris although admirably adapted to express ‘the strongwinged music of homer’ as far as its flow and freedom are concerned misses something of its dignity and calm  here it must be admitted we feel a distinct loss for there is in homer not a little of milton’s lofty manner and if swiftness be an essential of the greek hexameter stateliness is one of its distinguishing qualities in homer’s hands  this defect however if we must call it a defect seems almost unavoidable as for certain metrical reasons a majestic movement in english verse is necessarily a slow movement and after all that can be said is said how really admirable is this whole translation  if we set aside its noble qualities as a poem and look on it purely from the scholar’s point of view how straightforward it is how honest and direct  its fidelity to the original is far beyond that of any other versetranslation in our literature and yet it is not the fidelity of a pedant to his text but rather the fine loyalty of poet to poet  when mr morris’s first volume appeared many of the critics complained that his occasional use of archaic words and unusual expressions robbed his version of the true homeric simplicity  this however is not a very felicitous criticism for while homer is undoubtedly simple in his clearness and largeness of vision his wonderful power of direct narration his wholesome sanity and the purity and precision of his method simple in language he undoubtedly is not  what he was to his contemporaries we have of course no means of judging but we know that the athenian of the fifth century bc found him in many places difficult to understand and when the creative age was succeeded by the age of criticism and alexandria began to take the place of athens as the centre of culture for the hellenistic world homeric dictionaries and glossaries seem to have been constantly published  indeed athenæus tells us of a wonderful byzantine bluestocking a précieuse from the propontis who wrote a long hexameter poem called mnemosyne full of ingenious commentaries on difficulties in homer and in fact it is evident that as far as the language is concerned such a phrase as ‘homeric simplicity’ would have rather amazed an ancient greek  as for mr morris’s tendency to emphasize the etymological meaning of words a point commented on with somewhat flippant severity in a recent number of macmillan’s magazine here mr morris seems to us to be in complete accord not merely with the spirit of homer but with the spirit of all early poetry  it is quite true that language is apt to degenerate into a system of almost algebraic symbols and the modern cityman who takes a ticket for blackfriars bridge naturally never thinks of the dominican monks who once had their monastery by thamesside and after whom the spot is named  but in earlier times it was not so  men were then keenly conscious of the real meaning of words and early poetry especially is full of this feeling and indeed may be said to owe to it no small portion of its poetic power and charm  these old words then and this old use of words which we find in mr morris’s odyssey can be amply justified upon historical grounds and as for their artistic effect it is quite excellent  pope tried to put homer into the ordinary language of his day with what result we know only too well but mr morris who uses his archaisms with the tact of a true artist and to whom indeed they seem to come absolutely naturally has succeeded in giving to his version by their aid that touch not of ‘quaintness’ for homer is never quaint but of oldworld romance and oldworld beauty which we moderns find so pleasurable and to which the greeks themselves were so keenly sensitive  as for individual passages of special merit mr morris’s translation is no robe of rags sewn with purple patches for critics to sample  its real value lies in the absolute rightness and coherence of the whole in the grand architecture of the swift strong verse and in the fact that the standard is not merely high but everywhere sustained  it is impossible however to resist the temptation of quoting mr morris’s rendering of that famous passage in the twentythird book of the epic in which odysseus eludes the trap laid for him by penelope whose very faith in the certainty of her husband’s return makes her sceptical of his identity when he stands before her an instance by the way of homer’s wonderful psychological knowledge of human nature as it is always the dreamer himself who is most surprised when his dream comes true      thus she spake to prove her husband but odysseus grieved at heart     spake thus unto his bedmate wellskilled in gainful art     ‘o woman thou sayest a word exceeding grievous to me     who hath otherwhere shifted my bedstead full hard for him should it     be     for as deft as he were unless soothly a very god come here     who easily if he willed it might shift it otherwhere     but no mortal man is living how strong soe’er in his youth     who shall lightly hale it elsewhere since a mighty wonder forsooth     is wrought in that fashioned bedstead and i wrought it and i alone     in the close grew a thicket of olive a longleaved tree fullgrown     that flourished and grew goodly as big as a pillar about     so round it i built my brideroom till i did the work right out     with ashlar stone closefitting and i roofed it overhead     and thereto joined doors i made me wellfitting in their stead     then i lopped away the boughs of the longleafed olivetree     and shearing the bole from the root up full well and cunningly     i planed it about with the brass and set the rule thereto     and shaping thereof a bedpost with the wimble i bored it through     so beginning i wrought out the bedstead and finished it utterly     and with gold enwrought it about and with silver and ivory     and stretched on it a thong of oxhide with the purple dye made     bright     thus then the sign i have shown thee nor woman know i aright     if my bed yet bideth steadfast or if to another place     some man hath moved it and smitten the olivebole from its base’  these last twelve books of the odyssey have not the same marvel of romance adventure and colour that we find in the earlier part of the epic  there is nothing in them that we can compare to the exquisite idyll of nausicaa or to the titanic humour of the episode in the cyclops’ cave  penelope has not the glamour of circe and the song of the sirens may sound sweeter than the whizz of the arrows of odysseus as he stands on the threshold of his hall  yet for sheer intensity of passionate power for concentration of intellectual interest and for masterly dramatic construction these latter books are quite unequalled  indeed they show very clearly how it was that as greek art developed the epos passed into the drama  the whole scheme of the argument the return of the hero in disguise his disclosure of himself to his son his terrible vengeance on his enemies and his final recognition by his wife reminds us of the plot of more than one greek play and shows us what the great athenian poet meant when he said that his own dramas were merely scraps from homer’s table  in rendering this splendid poem into english verse mr morris has done our literature a service that can hardly be overestimated and it is pleasant to think that even should the classics be entirely excluded from our educational systems the english boy will still be able to know something of homer’s delightful tales to catch an echo of his grand music and to wander with the wise odysseus round ‘the shores of old romance’  the odyssey of homer  done into english verse by william morris author of the earthly paradise  volume ii  reeves and turner     mrs somerville pall mall gazette november 30 1887   phyllis browne’s life of mrs somerville forms part of a very interesting little series called ‘the world’s workers’—a collection of short biographies catholic enough to include personalities so widely different as turner and richard cobden handel and sir titus salt robert stephenson and florence nightingale and yet possessing a certain definite aim  as a mathematician and a scientist the translator and popularizer of la mécanique céleste and the author of an important book on physical geography mrs somerville is of course well known the scientific bodies of europe covered her with honours her bust stands in the hall of the royal society and one of the women’s colleges at oxford bears her name  yet considered simply in the light of a wife and a mother she is no less admirable and those who consider that stupidity is the proper basis for the domestic virtues and that intellectual women must of necessity be helpless with their hands cannot do better than read phyllis browne’s pleasant little book in which they will find that the greatest womanmathematician of any age was a clever needlewoman a good housekeeper and a most skilful cook  indeed mrs somerville seems to have been quite renowned for her cookery  the discoverers of the northwest passage christened an island ‘somerville’ not as a tribute to the distinguished mathematician but as a recognition of the excellence of some orange marmalade which the distinguished mathematician had prepared with her own hands and presented to the ships before they left england and to the fact that she was able to make currant jelly at a very critical moment she owed the affection of some of her husband’s relatives who up to that time had been rather prejudiced against her on the ground that she was merely an unpractical bluestocking  nor did her scientific knowledge ever warp or dull the tenderness and humanity of her nature  for birds and animals she had always a great love  we hear of her as a little girl watching with eager eyes the swallows as they built their nests in summer or prepared for their flight in the autumn and when snow was on the ground she used to open the windows to let the robins hop in and pick crumbs on the breakfasttable on one occasion she went with her father on a tour in the highlands and found on her return that a pet goldfinch which had been left in the charge of the servants had been neglected by them and had died of starvation  she was almost heartbroken at the event and in writing her recollections seventy years after she mentioned it and said that as she wrote she felt deep pain  her chief pet in her old age was a mountain sparrow which used to perch on her arm and go to sleep there while she was writing  one day the sparrow fell into the waterjug and was drowned to the great grief of its mistress who could hardly be consoled for its loss though later on we hear of a beautiful paroquet taking the place of le moineau d’uranie and becoming mrs somerville’s constant companion  she was also very energetic phyllis browne tells us in trying to get a law passed in the italian parliament for the protection of animals and said once with reference to this subject ‘we english cannot boast of humanity so long as our sportsmen find pleasure in shooting down tame pigeons as they fly terrified out of a cage’—a remark with which i entirely agree  mr herbert’s bill for the protection of land birds gave her immense pleasure though to quote her own words she was ‘grieved to find that “the lark which at heaven’s gate sings” is thought unworthy of man’s protection’ and she took a great fancy to a gentleman who on being told of the number of singing birds that is eaten in italy—nightingales goldfinches and robins—exclaimed in horror ‘what robins our household birds  i would as soon eat a child’  indeed she believed to some extent in the immortality of animals on the ground that if animals have no future it would seem as if some were created for uncompensated misery—an idea which does not seem to me to be either extravagant or fantastic though it must be admitted that the optimism on which it is based receives absolutely no support from science  on the whole phyllis browne’s book is very pleasant reading  its only fault is that it is far too short and this is a fault so rare in modern literature that it almost amounts to a distinction  however phyllis browne has managed to crowd into the narrow limits at her disposal a great many interesting anecdotes  the picture she gives of mrs somerville working away at her translation of laplace in the same room with her children is very charming and reminds one of what is told of george sand there is an amusing account of mrs somerville’s visit to the widow of the young pretender the countess of albany who after talking with her for some time exclaimed ‘so you don’t speak italian you must have had a very bad education’  and this story about the waverley novels may possibly be new to some of my readers      a very amusing circumstance in connection with mrs somerville’s     acquaintance with sir walter arose out of the childish     inquisitiveness of woronzow greig mrs somerville’s little boy      during the time mrs somerville was visiting abbotsford the waverley     novels were appearing and were creating a great sensation yet even     scott’s intimate friends did not know that he was the author he     enjoyed keeping the affair a mystery  but little woronzow discovered     what he was about  one day when mrs somerville was talking about a     novel that had just been published woronzow said ‘i knew all these     stories long ago for mr scott writes on the dinnertable when he     has finished he puts the green cloth with the papers in a corner of     the diningroom and when he goes out charlie scott and i read the     stories’  phyllis browne remarks that this incident shows ‘that persons who want to keep a secret ought to be very careful when children are about’ but the story seems to me to be far too charming to require any moral of the kind  bound up in the same volume is a life of miss mary carpenter also written by phyllis browne  miss carpenter does not seem to me to have the charm and fascination of mrs somerville  there is always something about her that is formal limited and precise  when she was about two years old she insisted on being called ‘doctor carpenter’ in the nursery at the age of twelve she is described by a friend as a sedate little girl who always spoke like a book and before she entered on her educational schemes she wrote down a solemn dedication of herself to the service of humanity  however she was one of the practical hardworking saints of the nineteenth century and it is no doubt quite right that the saints should take themselves very seriously  it is only fair also to remember that her work of rescue and reformation was carried on under great difficulties  here for instance is the picture miss cobbe gives us of one of the bristol nightschools      it was a wonderful spectacle to see mary carpenter sitting patiently     before the large school gallery in st james’s back teaching     singing and praying with the wild streetboys in spite of endless     interruptions caused by such proceedings as shooting marbles at any     object behind her whistling stamping fighting shrieking out     ‘amen’ in the middle of a prayer and sometimes rising en masse and     tearing like a troop of bisons in hobnailed shoes down from the     gallery round the great schoolroom and down the stairs and into     the street  these irrepressible outbreaks she bore with infinite     good humour  her own account is somewhat pleasanter and shows that ‘the troop of bisons in hobnailed shoes’ was not always so barbarous      i had taken to my class on the preceding week some specimens of ferns     neatly gummed on white paper    this time i took a piece of     coalshale with impressions of ferns to show them    i told     each to examine the specimen and tell me what he thought it was  w     gave so bright a smile that i saw he knew none of the others could     tell he said they were ferns like what i showed them last week but     he thought they were chiselled on the stone  their surprise and     pleasure were great when i explained the matter to them      the history of joseph they all found a difficulty in realizing that     this had actually occurred  one asked if egypt existed now and if     people lived in it  when i told them that buildings now stood which     had been erected about the time of joseph one said that it was     impossible as they must have fallen down ere this  i showed them     the form of a pyramid and they were satisfied  one asked if all     books were true      the story of macbeth impressed them very much  they knew the name of     shakespeare having seen his name over a publichouse  a boy defined conscience as ‘a thing a gentleman hasn’t got who when a boy finds his purse and gives it back to him doesn’t give the boy sixpence’  another boy was asked after a sunday evening lecture on ‘thankfulness’ what pleasure he enjoyed most in the course of a year  he replied candidly ‘cockfightin’ ma’am there’s a pit up by the “black boy” as is worth anythink in brissel’  there is something a little pathetic in the attempt to civilize the rough streetboy by means of the refining influence of ferns and fossils and it is difficult to help feeling that miss carpenter rather overestimated the value of elementary education  the poor are not to be fed upon facts  even shakespeare and the pyramids are not sufficient nor is there much use in giving them the results of culture unless we also give them those conditions under which culture can be realized  in these cold crowded cities of the north the proper basis for morals using the word in its wide hellenic signification is to be found in architecture not in books  still it would be ungenerous not to recognize that mary carpenter gave to the children of the poor not merely her learning but her love  in early life her biographer tells us she had longed for the happiness of being a wife and a mother but later she became content that her affection could be freely given to all who needed it and the verse in the prophecies ‘i have given thee children whom thou hast not borne’ seemed to her to indicate what was to be her true mission  indeed she rather inclined to bacon’s opinion that unmarried people do the best public work  ‘it is quite striking’ she says in one of her letters ‘to observe how much the useful power and influence of woman has developed of late years  unattached ladies such as widows and unmarried women have quite ample work to do in the world for the good of others to absorb all their powers  wives and mothers have a very noble work given them by god and want no more’  the whole passage is extremely interesting and the phrase ‘unattached ladies’ is quite delightful and reminds one of charles lamb  mrs somerville and mary carpenter  by phyllis browne author of what girls can do etc  cassell and co     aristotle at afternoon tea pall mall gazette december 16 1887   in society says mr mahaffy every civilized man and woman ought to feel it their duty to say something even when there is hardly anything to be said and in order to encourage this delightful art of brilliant chatter he has published a social guide without which no débutante or dandy should ever dream of going out to dine  not that mr mahaffy’s book can be said to be in any sense of the word popular  in discussing this important subject of conversation he has not merely followed the scientific method of aristotle which is perhaps excusable but he has adopted the literary style of aristotle for which no excuse is possible there is also hardly a single anecdote hardly a single illustration and the reader is left to put the professor’s abstract rules into practice without either the examples or the warnings of history to encourage or to dissuade him in his reckless career  still the book can be warmly recommended to all who propose to substitute the vice of verbosity for the stupidity of silence  it fascinates in spite of its form and pleases in spite of its pedantry and is the nearest approach that we know of in modern literature to meeting aristotle at an afternoon tea  as regards physical conditions the only one that is considered by mr mahaffy as being absolutely essential to a good conversationalist is the possession of a musical voice  some learned writers have been of opinion that a slight stammer often gives peculiar zest to conversation but mr mahaffy rejects this view and is extremely severe on every eccentricity from a native brogue to an artificial catchword  with his remarks on the latter point the meaningless repetition of phrases we entirely agree nothing can be more irritating than the scientific person who is always saying ‘exactly so’ or the commonplace person who ends every sentence with ‘don’t you know’ or the pseudoartistic person who murmurs ‘charming charming’ on the smallestprovocation  it is however with the mental and moral qualifications for conversation that mr mahaffy specially deals  knowledge he naturally regards as an absolute essential for as he most justly observes ‘an ignorant man is seldom agreeable except as a butt’  upon the other hand strict accuracy should be avoided  ‘even a consummate liar’ says mr mahaffy is a better ingredient in a company than ‘the scrupulously truthful man who weighs every statement questions every fact and corrects every inaccuracy’  the liar at any rate recognizes that recreation not instruction is the aim of conversation and is a far more civilized being than the blockhead who loudly expresses his disbelief in a story which is told simply for the amusement of the company  mr mahaffy however makes an exception in favour of the eminent specialist and tells us that intelligent questions addressed to an astronomer or a pure mathematician will elicit many curious facts which will pleasantly beguile the time  here in the interest of society we feel bound to enter a formal protest  nobody even in the provinces should ever be allowed to ask an intelligent question about pure mathematics across a dinnertable  a question of this kind is quite as bad as inquiring suddenly about the state of a man’s soul a sort of coup which as mr mahaffy remarks elsewhere ‘many pious people have actually thought a decent introduction to a conversation’  as for the moral qualifications of a good talker mr mahaffy following the example of his great master warns us against any disproportionate excess of virtue  modesty for instance may easily become a social vice and to be continually apologizing for one’s ignorance or stupidity is a grave injury to conversation for ‘what we want to learn from each member is his free opinion on the subject in hand not his own estimate of the value of that opinion’  simplicity too is not without its dangers  the enfant terrible with his shameless love of truth the raw countrybred girl who always says what she means and the plain blunt man who makes a point of speaking his mind on every possible occasion without ever considering whether he has a mind at all are the fatal examples of what simplicity leads to  shyness may be a form of vanity and reserve a development of pride and as for sympathy what can be more detestable than the man or woman who insists on agreeing with everybody and so makes ‘a discussion which implies differences in opinion’ absolutely impossible  even the unselfish listener is apt to become a bore  ‘these silent people’ says mr mahaffy ‘not only take all they can get in society for nothing but they take it without the smallest gratitude and have the audacity afterwards to censure those who have laboured for their amusement’  tact which is an exquisite sense of the symmetry of things is according to mr mahaffy the highest and best of all the moral conditions for conversation  the man of tact he most wisely remarks ‘will instinctively avoid jokes about blue beard’ in the company of a woman who is a man’s third wife he will never be guilty of talking like a book but will rather avoid too careful an attention to grammar and the rounding of periods he will cultivate the art of graceful interruption so as to prevent a subject being worn threadbare by the aged or the inexperienced and should he be desirous of telling a story he will look round and consider each member of the party and if there be a single stranger present will forgo the pleasure of anecdotage rather than make the social mistake of hurting even one of the guests as for prepared or premeditated art mr mahaffy has a great contempt for it and tells us of a certain college don let us hope not at oxford or cambridge who always carried a jestbook in his pocket and had to refer to it when he wished to make a repartee  great wits too are often very cruel and great humorists often very vulgar so it will be better to try and ‘make good conversation without any large help from these brilliant but dangerous gifts’  in a têteàtête one should talk about persons and in general society about things  the state of the weather is always an excusable exordium but it is convenient to have a paradox or heresy on the subject always ready so as to direct the conversation into other channels  really domestic people are almost invariably bad talkers as their very virtues in home life have dulled their interest in outer things  the very best mothers will insist on chattering of their babies and prattling about infant education  in fact most women do not take sufficient interest in politics just as most men are deficient in general reading  still anybody can be made to talk except the very obstinate and even a commercial traveller may be drawn out and become quite interesting  as for society small talk it is impossible mr mahaffy tells us for any sound theory of conversation to depreciate gossip ‘which is perhaps the main factor in agreeable talk throughout society’  the retailing of small personal points about great people always gives pleasure and if one is not fortunate enough to be an arctic traveller or an escaped nihilist the best thing one can do is to relate some anecdote of ‘prince bismarck or king victor emmanuel or mr gladstone’  in the case of meeting a genius and a duke at dinner the good talker will try to raise himself to the level of the former and to bring the latter down to his own level  to succeed among one’s social superiors one must have no hesitation in contradicting them  indeed one should make bold criticisms and introduce a bright and free tone into a society whose grandeur and extreme respectability make it mr mahaffy remarks as pathetically as inaccurately ‘perhaps somewhat dull’  the best conversationalists are those whose ancestors have been bilingual like the french and irish but the art of conversation is really within the reach of almost every one except those who are morbidly truthful or whose high moral worth requires to be sustained by a permanent gravity of demeanour and a general dullness of mind  these are the broad principles contained in mr mahaffy’s clever little book and many of them will no doubt commend themselves to our readers the maxim ‘if you find the company dull blame yourself’ seems to us somewhat optimistic and we have no sympathy at all with the professional storyteller who is really a great bore at a dinnertable but mr mahaffy is quite right in insisting that no bright social intercourse is possible without equality and it is no objection to his book to say that it will not teach people how to talk cleverly  it is not logic that makes men reasonable nor the science of ethics that makes men good but it is always useful to analyse to formularize and to investigate  the only thing to be regretted in the volume is the arid and jejune character of the style  if mr mahaffy would only write as he talks his book would be much pleasanter reading  the principles of the art of conversation a social essay  by j p mahaffy  macmillan and co     early christian art in ireland pall mall gazette december 17 1887   the want of a good series of popular handbooks on irish art has long been felt the works of sir william wilde petrie and others being somewhat too elaborate for the ordinary student so we are glad to notice the appearance under the auspicesof the committee of council on education of miss margaret stokes’s useful little volume on the early christian art of her country  there is of course nothing particularly original in miss stokes’s book nor can she be said to be a very attractive or pleasing writer but it is unfair to look for originality in primers and the charm of the illustrations fully atones for the somewhat heavy and pedantic character of the style  this early christian art of ireland is full of interest to the artist the archæologist and the historian  in its rudest forms such as the little iron handbell the plain stone chalice and the rough wooden staff it brings us back to the simplicity of the primitive christian church while to the period of its highest development we owe the great masterpieces of celtic metalwork  the stone chalice is now replaced by the chalice of silver and gold the iron bell has its jewelstudded shrine and the rough staff its gorgeous casing rich caskets and splendid bindings preserve the holy books of the saints and instead of the rudely carved symbol of the early missionaries we have such beautiful works of art as the processional cross of cong abbey beautiful this cross certainly is with its delicate intricacy of ornamentation its grace of proportion and its marvel of mere workmanship nor is there any doubt about its history  from the inscriptions on it which are corroborated by the annals of innisfallen and the book of clonmacnoise we learn that it was made for king turlough o’connor by a native artist under the superintendence of bishop o’duffy its primary object being to enshrine a portion of the true cross that was sent to the king in 1123  brought to cong some years afterwards probably by the archbishop who died there in 1150 it was concealed at the time of the reformation but at the beginning of the present century was still in the possession of the last abbot and at his death it was purchased by professor maccullagh and presented by him to the museum of the royal irish academy  this wonderful work is alone well worth a visit to dublin but not less lovely is the chalice of ardagh a twohandled silver cup absolutely classical in its perfect purity of form and decorated with gold and amber and crystal and with varieties of cloisonné and champlevé enamel  there is no mention of this cup or of the socalled tara brooch in ancient irish history  all that we know of them is that they were found accidentally the former by a boy who was digging potatoes near the old rath of ardagh the latter by a poor child who picked it up near the seashore  they both however belong probably to the tenth century  of all these works as well as of the bell shrines bookcovers sculptured crosses and illuminated designs in manuscripts excellent pictures are given in miss stokes’s handbook  the extremely interesting fiachal phadrig or shrine of st patrick’s tooth might have been figured and noted as an interesting example of the survival of ornament and one of the old miniatures of the scribe or evangelist writing would have given an additional interest to the chapter on irish mss  on the whole however the book is wonderfully well illustrated and the ordinary art student will be able to get some useful suggestions from it indeed miss stokes echoing the aspirations of many of the great irish archæologists looks forward to the revival of a native irish school in architecture sculpture metalwork and painting  such an aspiration is of course very laudable but there is always a danger of these revivals being merely artificial reproductions and it may be questioned whether the peculiar forms of irish ornamentation could be made at all expressive of the modern spirit  a recent writer on house decoration has gravely suggested that the british householder should take his meals in a celtic diningroom adorned with a dado of ogham inscriptions and such wicked proposals may serve as a warning to all who fancy that the reproduction of a form necessarily implies a revival of the spirit that gave the form life and meaning and who fail to recognize the difference between art and anachronisms  miss stokes’s proposal for an arkshaped church in which the mural painter is to repeat the arcades and ‘follow the architectural compositions of the grand pages of the eusebian canons in the book of kells’ has of course nothing grotesque about it but it is not probable that the artistic genius of the irish people will even when ‘the land has rest’ find in such interesting imitations its healthiest or best expression  still there are certain elements of beauty in ancient irish art that the modern artist would do well to study  the value of the intricate illuminations in the book of kells as far as their adaptability to modern designs and modern material goes has been very much overrated but in the ancient irish torques brooches pins clasps and the like the modern goldsmith will find a rich and comparatively speaking an untouched field and now that the celtic spirit has become the leaven of our politics there is no reason why it should not contribute something to our decorative art  this result however will not be obtained by a patriotic misuse of old designs and even the most enthusiastic home ruler must not be allowed to decorate his diningroom with a dado of oghams  early christian art in ireland  by margaret stokes  published for the committee of council on education by chapman and hall     madame ristori woman’s world january 1888   madame ristori’s etudes et souvenirs is one of the most delightful books on the stage that has appeared since lady martin’s charming volume on the shakespearian heroines  it is often said that actors leave nothing behind them but a barren name and a withered wreath that they subsist simply upon the applause of the moment that they are ultimately doomed to the oblivion of old playbills and that their art in a word dies with them and shares their own mortality  ‘chippendale the cabinetmaker’ says the clever author of obiter dicta ‘is more potent than garrick the actor  the vivacity of the latter no longer charms save in boswell the chairs of the former still render rest impossible in a hundred homes’  this view however seems to me to be exaggerated it rests on the assumption that acting is simply a mimetic art and takes no account of its imaginative and intellectual basis  it is quite true of course that the personality of the player passes away and with it that pleasuregiving power by virtue of which the arts exist  yet the artistic method of a great actor survives  it lives on in tradition and becomes part of the science of a school  it has all the intellectual life of a principle  in england at the present moment the influence of garrick on our actors is far stronger than that of reynolds on our painters of portraits and if we turn to france it is easy to discern the tradition of talma but where is the tradition of david  madame ristori’s memoirs then have not merely the charm that always attaches to the autobiography of a brilliant and beautiful woman but have also a definite and distinct artistic value  her analysis of the character of lady macbeth for instance is full of psychological interest and shows us that the subtleties of shakespearian criticism are not necessarily confined to those who have views on weak endings and rhyming tags but may also be suggested by the art of acting itself  the author of obiter dicta seeks to deny to actors all critical insight and all literary appreciation  the actor he tells us is art’s slave not her child and lives entirely outside literature ‘with its words for ever on his lips and none of its truths engraven on his heart’  but this seems to me to be a harsh and reckless generalization  indeed so far from agreeing with it i would be inclined to say that the mere artistic process of acting the translation of literature back again into life and the presentation of thought under the conditions of action is in itself a critical method of a very high order nor do i think that a study of the careers of our great english actors will really sustain the charge of want of literary appreciation  it may be true that actors pass too quickly away from the form in order to get at the feeling that gives the form beauty and colour and that where the literary critic studies the language the actor looks simply for the life and yet how well the great actors have appreciated that marvellous music of words which in shakespeare at any rate is so vital an element of poetic power if indeed it be not equally so in the case of all who have any claim to be regarded as true poets  ‘the sensual life of verse’ says keats in a dramatic criticism published in the champion ‘springs warm from the lips of kean and to one learned in shakespearian hieroglyphics learned in the spiritual portion of those lines to which kean adds a sensual grandeur his tongue must seem to have robbed the hybla bees and left them honeyless’  this particular feeling of which keats speaks is familiar to all who have heard salvini sarah bernhardt ristori or any of the great artists of our day and it is a feeling that one cannot i think gain merely by reading the passage to oneself  for my own part i must confess that it was not until i heard sarah bernhardt in phèdre that i absolutely realized the sweetness of the music of racine  as for mr birrell’s statement that actors have the words of literature for ever on their lips but none of its truths engraved on their hearts all that one can say is that if it be true it is a defect which actors share with the majority of literary critics  the account madame ristori gives of her own struggles voyages and adventures is very pleasant reading indeed  the child of poor actors she made her first appearance when she was three months old being brought on in a hamper as a new year’s gift to a selfish old gentleman who would not forgive his daughter for having married for love  as however she began to cry long before the hamper was opened the comedy became a farce to the immense amusement of the public  she next appeared in a mediæval melodrama being then three years of age and was so terrified at the machinations of the villain that she ran away at the most critical moment  however her stagefright seems to have disappeared and we find her playing silvio pellico’s francesca da rimini at fifteen and at eighteen making her début as marie stuart at this time the naturalism of the french method was gradually displacing the artificial elocution and academic poses of the italian school of acting  madame ristori seems to have tried to combine simplicity with style and the passion of nature with the selfrestraint of the artist ‘j’ai voulu fondre les deux manières’ she tells us ‘car je sentais que toutes choses étant susceptibles de progrès l’art dramatique aussi était appelé à subir des transformations’  the natural development however of the italian drama was almost arrested by the ridiculous censorship of plays then existing in each town under austrian or papal rule  the slightest allusion to the sentiment of nationality or the spirit of freedom was prohibited  even the word patria was regarded as treasonable and madame ristori tells us an amusing story of the indignation of a censor who was asked to license a play in which a dumb man returns home after an absence of many years and on his entrance upon the stage makes gestures expressive of his joy in seeing his native land once more  ‘gestures of this kind’ said the censor ‘are obviously of a very revolutionary tendency and cannot possibly be allowed  the only gestures that i could think of permitting would be gestures expressive of a dumb man’s delight in scenery generally’  the stage directions were accordingly altered and the word ‘landscape’ substituted for ‘native land’  another censor was extremely severe on an unfortunate poet who had used the expression ‘the beautiful italian sky’ and explained to him that ‘the beautiful lombardovenetian sky’ was the proper official expression to use  poor gregory in romeo and juliet had to be rechristened because gregory is a name dear to the popes and the      here i have a pilot’s thumb     wrecked as homeward he did come  of the first witch in macbeth was ruthlessly struck out as containing an obvious allusion to the steersman of st peter’s bark  finally bored and bothered by the political and theological dogberrys of the day with their inane prejudices their solemn stupidity and their entire ignorance of the conditions necessary for the growth of sane and healthy art madame ristori made up her mind to leave the stage  she however was extremely anxious to appear once before a parisian audience paris being at that time the centre of dramatic activity and after some consideration left italy for france in the year 1855  there she seems to have been a great success particularly in the part of myrrha classical without being cold artistic without being academic she brought to the interpretation of the character of alfieri’s great heroine the colourelement of passion the formelement of style  jules janin was loud in his praises the emperor begged ristori to join the troupe of the comédie française and rachel with the strange narrow jealousy of her nature trembled for her laurels  myrrha was followed by marie stuart and marie stuart by medea  in the latter part madame ristori excited the greatest enthusiasm  ary scheffer designed her costumes for her and the niobe that stands in the uffizi gallery at florence suggested to madame ristori her famous pose in the scene with the children  she would not consent however to remain in france and we find her subsequently playing in almost every country in the world from egypt to mexico from denmark to honolulu  her representations of classical plays seem to have been always immensely admired  when she played at athens the king offered to arrange for a performance in the beautiful old theatre of dionysos and during her tour in portugal she produced medea before the university of coimbra  her description of the latter engagement is extremely interesting  on her arrival at the university she was received by the entire body of the undergraduates who still wear a costume almost mediæval in character  some of them came on the stage in the course of the play as the handmaidens of creusa hiding their black beards beneath heavy veils and as soon as they had finished their parts they took their places gravely among the audience to madame ristori’s horror still in their greek dress but with their veils thrown back and smoking long cigars  ‘ce n’est pas la première fois’ she says ‘que j’ai dû empêcher par un effort de volonté la tragédie de se terminer en farce’  very interesting also is her account of the production of montanelli’s camma and she tells an amusing story of the arrest of the author by the french police on the charge of murder in consequence of a telegram she sent to him in which the words ‘body of the victim’ occurred  indeed the whole book is full of cleverly written stories and admirable criticisms on dramatic art  i have quoted from the french version which happens to be the one that lies before me but whether in french or italian the book is one of the most fascinating autobiographies that has appeared for some time even in an age like ours when literary egotism has been brought to such an exquisite pitch of perfection  etudes et souvenirs  by madame ristori  paul ollendorff     english poetesses queen december 8 1888   england has given to the world one great poetess elizabeth barrett browning  by her side mr swinburne would place miss christina rossetti whose new year hymn he describes as so much the noblest of sacred poems in our language that there is none which comes near it enough to stand second  ‘it is a hymn’ he tells us ‘touched as with the fire and bathed as in the light of sunbeams tuned as to chords and cadences of refluent seamusic beyond reach of harp and organ large echoes of the serene and sonorous tides of heaven’  much as i admire miss rossetti’s work her subtle choice of words her rich imagery her artistic naïveté wherein curious notes of strangeness and simplicity are fantastically blended together i cannot but think that mr swinburne has with noble and natural loyalty placed her on too lofty a pedestal  to me she is simply a very delightful artist in poetry  this is indeed something so rare that when we meet it we cannot fail to love it but it is not everything  beyond it and above it are higher and more sunlit heights of song a larger vision and an ampler air a music at once more passionate and more profound a creative energy that is born of the spirit a winged rapture that is born of the soul a force and fervour of mere utterance that has all the wonder of the prophet and not a little of the consecration of the priest  mrs browning is unapproachable by any woman who has ever touched lyre or blown through reed since the days of the great Æolian poetess  but sappho who to the antique world was a pillar of flame is to us but a pillar of shadow  of her poems burnt with other most precious work by byzantine emperor and by roman pope only a few fragments remain possibly they lie mouldering in the scented darkness of an egyptian tomb clasped in the withered hand of some longdead lover  some greek monk at athos may even now be poring over an ancient manuscript whose crabbed characters conceal lyric or ode by her whom the greeks spoke of as ‘the poetess’ just as they termed homer ‘the poet’ who was to them the tenth muse the flower of the graces the child of erôs and the pride of hellas—sappho with the sweet voice the bright beautiful eyes the dark hyacinth coloured hair  but practically the work of the marvellous singer of lesbos is entirely lost to us  we have a few roseleaves out of her garden that is all  literature nowadays survives marble and bronze but in the old days in spite of the roman poet’s noble boast it was not so  the fragile clay vases of the greeks still keep for us pictures of sappho delicately painted in black and red and white but of her song we have only the echo of an echo  of all the women of history mrs browning is the only one that we could name in any possible or remote conjunction with sappho  sappho was undoubtedly a far more flawless and perfect artist  she stirred the whole antique world more than mrs browning ever stirred our modern age  never had love such a singer  even in the few lines that remain to us the passion seems to scorch and burn  but as unjust time who has crowned her with the barren laurels of fame has twined with them the dull poppies of oblivion let us turn from the mere memory of a poetess to one whose song still remains to us as an imperishable glory to our literature to her who heard the cry of the children from dark mine and crowded factory and made england weep over its little ones who in the feigned sonnets from the portuguese sang of the spiritual mystery of love and of the intellectual gifts that love brings to the soul who had faith in all that is worthy and enthusiasm for all that is great and pity for all that suffers who wrote the vision of poets and casa guidi windows and aurora leigh  as one to whom i owe my love of poetry no less than my love of country said of her               still on our ears     the clear ‘excelsior’ from a woman’s lip     rings out across the apennines although     the woman’s brow lies pale and cold in death     with all the mighty marble dead in florence     for while great songs can stir the hearts of men     spreading their full vibrations through the world     in everwidening circles till they reach     the throne of god and song becomes a prayer     and prayer brings down the liberating strength     that kindles nations to heroic deeds     she lives—the greatsouled poetess who saw     from casa guidi windows freedom dawn     on italy and gave the glory back     in sunrise hymns to all humanity  she lives indeed and not alone in the heart of shakespeare’s england but in the heart of dante’s italy also  to greek literature she owed her scholarly culture but modern italy created her human passion for liberty  when she crossed the alps she became filled with a new ardour and from that fine eloquent mouth that we can still see in her portraits broke forth such a noble and majestic outburst of lyrical song as had not been heard from woman’s lips for more than two thousand years it is pleasant to think that an english poetess was to a certain extent a real factor in bringing about that unity of italy that was dante’s dream and if florence drove her great singer into exile she at least welcomed within her walls the later singer that england had sent to her  if one were asked the chief qualities of mrs browning’s work one would say as mr swinburne said of byron’s its sincerity and its strength faults it of course possesses  ‘she would rhyme moon to table’ used to be said of her in jest and certainly no more monstrous rhymes are to be found in all literature than some of those we come across in mrs browning’s poems  but her ruggedness was never the result of carelessness  it was deliberate as her letters to mr horne show very clearly  she refused to sandpaper her muse  she disliked facile smoothness and artificial polish  in her very rejection of art she was an artist  she intended to produce a certain effect by certain means and she succeeded and her indifference to complete assonance in rhyme often gives a splendid richness to her verse and brings into it a pleasurable element of surprise  in philosophy she was a platonist in politics an opportunist  she attached herself to no particular party  she loved the people when they were kinglike and kings when they showed themselves to be men  of the real value and motive of poetry she had a most exalted idea  ‘poetry’ she says in the preface of one of her volumes ‘has been as serious a thing to me as life itself and life has been a very serious thing there has been no playing at skittles for me in either  i never mistook pleasure for the final cause of poetry nor leisure for the hour of the poet  i have done my work so far not as mere hand and head work apart from the personal being but as the completest expression of that being to which i could attain’  it certainly is her completest expression and through it she realizes her fullest perfection  ‘the poet’ she says elsewhere ‘is at once richer and poorer than he used to be he wears better broadcloth but speaks no more oracles’  these words give us the keynote to her view of the poet’s mission  he was to utter divine oracles to be at once inspired prophet and holy priest and as such we may i think without exaggeration conceive her  she was a sibyl delivering a message to the world sometimes through stammering lips and once at least with blinded eyes yet always with the true fire and fervour of lofty and unshaken faith always with the great raptures of a spiritual nature the high ardours of an impassioned soul  as we read her best poems we feel that though apollo’s shrine be empty and the bronze tripod overthrown and the vale of delphi desolate still the pythia is not dead  in our own age she has sung for us and this land gave her new birth  indeed mrs browning is the wisest of the sibyls wiser even than that mighty figure whom michael angelo has painted on the roof of the sistine chapel at rome poring over the scroll of mystery and trying to decipher the secrets of fate for she realized that while knowledge is power suffering is part of knowledge  to her influence almost as much as to the higher education of women i would be inclined to attribute the really remarkable awakening of woman’s song that characterizes the latter half of our century in england  no country has ever had so many poetesses at once  indeed when one remembers that the greeks had only nine muses one is sometimes apt to fancy that we have too many  and yet the work done by women in the sphere of poetry is really of a very high standard of excellence  in england we have always been prone to underrate the value of tradition in literature  in our eagerness to find a new voice and a fresh mode of music we have forgotten how beautiful echo may be  we look first for individuality and personality and these are indeed the chief characteristics of the masterpieces of our literature either in prose or verse but deliberate culture and a study of the best models if united to an artistic temperament and a nature susceptible of exquisite impressions may produce much that is admirable much that is worthy of praise  it would be quite impossible to give a complete catalogue of all the women who since mrs browning’s day have tried lute and lyre  mrs pfeiffer mrs hamilton king mrs augusta webster graham tomson miss mary robinson jean ingelow miss may kendall miss nesbit miss may probyn mrs craik mrs meynell miss chapman and many others have done really good work in poetry either in the grave dorian mode of thoughtful and intellectual verse or in the light and graceful forms of old french song or in the romantic manner of antique ballad or in that ‘moment’s monument’ as rossetti called it the intense and concentrated sonnet occasionally one is tempted to wish that the quick artistic faculty that women undoubtedly possess developed itself somewhat more in prose and somewhat less in verse  poetry is for our highest moods when we wish to be with the gods and in our poetry nothing but the very best should satisfy us but prose is for our daily bread and the lack of good prose is one of the chief blots on our culture  french prose even in the hands of the most ordinary writers is always readable but english prose is detestable  we have a few a very few masters such as they are  we have carlyle who should not be imitated and mr pater who through the subtle perfection of his form is inimitable absolutely and mr froude who is useful and matthew arnold who is a model and mr george meredith who is a warning and mr lang who is the divine amateur and mr stevenson who is the humane artist and mr ruskin whose rhythm and colour and fine rhetoric and marvellous music of words are entirely unattainable  but the general prose that one reads in magazines and in newspapers is terribly dull and cumbrous heavy in movement and uncouth or exaggerated in expression  possibly some day our women of letters will apply themselves more definitely to prose  their light touch and exquisite ear and delicate sense of balance and proportion would be of no small service to us  i can fancy women bringing a new manner into our literature  however we have to deal here with women as poetesses and it is interesting to note that though mrs browning’s influence undoubtedly contributed very largely to the development of this new songmovement if i may so term it still there seems to have been never a time during the last three hundred years when the women of this kingdom did not cultivate if not the art at least the habit of writing poetry  who the first english poetess was i cannot say  i believe it was the abbess juliana berners who lived in the fifteenth century but i have no doubt that mr freeman would be able at a moment’s notice to produce some wonderful saxon or norman poetess whose works cannot be read without a glossary and even with its aid are completely unintelligible  for my own part i am content with the abbess juliana who wrote enthusiastically about hawking and after her i would mention anne askew who in prison and on the eve of her fiery martyrdom wrote a ballad that has at any rate a pathetic and historical interest  queen elizabeth’s ‘most sweet and sententious ditty’ on mary stuart is highly praised by puttenham a contemporary critic as an example of ‘exargasia or the gorgeous in literature’ which somehow seems a very suitable epithet for such a great queen’s poems  the term she applies to the unfortunate queen of scots ‘the daughter of debate’ has of course long since passed into literature  the countess of pembroke sir philip sidney’s sister was much admired as a poetess in her day  in 1613 the ‘learned virtuous and truly noble ladie’ elizabeth carew published a tragedie of marian the faire queene of jewry and a few years later the ‘noble ladie diana primrose’ wrote a chain of pearl which is a panegyric on the ‘peerless graces’ of gloriana  mary morpeth the friend and admirer of drummond of hawthornden lady mary wroth to whom ben jonson dedicated the alchemist and the princess elizabeth the sister of charles i should also be mentioned  after the restoration women applied themselves with still greater ardour to the study of literature and the practice of poetry  margaret duchess of newcastle was a true woman of letters and some of her verses are extremely pretty and graceful  mrs aphra behn was the first englishwoman who adopted literature as a regular profession  mrs katharine philips according to mr gosse invented sentimentality  as she was praised by dryden and mourned by cowley let us hope she may be forgiven  keats came across her poems at oxford when he was writing endymion and found in one of them ‘a most delicate fancy of the fletcher kind’ but i fear nobody reads the matchless orinda now  of lady winchelsea’s nocturnal reverie wordsworth said that with the exception of pope’s windsor forest it was the only poem of the period intervening between paradise lost and thomson’s seasons that contained a single new image of external nature  lady rachel russell who may be said to have inaugurated the letterwriting literature of england eliza haywood who is immortalized by the badness of her work and has a niche in the dunciad and the marchioness of wharton whose poems waller said he admired are very remarkable types the finest of them being of course the first named who was a woman of heroic mould and of a most noble dignity of nature  indeed though the english poetesses up to the time of mrs browning cannot be said to have produced any work of absolute genius they are certainly interesting figures fascinating subjects for study  amongst them we find lady mary wortley montague who had all the caprice of cleopatra and whose letters are delightful reading mrs centlivre who wrote one brilliant comedy lady anne barnard whose auld robin gray was described by sir walter scott as ‘worth all the dialogues corydon and phillis have together spoken from the days of theocritus downwards’ and is certainly a very beautiful and touching poem esther vanhomrigh and hester johnson the vanessa and the stella of dean swift’s life mrs thrale the friend of the great lexicographer the worthy mrs barbauld the excellent miss hannah more the industrious joanna baillie the admirable mrs chapone whose ode to solitude always fills me with the wildest passion for society and who will at least be remembered as the patroness of the establishment at which becky sharp was educated miss anna seward who was called ‘the swan of lichfield’ poor l e l whom disraeli described in one of his clever letters to his sister as ‘the personification of brompton—pink satin dress white satin shoes red cheeks snub nose and her hair à la sappho’ mrs ratcliffe who introduced the romantic novel and has consequently much to answer for the beautiful duchess of devonshire of whom gibbon said that she was ‘made for something better than a duchess’ the two wonderful sisters lady dufferin and mrs norton mrs tighe whose psyche keats read with pleasure constantia grierson a marvellous bluestocking in her time mrs hemans pretty charming ‘perdita’ who flirted alternately with poetry and the prince regent played divinely in the winter’s tale was brutally attacked by gifford and has left us a pathetic little poem on a snowdrop and emily brontë whose poems are instinct with tragic power and seem often on the verge of being great  old fashions in literature are not so pleasant as old fashions in dress i like the costume of the age of powder better than the poetry of the age of pope  but if one adopts the historical standpoint—and this is indeed the only standpoint from which we can ever form a fair estimate of work that is not absolutely of the highest order—we cannot fail to see that many of the english poetesses who preceded mrs browning were women of no ordinary talent and that if the majority of them looked upon poetry simply as a department of belles lettres so in most cases did their contemporaries  since mrs browning’s day our woods have become full of singing birds and if i venture to ask them to apply themselves more to prose and less to song it is not that i like poetical prose but that i love the prose of poets     venus or victory pall mall gazette february 24 1888   there are certain problems in archæology that seem to possess a real romantic interest and foremost among these is the question of the socalled venus of melos  who is she this marble mutilated goddess whom gautier loved to whom heine bent his knee  what sculptor wrought her and for what shrine  whose hands walled her up in that rude niche where the melian peasant found her  what symbol of her divinity did she carry was it apple of gold or shield of bronze  where is her city and what was her name among gods and men  the last writer on this fascinating subject is mr stillman who in a most interesting book recently published in america claims that the work of art in question is no seaborn and foamborn aphrodite but the very victory without wings that once stood in the little chapel outside the gates of the acropolis at athens  so long ago as 1826 that is to say six years after the discovery of the statue the venus hypothesis was violently attacked by millingen and from that time to this the battle of the archæologists has never ceased mr stillman who fights of course under millingen’s banner points out that the statue is not of the venus type at all being far too heroic in character to correspond to the greek conception of aphrodite at any period of their artistic development but that it agrees distinctly with certain wellknown statues of victory such as the celebrated ‘victory of brescia’  the latter is in bronze is later and has the wings but the type is unmistakable and though not a reproduction it is certainly a recollection of the melian statue  the representation of victory on the coin of agathocles is also obviously of the melian type and in the museum of naples is a terracotta victory in almost the identical action and drapery  as for dumont d’urville’s statement that when the statue was discovered one hand held an apple and the other a fold of the drapery the latter is obviously a mistake and the whole evidence on the subject is so contradictory that no reliance can be placed on the statement made by the french consul and the french naval officers none of whom seems to have taken the trouble to ascertain whether the arm and hand now in the louvre were really found in the same niche as the statue at all  at any rate these fragments seem to be of extremely inferior workmanship and they are so imperfect that they are quite worthless as data for measure or opinion  so far mr stillman is on old ground  his real artistic discovery is this  in working about the acropolis of athens some years ago he photographed among other sculptures the mutilated victories in the temple of nikè apteros the ‘wingless victory’ the little ionic temple in which stood that statue of victory of which it was said that ‘the athenians made her without wings that she might never leave athens’  looking over the photographs afterwards when the impression of the comparatively diminutive size had passed he was struck with the close resemblance of the type to that of the melian statue  now this resemblance is so striking that it cannot be questioned by any one who has an eye for form  there are the same large heroic proportions the same ampleness of physical development and the same treatment of drapery and there is also that perfect spiritual kinship which to any true antiquarian is one of the most valuable modes of evidence  now it is generally admitted on both sides that the melian statue is probably attic in its origin and belongs certainly to the period between phidias and praxiteles that is to say to the age of scopas if it be not actually the work of scopas himself and as it is to scopas that these basreliefs have been always attributed the similarity of style can on mr stillman’s hypothesis be easily accounted for  as regards the appearance of the statue in melos mr stillman points out that melos belonged to athens as late as she had any greek allegiance and that it is probable that the statue was sent there for concealment on the occasion of some siege or invasion  when this took place mr stillman does not pretend to decide with any degree of certainty but it is evident that it must have been subsequent to the establishment of the roman hegemony as the brickwork of the niche in which the statue was found is clearly roman in character and before the time of pausanias and pliny as neither of these antiquaries mentions the statue  accepting then the statue as that of the victory without wings mr stillman agrees with millingen in supposing that in her left hand she held a bronze shield the lower rim of which rested on the left knee where some marks of the kind are easily recognizable while with her right hand she traced or had just finished tracing the names of the great heroes of athens  valentin’s objection that if this were so the left thigh would incline outwards so as to secure a balance mr stillman meets partly by the analogy of the victory of brescia and partly by the evidence of nature herself for he has had a model photographed in the same position as the statue and holding a shield in the manner he proposes in his restoration  the result is precisely the contrary to that which valentin assumes  of course mr stillman’s solution of the whole matter must not be regarded as an absolutely scientific demonstration  it is simply an induction in which a kind of artistic instinct not communicable or equally valuable to all people has had the greatest part but to this mode of interpretation archæologists as a class have been far too indifferent and it is certain that in the present case it has given us a theory which is most fruitful and suggestive  the little temple of nikè apteros has had as mr stillman reminds us a destiny unique of its kind  like the parthenon it was standing little more than two hundred years ago but during the turkish occupation it was razed and its stones all built into the great bastion which covered the front of the acropolis and blocked up the staircase to the propylæa  it was dug out and restored nearly every stone in its place by two german architects during the reign of otho and it stands again just as pausanias described it on the spot where old Ægeus watched for the return of theseus from crete  in the distance are salamis and Ægina and beyond the purple hills lies marathon  if the melian statue be indeed the victory without wings she had no unworthy shrine  there are some other interesting essays in mr stillman’s book on the wonderful topographical knowledge of ithaca displayed in the odyssey and discussions of this kind are always interesting as long as there is no attempt to represent homer as the ordinary literary man but the article on the melian statue is by far the most important and the most delightful  some people will no doubt regret the possibility of the disappearance of the old name and as venus not as victory will still worship the stately goddess but there are others who will be glad to see in her the image and ideal of that spiritual enthusiasm to which athens owed her liberty and by which alone can liberty be won  on the track of ulysses together with an excursion in quest of the socalled venus of melos  by w j stillman  houghton mifflin and co boston     m caro on george sand pall mall gazette april 14 1888   the biography of a very great man from the pen of a very ladylike writer—this is the best description we can give of m caro’s life of george sand  the late professor of the sorbonne could chatter charmingly about culture and had all the fascinating insincerity of an accomplished phrasemaker being an extremely superior person he had a great contempt for democracy and its doings but he was always popular with the duchesses of the faubourg as there was nothing in history or in literature that he could not explain away for their edification having never done anything remarkable he was naturally elected a member of the academy and he always remained loyal to the traditions of that thoroughly respectable and thoroughly pretentious institution  in fact he was just the sort of man who should never have attempted to write a life of george sand or to interpret george sand’s genius  he was too feminine to appreciate the grandeur of that large womanly nature too much of a dilettante to realize the masculine force of that strong and ardent mind  he never gets at the secret of george sand and never brings us near to her wonderful personality  he looks on her simply as a littérateur as a writer of pretty stories of country life and of charming if somewhat exaggerated romances  but george sand was much more than this  beautiful as are such books as consuelo and mauprat françois le champi and la mare au diable yet in none of them is she adequately expressed by none of them is she adequately revealed  as mr matthew arnold said many years ago ‘we do not know george sand unless we feel the spirit which goes through her work as a whole’  with this spirit however m caro has no sympathy  madame sand’s doctrines are antediluvian he tells us her philosophy is quite dead and her ideas of social regeneration are utopian incoherent and absurd  the best thing for us to do is to forget these silly dreams and to read teverino and le secrétaire intime  poor m caro  this spirit which he treats with such airy flippancy is the very leaven of modern life  it is remoulding the world for us and fashioning our age anew  if it is antediluvian it is so because the deluge is yet to come if it is utopian then utopia must be added to our geographies  to what curious straits m caro is driven by his violent prejudices may be estimated by the fact that he tries to class george sand’s novels with the old chansons de geste the stories of adventure characteristic of primitive literatures whereas in using fiction as a vehicle of thought and romance as a means of influencing the social ideals of her age george sand was merely carrying out the traditions of voltaire and rousseau of diderot and of chateaubriand  the novel says m caro must be allied either to poetry or to science  that it has found in philosophy one of its strongest allies seems not to have occurred to him  in an english critic such a view might possibly be excusable  our greatest novelists such as fielding scott and thackeray cared little for the philosophy of their age  but coming as it does from a french critic the statement seems to show a strange want of recognition of one of the most important elements of french fiction  nor even in the narrow limits that he has imposed upon himself can m caro be said to be a very fortunate or felicitous critic  to take merely one instance out of many he says nothing of george sand’s delightful treatment of art and the artist’s life  and yet how exquisitely does she analyse each separate art and present it to us in its relation to life  in consuelo she tells us of music in horace of authorship in le château des désertes of acting in les maîtres mosaïstes of mosaic work in le château de pictordu of portrait painting and in la daniella of the painting of landscape what mr ruskin and mr browning have done for england she did for france  she invented an art literature  it is unnecessary however to discuss any of m caro’s minor failings for the whole effect of the book so far as it attempts to portray for us the scope and character of george sand’s genius is entirely spoiled by the false attitude assumed from the beginning and though the dictum may seem to many harsh and exclusive we cannot help feeling that an absolute incapacity for appreciating the spirit of a great writer is no qualification for writing a treatise on the subject  as for madame sand’s private life which is so intimately connected with her art for like goethe she had to live her romances before she could write them m caro says hardly anything about it  he passes it over with a modesty that almost makes one blush and for fear of wounding the susceptibilities of those grandes dames whose passions m paul bourget analyses with such subtlety he transforms her mother who was a typical french grisette into ‘a very amiable and spirituelle milliner’  it must be admitted that joseph surface himself could hardly show greater tact and delicacy though we ourselves must plead guilty to preferring madame sand’s own description of her as an ‘enfant du vieux pavé de paris’  george sand  by the late elmé marie caro  translated by gustave masson ba assistant master harrow school  ‘great french writers’ series  routledge and sons     a fascinating book woman’s world november 1888   mr alan cole’s carefullyedited translation of m lefébure’s history of embroidery and lace is one of the most fascinating books that has appeared on this delightful subject  m lefébure is one of the administrators of the musée des arts décoratifs at paris besides being a lace manufacturer and his work has not merely an important historical value but as a handbook of technical instruction it will be found of the greatest service by all needlewomen  indeed as the translator himself points out m lefébure’s book suggests the question whether it is not rather by the needle and the bobbin than by the brush the graver or the chisel that the influence of woman should assert itself in the arts  in europe at any rate woman is sovereign in the domain of artneedlework and few men would care to dispute with her the right of using those delicate implements so intimately associated with the dexterity of her nimble and slender fingers nor is there any reason why the productions of embroidery should not as mr alan cole suggests be placed on the same level with those of painting engraving and sculpture though there must always be a great difference between those purely decorative arts that glorify their own material and the more imaginative arts in which the material is as it were annihilated and absorbed into the creation of a new form  in the beautifying of modern houses it certainly must be admitted—indeed it should be more generally recognized than it is—that rich embroidery on hangings and curtains portières couches and the like produces a far more decorative and far more artistic effect than can be gained from our somewhat wearisome english practice of covering the walls with pictures and engravings and the almost complete disappearance of embroidery from dress has robbed modern costume of one of the chief elements of grace and fancy  that however a great improvement has taken place in english embroidery during the last ten or fifteen years cannot i think be denied  it is shown not merely in the work of individual artists such as mrs holiday miss may morris and others but also in the admirable productions of the south kensington school of embroidery the best—indeed the only real good—school that south kensington has produced  it is pleasant to note on turning over the leaves of m lefébure’s book that in this we are merely carrying out certain old traditions of early english art  in the seventh century st ethelreda first abbess of the monastery of ely made an offering to st cuthbert of a sacred ornament she had worked with gold and precious stones and the cope and maniple of st cuthbert which are preserved at durham are considered to be specimens of opus anglicanum  in the year 800 the bishop of durham allotted the income of a farm of two hundred acres for life to an embroideress named eanswitha in consideration of her keeping in repair the vestments of the clergy in his diocese  the battle standard of king alfred was embroidered by danish princesses and the anglosaxon gudric gave alcuid a piece of land on condition that she instructed his daughter in needlework  queen mathilda bequeathed to the abbey of the holy trinity at caen a tunic embroidered at winchester by the wife of one alderet and when william presented himself to the english nobles after the battle of hastings he wore a mantle covered with anglosaxon embroideries which is probably m lefébure suggests the same as that mentioned in the inventory of the bayeux cathedral where after the entry relating to the broderie à telle representing the conquest of england two mantles are described—one of king william ‘all of gold powdered with crosses and blossoms of gold and edged along the lower border with an orphrey of figures’  the most splendid example of the opus anglicanum now in existence is of course the syon cope at the south kensington museum but english work seems to have been celebrated all over the continent  pope innocent iv so admired the splendid vestments worn by the english clergy in 1246 that he ordered similar articles from cistercian monasteries in england  st dunstan the artistic english monk was known as a designer for embroideries and the stole of st thomas à becket is still preserved in the cathedral at sens and shows us the interlaced scrollforms used by anglosaxon ms illuminators  how far this modern artistic revival of rich and delicate embroidery will bear fruit depends of course almost entirely on the energy and study that women are ready to devote to it but i think that it must be admitted that all our decorative arts in europe at present have at least this element of strength—that they are in immediate relationship with the decorative arts of asia  wherever we find in european history a revival of decorative art it has i fancy nearly always been due to oriental influence and contact with oriental nations  our own keenly intellectual art has more than once been ready to sacrifice real decorative beauty either to imitative presentation or to ideal motive it has taken upon itself the burden of expression and has sought to interpret the secrets of thought and passion  in its marvellous truth of presentation it has found its strength and yet its weakness is there also  it is never with impunity that an art seeks to mirror life  if truth has her revenge upon those who do not follow her she is often pitiless to her worshippers  in byzantium the two arts met—greek art with its intellectual sense of form and its quick sympathy with humanity oriental art with its gorgeous materialism its frank rejection of imitation its wonderful secrets of craft and colour its splendid textures its rare metals and jewels its marvellous and priceless traditions  they had indeed met before but in byzantium they were married and the sacred tree of the persians the palm of zoroaster was embroidered on the hem of the garments of the western world  even the iconoclasts the philistines of theological history who in one of those strange outbursts of rage against beauty that seem to occur only amongst european nations rose up against the wonder and magnificence of the new art served merely to distribute its secrets more widely and in the liber pontificalis written in 687 by athanasius the librarian we read of an influx into rome of gorgeous embroideries the work of men who had arrived from constantinople and from greece  the triumph of the mussulman gave the decorative art of europe a new departure—that very principle of their religion that forbade the actual representation of any object in nature being of the greatest artistic service to them though it was not of course strictly carried out  the saracens introduced into sicily the art of weaving silken and golden fabrics and from sicily the manufacture of fine stuffs spread to the north of italy and became localized in genoa florence venice and other towns  a still greater artmovement took place in spain under the moors and saracens who brought over workmen from persia to make beautiful things for them  m lefébure tells us of persian embroidery penetrating as far as andalusia and almeria like palermo had its hôtel des tiraz which rivalled the hôtel des tiraz at bagdad tiraz being the generic name for ornamental tissues and costumes made with them spangles those pretty little discs of gold silver or polished steel used in certain embroidery for dainty glinting effects were a saracenic invention and arabic letters often took the place of letters in the roman characters for use in inscriptions upon embroidered robes and middle age tapestries their decorative value being so much greater  the book of crafts by etienne boileau provost of the merchants in 1258–1268 contains a curious enumeration of the different craftguilds of paris among which we find ‘the tapiciers or makers of the tapis sarrasinois or saracen cloths who say that their craft is for the service only of churches or great men like kings and counts’ and indeed even in our own day nearly all our words descriptive of decorative textures and decorative methods point to an oriental origin  what the inroads of the mohammedans did for sicily and spain the return of the crusaders did for the other countries of europe  the nobles who left for palestine clad in armour came back in the rich stuffs of the east and their costumes pouches aumônières sarrasinoises and caparisons excited the admiration of the needleworkers of the west  matthew paris says that at the sacking of antioch in 1098 gold silver and priceless costumes were so equally distributed among the crusaders that many who the night before were famishing and imploring relief suddenly found themselves overwhelmed with wealth and robert de clair tells us of the wonderful fêtes that followed the capture of constantinople  the thirteenth century as m lefébure points out was conspicuous for an increased demand in the west for embroidery  many crusaders made offerings to churches of plunder from palestine and st louis on his return from the first crusade offered thanks at st denis to god for mercies bestowed on him during his six years’ absence and travel and presented some richly embroidered stuffs to be used on great occasions as coverings to the reliquaries containing the relics of holy martyrs  european embroidery having thus become possessed of new materials and wonderful methods developed on its own intellectual and imitative lines inclining as it went on to the purely pictorial and seeking to rival painting and to produce landscapes and figuresubjects with elaborate perspective and subtle aerial effects  a fresh oriental influence however came through the dutch and the portuguese and the famous compagnie des grandes indes and m lefébure gives an illustration of a doorhanging now in the cluny museum where we find the french fleursdelys intermixed with indian ornament  the hangings of madame de maintenon’s room at fontainebleau which were embroidered at st cyr represent chinese scenery upon a jonquilyellow ground  clothes were sent out ready cut to the east to be embroidered and many of the delightful coats of the period of louis xv and louis xvi owe their dainty decoration to the needles of chinese artists  in our own day the influence of the east is strongly marked  persia has sent us her carpets for patterns and cashmere her lovely shawls and india her dainty muslins finely worked with gold thread palmates and stitched over with iridescent beetles’ wings  we are beginning now to dye by oriental methods and the silk robes of china and japan have taught us new wonders of colourcombination and new subtleties of delicate design  whether we have yet learned to make a wise use of what we have acquired is less certain  if books produce an effect this book of m lefébure should certainly make us study with still deeper interest the whole question of embroidery and by those who already work with their needles it will be found full of most fertile suggestion and most admirable advice  even to read of the marvellous works of embroidery that were fashioned in bygone ages is pleasant  time has kept a few fragments of greek embroidery of the fourth century bc for us  one is figured in m lefébure’s book—a chainstitch embroidery of yellow flax upon a mulberrycoloured worsted material with graceful spirals and palmettopatterns and another a tapestried cloth powdered with ducks was reproduced in the woman’s world some months ago for an article by mr alan cole 115  now and then we find in the tomb of some dead egyptian a piece of delicate work  in the treasury at ratisbon is preserved a specimen of byzantine embroidery on which the emperor constantine is depicted riding on a white palfrey and receiving homage from the east and west  metz has a red silk cope wrought with great eagles the gift of charlemagne and bayeux the needlewrought epic of queen matilda  but where is the great crocuscoloured robe wrought for athena on which the gods fought against the giants  where is the huge velarium that nero stretched across the colosseum at rome on which was represented the starry sky and apollo driving a chariot drawn by steeds how one would like to see the curious tablenapkins wrought for heliogabalus on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast or the mortuarycloth of king chilperic with its three hundred golden bees or the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the bishop of pontus and were embroidered with ‘lions panthers bears dogs forests rocks hunters—all in fact that painters can copy from nature’  charles of orleans had a coat on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning ‘madame je suis tout joyeux’ the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread and each note of square shape in those days formed with four pearls 116  the room prepared in the palace at rheims for the use of queen joan of burgundy was decorated with ‘thirteen hundred and twentyone papegauts parrots made in broidery and blazoned with the king’s arms and five hundred and sixtyone butterflies whose wings were similarly ornamented with the queen’s arms—the whole worked in fine gold’  catherine de medicis had a mourningbed made for her ‘of black velvet embroidered with pearls and powdered with crescents and suns’  its curtains were of damask ‘with leafy wreaths and garlands figured upon a gold and silver ground and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls’ and it stood in a room hung with rows of the queen’s devices in cut black velvet on cloth of silver  louis xiv had goldembroidered caryatides fifteen feet high in his apartment  the state bed of sobieski king of poland was made of smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises and pearls with verses from the koran its supports were of silvergilt beautifully chased and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions  he had taken it from the turkish camp before vienna and the standard of mahomet had stood under it  the duchess de la ferté wore a dress of reddishbrown velvet the skirt of which adjusted in graceful folds was held up by big butterflies made of dresden china the front was a tablier of cloth of silver upon which was embroidered an orchestra of musicians arranged in a pyramidal group consisting of a series of six ranks of performers with beautiful instruments wrought in raised needlework  ‘into the night go one and all’ as mr henley sings in his charming ballade of dead actors  many of the facts related by m lefébure about the embroiderers’ guilds are also extremely interesting  etienne boileau in his book of crafts to which i have already alluded tells us that a member of the guild was prohibited from using gold of less value than ‘eight sous about 6s the skein he was bound to use the best silk and never to mix thread with silk because that made the work false and bad’  the test or trial piece prescribed for a worker who was the son of a masterembroiderer was ‘a single figure a sixth of the natural size to be shaded in gold’ whilst one not the son of a master was required to produce ‘a complete incident with many figures’  the book of crafts also mentions ‘cuttersout and stencillers and illuminators’ amongst those employed in the industry of embroidery  in 1551 the parisian corporation of embroiderers issued a notice that ‘for the future the colouring in representations of nude figures and faces should be done in three or four gradations of carnationdyed silk and not as formerly in white silks’  during the fifteenth century every household of any position retained the services of an embroiderer by the year  the preparation of colours also whether for painting or for dyeing threads and textile fabrics was a matter which m lefébure points out received close attention from the artists of the middle ages  many undertook long journeys to obtain the more famous recipes which they filed subsequently adding to and correcting them as experience dictated  nor were great artists above making and supplying designs for embroidery  raphael made designs for francis i and boucher for louis xv and in the ambras collection at vienna is a superb set of sacerdotal robes from designs by the brothers van eyck and their pupils  early in the sixteenth century books of embroidery designs were produced and their success was so great that in a few years french german italian flemish and english publishers spread broadcast books of design made by their best engravers  in the same century in order to give the designers opportunity of studying directly from nature jean robin opened a garden with conservatories in which he cultivated strange varieties of plants then but little known in our latitudes  the rich brocades and brocadelles of the time are characterized by the introduction of large flowery patterns with pomegranates and other fruits with fine foliage  the second part of m lefébure’s book is devoted to the history of lace and though some may not find it quite as interesting as the earlier portion it will more than repay perusal and those who still work in this delicate and fanciful art will find many valuable suggestions in it as well as a large number of exceedingly beautiful designs  compared to embroidery lace seems comparatively modern  m lefébure and mr alan cole tell us that there is no reliable or documentary evidence to prove the existence of lace before the fifteenth century  of course in the east light tissues such as gauzes muslins and nets were made at very early times and were used as veils and scarfs after the manner of subsequent laces and women enriched them with some sort of embroidery or varied the openness of them by here and there drawing out threads the threads of fringes seem also to have been plaited and knotted together and the borders of one of the many fashions of roman toga were of open reticulated weaving  the egyptian museum at the louvre has a curious network embellished with glass beads and the monk reginald who took part in opening the tomb of st cuthbert at durham in the twelfth century writes that the saint’s shroud had a fringe of linen threads an inch long surmounted by a border ‘worked upon the threads’ with representations of birds and pairs of beasts there being between each such pair a branching tree a survival of the palm of zoroaster to which i have before alluded  our authors however do not in these examples recognize lace the production of which involves more refined and artistic methods and postulates a combination of skill and varied execution carried to a higher degree of perfection  lace as we know it seems to have had its origin in the habit of embroidering linen  white embroidery on linen has m lefébure remarks a cold and monotonous aspect that with coloured threads is brighter and gayer in effect but is apt to fade in frequent washing but white embroidery relieved by open spaces in or shapes cut from the linen ground is possessed of an entirely new charm and from a sense of this the birth may be traced of an art in the result of which happy contrasts are effected between ornamental details of close texture and others of openwork  soon also was suggested the idea that instead of laboriously withdrawing threads from stout linen it would be more convenient to introduce a needlemade pattern into an open network ground which was called a lacis  of this kind of embroidery many specimens are extant the cluny museum possesses a linen cap said to have belonged to charles v and an alb of linen drawnthread work supposed to have been made by anne of bohemia 1527 is preserved in the cathedral at prague catherine de medicis had a bed draped with squares of réseuil or lacis and it is recorded that ‘the girls and servants of her household consumed much time in making squares of réseuil’  the interesting patternbooks for openground embroidery of which the first was published in 1527 by pierre quinty of cologne supply us with the means of tracing the stages in the transition from white thread embroidery to needlepoint lace  we meet in them with a style of needlework which differs from embroidery in not being wrought upon a stuff foundation  it is in fact true lace done as it were ‘in the air’ both ground and pattern being entirely produced by the lacemaker  the elaborate use of lace in costume was of course largely stimulated by the fashion of wearing ruffs and their companion cuffs or sleeves catherine de medicis induced one frederic vinciolo to come from italy and make ruffs and gadrooned collars the fashion of which she started in france and henry iii was so punctilious over his ruffs that he would iron and goffer his cuffs and collars himself rather than see their pleats limp and out of shape  the patternbooks also gave a great impulse to the art  m lefébure mentions german books with patterns of eagles heraldic emblems hunting scenes and plants and leaves belonging to northern vegetation and italian books in which the motifs consist of oleander blossoms and elegant wreaths and scrolls landscapes with mythological scenes and hunting episodes less realistic than the northern ones in which appear fauns and nymphs or amorini shooting arrows  with regard to these patterns m lefébure notices a curious fact  the oldest painting in which lace is depicted is that of a lady by carpaccio who died about 1523  the cuffs of the lady are edged with a narrow lace the pattern of which reappears in vecellio’s corona a book not published until 1591  this particular pattern was therefore in use at least eighty years before it got into circulation with other published patterns  it was not however till the seventeenth century that lace acquired a really independent character and individuality and m duplessis states that the production of the more noteworthy of early laces owes more to the influence of men than to that of women  the reign of louis xiv witnessed the production of the most stately needlepoint laces the transformation of venetian point and the growth of points d’alençon d’argentan de bruxelles and d’angleterre  the king aided by colbert determined to make france the centre if possible for lace manufacture sending for this purpose both to venice and to flanders for workers  the studio of the gobelins supplied designs  the dandies had their huge rabatos or bands falling from beneath the chin over the breast and great prelates like bossuet and fénelon wore their wonderful albs and rochets  it is related of a collar made at venice for louis xiv that the laceworkers being unable to find sufficiently fine horsehair employed some of their own hairs instead in order to secure that marvellous delicacy of work which they aimed at producing  in the eighteenth century venice finding that laces of lighter texture were sought after set herself to make rosepoint and at the court of louis xv the choice of lace was regulated by still more elaborate etiquette  the revolution however ruined many of the manufactures alençon survived and napoleon encouraged it and endeavoured to renew the old rules about the necessity of wearing pointlace at court receptions  a wonderful piece of lace powdered over with devices of bees and costing 40000 francs was ordered  it was begun for the empress josephine but in the course of its making her escutcheons were replaced by those of marie louise  m lefébure concludes his interesting history by stating very clearly his attitude towards machinemade lace  ‘it would be an obvious loss to art’ he says ‘should the making of lace by hand become extinct for machinery as skilfully devised as possible cannot do what the hand does’  it can give us ‘the results of processes not the creations of artistic handicraft’  art is absent ‘where formal calculation pretends to supersede emotion’ it is absent ‘where no trace can be detected of intelligence guiding handicraft whose hesitancies even possess peculiar charm    cheapness is never commendable in respect of things which are not absolute necessities it lowers artistic standard’  these are admirable remarks and with them we take leave of this fascinating book with its delightful illustrations its charming anecdotes its excellent advice  mr alan cole deserves the thanks of all who are interested in art for bringing this book before the public in so attractive and so inexpensive a form  embroidery and lace their manufacture and history from the remotest antiquity to the present day  translated and enlarged by alan s cole from the french of ernest lefébure  grevel and co     henley’s poems woman’s world december 1888   ‘if i were king’ says mr henley in one of his most modest rondeaus      ‘art should aspire yet ugliness be dear     beauty the shaft should speed with wit for feather     and love sweet love should never fall to sere              if i were king’  and these lines contain if not the best criticism of his own work certainly a very complete statement of his aim and motive as a poet  his little book of verses reveals to us an artist who is seeking to find new methods of expression and has not merely a delicate sense of beauty and a brilliant fantastic wit but a real passion also for what is horrible ugly or grotesque  no doubt everything that is worthy of existence is worthy also of art—at least one would like to think so—but while echo or mirror can repeat for us a beautiful thing to render artistically a thing that is ugly requires the most exquisite alchemy of form the most subtle magic of transformation  to me there is more of the cry of marsyas than of the singing of apollo in the earlier poems of mr henley’s volume in hospital rhymes and rhythms as he calls them  but it is impossible to deny their power  some of them are like bright vivid pastels others like charcoal drawings with dull blacks and murky whites others like etchings with deeplybitten lines and abrupt contrasts and clever coloursuggestions  in fact they are like anything and everything except perfected poems—that they certainly are not  they are still in the twilight  they are preludes experiments inspired jottings in a notebook and should be heralded by a design of ‘genius making sketches’  rhyme gives architecture as well as melody to verse it gives that delightful sense of limitation which in all the arts is so pleasurable and is indeed one of the secrets of perfection it will whisper as a french critic has said ‘things unexpected and charming things with strange and remote relations to each other’ and bind them together in indissoluble bonds of beauty and in his constant rejection of rhyme mr henley seems to me to have abdicated half his power  he is a roi en exil who has thrown away some of the strings of his lute a poet who has forgotten the fairest part of his kingdom  however all work criticizes itself  here is one of mr henley’s inspired jottings  according to the temperament of the reader it will serve either as a model or as the reverse      as with varnish red and glistening        dripped his hair his feet were rigid        raised he settled stiffly sideways        you could see the hurts were spinal      he had fallen from an engine        and been dragged along the metals        it was hopeless and they knew it        so they covered him and left him      as he lay by fits half sentient        inarticulately moaning        with his stockinged feet protruded        sharp and awkward from the blankets      to his bed there came a woman        stood and looked and sighed a little        and departed without speaking        as himself a few hours after      i was told she was his sweetheart        they were on the eve of marriage        she was quiet as a statue        but her lip was gray and writhen  in this poem the rhythm and the music such as it is are obvious—perhaps a little too obvious  in the following i see nothing but ingeniously printed prose  it is a description—and a very accurate one—of a scene in a hospital ward  the medical students are supposed to be crowding round the doctor  what i quote is only a fragment but the poem itself is a fragment      so shows the ring     seen from behind round a conjuror     doing his pitch in the street     high shoulders low shoulders broad shoulders narrow ones     round square and angular serry and shove     while from within a voice     gravely and weightily fluent     sounds and then ceases and suddenly     look at the stress of the shoulders     out of a quiver of silence     over the hiss of the spray     comes a low cry and the sound     of breath quick intaken through teeth     clenched in resolve  and the master     breaks from the crowd and goes     wiping his hands     to the next bed with his pupils     flocking and whispering behind him      now one can see     case number one     sits rather pale with his bedclothes     stripped up and showing his foot     alas for god’s image     swaddled in wet white lint     brilliantly hideous with red  théophile gautier once said that flaubert’s style was meant to be read and his own style to be looked at  mr henley’s unrhymed rhythms form very dainty designs from a typographical point of view  from the point of view of literature they are a series of vivid concentrated impressions with a keen grip of fact a terrible actuality and an almost masterly power of picturesque presentation  but the poetic form—what of that  well let us pass to the later poems to the rondels and rondeaus the sonnets and quatorzains the echoes and the ballades  how brilliant and fanciful this is  the toyokuni colourprint that suggested it could not be more delightful  it seems to have kept all the wilful fantastic charm of the original      was i a samurai renowned     twosworded fierce immense of bow     a histrion angular and profound     a priest a porter—child although     i have forgotten clean i know     that in the shade of fujisan     what time the cherryorchards blow     i loved you once in old japan      as here you loiter flowinggowned     and hugely sashed with pins arow     your quaint head as with flamelets crowned     demure inviting—even so     when merry maids in miyako     to feel the sweet o’ the year began     and green gardens to overflow     i loved you once in old japan      clear shine the hills the ricefields round     two cranes are circling sleepy and slow     a blue canal the lake’s blue bound     breaks at the bamboo bridge and lo     touched with the sundown’s spirit and glow     i see you turn with flirted fan     against the plumtree’s bloomy snow        i loved you once in old japan                                      envoy      dear ’twas a dozen lives ago     but that i was a lucky man     the toyokuni here will show     i loved you—once—in old japan  this rondel too—how light it is and graceful—      we’ll to the woods and gather may     fresh from the footprints of the rain     we’ll to the woods at every vein     to drink the spirit of the day      the winds of spring are out at play     the needs of spring in heart and brain     we’ll to the woods and gather may     fresh from the footprints of the rain      the world’s too near her end you say     hark to the blackbird’s mad refrain     it waits for her the vast inane     then girls to help her on the way     we’ll to the woods and gather may  there are fine verses also scattered through this little book some of them very strong as—      out of the night that covers me        black as the pit from pole to pole     i thank whatever gods may be        for my unconquerable soul      it matters not how strait the gate        how charged with punishments the scroll     i am the master of my fate        i am the captain of my soul  others with a true touch of romance as—      or ever the knightly years were gone        with the old world to the grave     i was a king in babylon        and you were a christian slave  and here and there we come across such felicitous phrases as—               in the sand     the gold prowgriffin claws a hold  or—               the spires     shine and are changed  and many other graceful or fanciful lines even ‘the green sky’s minor thirds’ being perfectly right in its place and a very refreshing bit of affectation in a volume where there is so much that is natural  however mr henley is not to be judged by samples  indeed the most attractive thing in the book is no single poem that is in it but the strong humane personality that stands behind both flawless and faulty work alike and looks out through many masks some of them beautiful and some grotesque and not a few misshapen  in the case with most of our modern poets when we have analysed them down to an adjective we can go no further or we care to go no further but with this book it is different  through these reeds and pipes blows the very breath of life it seems as if one could put one’s hand upon the singer’s heart and count its pulsations  there is something wholesome virile and sane about the man’s soul  anybody can be reasonable but to be sane is not common and sane poets are as rare as blue lilies though they may not be quite so delightful      let the great winds their worst and wildest blow     or the gold weather round us mellow slow     we have fulfilled ourselves and we can dare     and we can conquer though we may not share     in the rich quiet of the afterglow              what is to come  is the concluding stanza of the last rondeau—indeed of the last poem in the collection and the high serene temper displayed in these lines serves at once as keynote and keystone to the book  the very lightness and slightness of so much of the work its careless moods and casual fancies seem to suggest a nature that is not primarily interested in art—a nature like sordello’s passionately enamoured of life one to which lyre and lute are things of less importance  from this mere joy of living this frank delight in experience for its own sake this lofty indifference and momentary unregretted ardours come all the faults and all the beauties of the volume  but there is this difference between them—the faults are deliberate and the result of much study the beauties have the air of fascinating impromptus  mr henley’s healthy if sometimes misapplied confidence in the myriad suggestions of life gives him his charm  he is made to sing along the highways not to sit down and write  if he took himself more seriously his work would become trivial  a book of verses  by william ernest henley  david nutt     some literary ladies woman’s world january 1889   in a recent article on english poetesses i ventured to suggest that our women of letters should turn their attention somewhat more to prose and somewhat less to poetry  women seem to me to possess just what our literature wants—a light touch a delicate hand a graceful mode of treatment and an unstudied felicity of phrase  we want some one who will do for our prose what madame de sévigné did for the prose of france george eliot’s style was far too cumbrous and charlotte brontë’s too exaggerated  however one must not forget that amongst the women of england there have been some charming letterwriters and certainly no book can be more delightful reading than mrs ross’s three generations of english women which has recently appeared  the three englishwomen whose memoirs and correspondence mrs ross has so admirably edited are mrs john taylor mrs sarah austin and lady duff gordon all of them remarkable personalities and two of them women of brilliant wit and european reputation  mrs taylor belonged to that great norwich family about whom the duke of sussex remarked that they reversed the ordinary saying that it takes nine tailors to make a man and was for many years one of the most distinguished figures in the famous society of her native town  her only daughter married john austin the great authority on jurisprudence and her salon in paris was the centre of the intellect and culture of her day  lucie duff gordon the only child of john and sarah austin inherited the talents of her parents  a beauty a femme d’esprit a traveller and clever writer she charmed and fascinated her age and her premature death in egypt was really a loss to our literature  it is to her daughter that we owe this delightful volume of memoirs  first we are introduced to mrs ross’s greatgrandmother mrs taylor who ‘was called by her intimate friends “madame roland of norwich” from her likeness to the portraits of the handsome and unfortunate frenchwoman’  we hear of her darning her boy’s grey worsted stockings while holding her own with southey and brougham and dancing round the tree of liberty with dr parr when the news of the fall of the bastille was first known  amongst her friends were sir james mackintosh the most popular man of the day ‘to whom madame de staël wrote “il n’y a pas de société sans vous”  “c’est très ennuyeux de dîner sans vous la société ne va pas quand vous n’êtes pas là”’ sir james smith the botanist crabb robinson the gurneys mrs barbauld dr alderson and his charming daughter amelia opie and many other wellknown people  her letters are extremely sensible and thoughtful  ‘nothing at present’ she says in one of them ‘suits my taste so well as susan’s latin lessons and her philosophical old master    when we get to cicero’s discussions on the nature of the soul or virgil’s fine descriptions my mind is filled up  life is either a dull round of eating drinking and sleeping or a spark of ethereal fire just kindled    the character of girls must depend upon their reading as much as upon the company they keep  besides the intrinsic pleasure to be derived from solid knowledge a woman ought to consider it as her best resource against poverty’  this is a somewhat caustic aphorism ‘a romantic woman is a troublesome friend as she expects you to be as impudent as herself and is mortified at what she calls coldness and insensibility’  and this is admirable ‘the art of life is not to estrange oneself from society and yet not to pay too dear for it’  this too is good ‘vanity like curiosity is wanted as a stimulus to exertion indolence would certainly get the better of us if it were not for these two powerful principles’ and there is a keen touch of humour in the following ‘nothing is so gratifying as the idea that virtue and philanthropy are becoming fashionable’  dr james martineau in a letter to mrs ross gives us a pleasant picture of the old lady returning from market ‘weighted by her huge basket with the shank of a leg of mutton thrust out to betray its contents’ and talking divinely about philosophy poets politics and every intellectual topic of the day  she was a woman of admirable good sense a type of roman matron and quite as careful as were the roman matrons to keep up the purity of her native tongue  mrs taylor however was more or less limited to norwich  mrs austin was for the world  in london paris and germany she ruled and dominated society loved by every one who knew her  ‘she is “my best and brightest” to lord jeffrey “dear fair and wise” to sydney smith “my great ally” to sir james stephen “sunlight through waste weltering chaos” to thomas carlyle while he needed her aid “la petite mère du genre humain” to michael chevalier “liebes mütterlein” to john stuart mill and “my own professorin” to charles buller to whom she taught german as well as to the sons of mr james mill’  jeremy bentham when on his deathbed gave her a ring with his portrait and some of his hair let in behind  ‘there my dear’ he said ‘it is the only ring i ever gave a woman’  she corresponded with guizot barthelemy de st hilaire the grotes dr whewell the master of trinity nassau senior the duchesse d’orléans victor cousin and many other distinguished people her translation of ranke’s history of the popes is admirable indeed all her literary work was thoroughly well done and her edition of her husband’s province of jurisprudence deserves the very highest praise two people more unlike than herself and her husband it would have been difficult to find  he was habitually grave and despondent she was brilliantly handsome fond of society in which she shone and ‘with an almost superabundance of energy and animal spirits’ mrs ross tells us she married him because she thought him perfect but he never produced the work of which he was worthy and of which she knew him to be worthy her estimate of him in the preface to the jurisprudence is wonderfully striking and simple  ‘he was never sanguine  he was intolerant of any imperfection  he was always under the control of severe love of truth he lived and died a poor man’  she was terribly disappointed in him but she loved him  some years after his death she wrote to m guizot      in the intervals of my study of his works i read his letters to     me—fortyfive years of loveletters the last as tender and     passionate as the first  and how full of noble sentiments  the     midday of our lives was clouded and stormy full of cares and     disappointments but the sunset was bright and serene—as bright as     the morning and more serene  now it is night with me and must     remain so till the dawn of another day  i am always alone—that is     i live with him  the most interesting letters in the book are certainly those to m guizot with whom she maintained the closest intellectual friendship but there is hardly one of them that does not contain something clever or thoughtful or witty while those addressed to her in turn are very interesting  carlyle writes her letters full of lamentations the wail of a titan in pain superbly exaggerated for literary effect      literature one’s sole craft and staff of life lies broken in     abeyance what room for music amid the braying of innumerable     jackasses the howling of innumerable hyænas whetting the tooth to     eat them up  alas for it it is a sick disjointed time neither     shall we ever mend it at best let us hope to mend ourselves  i     declare i sometimes think of throwing down the pen altogether as a     worthless weapon and leading out a colony of these poor starving     drudges to the waste places of their old mother earth when for sweat     of their brow bread will rise for them it were perhaps the     worthiest service that at this moment could be rendered our old world     to throw open for it the doors of the new  thither must they come at     last ‘bursts of eloquence’ will do nothing men are starving and     will try many things before they die  but poor i ach gott  i am     no hengist or alaric only a writer of articles in bad prose stick     to thy last o tutor the pen is not worthless it is omnipotent to     those who have faith  henri beyle stendhal the great i am often tempted to think the greatest of french novelists writes her a charming letter about nuances  ‘it seems to me’ he says ‘that except when they read shakespeare byron or sterne no englishman understands “nuances” we adore them  a fool says to a woman “i love you” the words mean nothing he might as well say “olli batachor” it is the nuance which gives force to the meaning’  in 1839 mrs austin writes to victor cousin ‘i have seen young gladstone a distinguished tory who wants to reestablish education based on the church in quite a catholic form’ and we find her corresponding with mr gladstone on the subject of education  ‘if you are strong enough to provide motives and checks’ she says to him ‘you may do two blessed acts—reform your clergy and teach your people  as it is how few of them conceive what it is to teach a people’  mr gladstone replies at great length and in many letters from which we may quote this passage      you are for pressing and urging the people to their profit against     their inclination so am i  you set little value upon all merely     technical instruction upon all that fails to touch the inner nature     of man so do i  and here i find ground of union broad and     deeplaid         i more than doubt whether your idea namely that of raising man to     social sufficiency and morality can be accomplished except through     the ancient religion of christ    or whether the principles of     eclecticism are legitimately applicable to the gospel or whether if     we find ourselves in a state of incapacity to work through the     church we can remedy the defect by the adoption of principles     contrary to hers         but indeed i am most unfit to pursue the subject private     circumstances of no common interest are upon me as i have become     very recently engaged to miss glynne and i hope your recollections     will enable you in some degree to excuse me  lord jeffrey has a very curious and suggestive letter on popular education in which he denies or at least doubts the effect of this education on morals  he however supports it on the ground ‘that it will increase the enjoyment of individuals’ which is certainly a very sensible claim  humboldt writes to her about an old indian language which was preserved by a parrot the tribe who spoke it having been exterminated and about ‘young darwin’ who had just published his first book  here are some extracts from her own letters      i heard from lord lansdowne two or three days ago    i think he     is ce que nous avons de mieux  he wants only the energy that great     ambition gives  he says ‘we shall have a parliament of railway     kings’    what can be worse than that—the deification of money by     a whole people  as lord brougham says we have no right to give     ourselves pharisaical airs  i must give you a story sent to me     mrs hudson the railway queen was shown a bust of marcus aurelius     at lord westminster’s on which she said ‘i suppose that is not the     present marquis’  to goûter this you must know that the extreme     vulgar hackney coachmen etc in england pronounce ‘marquis’ very     like ‘marcus’      dec 17th—went to savigny’s  nobody was there but w grimm and     his wife and a few men  grimm told me he had received two volumes of     norwegian fairytales and that they were delightful  talking of     them i said ‘your children appear to be the happiest in the world     they live in the midst of fairytales’  ‘ah’ said he ‘i must tell     you about that  when we were at göttingen somebody spoke to my     little son about his father’s mährchen  he had read them but never     thought of their being mine  he came running to me and said with an     offended air “father they say you wrote those fairytales surely     you never invented such silly rubbish”  he thought it below my     dignity’      savigny told a volksmährchen too      ‘st anselm was grown old and infirm and lay on the ground among     thorns and thistles  der liebe gott said to him “you are very     badly lodged there why don’t you build yourself a house”  “before i     take the trouble” said anselm “i should like to know how long i     have to live”  “about thirty years” said der liebe gott  “oh     for so short a time” replied he “it’s not worth while” and turned     himself round among the thistles’      dr franck told me a story of which i had never heard before     voltaire had for some reason or other taken a grudge against the     prophet habakkuk and affected to find in him things he never wrote     somebody took the bible and began to demonstrate to him that he was     mistaken  ‘c’est égal’ he said impatiently ‘habakkuk était     capable de tout’                                                            oct 30 1853      i am not in love with the richtung tendency of our modern     novelists  there is abundance of talent but writing a pretty     graceful touching yet pleasing story is the last thing our writers     nowadays think of  their novels are party pamphlets on political or     social questions like sybil or alton locke or mary barton     or uncle tom or they are the most minute and painful dissections     of the least agreeable and beautiful parts of our nature like those     of miss brontë—jane eyre and villette or they are a kind of     martyrology like mrs marsh’s emilia wyndham which makes you     almost doubt whether any torments the heroine would have earned by     being naughty could exceed those she incurred by her virtue      where oh where is the charming humane gentle spirit that dictated     the vicar of wakefield—the spirit which goethe so justly calls     versöhnend reconciling with all the weaknesses and woes of     humanity    have you read thackeray’s esmond  it is a curious     and very successful attempt to imitate the style of our old     novelists     which of mrs gore’s novels are translated  they     are very clever lively worldly bitter disagreeable and     entertaining     miss austen’s—are they translated  they are not     new and are dutch paintings of everyday people—very clever very     true very unæsthetic but amusing  i have not seen ruth by     mrs gaskell  i hear it much admired—and blamed  it is one of the     many proofs of the desire women now have to friser questionable     topics and to poser insoluble moral problems  george sand has     turned their heads in that direction  i think a few broad scenes     or hearty jokes à la fielding were very harmless in comparison     they confounded nothing         the heir of redcliffe i have not read    i am not worthy of     superhuman flights of virtue—in a novel  i want to see how people     act and suffer who are as goodfornothing as i am myself  then i     have the sinful pretension to be amused whereas all our novelists     want to reform us and to show us what a hideous place this world is     ma foi je ne le sais que trop without their help      the head of the family has some merits    but there is too much     affliction and misery and frenzy  the heroine is one of those     creatures now so common in novels who remind me of a poor bird     tied to a stake as was once the cruel sport of boys to be ‘shyed’     at ie pelted till it died only our gentle ladywriters at the     end of all untie the poor battered bird and assure us that it is     never the worse for all the blows it has had—nay the better—and that     now with its broken wings and torn feathers and bruised body it is     going to be quite happy  no fair ladies you know that it is not     so—resigned if you please but make me no shams of happiness out     of such wrecks  in politics mrs austin was a philosophical tory  radicalism she detested and she and most of her friends seem to have regarded it as moribund  ‘the radical party is evidently effete’ she writes to m victor cousin the probable ‘leader of the tory party’ is mr gladstone ‘the people must be instructed must be guided must be in short governed’ she writes elsewhere and in a letter to dr whewell she says that the state of things in france fills ‘me with the deepest anxiety on one point—the point on which the permanency of our institutions and our salvation as a nation turn  are our higher classes able to keep the lead of the rest  if they are we are safe if not i agree with my poor dear charles buller—our turn must come  now cambridge and oxford must really look to this’  the belief in the power of the universities to stem the current of democracy is charming  she grew to regard carlyle as ‘one of the dissolvents of the age—as mischievous as his extravagances will let him be’ speaks of kingsley and maurice as ‘pernicious’ and talks of john stuart mill as a ‘demagogue’  she was no doctrinaire ‘one ounce of education demanded is worth a pound imposed  it is no use to give the meat before you give the hunger’  she was delighted at a letter of st hilaire’s in which he said ‘we have a system and no results you have results and no system’  yet she had a deep sympathy with the wants of the people  she was horrified at something babbage told her of the population of some of the manufacturing towns who are worked out before they attain to thirty years of age  ‘but i am persuaded that the remedy will not cannot come from the people’ she adds  many of her letters are concerned with the question of the higher education of women  she discusses buckle’s lecture on ‘the influence of women upon the progress of knowledge’ admits to m guizot that women’s intellectual life is largely coloured by the emotions but adds ‘one is not precisely a fool because one’s opinions are greatly influenced by one’s affections  the opinions of men are often influenced by worse things’  dr whewell consults her about lecturing women on plato being slightly afraid lest people should think it ridiculous comte writes her elaborate letters on the relation of women to progress and mr gladstone promises that mrs gladstone will carry out at hawarden the suggestions contained in one of her pamphlets  she was always very practical and never lost her admiration for plain sewing  all through the book we come across interesting and amusing things  she gets st hilaire to order a large sensible bonnet for her in paris which was at once christened the ‘aristotelian’ and was supposed to be the only useful bonnet in england  grote has to leave paris after the coup d’état he tells her because he cannot bear to see the establishment of a greek tyrant  alfred de vigny macaulay john stirling southey alexis de tocqueville hallam and jean jacques ampère all contribute to these pleasant pages  she seems to have inspired the warmest feelings of friendship in those who knew her  guizot writes to her ‘madame de staël used to say that the best thing in the world was a serious frenchman  i turn the compliment and say that the best thing in the world is an affectionate englishman  how much more an englishwoman given equal qualities a woman is always more charming than a man’  lucie austin afterwards lady duff gordon was born in 1821  her chief playfellow was john stuart mill and jeremy bentham’s garden was her playground  she was a lovely romantic child who was always wanting the flowers to talk to her and used to invent the most wonderful stories about animals of whom she was passionately fond  in 1834 mrs austin decided on leaving england and sydney smith wrote his immortal letter to the little girl      lucie lucie my dear child don’t tear your frock tearing frocks is     not of itself a proof of genius  but write as your mother writes     act as your mother acts be frank loyal affectionate simple     honest and then integrity or laceration of frock is of little     import  and lucie dear child mind your arithmetic  you know in     the first sum of yours i ever saw there was a mistake  you had     carried two as a cab is licensed to do and you ought dear lucie     to have carried but one  is this a trifle  what would life be     without arithmetic but a scene of horrors  you are going to     boulogne the city of debts peopled by men who have never understood     arithmetic  by the time you return i shall probably have received     my first paralytic stroke and shall have lost all recollection of     you  therefore i now give you my parting advice—don’t marry anybody     who has not a tolerable understanding and a thousand a year  and god     bless you dear child  at boulogne she sat next heine at table d’hôte  ‘he heard me speak german to my mother and soon began to talk to me and then said “when you go back to england you can tell your friends that you have seen heinrich heine”  i replied “and who is heinrich heine”  he laughed heartily and took no offence at my ignorance and we used to lounge on the end of the pier together where he told me stories in which fish mermaids watersprites and a very funny old french fiddler with a poodle were mixed up in the most fanciful manner sometimes humorous and very often pathetic especially when the watersprites brought him greetings from the “nord see”  he was    so kind to me and so sarcastic to every one else’  twenty years afterwards the little girl whose ‘braune augen’ heine had celebrated in his charming poem wenn ick an deinem hause used to go and see the dying poet in paris  ‘it does one good’ he said to her ‘to see a woman who does not carry about a broken heart to be mended by all sorts of men like the women here who do not see that a total want of heart is their real failing’  on another occasion he said to her ‘i have now made peace with the whole world and at last also with god who sends thee to me as a beautiful angel of death i shall certainly soon die’  lady duff gordon said to him ‘poor poet do you still retain such splendid illusions that you transform a travelling englishwoman into azrael  that used not to be the case for you always disliked us’  he answered ‘yes i do not know what possessed me to dislike the english    it really was only petulance i never hated them indeed i never knew them  i was only once in england but knew no one and found london very dreary and the people and the streets odious but england has revenged herself well she has sent me most excellent friends—thyself and milnes that good milnes’  there are delightful letters from dicky doyle here with the most amusing drawings one of the present sir robert peel as he made his maiden speech in the house being excellent and the various descriptions of hassan’s performances are extremely amusing  hassan was a black boy who had been turned away by his master because he was going blind and was found by lady duff gordon one night sitting on her doorstep  she took care of him and had him cured and he seems to have been a constant source of delight to every one  on one occasion ‘when prince louis napoleon the late emperor of the french came in unexpectedly he gravely said “please my lady i ran out and bought twopennyworth of sprats for the prince and for the honour of the house”’  here is an amusing letter from mrs norton      my dear lucie—we have never thanked you for the red pots which no     early christian should be without and which add that finishing     stroke to the splendour of our demesne which was supposed to depend     on a roc’s egg in less intelligent times  we have now a warm     pompeian appearance and the constant contemplation of these     classical objects favours the beauty of the facial line for what can     be deducted from the great fact apparent in all the states of     antiquity that straight noses were the ancient custom but the     logical assumption that the constant habit of turning up the nose at     unsightly objects—such as the national gallery and other offensive     and obtrusive things—has produced the modern divergence from the true     and proper line of profile  i rejoice to think that we ourselves are     exempt  i attribute this to our love of pompeian pots on account of     the beauty and distinction of this pot’s shape i spell it with a big     p which has kept us straight in a world of crookedness  the     pursuit of profiles under difficulties—how much more rare than a     pursuit of knowledge  talk of setting good examples before our     children  bah let us set good pompeian pots before our children     and when they grow up they will not depart from them  lady duff gordon’s letters from the cape and her brilliant translation of the amber witch are of course well known  the latter book was with lady wilde’s translation of sidonia the sorceress my favourite romantic reading when a boy  her letters from egypt are wonderfully vivid and picturesque  here is an interesting bit of art criticism      sheykh yoosuf laughed so heartily over a print in an illustrated     paper from a picture of hilton’s of rebekah at the well with the old     ‘wekeel’ of ‘sidi ibraheem’ abraham’s chief servant kneeling     before the girl he was sent to fetch like an old fool without his     turban and rebekah and the other girls in queer fancy dresses and     the camels with snouts like pigs  ‘if the painter could not go into     “es sham” to see how the arab really look’ said sheykh yoosuf ‘why     did he not paint a well in england with girls like english     peasants—at least it would have looked natural to english people and     the wekeel would not seem so like a madman if he had taken off a     hat’  i cordially agree with yoosuf’s art criticism  fancy     pictures of eastern things are hopelessly absurd  mrs ross has certainly produced a most fascinating volume and her book is one of the books of the season  it is edited with tact and judgment  three generations of english women  memoirs and

prison has had an admirable effect on mr wilfrid blunt as a poet  the love sonnets of proteus in spite of their clever mussetlike modernities and their swift brilliant wit were but affected or fantastic at best  they were simply the records of passing moods and moments of which some were sad and others sweet and not a few shameful  their subject was not of high or serious import  they contained much that was wilful and weak  in vinculis upon the other hand is a book that stirs one by its fine sincerity of purpose its lofty and impassioned thought its depth and ardour of intense feeling  ‘imprisonment’ says mr blunt in his preface ‘is a reality of discipline most useful to the modern soul lapped as it is in physical sloth and selfindulgence  like a sickness or a spiritual retreat it purifies and ennobles and the soul emerges from it stronger and more selfcontained’  to him certainly it has been a mode of purification  the opening sonnets composed in the bleak cell of galway gaol and written down on the flyleaves of the prisoner’s prayerbook are full of things nobly conceived and nobly uttered and show that though mr balfour may enforce ‘plain living’ by his prison regulations he cannot prevent ‘high thinking’ or in any way limit or constrain the freedom of a man’s soul  they are of course intensely personal in expression  they could not fail to be so  but the personality that they reveal has nothing petty or ignoble about it  the petulant cry of the shallow egoist which was the chief characteristic of the love sonnets of proteus is not to be found here  in its place we have wild grief and terrible scorn fierce rage and flamelike passion such a sonnet as the following comes out of the very fire of heart and brain      god knows ’twas not with a forereasoned plan        i left the easeful dwellings of my peace     and sought this combat with ungodly man        and ceaseless still through years that do not cease        have warred with powers and principalities     my natural soul ere yet these strifes began        was as a sister diligent to please     and loving all and most the human clan      god knows it  and he knows how the world’s tears        touched me  and he is witness of my wrath     how it was kindled against murderers        who slew for gold and how upon their path     i met them  since which day the world in arms     strikes at my life with angers and alarms  and this sonnet has all the strange strength of that despair which is but the prelude to a larger hope      i thought to do a deed of chivalry        an act of worth which haply in her sight     who was my mistress should recorded be        and of the nations  and when thus the fight        faltered and men once bold with faces white     turned this and that way in excuse to flee        i only stood and by the foeman’s might     was overborne and mangled cruelly      then crawled i to her feet in whose dear cause        i made this venture and ‘behold’ i said     ‘how i am wounded for thee in these wars’        but she ‘poor cripple would’st thou i should wed     a limbless trunk’ and laughing turned from me     yet she was fair and her name ‘liberty’  the sonnet beginning      a prison is a convent without god—        poverty chastity obedience     its precepts are  is very fine and this written just after entering the gaol is powerful      naked i came into the world of pleasure        and naked come i to this house of pain     here at the gate i lay down my life’s treasure        my pride my garments and my name with men        the world and i henceforth shall be as twain     no sound of me shall pierce for good or ill        these walls of grief  nor shall i hear the vain     laughter and tears of those who love me still      within what new life waits me  little ease        cold lying hunger nights of wakefulness     harsh orders given no voice to soothe or please        poor thieves for friends for books rules meaningless     this is the grave—nay hell  yet lord of might     still in thy light my spirit shall see light  but indeed all the sonnets are worth reading and the canon of aughrim the longest poem in the book is a most masterly and dramatic description of the tragic life of the irish peasant  literature is not much indebted to mr balfour for his sophistical defence of philosophic doubt which is one of the dullest books we know but it must be admitted that by sending mr blunt to gaol he has converted a clever rhymer into an earnest and deepthinking poet  the narrow confines of a prison cell seem to suit the ‘sonnet’s scanty plot of ground’ and an unjust imprisonment for a noble cause strengthens as well as deepens the nature  in vinculis  by wilfrid scawen blunt author of the wind and the whirlwind the love sonnets of proteus etc etc  kegan paul     the gospel according to walt whitman pall mall gazette january 25 1889   ‘no one will get to my verses who insists upon viewing them as a literary performance    or as aiming mainly towards art and æstheticism’ ‘leaves of grass    has mainly been the outcropping of my own emotional and other personal nature—an attempt from first to last to put a person a human being myself in the latter half of the nineteenth century in america freely fully and truly on record  i could not find any similar personal record in current literature that satisfied me’  in these words walt whitman gives us the true attitude we should adopt towards his work having indeed a much saner view of the value and meaning of that work than either his eloquent admirers or noisy detractors can boast of possessing  his last book november boughs as he calls it published in the winter of the old man’s life reveals to us not indeed a soul’s tragedy for its last note is one of joy and hope and noble and unshaken faith in all that is fine and worthy of such faith but certainly the drama of a human soul and puts on record with a simplicity that has in it both sweetness and strength the record of his spiritual development and of the aim and motive both of the manner and the matter of his work  his strange mode of expression is shown in these pages to have been the result of deliberate and selfconscious choice the ‘barbaric yawp’ which he sent over ‘the roofs of the world’ so many years ago and which wrung from mr swinburne’s lip such lofty panegyric in song and such loud clamorous censure in prose appears here in what will be to many an entirely new light  for in his very rejection of art walt whitman is an artist  he tried to produce a certain effect by certain means and he succeeded  there is much method in what many have termed his madness too much method indeed some may be tempted to fancy  in the story of his life as he tells it to us we find him at the age of sixteen beginning a definite and philosophical study of literature      summers and falls i used to go off sometimes for a week at a     stretch down in the country or to long island’s seashores—there in     the presence of outdoor influences i went over thoroughly the old     and new testaments and absorb’d probably to better advantage for me     than in any library or indoor room—it makes such difference where     you read shakspere ossian the best translated versions i could get     of homer eschylus sophocles the old german nibelungen the ancient     hindoo poems and one or two other masterpieces dante’s among them     as it happen’d i read the latter mostly in an old wood  the iliad        i read first thoroughly on the peninsula of orient northeast     end of long island in a shelter’d hollow of rock and sand with the     sea on each side  i have wonder’d since why i was not overwhelm’d     by those mighty masters  likely because i read them as described     in the full presence of nature under the sun with the farspreading     landscapes and vistas or the sea rolling in  edgar allan poe’s amusing bit of dogmatism that for our occasions and our day ‘there can be no such thing as a long poem’ fascinated him ‘the same thought had been haunting my mind before’ he said ‘but poe’s argument    work’d the sum out and proved it to me’ and the english translation of the bible seems to have suggested to him the possibility of a poetic form which while retaining the spirit of poetry would still be free from the trammels of rhyme and of a definite metrical system having thus to a certain degree settled upon what one might call the ‘technique’ of whitmanism he began to brood upon the nature of that spirit which was to give life to the strange form  the central point of the poetry of the future seemed to him to be necessarily ‘an identical body and soul a personality’ in fact which personality he tells us frankly ‘after many considerations and ponderings i deliberately settled should be myself’  however for the true creation and revealing of this personality at first only dimly felt a new stimulus was needed  this came from the civil war  after describing the many dreams and passions of his boyhood and early manhood he goes on to say      these however and much more might have gone on and come to naught     almost positively would have come to naught if a sudden vast     terrible direct and indirect stimulus for new and national     declamatory expression had not been given to me  it is certain i     say that although i had made a start before only from the     occurrence of the secession war and what it show’d me as by flashes     of lightning with the emotional depths it sounded and arous’d of     course i don’t mean in my own heart only i saw it just as plainly     in others in millions—that only from the strong flare and     provocation of that war’s sights and scenes the final     reasonsforbeing of an autochthonic and passionate song definitely     came forth      i went down to the war fields of virginia    lived thenceforward     in camp—saw great battles and the days and nights afterward—partook     of all the fluctuations gloom despair hopes again arous’d courage     evoked—death readily risk’d—the cause too—along and filling those     agonistic and lurid following years    the real parturition years        of this henceforth homogeneous union  without those three or     four years and the experiences they gave leaves of grass would not     now be existing  having thus obtained the necessary stimulus for the quickening and awakening of the personal self some day to be endowed with universality he sought to find new notes of song and passing beyond the mere passion for expression he aimed at ‘suggestiveness’ first      i round and finish little if anything and could not consistently     with my scheme  the reader will have his or her part to do just as     much as i have had mine  i seek less to state or display any theme     or thought and more to bring you reader into the atmosphere of the     theme or thought—there to pursue your own flight  another ‘impetusword’ is comradeship and other ‘wordsigns’ are good cheer content and hope  individuality especially he sought for      i have allow’d the stress of my poems from beginning to end to bear     upon american individuality and assist it—not only because that is a     great lesson in nature amid all her generalizing laws but as     counterpoise to the leveling tendencies of democracy—and for other     reasons  defiant of ostensible literary and other conventions i     avowedly chant ‘the great pride of man in himself’ and permit it to     be more or less a motif of nearly all my verse  i think this pride     is indispensable to an american  i think it not inconsistent with     obedience humility deference and selfquestioning  a new theme also was to be found in the relation of the sexes conceived in a natural simple and healthy form and he protests against poor mr william rossetti’s attempt to bowdlerise and expurgate his song      from another point of view leaves of grass is avowedly the song of     sex and amativeness and even animality—though meanings that do not     usually go along with these words are behind all and will duly     emerge and all are sought to be lifted into a different light and     atmosphere  of this feature intentionally palpable in a few lines     i shall only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives     breath to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well     have been left unwritten were those lines omitted         universal as are certain facts and symptoms of communities        there is nothing so rare in modern conventions and poetry as their     normal recognizance  literature is always calling in the doctor for     consultation and confession and always giving evasions and swathing     suppressions in place of that ‘heroic nudity’ on which only a genuine     diagnosis    can be built  and in respect to editions of leaves     of grass in time to come if there should be such i take occasion     now to confirm those lines with the settled convictions and     deliberate renewals of thirty years and to hereby prohibit as far     as word of mine can do so any elision of them  but beyond all these notes and moods and motives is the lofty spirit of a grand and free acceptance of all things that are worthy of existence  he desired he says ‘to formulate a poem whose every thought or fact should directly or indirectly be or connive at an implicit belief in the wisdom health mystery beauty of every process every concrete object every human or other existence not only consider’d from the point of view of all but of each’  his two final utterances are that ‘really great poetry is always    the result of a national spirit and not the privilege of a polish’d and select few’ and that ‘the strongest and sweetest songs yet remain to be sung’  such are the views contained in the opening essay a backward glance o’er travel’d roads as he calls it but there are many other essays in this fascinating volume some on poets such as burns and lord tennyson for whom walt whitman has a profound admiration some on old actors and singers the elder booth forrest alboni and mario being his special favourites others on the native indians on the spanish element in american nationality on western slang on the poetry of the bible and on abraham lincoln  but walt whitman is at his best when he is analysing his own work and making schemes for the poetry of the future literature to him has a distinctly social aim  he seeks to build up the masses by ‘building up grand individuals’  and yet literature itself must be preceded by noble forms of life  ‘the best literature is always the result of something far greater than itself—not the hero but the portrait of the hero  before there can be recorded history or poem there must be the transaction’  certainly in walt whitman’s views there is a largeness of vision a healthy sanity and a fine ethical purpose  he is not to be placed with the professional littérateurs of his country boston novelists new york poets and the like  he stands apart and the chief value of his work is in its prophecy not in its performance  he has begun a prelude to larger themes  he is the herald to a new era  as a man he is the precursor of a fresh type  he is a factor in the heroic and spiritual evolution of the human being  if poetry has passed him by philosophy will take note of him  november boughs  by walt whitman  alexander gardner     irish fairy tales woman’s world february 1889   ‘the various collectors of irish folklore’ says mr w b yeats in his charming little book fairy and folk tales of the irish peasantry ‘have from our point of view one great merit and from the point of view of others one great fault’      they have made their work literature rather than science and told us     of the irish peasantry rather than of the primitive religion of     mankind or whatever else the folklorists are on the gad after  to     be considered scientists they should have tabulated all their tales     in forms like grocers’ bills—item the fairy king item the queen     instead of this they have caught the very voice of the people the     very pulse of life each giving what was most noticed in his day     croker and lover full of the ideas of harumscarum irish gentility     saw everything humorized  the impulse of the irish literature of     their time came from a class that did not—mainly for political     reasons—take the populace seriously and imagined the country as a     humorist’s arcadia its passion its gloom its tragedy they knew     nothing of  what they did was not wholly false they merely     magnified an irresponsible type found oftenest among boatmen     carmen and gentlemen’s servants into the type of a whole nation     and created the stage irishman  the writers of ’fortyeight and the     famine combined burst their bubble  their work had the dash as well     as the shallowness of an ascendant and idle class and in croker is     touched everywhere with beauty—a gentle arcadian beauty  carleton a     peasant born has in many of his stories    more especially in     his ghost stories a much more serious way with him for all his     humour  kennedy an old bookseller in dublin who seems to have had     a something of genuine belief in the fairies comes next in time  he     has far less literary faculty but is wonderfully accurate giving     often the very words the stories were told in  but the best book     since croker is lady wilde’s ancient legends  the humour has all     given way to pathos and tenderness  we have here the innermost heart     of the celt in the moments he has grown to love through years of     persecution when cushioning himself about with dreams and hearing     fairysongs in the twilight he ponders on the soul and on the dead     here is the celt only it is the celt dreaming  into a volume of very moderate dimensions and of extremely moderate price mr yeats has collected together the most characteristic of our irish folklore stories grouping them together according to subject first come the trooping fairies  the peasants say that these are ‘fallen angels who were not good enough to be saved nor bad enough to be lost’ but the irish antiquarians see in them ‘the gods of pagan ireland’ who ‘when no longer worshipped and fed with offerings dwindled away in the popular imagination and now are only a few spans high’  their chief occupations are feasting fighting making love and playing the most beautiful music  ‘they have only one industrious person amongst them the lepracaun—the shoemaker’  it is his duty to repair their shoes when they wear them out with dancing  mr yeats tells us that ‘near the village of ballisodare is a little woman who lived amongst them seven years  when she came home she had no toes—she had danced them off’  on may eve every seventh year they fight for the harvest for the best ears of grain belong to them  an old man informed mr yeats that he saw them fight once and that they tore the thatch off a house ‘had any one else been near they would merely have seen a great wind whirling everything into the air as it passed’  when the wind drives the leaves and straws before it ‘that is the fairies and the peasants take off their hats and say “god bless them”’  when they are gay they sing many of the most beautiful tunes of ireland ‘are only their music caught up by eavesdroppers’  no prudent peasant would hum the pretty girl milking the cow near a fairy rath ‘for they are jealous and do not like to hear their songs on clumsy mortal lips’  blake once saw a fairy’s funeral  but this as mr yeats points out must have been an english fairy for the irish fairies never die they are immortal  then come the solitary fairies amongst whom we find the little lepracaun mentioned above  he has grown very rich as he possesses all the treasurecrocks buried in wartime  in the early part of this century according to croker they used to show in tipperary a little shoe forgotten by the fairy shoemaker  then there are two rather disreputable little fairies—the cluricaun who gets intoxicated in gentlemen’s cellars and the red man who plays unkind practical jokes ‘the feargorta man of hunger is an emaciated phantom that goes through the land in famine time begging an alms and bringing good luck to the giver’  the watersheerie is ‘own brother to the english jacko’lantern’  ‘the leanhaun shee fairy mistress seeks the love of mortals  if they refuse she must be their slave if they consent they are hers and can only escape by finding another to take their place  the fairy lives on their life and they waste away  death is no escape from her  she is the gaelic muse for she gives inspiration to those she persecutes  the gaelic poets die young for she is restless and will not let them remain long on earth’  the pooka is essentially an animal spirit and some have considered him the forefather of shakespeare’s ‘puck’  he lives on solitary mountains and among old ruins ‘grown monstrous with much solitude’ and ‘is of the race of the nightmare’  ‘he has many shapes—is now a horse    now a goat now an eagle  like all spirits he is only half in the world of form’  the banshee does not care much for our democratic levelling tendencies she loves only old families and despises the parvenu or the nouveau riche  when more than one banshee is present and they wail and sing in chorus it is for the death of some holy or great one  an omen that sometimes accompanies the banshee is ‘   an immense black coach mounted by a coffin and drawn by headless horses driven by a dullahan’  a dullahan is the most terrible thing in the world  in 1807 two of the sentries stationed outside st james’s park saw one climbing the railings and died of fright  mr yeats suggests that they are possibly ‘descended from that irish giant who swam across the channel with his head in his teeth’  then come the stories of ghosts of saints and priests and of giants the ghosts live in a state intermediary between this world and the next they are held there by some earthly longing or affection or some duty unfulfilled or anger against the living they are those who are too good for hell and too bad for heaven  sometimes they ‘take the forms of insects especially of butterflies’  the author of the parochial survey of ireland ‘heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly “how do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather”  on november eve they are abroad and dance with the fairies’  as for the saints and priests ‘there are no martyrs in the stories’  that ancient chronicler giraldus cambrensis ‘taunted the archbishop of cashel because no one in ireland had received the crown of martyrdom  “our people may be barbarous” the prelate answered “but they have never lifted their hands against god’s saints but now that a people have come amongst us who know how to make them it was just after the english invasion we shall have martyrs plentifully”’  the giants were the old pagan heroes of ireland who grew bigger and bigger just as the gods grew smaller and smaller the fact is they did not wait for offerings they took them vi et armis  some of the prettiest stories are those that cluster round tírnanog this is the country of the young ‘for age and death have not found it neither tears nor loud laughter have gone near it’  ‘one man has gone there and returned  the bard oisen who wandered away on a white horse moving on the surface of the foam with his fairy niamh lived there three hundred years and then returned looking for his comrades  the moment his foot touched the earth his three hundred years fell on him and he was bowed double and his beard swept the ground  he described his sojourn in the land of youth to patrick before he died’  since then according to mr yeats ‘many have seen it in many places some in the depths of lakes and have heard rising therefrom a vague sound of bells more have seen it far off on the horizon as they peered out from the western cliffs  not three years ago a fisherman imagined that he saw it’  mr yeats has certainly done his work very well  he has shown great critical capacity in his selection of the stories and his little introductions are charmingly written  it is delightful to come across a collection of purely imaginative work and mr yeats has a very quick instinct in finding out the best and the most beautiful things in irish folklore  i am also glad to see that he has not confined himself entirely to prose but has included allingham’s lovely poem on the fairies      up the airy mountain        down the rushy glen     we daren’t go ahunting        for fear of little men     wee folk good folk        trooping all together     green jacket red cap        and white owl’s feather      down along the rocky shore        some make their home     they live on crispy pancakes        of yellow tidefoam     some in the reeds        of the black mountain lake     with frogs for their watchdogs        all night awake      high on the hilltop        the old king sits     he is now so old and gray        he’s nigh lost his wits     with a bridge of white mist        columbkill he crosses     on his stately journeys        from slieveleague to rosses     or going up with music        on cold starry nights     to sup with the queen        of the gay northern lights  all lovers of fairy tales and folklore should get this little book  the horned women the priest’s soul 157 and teig o’kane are really marvellous in their way and indeed there is hardly a single story that is not worth reading and thinking over  fairy and folk tales of the irish peasantry  edited and selected by w b yeats  walter scott     mr w b yeats woman’s world march 1889   ‘the wanderings of oisin and other poems is i believe the first volume of poems that mr yeats has published and it is certainly full of promise  it must be admitted that many of the poems are too fragmentary too incomplete  they read like stray scenes out of unfinished plays like things only half remembered or at best but dimly seen  but the architectonic power of construction the power to build up and make perfect a harmonious whole is nearly always the latest as it certainly is the highest development of the artistic temperament  it is somewhat unfair to expect it in early work  one quality mr yeats has in a marked degree a quality that is not common in the work of our minor poets and is therefore all the more welcome to us—i mean the romantic temper  he is essentially celtic and his verse at its best is celtic also strongly influenced by keats he seems to study how to ‘load every rift with ore’ yet is more fascinated by the beauty of words than by the beauty of metrical music  the spirit that dominates the whole book is perhaps more valuable than any individual poem or particular passage but this from the wanderings of oisin is worth quoting  it describes the ride to the island of forgetfulness      and the ears of the horse went sinking away in the hollow light        for as drift from a sailor slow drowning the gleams of the world     and the sun     ceased on our hands and faces on hazel and oak leaf the light        and the stars were blotted above us and the whole of the world     was one      till the horse gave a whinny for cumbrous with stems of the hazel     and oak        of hollies and hazels and oaktrees a valley was sloping away     from his hoofs in the heavy grasses with monstrous slumbering folk        their mighty and naked and gleaming bodies heaped loose where they     lay      more comely than man may make them inlaid with silver and gold        were arrow and shield and waraxe arrow and spear and blade     and dewblanched horns in whose hollows a child of three years old        could sleep on a couch of rushes round and about them laid  and this which deals with the old legend of the city lying under the waters of a lake is strange and interesting      the maker of the stars and worlds        sat underneath the market cross     and the old men were walking walking        and little boys played pitchandtoss      ‘the props’ said he ‘of stars and worlds        are prayers of patient men and good     the boys the women and old men        listening upon their shadows stood      a grey professor passing cried        ‘how few the mind’s intemperance rule     what shallow thoughts about deep things        the world grows old and plays the fool’      the mayor came leaning his left ear—        there were some talking of the poor—     and to himself cried ‘communist’        and hurried to the guardhouse door      the bishop came with open book        whispering along the sunny path     there was some talking of man’s god        his god of stupor and of wrath      the bishop murmured ‘atheist        how sinfully the wicked scoff’     and sent the old men on their way        and drove the boys and women off      the place was empty now of people        a cock came by upon his toes     an old horse looked across the fence        and rubbed along the rail his nose      the maker of the stars and worlds        to his own house did him betake     and on that city dropped a tear        and now that city is a lake  mr yeats has a great deal of invention and some of the poems in his book such as mosada jealousy and the island of statues are very finely conceived  it is impossible to doubt after reading his present volume that he will some day give us work of high import  up to this he has been merely trying the strings of his instrument running over the keys  the wanderings of oisin and other poems  by w b yeats  kegan paul     mr yeats’s wanderings of oisin pall mall gazette july 12 1889   books of poetry by young writers are usually promissory notes that are never met  now and then however one comes across a volume that is so far above the average that one can hardly resist the fascinating temptation of recklessly prophesying a fine future for its author  such a book mr yeats’s wanderings of oisin certainly is  here we find nobility of treatment and nobility of subjectmatter delicacy of poetic instinct and richness of imaginative resource  unequal and uneven much of the work must be admitted to be  mr yeats does not try to ‘outbaby’ wordsworth we are glad to say but he occasionally succeeds in ‘outglittering’ keats and here and there in his book we come across strange crudities and irritating conceits  but when he is at his best he is very good  if he has not the grand simplicity of epic treatment he has at least something of the largeness of vision that belongs to the epical temper  he does not rob of their stature the great heroes of celtic mythology  he is very naïve and very primitive and speaks of his giants with the air of a child  here is a characteristic passage from the account of oisin’s return from the island of forgetfulness      and i rode by the plains of the sea’s edge where all is barren and     grey        grey sands on the green of the grasses and over the dripping     trees     dripping and doubling landward as though they would hasten away        like an army of old men longing for rest from the moan of the     seas      long fled the foamflakes around me the winds fled out of the vast        snatching the bird in secret nor knew i embosomed apart     when they froze the cloth on my body like armour riveted fast        for remembrance lifting her leanness keened in the gates of my     heart      till fattening the winds of the morning an odour of newmown hay        came and my forehead fell low and my tears like berries fell     down     later a sound came half lost in the sound of a shore far away        from the great grassbarnacle calling and later the shorewinds     brown      if i were as i once was the gold hooves crushing the sand and the     shells        coming forth from the sea like the morning with red lips murmuring     a song     not coughing my head on my knees and praying and wroth with the     bells        i would leave no saint’s head on his body though spacious his     lands were and strong      making way from the kindling surges i rode on a bridlepath        much wondering to see upon all hands of wattle and woodwork made     thy bellmounted churches and guardless the sacred cairn and the     earth        and a small and feeble populace stooping with mattock and spade  in one or two places the music is faulty the construction is sometimes too involved and the word ‘populace’ in the last line is rather infelicitous but when all is said it is impossible not to feel in these stanzas the presence of the true poetic spirit  the wanderings of oisin and other poems  by w b yeats  kegan paul     mr william morris’s last book pall mall gazette march 2 1889   mr morris’s last book is a piece of pure art workmanship from beginning to end and the very remoteness of its style from the common language and ordinary interests of our day gives to the whole story a strange beauty and an unfamiliar charm  it is written in blended prose and verse like the mediæval ‘cantefable’ and tells the tale of the house of the wolfings in its struggles against the legionaries of rome then advancing into northern germany  it is a kind of saga and the language in which the folkepic as we may call it is set forth recalls the antique dignity and directness of our english tongue four centuries ago  from an artistic point of view it may be described as an attempt to return by a selfconscious effort to the conditions of an earlier and a fresher age attempts of this kind are not uncommon in the history of art  from some such feeling came the preraphaelite movement of our own day and the archaistic movement of later greek sculpture  when the result is beautiful the method is justified and no shrill insistence upon a supposed necessity for absolute modernity of form can prevail against the value of work that has the incomparable excellence of style  certainly mr morris’s work possesses this excellence  his fine harmonies and rich cadences create in the reader that spirit by which alone can its own spirit be interpreted awake in him something of the temper of romance and by taking him out of his own age place him in a truer and more vital relation to the great masterpieces of all time  it is a bad thing for an age to be always looking in art for its own reflection  it is well that now and then we are given work that is nobly imaginative in its method and purely artistic in its aim  as we read mr morris’s story with its fine alternations of verse and prose its decorative and descriptive beauties its wonderful handling of romantic and adventurous themes we cannot but feel that we are as far removed from the ignoble fiction as we are from the ignoble facts of our own day  we breathe a purer air and have dreams of a time when life had a kind of poetical quality of its own and was simple and stately and complete  the tragic interest of the house of the wolfings centres round the figure of thiodolf the great hero of the tribe  the goddess who loves him gives him as he goes to battle against the romans a magical hauberk on which rests this strange fate that he who wears it shall save his own life and destroy the life of his land  thiodolf finding out this secret brings the hauberk back to the woodsun as she is called and chooses death for himself rather than the ruin of his cause and so the story ends  but mr morris has always preferred romance to tragedy and set the development of action above the concentration of passion  his story is like some splendid old tapestry crowded with stately images and enriched with delicate and delightful detail  the impression it leaves on us is not of a single central figure dominating the whole but rather of a magnificent design to which everything is subordinated and by which everything becomes of enduring import  it is the whole presentation of the primitive life that really fascinates  what in other hands would have been mere archæology is here transformed by quick artistic instinct and made wonderful for us and human and full of high interest  the ancient world seems to have come to life again for our pleasure  of a work so large and so coherent completed with no less perfection than it is conceived it is difficult by mere quotation to give any adequate idea  this however may serve as an example of its narrative power  the passage describes the visit of thiodolf to the woodsun      the moonlight lay in a great flood on the grass without and the dew     was falling in the coldest hour of the night and the earth smelled     sweetly the whole habitation was asleep now and there was no sound     to be known as the sound of any creature save that from the distant     meadow came the lowing of a cow that had lost her calf and that a     white owl was flitting about near the eaves of the roof with her wild     cry that sounded like the mocking of merriment now silent  thiodolf     turned toward the wood and walked steadily through the scattered     hazeltrees and thereby into the thick of the beechtrees whose     boles grew smooth and silvergrey high and closeset and so on and     on he went as one going by a wellknown path though there was no     path till all the moonlight was quenched under the close roof of the     beechleaves though yet for all the darkness no man could go there     and not feel that the roof was green above him  still he went on in     despite of the darkness till at last there was a glimmer before him     that grew greater till he came unto a small woodlawn whereon the     turf grew again though the grass was but thin because little     sunlight got to it so close and thick were the tall trees round     about it    nought looked thiodolf either at the heavens above     or the trees as he strode from off the huskstrewn floor of the     beech wood on to the scanty grass of the lawn but his eyes looked     straight before him at that which was amidmost of the lawn and     little wonder was that for there on a stone chair sat a woman     exceeding fair clad in glittering raiment her hair lying as pale in     the moonlight on the grey stone as the barley acres in the august     night before the reapinghook goes in amongst them  she sat there as     though she were awaiting some one and he made no stop nor stay but     went straight up to her and took her in his arms and kissed her     mouth and her eyes and she him again and then he sat himself down     beside her  as an example of the beauty of the verse we would take this from the song of the woodsun  it at least shows how perfectly the poetry harmonizes with the prose and how natural the transition is from the one to the other      in many a stead doom dwelleth nor sleepeth day nor night     the rim of the bowl she kisseth and beareth the chambering light     when the kings of men wend happy to the bridebed from the board     it is little to say that she wendeth the edge of the grinded sword     when about the house half builded she hangeth many a day     the ship from the strand she shoveth and on his wonted way     by the mountain hunter fareth where his foot ne’er failed before     she is where the high bank crumbles at last on the river’s shore     the mower’s scythe she whetteth and lulleth the shepherd to sleep     where the deadly lingworm wakeneth in the desert of the sheep     now we that come of the godkin of her redes for ourselves we wot     but her will with the lives of menfolk and their ending know we not     so therefore i bid thee not fear for thyself of doom and her deed     but for me and i bid thee hearken to the helping of my need     or else—art thou happy in life or lusteth thou to die     in the flower of thy days when thy glory and thy longing bloom on     high  the last chapter of the book in which we are told of the great feast made for the dead is so finely written that we cannot refrain from quoting this passage      now was the glooming falling upon the earth but the hall was bright     within even as the hallsun had promised  therein was set forth the     treasure of the wolfings fair cloths were hung on the walls goodly     broidered garments on the pillars goodly brazen cauldrons and     faircarven chests were set down in nooks where men could see them     well and vessels of gold and silver were set all up and down the     tables of the feast  the pillars also were wreathed with flowers     and flowers hung garlanded from the walls over the precious hangings     sweet gums and spices were burning in fairwrought censers of brass     and so many candles were alight under the roof that scarce had it     looked more ablaze when the romans had litten the faggots therein for     its burning amidst the hurry of the morning battle      there then they fell to feasting hallowing in the hightide of their     return with victory in their hands and the dead corpses of thiodolf     and otter clad in precious glittering raiment looked down on them     from the highseat and the kindreds worshipped them and were glad     and they drank the cup to them before any others were they gods or     men  in days of uncouth realism and unimaginative imitation it is a high pleasure to welcome work of this kind  it is a work in which all lovers of literature cannot fail to delight  a tale of the house of the wolfings and all the kindreds of the mark written in prose and in verse by william morris  reeves and turner     some literary notes woman’s world april 1889   ‘in modern life’ said matthew arnold once ‘you cannot well enter a monastery but you can enter the wordsworth society’  i fear that this will sound to many a somewhat uninviting description of this admirable and useful body whose papers and productions have been recently published by professor knight under the title of wordsworthiana ‘plain living and high thinking’ are not popular ideals  most people prefer to live in luxury and to think with the majority  however there is really nothing in the essays and addresses of the wordsworth society that need cause the public any unnecessary alarm and it is gratifying to note that although the society is still in the first blush of enthusiasm it has not yet insisted upon our admiring wordsworth’s inferior work  it praises what is worthy of praise reverences what should be reverenced and explains what does not require explanation one paper is quite delightful it is from the pen of mr rawnsley and deals with such reminiscences of wordsworth as still linger among the peasantry of westmoreland  mr rawnsley grew up he tells us in the immediate vicinity of the present poetlaureate’s old home in lincolnshire and had been struck with the swiftness with which      as year by year the labourer tills     his wonted glebe or lops the glades  the memories of the poet of the somersby wold had ‘faded from off the circle of the hills’—had indeed been astonished to note how little real interest was taken in him or his fame and how seldom his works were met with in the houses of the rich or poor in the very neighbourhood accordingly when he came to reside in the lake country he endeavoured to find out what of wordsworth’s memory among the men of the dales still lingered on—how far he was still a moving presence among them—how far his works had made their way into the cottages and farmhouses of the valleys he also tried to discover how far the race of westmoreland and cumberland farmfolk—the ‘matthews’ and the ‘michaels’ of the poet as described by him—were real or fancy pictures or how far the characters of the dalesmen had been altered in any remarkable manner by tourist influences during the thirtytwo years that have passed since the lake poet was laid to rest  with regard to the latter point it will be remembered that mr ruskin writing in 1876 said that ‘the border peasantry painted with absolute fidelity by scott and wordsworth’ are as hitherto a scarcely injured race that in his fields at coniston he had men who might have fought with henry v at agincourt without being distinguished from any of his knights that he could take his tradesmen’s word for a thousand pounds and need never latch his garden gate and that he did not fear molestation in wood or on moor for his girl guests  mr rawnsley however found that a certain beauty had vanished which the simple retirement of old valley days fifty years ago gave to the men among whom wordsworth lived  ‘the strangers’ he says ‘with their gifts of gold their vulgarity and their requirements have much to answer for’  as for their impressions of wordsworth to understand them one must understand the vernacular of the lake district  ‘what was mr wordsworth like in personal appearance’ said mr rawnsley once to an old retainer who still lives not far from rydal mount  ‘he was a uglyfaäced man and a meänliver’ was the answer but all that was really meant was that he was a man of marked features and led a very simple life in matters of food and raiment  another old man who believed that wordsworth ‘got most of his poetry out of hartley’ spoke of the poet’s wife as ‘a very onpleasant woman very onpleasant indeed  a closefisted woman that’s what she was’  this however seems to have been merely a tribute to mrs wordsworth’s admirable housekeeping qualities  the first person interviewed by mr rawnsley was an old lady who had been once in service at rydal mount and was in 1870 a lodginghouse keeper at grasmere  she was not a very imaginative person as may be gathered from the following anecdote—mr rawnsley’s sister came in from a late evening walk and said ‘o mrs d have you seen the wonderful sunset’  the good lady turned sharply round and drawing herself to her full height as if mortally offended answered ‘no miss i’m a tidy cook i know and “they say” a decentish body for a landlady but i don’t knaw nothing about sunsets or them sort of things they’ve never been in my line’  her reminiscence of wordsworth was as worthy of tradition as it was explanatory from her point of view of the method in which wordsworth composed and was helped in his labours by his enthusiastic sister  ‘well you know’ she said ‘mr wordsworth went humming and booing about and she miss dorothy kept close behint him and she picked up the bits as he let ’em fall and tak’ ’em down and put ’em together on paper for him  and you may be very well sure as how she didn’t understand nor make sense out of ’em and i doubt that he didn’t know much about them either himself but howivver there’s a great many folk as do i dare say’  of wordsworth’s habit of talking to himself and composing aloud we hear a great deal  ‘was mr wordsworth a sociable man’ asked mr rawnsley of a rydal farmer  ‘wudsworth for a’ he had noa pride nor nowt’ was the answer ‘was a man who was quite one to hissel ye kna  he was not a man as folks could crack wi’ nor not a man as could crack wi’ folks  but there was another thing as kep’ folk off he had a ter’ble girt deep voice and ye might see his faace agaan for long enuff  i’ve knoan folks village lads and lasses coming over by old road above which runs from grasmere to rydal flayt a’most to death there by wishing gaate to hear the girt voice a groanin’ and mutterin’ and thunderin’ of a still evening  and he had a way of standin’ quite still by the rock there in t’ path under rydal and folks could hear sounds like a wild beast coming from the rocks and childer were scared fit to be dead a’most’  wordsworth’s description of himself constantly recurs to one      and who is he with modest looks        and clad in sober russet gown     he murmurs by the running brooks        a music sweeter than their own     he is retired as noontide dew     or fountain in a noonday grove  but the corroboration comes in strange guise  mr rawnsley asked one of the dalesmen about wordsworth’s dress and habits  this was the reply ‘wudsworth wore a jem crow never seed him in a boxer in my life—a jem crow and an old blue cloak was his rig and as for his habits he had noan niver knew him with a pot i’ his hand or a pipe i’ his mouth but he was a greät skater for a’ that—noan better in these parts—why he could cut his own naäme upo’ the ice could mr wudsworth’  skating seems to have been wordsworth’s one form of amusement  he was ‘over feckless i’ his hands’—could not drive or ride—‘not a bit of fish in him’ and ‘nowt of a mountaineer’  but he could skate  the rapture of the time when as a boy on esthwaite’s frozen lake he had               wheeled about     proud and exulting like an untired horse     that cares not for his home and shod with steel     had hissed along the polished ice  was continued mr rawnsley tells us into manhood’s later day and mr rawnsley found many proofs that the skill the poet had gained when      not seldom from the uproar he retired     into a silent bay or sportively     glanced sideways leaving the tumultuous throng     to cut across the reflex of a star  was of such a kind as to astonish the natives among whom he dwelt  the recollection of a fall he once had when his skate caught on a stone still lingers in the district  a boy had been sent to sweep the snow from the white moss tarn for him  ‘did mr wudsworth gie ye owt’ he was asked when he returned from his labour  ‘na but i seed him tumlle though’ was the answer  ‘he was a ter’ble girt skater was wudsworth now’ says one of mr rawnsley’s informants ‘he would put one hand i’ his breast he wore a frill shirt i’ them days and t’ other hand i’ his waistband same as shepherds does to keep their hands warm and he would stand up straight and sway and swing away grandly’  of his poetry they did not think much and whatever was good in it they ascribed to his wife his sister and hartley coleridge  he wrote poetry they said ‘because he couldn’t help it—because it was his hobby’—for sheer love and not for money  they could not understand his doing work ‘for nowt’ and held his occupation in somewhat light esteem because it did not bring in ‘a deal o’ brass to the pocket’  ‘did you ever read his poetry or see any books about in the farmhouses’ asked mr rawnsley  the answer was curious ‘ay ay time or two  but ya’re weel aware there’s potry and potry  there’s potry wi’ a li’le bit pleasant in it and potry sic as a man can laugh at or the childer understand and some as takes a deal of mastery to make out what’s said and a deal of wudsworth’s was this sort ye kna  you could tell fra the man’s faace his potry would niver have no laugh in it  his potry was quite different work from li’le hartley  hartley ’ud goa running along beside o’ the brooks and mak his and goa in the first oppen door and write what he had got upo’ paper  but wudsworth’s potry was real hard stuff and bided a deal of makking and he’d keep it in his head for long enough  eh but it’s queer mon different ways folks hes of making potry now     not but what mr wudsworth didn’t stand very high and was a wellspoken man enough’  the best criticism on wordsworth that mr rawnsley heard was this ‘he was an openair man and a great critic of trees’  there are many useful and wellwritten essays in professor knight’s volume but mr rawnsley’s is far the most interesting of all  it gives us a graphic picture of the poet as he appeared in outward semblance and manner to those about whom he wrote  wordsworthiana a selection from papers read to the wordsworth society  edited by william knight  macmillan and co     mr swinburne’s poems and ballads third series pall mall gazette june 27 1889   mr swinburne once set his age on fire by a volume of very perfect and very poisonous poetry  then he became revolutionary and pantheistic and cried out against those that sit in high places both in heaven and on earth  then he invented marie stuart and laid upon us the heavy burden of bothwell  then he retired to the nursery and wrote poems about children of a somewhat oversubtle character  he is now extremely patriotic and manages to combine with his patriotism a strong affection for the tory party  he has always been a great poet  but he has his limitations the chief of which is curiously enough the entire lack of any sense of limit  his song is nearly always too loud for his subject his magnificent rhetoric nowhere more magnificent than in the volume that now lies before us conceals rather than reveals  it has been said of him and with truth that he is a master of language but with still greater truth it may be said that language is his master  words seem to dominate him  alliteration tyrannizes over him  mere sound often becomes his lord  he is so eloquent that whatever he touches becomes unreal  let us turn to the poem on the armada      the wings of the southwest wind are widened the breath of his     fervent lips     more keen than a sword’s edge fiercer than fire falls full on the     plunging ships     the pilot is he of the northward flight their stay and their     steersman he     a helmsman clothed with the tempest and girdled with strength to     constrain the sea     and the host of them trembles and quails caught fast in his hand as     a bird in the toils     for the wrath and the joy that fulfil him are mightier than man’s     whom he slays and spoils     and vainly with heart divided in sunder and labour of wavering     will     the lord of their host takes counsel with hope if haply their star     shine still  somehow we seem to have heard all this before  does it come from the fact that of all the poets who ever lived mr swinburne is the one who is the most limited in imagery  it must be admitted that he is so  he has wearied us with his monotony  ‘fire’ and the ‘sea’ are the two words ever on his lips  we must confess also that this shrill singing—marvellous as it is—leaves us out of breath  here is a passage from a poem called a word with the wind      be the sunshine bared or veiled the sky superb or shrouded        still the waters lax and languid chafed and foiled     keen and thwarted pale and patient clothed with fire or clouded        vex their heart in vain or sleep like serpents coiled     thee they look for blind and baffled wan with wrath and weary        blown for ever back by winds that rock the bird     winds that seamews breast subdue the sea and bid the dreary        waves be weak as hearts made sick with hope deferred     let the clarion sound from westward let the south bear token        how the glories of thy godhead sound and shine     bid the land rejoice to see the landwind’s broad wings broken        bid the sea take comfort bid the world be thine  verse of this kind may be justly praised for the sustained strength and vigour of its metrical scheme  its purely technical excellence is extraordinary  but is it more than an oratorical tour de force  does it really convey much  does it charm  could we return to it again and again with renewed pleasure  we think not  it seems to us empty  of course we must not look to these poems for any revelation of human life  to be at one with the elements seems to be mr swinburne’s aim he seeks to speak with the breath of wind and wave  the roar of the fire is ever in his ears  he puts his clarion to the lips of spring and bids her blow and the earth wakes from her dreams and tells him her secret he is the first lyric poet who has tried to make an absolute surrender of his own personality and he has succeeded  we hear the song but we never know the singer  we never even get near to him  out of the thunder and splendour of words he himself says nothing  we have often had man’s interpretation of nature now we have nature’s interpretation of man and she has curiously little to say  force and freedom form her vague message  she deafens us with her clangours  but mr swinburne is not always riding the whirlwind and calling out of the depths of the sea  romantic ballads in border dialect have not lost their fascination for him and this last volume contains some very splendid examples of this curious artificial kind of poetry  the amount of pleasure one gets out of dialect is a matter entirely of temperament to say ‘mither’ instead of ‘mother’ seems to many the acme of romance there are others who are not quite so ready to believe in the pathos of provincialism  there is however no doubt of mr swinburne’s mastery over the form whether the form be quite legitimate or not  the weary wedding has the concentration and colour of a great drama and the quaintness of its style lends it something of the power of a grotesque the ballad of the witchmother a mediæval medea who slays her children because her lord is faithless is worth reading on account of its horrible simplicity  the bride’s tragedy with its strange refrain of      in in out and in     blaws the wind and whirls the whin  the jacobite’s exile—      o lordly flow the loire and seine        and loud the dark durance     but bonnier shine the braes of tyne        than a’ the fields of france     and the waves of till that speak sae still        gleam goodlier where they glance  the tyneside widow and a reiver’s neckverse are all poems of fine imaginative power and some of them are terrible in their fierce intensity of passion  there is no danger of english poetry narrowing itself to a form so limited as the romantic ballad in dialect  it is of too vital a growth for that  so we may welcome mr swinburne’s masterly experiments with the hope that things which are inimitable will not be imitated  the collection is completed by a few poems on children some sonnets a threnody on john william inchbold and a lovely lyric entitled the interpreters      in human thought have all things habitation              our days     laugh lower and lighten past and find no station              that stays      but thought and faith are mightier things than time              can wrong     made splendid once by speech or made sublime              by song      remembrance though the tide of change that rolls              wax hoary     gives earth and heaven for song’s sake and the soul’s              their glory  certainly ‘for song’s sake’ we should love mr swinburne’s work cannot indeed help loving it so marvellous a musicmaker is he  but what of the soul  for the soul we must go elsewhere  poems and ballads  third series  by algernon charles swinburne chatto and windus     a chinese sage speaker february 8 1890   an eminent oxford theologian once remarked that his only objection to modern progress was that it progressed forward instead of backward—a view that so fascinated a certain artistic undergraduate that he promptly wrote an essay upon some unnoticed analogies between the development of ideas and the movements of the common seacrab  i feel sure the speaker will not be suspected even by its most enthusiastic friends of holding this dangerous heresy of retrogression  but i must candidly admit that i have come to the conclusion that the most caustic criticism of modern life i have met with for some time is that contained in the writings of the learned chuang tzŭ recently translated into the vulgar tongue by mr herbert giles her majesty’s consul at tamsui  the spread of popular education has no doubt made the name of this great thinker quite familiar to the general public but for the sake of the few and the overcultured i feel it my duty to state definitely who he was and to give a brief outline of the character of his philosophy  chuang tzŭ whose name must carefully be pronounced as it is not written was born in the fourth century before christ by the banks of the yellow river in the flowery land and portraits of the wonderful sage seated on the flying dragon of contemplation may still be found on the simple teatrays and pleasing screens of many of our most respectable suburban households  the honest ratepayer and his healthy family have no doubt often mocked at the domelike forehead of the philosopher and laughed over the strange perspective of the landscape that lies beneath him  if they really knew who he was they would tremble  chuang tzŭ spent his life in preaching the great creed of inaction and in pointing out the uselessness of all useful things  ‘do nothing and everything will be done’ was the doctrine which he inherited from his great master lao tzŭ to resolve action into thought and thought into abstraction was his wicked transcendental aim  like the obscure philosopher of early greek speculation he believed in the identity of contraries like plato he was an idealist and had all the idealist’s contempt for utilitarian systems he was a mystic like dionysius and scotus erigena and jacob böhme and held with them and with philo that the object of life was to get rid of selfconsciousness and to become the unconscious vehicle of a higher illumination  in fact chuang tzŭ may be said to have summed up in himself almost every mood of european metaphysical or mystical thought from heraclitus down to hegel  there was something in him of the quietist also and in his worship of nothing he may be said to have in some measure anticipated those strange dreamers of mediæval days who like tauler and master eckhart adored the purum nihil and the abyss the great middle classes of this country to whom as we all know our prosperity if not our civilization is entirely due may shrug their shoulders over all this and ask with a certain amount of reason what is the identity of contraries to them and why they should get rid of that selfconsciousness which is their chief characteristic  but chuang tzŭ was something more than a metaphysician and an illuminist  he sought to destroy society as we know it as the middle classes know it and the sad thing is that he combines with the passionate eloquence of a rousseau the scientific reasoning of a herbert spencer  there is nothing of the sentimentalist in him  he pities the rich more than the poor if he even pities at all and prosperity seems to him as tragic a thing as suffering  he has nothing of the modern sympathy with failures nor does he propose that the prizes should always be given on moral grounds to those who come in last in the race  it is the race itself that he objects to and as for active sympathy which has become the profession of so many worthy people in our own day he thinks that trying to make others good is as silly an occupation as ‘beating a drum in a forest in order to find a fugitive’  it is a mere waste of energy  that is all while as for a thoroughly sympathetic man he is in the eyes of chuang tzŭ simply a man who is always trying to be somebody else and so misses the only possible excuse for his own existence  yes incredible as it may seem this curious thinker looked back with a sigh of regret to a certain golden age when there were no competitive examinations no wearisome educational systems no missionaries no penny dinners for the people no established churches no humanitarian societies no dull lectures about one’s duty to one’s neighbour and no tedious sermons about any subject at all  in those ideal days he tells us people loved each other without being conscious of charity or writing to the newspapers about it  they were upright and yet they never published books upon altruism  as every man kept his knowledge to himself the world escaped the curse of scepticism and as every man kept his virtues to himself nobody meddled in other people’s business  they lived simple and peaceful lives and were contented with such food and raiment as they could get  neighbouring districts were in sight and ‘the cocks and dogs of one could be heard in the other’ yet the people grew old and died without ever interchanging visits  there was no chattering about clever men and no laudation of good men  the intolerable sense of obligation was unknown  the deeds of humanity left no trace and their affairs were not made a burden for prosperity by foolish historians  in an evil moment the philanthropist made his appearance and brought with him the mischievous idea of government  ‘there is such a thing’ says chuang tzŭ ‘as leaving mankind alone there has never been such a thing as governing mankind’  all modes of government are wrong  they are unscientific because they seek to alter the natural environment of man they are immoral because by interfering with the individual they produce the most aggressive forms of egotism they are ignorant because they try to spread education they are selfdestructive because they engender anarchy  ‘of old’ he tells us ‘the yellow emperor first caused charity and duty to one’s neighbour to interfere with the natural goodness of the heart of man  in consequence of this yao and shun wore the hair off their legs in endeavouring to feed their people  they disturbed their internal economy in order to find room for artificial virtues  they exhausted their energies in framing laws and they were failures’  man’s heart our philosopher goes on to say may be ‘forced down or stirred up’ and in either case the issue is fatal  yao made the people too happy so they were not satisfied  chieh made them too wretched so they grew discontented  then every one began to argue about the best way of tinkering up society  ‘it is quite clear that something must be done’ they said to each other and there was a general rush for knowledge  the results were so dreadful that the government of the day had to bring in coercion and as a consequence of this ‘virtuous men sought refuge in mountain caves while rulers of state sat trembling in ancestral halls’  then when everything was in a state of perfect chaos the social reformers got up on platforms and preached salvation from the ills that they and their system had caused  the poor social reformers ‘they know not shame nor what it is to blush’ is the verdict of chuang tzŭ upon them  the economic question also is discussed by this almondeyed sage at great length and he writes about the curse of capital as eloquently as mr hyndman  the accumulation of wealth is to him the origin of evil it makes the strong violent and the weak dishonest  it creates the petty thief and puts him in a bamboo cage  it creates the big thief and sets him on a throne of white jade  it is the father of competition and competition is the waste as well as the destruction of energy  the order of nature is rest repetition and peace  weariness and war are the results of an artificial society based upon capital and the richer this society gets the more thoroughly bankrupt it really is for it has neither sufficient rewards for the good nor sufficient punishments for the wicked  there is also this to be remembered—that the prizes of the world degrade a man as much as the world’s punishments  the age is rotten with its worship of success  as for education true wisdom can neither be learnt nor taught  it is a spiritual state to which he who lives in harmony with nature attains  knowledge is shallow if we compare it with the extent of the unknown and only the unknowable is of value society produces rogues and education makes one rogue cleverer than another  that is the only result of school boards  besides of what possible philosophic importance can education be when it serves simply to make each man differ from his neighbour  we arrive ultimately at a chaos of opinions doubt everything and fall into the vulgar habit of arguing and it is only the intellectually lost who ever argue  look at hui tzu  ‘he was a man of many ideas  his work would fill five carts but his doctrines were paradoxical’  he said that there were feathers in an egg because there were feathers on a chicken that a dog could be a sheep because all names were arbitrary that there was a moment when a swiftflying arrow was neither moving nor at rest that if you took a stick a foot long and cut it in half every day you would never come to the end of it and that a bay horse and a dun cow were three because taken separately they were two and taken together they were one and one and two made up three  ‘he was like a man running a race with his own shadow and making a noise in order to drown the echo  he was a clever gadfly that was all  what was the use of him’  morality is of course a different thing  it went out of fashion says chuang tzŭ when people began to moralize  men ceased then to be spontaneous and to act on intuition  they became priggish and artificial and were so blind as to have a definite purpose in life then came governments and philanthropists those two pests of the age the former tried to coerce people into being good and so destroyed the natural goodness of man  the latter were a set of aggressive busybodies who caused confusion wherever they went  they were stupid enough to have principles and unfortunate enough to act up to them  they all came to bad ends and showed that universal altruism is as bad in its results as universal egotism  ‘they tripped people up over charity and fettered them with duties to their neighbours’  they gushed over music and fussed over ceremonies  as a consequence of all this the world lost its equilibrium and has been staggering ever since  who then according to chuang tzŭ is the perfect man  and what is his manner of life  the perfect man does nothing beyond gazing at the universe  he adopts no absolute position  ‘in motion he is like water at rest he is like a mirror  and like echo he answers only when he is called upon’  he lets externals take care of themselves  nothing material injures him nothing spiritual punishes him  his mental equilibrium gives him the empire of the world  he is never the slave of objective existences  he knows that ‘just as the best language is that which is never spoken so the best action is that which is never done’ he is passive and accepts the laws of life  he rests in inactivity and sees the world become virtuous of itself  he does not try to ‘bring about his own good deeds’  he never wastes himself on effort  he is not troubled about moral distinctions  he knows that things are what they are and that their consequences will be what they will be  his mind is the ‘speculum of creation’ and he is ever at peace  all this is of course excessively dangerous but we must remember that chuang tzŭ lived more than two thousand years ago and never had the opportunity of seeing our unrivalled civilization  and yet it is possible that were he to come back to earth and visit us he might have something to say to mr balfour about his coercion and active misgovernment in ireland he might smile at some of our philanthropic ardours and shake his head over many of our organized charities the school board might not impress him nor our race for wealth stir his admiration he might wonder at our ideals and grow sad over what we have realized  perhaps it is well that chuang tzŭ cannot return  meanwhile thanks to mr giles and mr quaritch we have his book to console us and certainly it is a most fascinating and delightful volume chuang tzŭ is one of the darwinians before darwin  he traces man from the germ and sees his unity with nature  as an anthropologist he is excessively interesting and he describes our primitive arboreal ancestor living in trees through his terror of animals stronger than himself and knowing only one parent the mother with all the accuracy of a lecturer at the royal society  like plato he adopts the dialogue as his mode of expression ‘putting words into other people’s mouths’ he tells us ‘in order to gain breadth of view’  as a storyteller he is charming  the account of the visit of the respectable confucius to the great robber chê is most vivid and brilliant and it is impossible not to laugh over the ultimate discomfiture of the sage the barrenness of whose moral platitudes is ruthlessly exposed by the successful brigand  even in his metaphysics chuang tzŭ is intensely humorous  he personifies his abstractions and makes them act plays before us  the spirit of the clouds when passing eastward through the expanse of air happened to fall in with the vital principle  the latter was slapping his ribs and hopping about whereupon the spirit of the clouds said ‘who are you old man and what are you doing’  ‘strolling’ replied the vital principle without stopping for all activities are ceaseless  ‘i want to know something’ continued the spirit of the clouds  ‘ah’ cried the vital principle in a tone of disapprobation and a marvellous conversation follows that is not unlike the dialogue between the sphinx and the chimera in flaubert’s curious drama  talking animals also have their place in chuang tzŭ’s parables and stories and through myth and poetry and fancy his strange philosophy finds musical utterance  of course it is sad to be told that it is immoral to be consciously good and that doing anything is the worst form of idleness  thousands of excellent and really earnest philanthropists would be absolutely thrown upon the rates if we adopted the view that nobody should be allowed to meddle in what does not concern him  the doctrine of the uselessness of all useful things would not merely endanger our commercial supremacy as a nation but might bring discredit upon many prosperous and seriousminded members of the shopkeeping classes  what would become of our popular preachers our exeter hall orators our drawingroom evangelists if we said to them in the words of chuang tzŭ ‘mosquitoes will keep a man awake all night with their biting and just in the same way this talk of charity and duty to one’s neighbour drives us nearly crazy  sirs strive to keep the world to its own original simplicity and as the wind bloweth where it listeth so let virtue establish itself  wherefore this undue energy’  and what would be the fate of governments and professional politicians if we came to the conclusion that there is no such thing as governing mankind at all  it is clear that chuang tzŭ is a very dangerous writer and the publication of his book in english two thousand years after his death is obviously premature and may cause a great deal of pain to many thoroughly respectable and industrious persons  it may be true that the ideal of selfculture and selfdevelopment which is the aim of his scheme of life and the basis of his scheme of philosophy is an ideal somewhat needed by an age like ours in which most people are so anxious to educate their neighbours that they have actually no time left in which to educate themselves  but would it be wise to say so  it seems to me that if we once admitted the force of any one of chuang tzŭ’s destructive criticisms we should have to put some check on our national habit of selfglorification and the only thing that ever consoles man for the stupid things he does is the praise he always gives himself for doing them  there may however be a few who have grown wearied of that strange modern tendency that sets enthusiasm to do the work of the intellect  to these and such as these chuang tzŭ will be welcome  but let them only read him  let them not talk about him  he would be disturbing at dinnerparties and impossible at afternoon teas and his whole life was a protest against platform speaking  ‘the perfect man ignores self the divine man ignores action the true sage ignores reputation’  these are the principles of chuang tzŭ  chuang tzŭ mystic moralist and social reformer  translated from the chinese by herbert a giles hbm’s consul at tamsui bernard quaritch     mr pater’s appreciations speaker march 22 1890   when i first had the privilege—and i count it a very high one—of meeting mr walter pater he said to me smiling ‘why do you always write poetry  why do you not write prose  prose is so much more difficult’  it was during my undergraduate days at oxford days of lyrical ardour and of studious sonnetwriting days when one loved the exquisite intricacy and musical repetitions of the ballade and the villanelle with its linked longdrawn echoes and its curious completeness days when one solemnly sought to discover the proper temper in which a triolet should be written delightful days in which i am glad to say there was far more rhyme than reason  i may frankly confess now that at the time i did not quite comprehend what mr pater really meant and it was not till i had carefully studied his beautiful and suggestive essays on the renaissance that i fully realized what a wonderful selfconscious art the art of english prosewriting really is or may be made to be  carlyle’s stormy rhetoric ruskin’s winged and passionate eloquence had seemed to me to spring from enthusiasm rather than from art  i do not think i knew then that even prophets correct their proofs  as for jacobean prose i thought it too exuberant and queen anne prose appeared to me terribly bald and irritatingly rational  but mr pater’s essays became to me ‘the golden book of spirit and sense the holy writ of beauty’  they are still this to me  it is possible of course that i may exaggerate about them  i certainly hope that i do for where there is no exaggeration there is no love and where there is no love there is no understanding it is only about things that do not interest one that one can give a really unbiassed opinion and this is no doubt the reason why an unbiassed opinion is always valueless  but i must not allow this brief notice of mr pater’s new volume to degenerate into an autobiography  i remember being told in america that whenever margaret fuller wrote an essay upon emerson the printers had always to send out to borrow some additional capital ‘i’s’ and i feel it right to accept this transatlantic warning  appreciations in the fine latin sense of the word is the title given by mr pater to his book which is an exquisite collection of exquisite essays of delicately wrought works of art—some of them being almost greek in their purity of outline and perfection of form others mediæval in their strangeness of colour and passionate suggestion and all of them absolutely modern in the true meaning of the term modernity  for he to whom the present is the only thing that is present knows nothing of the age in which he lives  to realize the nineteenth century one must realize every century that has preceded it and that has contributed to its making  to know anything about oneself one must know all about others  there must be no mood with which one cannot sympathize no dead mode of life that one cannot make alive  the legacies of heredity may make us alter our views of moral responsibility but they cannot but intensify our sense of the value of criticism for the true critic is he who bears within himself the dreams and ideas and feelings of myriad generations and to whom no form of thought is alien no emotional impulse obscure  perhaps the most interesting and certainly the least successful of the essays contained in the present volume is that on style  it is the most interesting because it is the work of one who speaks with the high authority that comes from the noble realization of things nobly conceived  it is the least successful because the subject is too abstract  a true artist like mr pater is most felicitous when he deals with the concrete whose very limitations give him finer freedom while they necessitate more intense vision  and yet what a high ideal is contained in these few pages  how good it is for us in these days of popular education and facile journalism to be reminded of the real scholarship that is essential to the perfect writer who ‘being a true lover of words for their own sake a minute and constant observer of their physiognomy’ will avoid what is mere rhetoric or ostentatious ornament or negligent misuse of terms or ineffective surplusage and will be known by his tact of omission by his skilful economy of means by his selection and selfrestraint and perhaps above all by that conscious artistic structure which is the expression of mind in style  i think i have been wrong in saying that the subject is too abstract  in mr pater’s hands it becomes very real to us indeed and he shows us how behind the perfection of a man’s style must lie the passion of a man’s soul  as one passes to the rest of the volume one finds essays on wordsworth and on coleridge on charles lamb and on sir thomas browne on some of shakespeare’s plays and on the english kings that shakespeare fashioned on dante rossetti and on william morris  as that on wordsworth seems to be mr pater’s last work so that on the singer of the defence of guenevere is certainly his earliest or almost his earliest and it is interesting to mark the change that has taken place in his style  this change is perhaps at first sight not very apparent  in 1868 we find mr pater writing with the same exquisite care for words with the same studied music with the same temper and something of the same mode of treatment  but as he goes on the architecture of the style becomes richer and more complex the epithet more precise and intellectual occasionally one may be inclined to think that there is here and there a sentence which is somewhat long and possibly if one may venture to say so a little heavy and cumbersome in movement  but if this be so it comes from those sideissues suddenly suggested by the idea in its progress and really revealing the idea more perfectly or from those felicitous afterthoughts that give a fuller completeness to the central scheme and yet convey something of the charm of chance or from a desire to suggest the secondary shades of meaning with all their accumulating effect and to avoid it may be the violence and harshness of too definite and exclusive an opinion  for in matters of art at any rate thought is inevitably coloured by emotion and so is fluid rather than fixed and recognizing its dependence upon the moods and upon the passion of fine moments will not accept the rigidity of a scientific formula or a theological dogma  the critical pleasure too that we receive from tracing through what may seem the intricacies of a sentence the working of the constructive intelligence must not be overlooked  as soon as we have realized the design everything appears clear and simple  after a time these long sentences of mr pater’s come to have the charm of an elaborate piece of music and the unity of such music also  i have suggested that the essay on wordsworth is probably the most recent bit of work contained in this volume  if one might choose between so much that is good i should be inclined to say it is the finest also the essay on lamb is curiously suggestive suggestive indeed of a somewhat more tragic more sombre figure than men have been wont to think of in connection with the author of the essays of elia  it is an interesting aspect under which to regard lamb but perhaps he himself would have had some difficulty in recognizing the portrait given of him he had undoubtedly great sorrows or motives for sorrow but he could console himself at a moment’s notice for the real tragedies of life by reading any one of the elizabethan tragedies provided it was in a folio edition  the essay on sir thomas browne is delightful and has the strange personal fanciful charm of the author of the religio medici mr pater often catching the colour and accent and tone of whatever artist or work of art he deals with  that on coleridge with its insistence on the necessity of the cultivation of the relative as opposed to the absolute spirit in philosophy and in ethics and its high appreciation of the poet’s true position in our literature is in style and substance a very blameless work  grace of expression and delicate subtlety of thought and phrase characterize the essays on shakespeare but the essay on wordsworth has a spiritual beauty of its own  it appeals not to the ordinary wordsworthian with his uncritical temper and his gross confusion of ethical and æsthetical problems but rather to those who desire to separate the gold from the dross and to reach at the true wordsworth through the mass of tedious and prosaic work that bears his name and that serves often to conceal him from us  the presence of an alien element in wordsworth’s art is of course recognized by mr pater but he touches on it merely from the psychological point of view pointing out how this quality of higher and lower moods gives the effect in his poetry ‘of a power not altogether his own or under his control’ a power which comes and goes when it wills ‘so that the old fancy which made the poet’s art an enthusiasm a form of divine possession seems almost true of him’  mr pater’s earlier essays had their purpurei panni so eminently suitable for quotation such as the famous passage on mona lisa and that other in which botticelli’s strange conception of the virgin is so strangely set forth  from the present volume it is difficult to select any one passage in preference to another as specially characteristic of mr pater’s treatment  this however is worth quoting at length  it contains a truth eminently suitable for our age      that the end of life is not action but contemplation—being as     distinct from doing—a certain disposition of the mind is in some     shape or other the principle of all the higher morality  in poetry     in art if you enter into their true spirit at all you touch this     principle in a measure these by their sterility are a type of     beholding for the mere joy of beholding  to treat life in the spirit     of art is to make life a thing in which means and ends are     identified to encourage such treatment the true moral significance     of art and poetry  wordsworth and other poets who have been like     him in ancient or more recent times are the masters the experts in     this art of impassioned contemplation  their work is not to teach     lessons or enforce rules or even to stimulate us to noble ends but     to withdraw the thoughts for a while from the mere machinery of life     to fix them with appropriate emotions on the spectacle of those     great facts in man’s existence which no machinery affects ‘on the     great and universal passions of men the most general and interesting     of their occupations and the entire world of nature’—on ‘the     operations of the elements and the appearances of the visible     universe on storm and sunshine on the revolutions of the seasons     on cold and heat on loss of friends and kindred on injuries and     resentments on gratitude and hope on fear and sorrow’  to witness     this spectacle with appropriate emotions is the aim of all culture     and of these emotions poetry like wordsworth’s is a great nourisher     and stimulant  he sees nature full of sentiment and excitement he     sees men and women as parts of nature passionate excited in     strange grouping and connection with the grandeur and beauty of the     natural world—images in his own words ‘of men suffering amid     awful forms and powers’  certainly the real secret of wordsworth has never been better expressed after having read and reread mr pater’s essay—for it requires rereading—one returns to the poet’s work with a new sense of joy and wonder and with something of eager and impassioned expectation  and perhaps this might be roughly taken as the test or touchstone of the finest criticism  finally one cannot help noticing the delicate instinct that has gone to fashion the brief epilogue that ends this delightful volume  the difference between the classical and romantic spirits in art has often and with much overemphasis been discussed  but with what a light sure touch does mr pater write of it  how subtle and certain are his distinctions  if imaginative prose be really the special art of this century mr pater must rank amongst our century’s most characteristic artists  in certain things he stands almost alone  the age has produced wonderful prose styles turbid with individualism and violent with excess of rhetoric  but in mr pater as in cardinal newman we find the union of personality with perfection  he has no rival in his own sphere and he has escaped disciples  and this not because he has not been imitated but because in art so fine as his there is something that in its essence is inimitable  appreciations with an essay on style  by walter pater fellow of brasenose college  macmillan and co     sententiae extracted from reviews   perhaps he will write poetry some day  if he does we would earnestly appeal to him to give up calling a cock ‘proud chanticleer’  few synonyms are so depressing  a young writer can gain more from the study of a literary poet than from the study of a lyrist  i have seen many audiences more interesting than the actors and have often heard better dialogue in the foyer than i have on the stage  the dramatic college might take up the education of spectators as well as that of players and teach people that there is a proper moment for the throwing of flowers as well as a proper method  life remains eternally unchanged it is art which by presenting it to us under various forms enables us to realize its manysided mysteries and to catch the quality of its most fierycoloured moments  the originality i mean which we ask from the artist is originality of treatment not of subject  it is only the unimaginative who ever invents  the true artist is known by the use he makes of what he annexes and he annexes everything  if i ventured on a bit of advice which i feel most reluctant to do it would be to the effect that while one should always study the method of a great artist one should never imitate his manner  the manner of an artist is essentially individual the method of an artist is absolutely universal  the first is personality which no one should copy the second is perfection which all should aim at  a critic who posed as an authority on field sports assured me that no one ever went out hunting when roses were in full bloom  personally that is exactly the season i would select for the chase but then i know more about flowers than i do about foxes and like them much better  the nineteenth century may be a prosaic age but we fear that if we are to judge by the general run of novels it is not an age of prose  perhaps in this century we are too altruistic to be really artistic  i am led to hope that the university will some day have a theatre of its own and that proficiency in scenepainting will be regarded as a necessary qualification for the slade professorship  on the stage literature returns to life and archæology becomes art  a fine theatre is a temple where all the muses may meet a second parnassus  it would be sad indeed if the many volumes of poems that are every year published in london found no readers but the authors themselves and the authors’ relations and the real philanthropist should recognize it as part of his duties to buy every new book of verse that appears  a fifteenline sonnet is as bad a monstrosity as a sonnet in dialogue  antiquarian books as a rule are extremely dull reading  they give us facts without form science without style and learning without life  the roman patron in fact kept the roman poet alive and we fancy that many of our modern bards rather regret the old system  better surely the humiliation of the sportula than the indignity of a bill for printing  better to accept a countryhouse as a gift than to be in debt to one’s landlady  on the whole the patron was an excellent institution if not for poetry at least for the poets    every poet longs for a mæcenas  the two things the greeks valued most in actors were grace of gesture and music of voice  indeed to gain these virtues their actors used to subject themselves to a regular course of gymnastics and a particular regime of diet health being to the greeks not merely a quality of art but a condition of its production  one should not be too severe on english novels they are the only relaxation of the intellectually unemployed  most modern novels are more remarkable for their crime than for their culture  not that a tramp’s mode of life is at all unsuited to the development of the poetic faculty  far from it  he if any one should possess that freedom of mood which is so essential to the artist for he has no taxes to pay and no relations to worry him  the man who possesses a permanent address and whose name is to be found in the directory is necessarily limited and localized  only the tramp has absolute liberty of living was not homer himself a vagrant and did not thespis go about in a caravan  in art as in life the law of heredity holds good  on est toujours fils de quelqu’un  he has succeeded in studying a fine poet without stealing from him—a very difficult thing to do  morocco is a sort of paradox among countries for though it lies westward of piccadilly yet it is purely oriental in character and though it is but three hours’ sail from europe yet it makes you feel to use the forcible expression of an american writer as if you had been taken up by the scruff of the neck and set down in the old testament  as children themselves are the perfect flowers of life so a collection of the best poems written on children should be the most perfect of all anthologies  no english poet has written of children with more love and grace and delicacy than herrick  his ode on the birth of our saviour his poem to his saviour a child a present by a child his graces for children and his many lovely epitaphs on children are all of them exquisite works of art simple sweet and sincere  as the crossbenches form a refuge for those who have no minds to make up so those who cannot make up their minds always take to homeric studies  many of our leaders have sulked in their tents with achilles after some violent political crisis and enraged at the fickleness of fortune more than one has given up to poetry what was obviously meant for party  there are two ways of misunderstanding a poem  one is to misunderstand it and the other to praise it for qualities it does not possess  most modern calendars mar the sweet simplicity of our lives by reminding us that each day that passes is the anniversary of some perfectly uninteresting event  it is true that such aphorisms as      graves are a mother’s dimples           when we complain  or      the primrose wears a constant smile     and captive takes the heart  can hardly be said to belong to the very highest order of poetry still they are preferable on the whole to the date of hannah more’s birth or of the burning down of exeter change or of the opening of the great exhibition and though it would be dangerous to make calendars the basis of culture we should all be much improved if we began each day with a fine passage of english poetry  even the most uninteresting poet cannot survive bad editing  prefixed to the calendar is an introductory note    displaying that intimate acquaintance with sappho’s lost poems which is the privilege only of those who are not acquainted with greek literature  mediocre critics are usually safe in their generalities it is in their reasons and examples that they come so lamentably to grief  all premature panegyrics bring their own punishment upon themselves  no one survives being overestimated  henry wadsworth longfellow was one of the first true men of letters america produced and as such deserves a high place in any history of american civilization  to a land out of breath in its greed for gain he showed the example of a life devoted entirely to the study of literature his lectures though not by any means brilliant were still productive of much good he had a most charming and gracious personality and he wrote some pretty poems  but his poems are not of the kind that call for intellectual analysis or for elaborate description or indeed for any serious discussion at all  though the psalm of life be shouted from maine to california that would not make it true poetry  longfellow has no imitators for of echoes themselves there are no echoes and it is only style that makes a school  poe’s marvellous lines to helen a poem as beautiful as a greek gem and as musical as apollo’s lute  good novelists are much rarer than good sons and none of us would part readily with micawber and mrs nickleby  still the fact remains that a man who was affectionate and loving to his children generous and warmhearted to his friends and whose books are the very bacchanalia of benevolence pilloried his parents to make the groundlings laugh and this fact every biographer of dickens should face and if possible explain  no age ever borrows the slang of its predecessor  what we do not know about shakespeare is a most fascinating subject and one that would fill a volume but what we do know about him is so meagre and inadequate that when it is collected together the result is rather depressing  they show a want of knowledge that must be the result of years of study  rossetti’s was a great personality and personalities such as his do not easily survive shilling primers  we are sorry to find an english dramatic critic misquoting shakespeare as we had always been of opinion that this was a privilege reserved specially for our english actors  biographies of this kind rob life of much of its dignity and its wonder add to death itself a new terror and make one wish that all art were anonymous  a pillar of fire to the few who knew him and of cloud to the many who knew him not dante gabriel rossetti lived apart from the gossip and tittletattle of a shallow age  he never trafficked with the merchants for his soul nor brought his wares into the marketplace for the idle to gape at  passionate and romantic though he was yet there was in his nature something of high austerity  he loved seclusion and hated notoriety and would have shuddered at the idea that within a few years after his death he was to make his appearance in a series of popular biographies sandwiched between the author of pickwick and the great lexicographer  we sincerely hope that a few more novels like these will be published as the public will then find out that a bad book is very dear at a shilling  the only form of fiction in which real characters do not seem out of place is history  in novels they are detestable  shilling literature is always making demands on our credulity without ever appealing to our imagination  pathology is rapidly becoming the basis of sensational literature and in art as in politics there is a great future for monsters  it is only mediocrities and old maids who consider it a grievance to be misunderstood  as truly religious people are resigned to everything even to mediocre poetry there is no reason at all why madame guyon’s verses should not be popular with a large section of the community  a simile committing suicide is always a depressing spectacle  such novels as scamp are possibly more easy to write than they are to read  we have no doubt that when bailey wrote to lord houghton that commonsense and gentleness were keats’s two special characteristics the worthy archdeacon meant extremely well but we prefer the real keats with his passionate wilfulness his fantastic moods and his fine inconsistence  part of keats’s charm as a man is his fascinating incompleteness  the apostolic dictum that women should not be suffered to teach is no longer applicable to a society such as ours with its solidarity of interests its recognition of natural rights and its universal education however suitable it may have been to the greek cities under roman rule  nothing in the united states struck me more than the fact that the remarkable intellectual progress of that country is very largely due to the efforts of american women who edit many of the most powerful magazines and newspapers take part in the discussion of every question of public interest and exercise an important influence upon the growth and tendencies of literature and art  indeed the women of america are the one class in the community that enjoys that leisure which is so necessary for culture  the men are as a rule so absorbed in business that the task of bringing some element of form into the chaos of daily life is left almost entirely to the opposite sex and an eminent bostonian once assured me that in the twentieth century the whole culture of his country would be in petticoats  by that time however it is probable that the dress of the two sexes will be assimilated as similarity of costume always follows similarity of pursuits  the aim of social comedy in menander no less than in sheridan is to mirror the manners not to reform the morals of its day and the censure of the puritan whether real or affected is always out of place in literary criticism and shows a want of recognition of the essential distinction between art and life  after all it is only the philistine who thinks of blaming jack absolute for his deception bob acres for his cowardice and charles surface for his extravagance and there is very little use in airing one’s moral sense at the expense of one’s artistic appreciation  the Æneid bears almost the same relation to the iliad that the idylls of the king do to the old celtic romances of arthur  like them it is full of felicitous modernisms of exquisite literary echoes and of delicate and delightful pictures as lord tennyson loves england so did virgil love rome the pageants of history and the purple of empire are equally dear to both poets but neither of them has the grand simplicity or the large humanity of the early singers and as a hero Æneas is no less a failure than arthur  there is always a certain amount of danger in any attempt to cultivate impossible virtues  as far as the serious presentation of life is concerned what we require is more imaginative treatment greater freedom from theatric language and theatric convention  it may be questioned also whether the consistent reward of virtue and punishment of wickedness be really the healthiest ideal for an art that claims to mirror nature  true originality is to be found rather in the use made of a model than in the rejection of all models and masters  dans l’art comme dans la nature on est toujours fils de quelqu’un and we should not quarrel with the reed if it whispers to us the music of the lyre  a little child once asked me if it was the nightingale who taught the linnets how to sing  in france they have had one great genius balzac who invented the modern method of looking at life and one great artist flaubert who is the impeccable master of style and to the influence of these two men we may trace almost all contemporary french fiction  but in england we have had no schools worth speaking of  the fiery torch lit by the brontës has not been passed on to other hands dickens has influenced only journalism thackeray’s delightful superficial philosophy superb narrative power and clever social satire have found no echoes nor has trollope left any direct successors behind him—a fact which is not much to be regretted however as admirable though trollope undoubtedly is for rainy afternoons and tedious railway journeys from the point of view of literature he is merely the perpetual curate of pudlington parva  george meredith’s style is chaos illumined by brilliant flashes of lightning  as a writer he has mastered everything except language as a novelist he can do everything except tell a story as an artist he is everything except articulate  too strange to be popular too individual to have imitators the author of richard feverel stands absolutely alone  it is easy to disarm criticism but he has disarmed the disciple he gives us his philosophy through the medium of wit and is never so pathetic as when he is humorous  to turn truth into a paradox is not difficult but george meredith makes all his paradoxes truths and no theseus can thread his labyrinth no Œdipus solve his secret  the most perfect and the most poisonous of all modern french poets once remarked that a man can live for three days without bread but that no one can live for three days without poetry  this however can hardly be said to be a popular view or one that commends itself to that curiously uncommon quality which is called commonsense  i fancy that most people if they do not actually prefer a salmis to a sonnet certainly like their culture to repose on a basis of good cookery  a cynical critic once remarked that no great poet is intelligible and no little poet worth understanding but that otherwise poetry is an admirable thing  this however seems to us a somewhat harsh view of the subject  little poets are an extremely interesting study  the best of them have often some new beauty to show us and though the worst of them may bore yet they rarely brutalize  it is a curious thing that when minor poets write choruses to a play they should always consider it necessary to adopt the style and language of a bad translator  we fear that mr bohn has much to answer for  in one sonnet he makes a distinct attempt to be original and the result is extremely depressing      earth wears her grandest robe by autumn spun     like some stout matron who of youth has run     the course     is the most dreadful simile we have ever come across even in poetry  mr griffiths should beware of originality  like beauty it is a fatal gift  there is a wide difference between the beautiful tuscan city and the seacity of the adriatic  florence is a city full of memories of the great figures of the past  the traveller cannot pass along her streets without treading in the very traces of dante without stepping on soil made memorable by footprints never to be effaced  the greatness of the surroundings the palaces churches and frowning mediæval castles in the midst of the city are all thrown into the background by the greatness the individuality the living power and vigour of the men who are their originators and at the same time their inspiring soul  but when we turn to venice the effect is very different  we do not think of the makers of that marvellous city but rather of what they made  the idealized image of venice herself meets us everywhere  the mother is not overshadowed by the too great glory of any of her sons  in her records the city is everything—the republic the worshipped ideal of a community in which every man for the common glory seems to have been willing to sink his own  we know that dante stood within the red walls of the arsenal and saw the galleys making and mending and the pitch flaming up to heaven petrarch came to visit the great mistress of the sea taking refuge there ‘in this city true home of the human race’ from trouble war and pestilence outside and byron with his facile enthusiasms and fervent eloquence made his home for a time in one of the stately decaying palaces but with these exceptions no great poet has ever associated himself with the life of venice  she had architects sculptors and painters but no singer of her own  to realize the popularity of the great poets one should turn to the minor poets and see whom they follow what master they select whose music they echo  ordinary theology has long since converted its gold into lead and words and phrases that once touched the heart of the world have become wearisome and meaningless through repetition  if theology desires to move us she must rewrite her formulas  it takes a great artist to be thoroughly modern  nature is always a little behind the age  mr nash who styles himself ‘a humble soldier in the army of faith’ expresses a hope that his book may ‘invigorate devotional feeling especially among the young to whom verse is perhaps more attractive than to their elders’ but we should be sorry to think that people of any age could admire such a paraphrase as the following      foxes have holes in which to slink for rest     the birds of air find shelter in the nest     but he the son of man and lord of all     has no abiding place his own to call  it is a curious fact that the worst work is always done with the best intentions and that people are never so trivial as when they take themselves very seriously  mr foster is an american poet who has read hawthorne which is wise of him and imitated longfellow which is not quite so commendable  andiatoroctè is the title of a volume of poems by the rev clarence walworth of albany ny  it is a word borrowed from the indians and should we think be returned to them as soon as possible  the most curious poem of the book is called scenes at the holy home         jesus and joseph at work  hurra     sight never to see again        a prentice deity plies the saw     while the master ploughs with the plane  poems of this kind were popular in the middle ages when the cathedrals of every christian country served as its theatres  they are anachronisms now and it is odd that they should come to us from the united states in matters of this kind we should have some protection  as for the triolets and the rondels and the careful study of metrical subtleties these things are merely the signs of a desire for perfection in small things and of the recognition of poetry as an art  they have had certainly one good result—they have made our minor poets readable and have not left us entirely at the mercy of geniuses  poetry has many modes of music she does not blow through one pipe alone directness of utterance is good but so is the subtle recasting of thought into a new and delightful form  simplicity is good but complexity mystery strangeness symbolism obscurity even these have their value  indeed properly speaking there is no such thing as style there are merely styles that is all  writers of poetical prose are rarely good poets  poetry may be said to need far more selfrestraint than prose  its conditions are more exquisite  it produces its effects by more subtle means  it must not be allowed to degenerate into mere rhetoric or mere eloquence  it is in one sense the most selfconscious of all the arts as it is never a means to an end but always an end in itself  it may be difficult for a poet to find english synonyms for asiatic expressions but even if it were impossible it is none the less a poet’s duty to find them  as it is sir edwin arnold has translated sa’di and some one must translate sir edwin arnold  lounging in the open air is not a bad school for poets but it largely depends on the lounger  people are so fond of giving away what they do not want themselves that charity is largely on the increase  but with this kind of charity i have not much sympathy  if one gives away a book it should be a charming book—so charming that one regrets having given it  mr whistler for some reason or other always adopted the phraseology of the minor prophets  possibly it was in order to emphasize his wellknown claims to verbal inspiration or perhaps he thought with voltaire that habakkuk était capable de tout and wished to shelter himself under the shield of a definitely irresponsible writer none of whose prophecies according to the french philosopher has ever been fulfilled  the idea was clever enough at the beginning but ultimately the manner became monotonous  the spirit of the hebrews is excellent but their mode of writing is not to be imitated and no amount of american jokes will give it that modernity which is essential to a good literary style  admirable as are mr whistler’s fireworks on canvas his fireworks in prose are abrupt violent and exaggerated  ‘the decisive events of the world’ as has been well said ‘take place in the intellect’ and as for boardschools academic ceremonies hospital wards and the like they may be well left to the artists of the illustrated papers who do them admirably and quite as well as they need be done  indeed the pictures of contemporary events royal marriages naval reviews and things of this kind that appear in the academy every year are always extremely bad while the very same subjects treated in black and white in the graphic or the london news are excellent besides if we want to understand the history of a nation through the medium of art it is to the imaginative and ideal arts that we have to go and not to the arts that are definitely imitative  the visible aspect of life no longer contains for us the secret of life’s spirit  the difficulty under which the novelists of our day labour seems to me to be this if they do not go into society their books are unreadable and if they do go into society they have no time left for writing  i must confess that most modern mysticism seems to me to be simply a method of imparting useless knowledge in a form that no one can understand  allegory parable and vision have their high artistic uses but their philosophical and scientific uses are very small  the object of most modern fiction is not to give pleasure to the artistic instinct but rather to portray life vividly for us to draw attention to social anomalies and social forms of injustice  many of our novelists are really pamphleteers reformers masquerading as storytellers earnest sociologists seeking to mend as well as to mirror life  the book is certainly characteristic of an age so practical and so literary as ours an age in which all social reforms have been preceded and have been largely influenced by fiction  mr stopford brooke said some time ago that socialism and the socialistic spirit would give our poets nobler and loftier themes for song would widen their sympathies and enlarge the horizon of their vision and would touch with the fire and fervour of a new faith lips that had else been silent hearts that but for this fresh gospel had been cold  what art gains from contemporary events is always a fascinating problem and a problem that is not easy to solve  it is however certain that socialism starts well equipped  she has her poets and her painters her art lecturers and her cunning designers her powerful orators and her clever writers  if she fails it will not be for lack of expression  if she succeeds her triumph will not be a triumph of mere brute force  socialism is not going to allow herself to be trammelled by any hard and fast creed or to be stereotyped into an iron formula  she welcomes many and multiform natures  she rejects none and has room for all  she has the attraction of a wonderful personality and touches the heart of one and the brain of another and draws this man by his hatred and injustice and his neighbour by his faith in the future and a third it may be by his love of art or by his wild worship of a lost and buried past  and all of this is well  for to make men socialists is nothing but to make socialism human is a great thing  the reformation gained much from the use of popular hymntunes and the socialists seem determined to gain by similar means a similar hold upon the people  however they must not be too sanguine about the result the walls of thebes rose up to the sound of music and thebes was a very dull city indeed  we really must protest against mr matthews’ efforts to confuse the poetry of piccadilly with the poetry of parnassus  to tell us for instance that mr austin dobson’s verse ‘has not the condensed clearness nor the incisive vigor of mr locker’s’ is really too bad even for transatlantic criticism  nobody who lays claim to the slightest knowledge of literature and the forms of literature should ever bring the two names into conjunction  mr dobson has produced work that is absolutely classical in its exquisite beauty of form  nothing more artistically perfect in its way than the lines to a greek girl has been written in our time  this little poem will be remembered in literature as long as thyrsis is remembered and thyrsis will never be forgotten  both have that note of distinction that is so rare in these days of violence exaggeration and rhetoric  of course to suggest as mr matthews does that mr dobson’s poems belong to ‘the literature of power’ is ridiculous  power is not their aim nor is it their effect  they have other qualities and in their own delicately limited sphere they have no contemporary rivals they have none even second to them  the heroine is a sort of wellworn becky sharp only much more beautiful than becky or at least than thackeray’s portraits of her which however have always seemed to me rather illnatured  i feel sure that mrs rawdon crawley was extremely pretty and i have never understood how it was that thackeray could caricature with his pencil so fascinating a creation of his pen  a critic recently remarked of adam lindsay gordon that through him australia had found her first fine utterance in song  this however is an amiable error  there is very little of australia in gordon’s poetry his heart and mind and fancy were always preoccupied with memories and dreams of england and such culture as england gave him  he owed nothing to the land of his adoption  had he stayed at home he would have done much better work  that australia however will some day make amends by producing a poet of her own we cannot doubt and for him there will be new notes to sound and new wonders to tell of  the best that we can say of him is that he wrote imperfectly in australia those poems that in england he might have made perfect  judges like the criminal classes have their lighter moments  there seems to be some curious connection between piety and poor rhymes  the south african poets as a class are rather behind the age  they seem to think that ‘aurora’ is a very novel and delightful epithet for the dawn  on the whole they depress us  the only original thing in the volume is the description of mr robert buchanan’s ‘grandeur of mind’  this is decidedly new  dr cockle tells us that müllner’s guilt and the ancestress of grillparzer are the masterpieces of german fatetragedy  his translation of the first of these two masterpieces does not make us long for any further acquaintance with the school  here is a specimen from the fourth act of the fatetragedy                                   scene viii                        elvira                     hugo      elvira after long silence leaving the harp steps to hugo     and seeks his gaze      hugo softly  though i made sacrifice of thy sweet life the     father has forgiven  can the wife—forgive      elvira on his breast  she can      hugo with all the warmth of love  dear wife      elvira after a pause in deep sorrow  must it be so beloved     one      hugo sorry to have betrayed himself  what  the renaissance had for its object the development of great personalities  the perfect freedom of the temperament in matters of art the perfect freedom of the intellect in intellectual matters the full development of the individual were the things it aimed at  as we study its history we find it full of great anarchies  it solved no political or social problems it did not seek to solve them  the ideal of the ‘grand siècle’ and of richelieu in whom the forces of that great age were incarnate was different  the ideas of citizenship of the building up of a great nation of the centralization of forces of collective action of ethnic unity of purpose came before the world  the creation of a formal tradition upon classical lines is never without its danger and it is sad to find the provincial towns of france once so varied and individual in artistic expression writing to paris for designs and advice  and yet through colbert’s great centralizing scheme of state supervision and state aid france was the one country in europe and has remained the one country in europe where the arts are not divorced from industry  hawthorne recreated for us the america of the past with the incomparable grace of a very perfect artist but mr bret harte’s emphasized modernity has in its own sphere won equal or almost equal triumphs  it is pleasant to come across a heroine bret harte’s cressy who is not identified with any great cause and represents no important principle but is simply a wonderful nymph from american backwoods who has in her something of artemis and not a little of aphrodite  it is always a pleasure to come across an american poet who is not national and who tries to give expression to the literature that he loves rather than to the land in which he lives  the muses care so little for geography  bluebooks are generally dull reading but bluebooks on ireland have always been interesting  they form the record of one of the great tragedies of modern europe  in them england has written down her indictment against herself and has given to the world the history of her shame  if in the last century she tried to govern ireland with an insolence that was intensified by race hatred and religious prejudice she has sought to rule her in this century with a stupidity that is aggravated by good intentions  like most penmen he froude overrates the power of the sword  where england has had to struggle she has been wise  where physical strength has been on her side as in ireland she has been made unwieldy by that strength  her own strong hands have blinded her  she has had force but no direction  there are some who will welcome with delight the idea of solving the irish question by doing away with the irish people  there are others who will remember that ireland has extended her boundaries and that we have now to reckon with her not merely in the old world but in the new  plastic simplicity of outline may render for us the visible aspect of life it is different when we come to deal with those secrets which selfconsciousness alone contains and which selfconsciousness itself can but half reveal  action takes place in the sunlight but the soul works in the dark  there is something curiously interesting in the marked tendency of modern poetry to become obscure  many critics writing with their eyes fixed on the masterpieces of past literature have ascribed this tendency to wilfulness and to affectation  its origin is rather to be found in the complexity of the new problems and in the fact that selfconsciousness is not yet adequate to explain the contents of the ego  in mr browning’s poems as in life itself which has suggested or rather necessitated the new method thought seems to proceed not on logical lines but on lines of passion  the unity of the individual is being expressed through its inconsistencies and its contradictions  in a strange twilight man is seeking for himself and when he has found his own image he cannot understand it  objective forms of art such as sculpture and the drama sufficed one for the perfect presentation of life they can no longer so suffice  as he is not a genius he naturally behaves admirably on every occasion  certainly dialect is dramatic  it is a vivid method of recreating a past that never existed  it is something between ‘a return to nature’ and ‘a return to the glossary’  it is so artificial that it is really naïve  from the point of view of mere music much may be said for it wonderful diminutives lend new notes of tenderness to the song  there are possibilities of fresh rhymes and in search for a fresh rhyme poets may be excused if they wander from the broad highroad of classical utterance into devious byways and lesstrodden paths  sometimes one is tempted to look on dialect as expressing simply the pathos of provincialisms but there is more in it than mere mispronunciation  with that revival of an antique form often comes the revival of an antique spirit  through limitations that are sometimes uncouth and always narrow comes tragedy herself and though she may stammer in her utterance and deck herself in castoff weeds and trammelling raiment still we must hold ourselves in readiness to accept her so rare are her visits to us now so rare her presence in an age that demands a happy ending from every play and that sees in the theatre merely a source of amusement  there is a great deal to be said in favour of reading a novel backwards the last page is as a rule the most interesting and when one begins with the catastrophe or the dénoûment one feels on pleasant terms of equality with the author  it is like going behind the scenes of a theatre  one is no longer taken in and the hairbreadth escapes of the hero and the wild agonies of the heroine leave one absolutely unmoved  he has every form of sincerity except the sincerity of the artist a defect that he shares with most of our popular writers  on the whole primavera is a pleasant little book and we are glad to welcome it  it is charmingly ‘got up’ and undergraduates might read it with advantage during lecture hours                                                 printed by t and a constable printers to his majesty                     at the edinburgh university press     footnotes   2  reverently some wellmeaning persons have placed a marble slab on the wall of the cemetery with a medallionprofile of keats on it and some mediocre lines of poetry  the face is ugly and rather hatchetshaped with thick sensual lips and is utterly unlike the poet himself who was very beautiful to look upon  ‘his countenance’ says a lady who saw him at one of hazlitt’s lectures ‘lives in my mind as one of singular beauty and brightness it had the expression as if he had been looking on some glorious sight’  and this is the idea which severn’s picture of him gives  even haydon’s rough penandink sketch of him is better than this ‘marble libel’ which i hope will soon be taken down  i think the best representation of the poet would be a coloured bust like that of the young rajah of koolapoor at florence which is a lovely and lifelike work of art  5  ‘make’ is of course a mere printer’s error for ‘mock’ and was subsequently corrected by lord houghton  the sonnet as given in the garden of florence reads ‘orbs for ‘those’
