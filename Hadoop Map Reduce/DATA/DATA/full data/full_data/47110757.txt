47110757	behind a mask or a womans power by am barnard     chapter i   jean muir  has she come  no mamma not yet  i wish it were well over the thought of it worries and excites me a cushion for my back bella  and poor peevish mrs coventry sank into an easy chair with a nervous sigh and the air of a martyr while her pretty daughter hovered about her with affectionate solicitude  who are they talking of lucia asked the languid young man lounging on a couch near his cousin who bent over her tapestry work with a happy smile on her usually haughty face  the new governess miss muir shall i tell you about her  no thank you i have an inveterate aversion to the whole tribe ive often thanked heaven that i had but one sister and she a spoiled child so that i have escaped the infliction of a governess so long  how will you bear it now asked lucia  leave the house while she is in it  no you wont youre too lazy gerald called out a younger and more energetic man from the recess where he stood teasing his dogs  ill give her a three days trial if she proves endurable i shall not disturb myself if as i am sure she is a bore im off anywhere anywhere out of her way  i beg you wont talk in that depressing manner boys i dread the coming of a stranger more than you possibly can but bella must not be neglected so i have nerved myself to endure this woman and lucia is good enough to say she will attend to her after tonight  dont be troubled mamma she is a nice person i dare say and when once we are used to her ive no doubt we shall be glad to have her its so dull here just now lady sydney said she was a quiet accomplished amiable girl who needed a home and would be a help to poor stupid me so try to like her for my sake  i will dear but isnt it getting late i do hope nothing has happened did you tell them to send a carriage to the station for her gerald  i forgot it but its not far it wont hurt her to walk was the languid reply  it was indolence not forgetfulness i know im very sorry she will think it so rude to leave her to find her way so late do go and see to it ned  too late bella the train was in some time ago give your orders to me next time mother and ill see that they are obeyed said edward  ned is just at an age to make a fool of himself for any girl who comes in his way have a care of the governess lucia or she will bewitch him  gerald spoke in a satirical whisper but his brother heard him and answered with a goodhumored laugh  i wish there was any hope of your making a fool of yourself in that way old fellow set me a good example and i promise to follow it as for the governess she is a woman and should be treated with common civility i should say a little extra kindness wouldnt be amiss either because she is poor and a stranger  that is my dear goodhearted ned well stand by poor little muir wont we and running to her brother bella stood on tiptoe to offer him a kiss which he could not refuse for the rosy lips were pursed up invitingly and the bright eyes full of sisterly affection  i do hope she has come for when i make an effort to see anyone i hate to make it in vain punctuality is such a virtue and i know this woman hasnt got it for she promised to be here at seven and now it is long after began mrs coventry in an injured tone  before she could get breath for another complaint the clock struck seven and the doorbell rang  there she is cried bella and turned toward the door as if to go and meet the newcomer  but lucia arrested her saying authoritatively stay here child it is her place to come to you not yours to go to her  miss muir announced a servant and a little blackrobed figure stood in the doorway for an instant no one stirred and the governess had time to see and be seen before a word was uttered all looked at her and she cast on the household group a keen glance that impressed them curiously then her eyes fell and bowing slightly she walked in edward came forward and received her with the frank cordiality which nothing could daunt or chill  mother this is the lady whom you expected miss muir allow me to apologize for our apparent neglect in not sending for you there was a mistake about the carriage or rather the lazy fellow to whom the order was given forgot it bella come here  thank you no apology is needed i did not expect to be sent for and the governess meekly sat down without lifting her eyes  i am glad to see you let me take your things said bella rather shyly for gerald still lounging watched the fireside group with languid interest and lucia never stirred mrs coventry took a second survey and began  you were punctual miss muir which pleases me im a sad invalid as lady sydney told you i hope so that miss coventrys lessons will be directed by my niece and you will go to her for directions as she knows what i wish you will excuse me if i ask you a few questions for lady sydneys note was very brief and i left everything to her judgment  ask anything you like madam answered the soft sad voice  you are scotch i believe  yes madam  are your parents living  i have not a relation in the world  dear me how sad do you mind telling me your age  nineteen and a smile passed over miss muirs lips as she folded her hands with an air of resignation for the catechism was evidently to be a long one  so young lady sydney mentioned fiveandtwenty i think didnt she bella  no mamma she only said she thought so dont ask such questions its not pleasant before us all whispered bella  a quick grateful glance shone on her from the suddenly lifted eyes of miss muir as she said quietly i wish i was thirty but as i am not i do my best to look and seem old  of course every one looked at her then and all felt a touch of pity at the sight of the palefaced girl in her plain black dress with no ornament but a little silver cross at her throat small thin and colorless she was with yellow hair gray eyes and sharply cut irregular but very expressive features poverty seemed to have set its bond stamp upon her and life to have had for her more frost than sunshine but something in the lines of the mouth betrayed strength and the clear low voice had a curious mixture of command and entreaty in its varying tones not an attractive woman yet not an ordinary one and as she sat there with her delicate hands lying in her lap her head bent and a bitter look on her thin face she was more interesting than many a blithe and blooming girl bellas heart warmed to her at once and she drew her seat nearer while edward went back to his dogs that his presence might not embarrass her  you have been ill i think continued mrs coventry who considered this fact the most interesting of all she had heard concerning the governess  yes madam i left the hospital only a week ago  are you quite sure it is safe to begin teaching so soon  i have no time to lose and shall soon gain strength here in the country if you care to keep me  and you are fitted to teach music french and drawing  i shall endeavor to prove that i am  be kind enough to go and play an air or two i can judge by your touch i used to play finely when a girl  miss muir rose looked about her for the instrument and seeing it at the other end of the room went toward it passing gerald and lucia as if she did not see them bella followed and in a moment forgot everything in admiration miss muir played like one who loved music and was perfect mistress of her art she charmed them all by the magic of this spell even indolent gerald sat up to listen and lucia put down her needle while ned watched the slender white fingers as they flew and wondered at the strength and skill which they possessed  please sing pleaded bella as a brilliant overture ended  with the same meek obedience miss muir complied and began a little scotch melody so sweet so sad that the girls eyes filled and mrs coventry looked for one of her many pockethandkerchiefs but suddenly the music ceased for with a vain attempt to support herself the singer slid from her seat and lay before the startled listeners as white and rigid as if struck with death edward caught her up and ordering his brother off the couch laid her there while bella chafed her hands and her mother rang for her maid lucia bathed the poor girls temples and gerald with unwonted energy brought a glass of wine soon miss muirs lips trembled she sighed then murmured tenderly with a pretty scotch accent as if wandering in the past bide wi me mither im sae sick an sad here all alone  take a sip of this and it will do you good my dear said mrs coventry quite touched by the plaintive words  the strange voice seemed to recall her she sat up looked about her a little wildly for a moment then collected herself and said with a pathetic look and tone pardon me i have been on my feet all day and in my eagerness to keep my appointment i forgot to eat since morning im better now shall i finish the song  by no means come and have some tea said bella full of pity and remorse  scene first very well done whispered gerald to his cousin  miss muir was just before them apparently listening to mrs coventrys remarks upon fainting fits but she heard and looked over her shoulders with a gesture like rachel her eyes were gray but at that instant they seemed black with some strong emotion of anger pride or defiance a curious smile passed over her face as she bowed and said in her penetrating voice thanks the last scene shall be still better  young coventry was a cool indolent man seldom conscious of any emotion any passion pleasurable or otherwise but at the look the tone of the governess he experienced a new sensation indefinable yet strong he colored and for the first time in his life looked abashed lucia saw it and hated miss muir with a sudden hatred for in all the years she had passed with her cousin no look or word of hers had possessed such power coventry was himself again in an instant with no trace of that passing change but a look of interest in his usually dreamy eyes and a touch of anger in his sarcastic voice  what a melodramatic young lady i shall go tomorrow  lucia laughed and was well pleased when he sauntered away to bring her a cup of tea from the table where a little scene was just taking place mrs coventry had sunk into her chair again exhausted by the flurry of the fainting fit bella was busied about her and edward eager to feed the pale governess was awkwardly trying to make the tea after a beseeching glance at his cousin which she did not choose to answer as he upset the caddy and uttered a despairing exclamation miss muir quietly took her place behind the urn saying with a smile and a shy glance at the young man allow me to assume my duty at once and serve you all i understand the art of making people comfortable in this way the scoop please i can gather this up quite well alone if you will tell me how your mother likes her tea  edward pulled a chair to the table and made merry over his mishaps while miss muir performed her little task with a skill and grace that made it pleasant to watch her coventry lingered a moment after she had given him a steaming cup to observe her more nearly while he asked a question or two of his brother she took no more notice of him than if he had been a statue and in the middle of the one remark he addressed to her she rose to take the sugar basin to mrs coventry who was quite won by the modest domestic graces of the new governess  really my dear you are a treasure i havent tasted such tea since my poor maid ellis died bella never makes it good and miss lucia always forgets the cream whatever you do you seem to do well and that is such a comfort  let me always do this for you then it will be a pleasure madam and miss muir came back to her seat with a faint color in her cheek which improved her much  my brother asked if young sydney was at home when you left said edward for gerald would not take the trouble to repeat the question  miss muir fixed her eyes on coventry and answered with a slight tremor of the lips no he left home some weeks ago  the young man went back to his cousin saying as he threw himself down beside her i shall not go tomorrow but wait till the three days are out  why demanded lucia  lowering his voice he said with a significant nod toward the governess because i have a fancy that she is at the bottom of sydneys mystery hes not been himself lately and now he is gone without a word i rather like romances in real life if they are not too long or difficult to read  do you think her pretty  far from it a most uncanny little specimen  then why fancy sydney loves her  he is an oddity and likes sensations and things of that sort  what do you mean gerald  get the muir to look at you as she did at me and you will understand will you have another cup juno  yes please she liked to have him wait upon her for he did it to no other woman except his mother  before he could slowly rise miss muir glided to them with another cup on the salver and as lucia took it with a cold nod the girl said under her breath i think it honest to tell you that i possess a quick ear and cannot help hearing what is said anywhere in the room what you say of me is of no consequence but you may speak of things which you prefer i should not hear therefore allow me to warn you and she was gone again as noiselessly as she came  how do you like that whispered coventry as his cousin sat looking after the girl with a disturbed expression  what an uncomfortable creature to have in the house i am very sorry i urged her coming for your mother has taken a fancy to her and it will be hard to get rid of her said lucia half angry half amused  hush she hears every word you say i know it by the expression of her face for ned is talking about horses and she looks as haughty as ever you did and that is saying much faith this is getting interesting  hark she is speaking i want to hear and lucia laid her hand on her cousins lips he kissed it and then idly amused himself with turning the rings to and fro on the slender fingers  i have been in france several years madam but my friend died and i came back to be with lady sydney till muir paused an instant then added slowly till i fell ill it was a contagious fever so i went of my own accord to the hospital not wishing to endanger her  very right but are you sure there is no danger of infection now asked mrs coventry anxiously  none i assure you i have been well for some time but did not leave because i preferred to stay there than to return to lady sydney  no quarrel i hope no trouble of any kind  no quarrel butwell why not you have a right to know and i will not make a foolish mystery out of a very simple thing as your family only is present i may tell the truth i did not go back on the young gentlemans account please ask no more  ah i see quite prudent and proper miss muir i shall never allude to it again thank you for your frankness bella you will be careful not to mention this to young friends girls gossip sadly and it would annoy lady sydney beyond everything to have this talked of  very neighborly of lady s to send the dangerous young lady here where there are two young gentlemen to be captivated i wonder why she didnt keep sydney after she had caught him murmured coventry to his cousin  because she had the utmost contempt for a titled fool miss muir dropped the words almost into his ear as she bent to take her shawl from the sofa corner  how the deuce did she get there ejaculated coventry looking as if he had received another sensation she has spirit though and upon my word i pity sydney if he did try to dazzle her for he must have got a splendid dismissal  come and play billiards you promised and i hold you to your word said lucia rising with decision for gerald was showing too much interest in another to suit miss beaufort  i am as ever your most devoted my mother is a charming woman but i find our evening parties slightly dull when only my own family are present good night mamma he shook hands with his mother whose pride and idol he was and with a comprehensive nod to the others strolled after his cousin  now they are gone we can be quite cozy and talk over things for i dont mind ned any more than i do his dogs said bella settling herself on her mothers footstool  i merely wish to say miss muir that my daughter has never had a governess and is sadly backward for a girl of sixteen i want you to pass the mornings with her and get her on as rapidly as possible in the afternoon you will walk or drive with her and in the evening sit with us here if you like or amuse yourself as you please while in the country we are very quiet for i cannot bear much company and when my sons want gaiety they go away for it miss beaufort oversees the servants and takes my place as far as possible i am very delicate and keep my room till evening except for an airing at noon we will try each other for a month and i hope we shall get on quite comfortably together  i shall do my best madam  one would not have believed that the meek spiritless voice which uttered these words was the same that had startled coventry a few minutes before nor that the pale patient face could ever have kindled with such sudden fire as that which looked over miss muirs shoulder when she answered her young hosts speech  edward thought within himself poor little woman she has had a hard life we will try and make it easier while she is here and began his charitable work by suggesting that she might be tired she acknowledged she was and bella led her away to a bright cozy room where with a pretty little speech and a goodnight kiss she left her  when alone miss muirs conduct was decidedly peculiar her first act was to clench her hands and mutter between her teeth with passionate force ill not fail again if there is power in a womans wit and will she stood a moment motionless with an expression of almost fierce disdain on her face then shook her clenched hand as if menacing some unseen enemy next she laughed and shrugged her shoulders with a true french shrug saying low to herself yes the last scene shall be better than the first mon dieu how tired and hungry i am  kneeling before the one small trunk which held her worldly possessions she opened it drew out a flask and mixed a glass of some ardent cordial which she seemed to enjoy extremely as she sat on the carpet musing while her quick eyes examined every corner of the room  not bad it will be a good field for me to work in and the harder the task the better i shall like it merci old friend you put heart and courage into me when nothing else will come the curtain is down so i may be myself for a few hours if actresses ever are themselves  still sitting on the floor she unbound and removed the long abundant braids from her head wiped the pink from her face took out several pearly teeth and slipping off her dress appeared herself indeed a haggard worn and moody woman of thirty at least the metamorphosis was wonderful but the disguise was more in the expression she assumed than in any art of costume or false adornment now she was alone and her mobile features settled into their natural expression weary hard bitter she had been lovely once happy innocent and tender but nothing of all this remained to the gloomy woman who leaned there brooding over some wrong or loss or disappointment which had darkened all her life for an hour she sat so sometimes playing absently with the scanty locks that hung about her face sometimes lifting the glass to her lips as if the fiery draught warmed her cold blood and once she half uncovered her breast to eye with a terrible glance the scar of a newly healed wound at last she rose and crept to bed like one worn out with weariness and mental pain     chapter ii   a good beginning  only the housemaids were astir when miss muir left her room next morning and quietly found her way into the garden as she walked apparently intent upon the flowers her quick eye scrutinized the fine old house and its picturesque surroundings  not bad she said to herself adding as she passed into the adjoining park but the other may be better and i will have the best  walking rapidly she came out at length upon the wide green lawn which lay before the ancient hall where sir john coventry lived in solitary splendor a stately old place rich in oaks wellkept shrubberies gay gardens sunny terraces carved gables spacious rooms liveried servants and every luxury befitting the ancestral home of a rich and honorable race miss muirs eyes brightened as she looked her step grew firmer her carriage prouder and a smile broke over her face the smile of one well pleased at the prospect of the success of some cherished hope suddenly her whole air changed she pushed back her hat clasped her hands loosely before her and seemed absorbed in girlish admiration of the fair scene that could not fail to charm any beautyloving eye the cause of this rapid change soon appeared a hale handsome man between fifty and sixty came through the little gate leading to the park and seeing the young stranger paused to examine her he had only time for a glance however she seemed conscious of his presence in a moment turned with a startled look uttered an exclamation of surprise and looked as if hesitating whether to speak or run away gallant sir john took off his hat and said with the oldfashioned courtesy which became him well i beg your pardon for disturbing you young lady allow me to atone for it by inviting you to walk where you will and gather what flowers you like i see you love them so pray make free with those about you  with a charming air of maidenly timidity and artlessness miss muir replied oh thank you sir but it is i who should ask pardon for trespassing i never should have dared if i had not known that sir john was absent i always wanted to see this fine old place and ran over the first thing to satisfy myself  and are you satisfied he asked with a smile  more than satisfiedim charmed for it is the most beautiful spot i ever saw and ive seen many famous seats both at home and abroad she answered enthusiastically  the hall is much flattered and so would its master be if he heard you began the gentleman with an odd expression  i should not praise it to himat least not as freely as i have to you sir said the girl with eyes still turned away  why not asked her companion looking much amused  i should be afraid not that i dread sir john but ive heard so many beautiful and noble things about him and respect him so highly that i should not dare to say much lest he should see how i admire and  and what young lady finish if you please  i was going to say love him i will say it for he is an old man and one cannot help loving virtue and bravery  miss muir looked very earnest and pretty as she spoke standing there with the sunshine glinting on her yellow hair delicate face and downcast eyes sir john was not a vain man but he found it pleasant to hear himself commended by this unknown girl and felt redoubled curiosity to learn who she was too wellbred to ask or to abash her by avowing what she seemed unconscious of he left both discoveries to chance and when she turned as if to retrace her steps he offered her the handful of hothouse flowers which he held saying with a gallant bow in sir johns name let me give you my little nosegay with thanks for your good opinion which i assure you is not entirely deserved for i know him well  miss muir looked up quickly eyed him an instant then dropped her eyes and coloring deeply stammered out i did not knowi beg your pardonyou are too kind sir john  he laughed like a boy asking mischievously why call me sir john how do you know that i am not the gardener or the butler  i did not see your face before and no one but yourself would say that any praise was undeserved murmured miss muir still overcome with girlish confusion  well well we will let that pass and the next time you come we will be properly introduced bella always brings her friends to the hall for i am fond of young people  i am not a friend i am only miss coventrys governess and miss muir dropped a meek curtsy a slight change passed over sir johns manner few would have perceived it but miss muir felt it at once and bit her lips with an angry feeling at her heart with a curious air of pride mingled with respect she accepted the still offered bouquet returned sir johns parting bow and tripped away leaving the old gentleman to wonder where mrs coventry found such a piquant little governess  that is done and very well for a beginning she said to herself as she approached the house  in a green paddock close by fed a fine horse who lifted up his head and eyed her inquiringly like one who expected a greeting following a sudden impulse she entered the paddock and pulling a handful of clover invited the creature to come and eat this was evidently a new proceeding on the part of a lady and the horse careered about as if bent on frightening the newcomer away  i see she said aloud laughing to herself i am not your master and you rebel nevertheless ill conquer you my fine brute  seating herself in the grass she began to pull daisies singing idly the while as if unconscious of the spirited prancings of the horse presently he drew nearer sniffing curiously and eyeing her with surprise she took no notice but plaited the daisies and sang on as if he was not there this seemed to pique the petted creature for slowly approaching he came at length so close that he could smell her little foot and nibble at her dress then she offered the clover uttering caressing words and making soothing sounds till by degrees and with much coquetting the horse permitted her to stroke his glossy neck and smooth his mane  it was a pretty sightthe slender figure in the grass the highspirited horse bending his proud head to her hand edward coventry who had watched the scene found it impossible to restrain himself any longer and leaping the wall came to join the group saying with mingled admiration and wonder in countenance and voice good morning miss muir if i had not seen your skill and courage proved before my eyes i should be alarmed for your safety hector is a wild wayward beast and has damaged more than one groom who tried to conquer him  good morning mr coventry dont tell tales of this noble creature who has not deceived my faith in him your grooms did not know how to win his heart and so subdue his spirit without breaking it  miss muir rose as she spoke and stood with her hand on hectors neck while he ate the grass which she had gathered in the skirt of her dress  you have the secret and hector is your subject now though heretofore he has rejected all friends but his master will you give him his morning feast i always bring him bread and play with him before breakfast  then you are not jealous and she looked up at him with eyes so bright and beautiful in expression that the young man wondered he had not observed them before  not i pet him as much as you will it will do him good he is a solitary fellow for he scorns his own kind and lives alone like his master he added half to himself  alone with such a happy home mr coventry and a softly compassionate glance stole from the bright eyes  that was an ungrateful speech and i retract it for bellas sake younger sons have no position but such as they can make for themselves you know and ive had no chance yet  younger sons i thoughti beg pardon and miss muir paused as if remembering that she had no right to question  edward smiled and answered frankly nay dont mind me you thought i was the heir perhaps whom did you take my brother for last night  for some guest who admired miss beaufort i did not hear his name nor observe him enough to discover who he was i saw only your land mother your charming little sister and  she stopped there with a halfshy halfgrateful look at the young man which finished the sentence better than any words he was still a boy in spite of his oneandtwenty years and a little color came into his brown cheek as the eloquent eyes met his and fell before them  yes bella is a capital girl and one cant help loving her i know youll get her on for really she is the most delightful little dunce my mothers ill health and bellas devotion to her have prevented our attending to her education before next winter when we go to town she is to come out and must be prepared for that great event you know he said choosing a safe subject  i shall do my best and that reminds me that i should report myself to her instead of enjoying myself here when one has been ill and shut up a long time the country is so lovely one is apt to forget duty for pleasure please remind me if i am negligent mr coventry  that name belongs to gerald im only mr ned here he said as they walked toward the house while hector followed to the wall and sent a sonorous farewell after them  bella came running to meet them and greeted miss muir as if she had made up her mind to like her heartily what a lovely bouquet you have got i never can arrange flowers prettily which vexes me for mamma is so fond of them and cannot go out herself you have charming taste she said examining the graceful posy which miss muir had much improved by adding feathery grasses delicate ferns and fragrant wild flowers to sir johns exotics  putting them into bellas hand she said in a winning way take them to your mother then and ask her if i may have the pleasure of making her a daily nosegay for i should find real delight in doing it if it would please her  how kind you are of course it would please her ill take them to her while the dew is still on them and away flew bella eager to give both the flowers and the pretty message to the poor invalid  edward stopped to speak to the gardener and miss muir went up the steps alone the long hall was lined with portraits and pacing slowly down it she examined them with interest one caught her eye and pausing before it she scrutinized it carefully a young beautiful but very haughty female face miss muir suspected at once who it was and gave a decided nod as if she saw and caught at some unexpected chance a soft rustle behind her made her look around and seeing lucia she bowed half turned as if for another glance at the picture and said as if involuntarily how beautiful it is may i ask if it is an ancestor miss beaufort  it is the likeness of my mother was the reply given with a softened voice and eyes that looked up tenderly  ah i might have known from the resemblance but i scarcely saw you last night excuse my freedom but lady sydney treated me as a friend and i forget my position allow me  as she spoke miss muir stooped to return the handkerchief which had fallen from lucias hand and did so with a humble mien which touched the others heart for though a proud it was also a very generous one  thank you are you better this morning she said graciously and having received an affirmative reply she added as she walked on i will show you to the breakfast room as bella is not here it is a very informal meal with us for my aunt is never down and my cousins are very irregular in their hours you can always have yours when you like without waiting for us if you are an early riser  bella and edward appeared before the others were seated and miss muir quietly ate her breakfast feeling well satisfied with her hours work ned recounted her exploit with hector bella delivered her mothers thanks for the flowers and lucia more than once recalled with pardonable vanity that the governess had compared her to her lovely mother expressing by a look as much admiration for the living likeness as for the painted one all kindly did their best to make the pale girl feel at home and their cordial manner seemed to warm and draw her out for soon she put off her sad meek air and entertained them with gay anecdotes of her life in paris her travels in russia when governess in prince jermadoffs family and all manner of witty stories that kept them interested and merry long after the meal was over in the middle of an absorbing adventure coventry came in nodded lazily lifted his brows as if surprised at seeing the governess there and began his breakfast as if the ennui of another day had already taken possession of him miss muir stopped short and no entreaties could induce her to go on  another time i will finish it if you like now miss bella and i should be at our books and she left the room followed by her pupil taking no notice of the young master of the house beyond a graceful bow in answer to his careless nod  merciful creature she goes when i come and does not make life unendurable by moping about before my eyes does she belong to the moral the melancholy the romantic or the dashing class ned said gerald lounging over his coffee as he did over everything he attempted  to none of them she is a capital little woman i wish you had seen her tame hector this morning and edward repeated his story  not a bad move on her part said coventry in reply she must be an observing as well as an energetic young person to discover your chief weakness and attack it so soon first tame the horse and then the master it will be amusing to watch the game only i shall be under the painful necessity of checkmating you both if it gets serious  you neednt exert yourself old fellow on my account if i was not above thinking ill of an inoffensive girl i should say you were the prize best worth winning and advise you to take care of your own heart if youve got one which i rather doubt  i often doubt it myself but i fancy the little scotchwoman will not be able to satisfy either of us upon that point how does your highness like her asked coventry of his cousin who sat near him  better than i thought i should she is wellbred unassuming and very entertaining when she likes she has told us some of the wittiest stories ive heard for a long time didnt our laughter wake you replied lucia  yes now atone for it by amusing me with a repetition of these witty tales  that is impossible her accent and manner are half the charm said ned i wish you had kept away ten minutes longer for your appearance spoilt the best story of all  why didnt she go on asked coventry with a ray of curiosity  you forget that she overheard us last night and must feel that you consider her a bore she has pride and no woman forgets speeches like those you made answered lucia  or forgives them either i believe well i must be resigned to languish under her displeasure then on sydneys account i take a slight interest in her not that i expect to learn anything from her for a woman with a mouth like that never confides or confesses anything but i have a fancy to see what captivated him for captivated he was beyond a doubt and by no lady whom he met in society did you ever hear anything of it ned asked gerald  im not fond of scandal or gossip and never listen to either with which remark edward left the room  lucia was called out by the housekeeper a moment after and coventry left to the society most wearisome to him namely his own as he entered he had caught a part of the story which miss muir had been telling and it had excited his curiosity so much that he found himself wondering what the end could be and wishing that he might hear it  what the deuce did she run away for when i came in he thought if she is amusing she must make herself useful for its intensely dull i own here in spite of lucia hey whats that  it was a rich sweet voice singing a brilliant italian air and singing it with an expression that made the music doubly delicious stepping out of the french window coventry strolled along the sunny terrace enjoying the song with the relish of a connoisseur others followed and still he walked and listened forgetful of weariness or tune as one exquisite air ended he involuntarily applauded miss muirs face appeared for an instant then vanished and no more music followed though coventry lingered hoping to hear the voice again for music was the one thing of which he never wearied and neither lucia nor bella possessed skill enough to charm him for an hour he loitered on the terrace or the lawn basking in the sunshine too indolent to seek occupation or society at length bella came out hat in hand and nearly stumbled over her brother who lay on the grass  you lazy man have you been dawdling here all this time she said looking down at him  no ive been very busy come and tell me how youve got on with the little dragon  cant stop she bade me take a run after my french so that i might be ready for my drawing and so i must  its too warm to run sit down and amuse your deserted brother who has had no society but bees and lizards for an hour  he drew her down as he spoke and bella obeyed for in spite of his indolence he was one to whom all submitted without dreaming of refusal  what have you been doing muddling your poor little brains with all manner of elegant rubbish  no ive been enjoying myself immensely jean is so interesting so kind and clever she didnt bore me with stupid grammar but just talked to me in such pretty french that i got on capitally and like it as i never expected to after lucias dull way of teaching it  what did you talk about  oh all manner of things she asked questions and i answered and she corrected me  questions about our affairs i suppose  not one she dont care two sous for us or our affairs i thought she might like to know what sort of people we were so i told her about papas sudden death uncle john and you and ned but in the midst of it she said in her quiet way you are getting too confidential my dear it is not best to talk too freely of ones affairs to strangers let us speak of something else  what were you talking of when she said that bell  you  ah then no wonder she was bored  she was tired of my chatter and didnt hear half i said for she was busy sketching something for me to copy and thinking of something more interesting than the coventrys  how do you know  by the expression of her face did you like her music gerald  yes was she angry when i clapped  she looked surprised then rather proud and shut the piano at once though i begged her to go on isnt jean a pretty name  not bad but why dont you call her miss muir  she begged me not she hates it and loves to be called jean alone ive imagined such a nice little romance about her and someday i shall tell her for im sure she has had a love trouble  dont get such nonsense into your head but follow miss muirs wellbred example and dont be curious about other peoples affairs ask her to sing tonight it amuses me  she wont come down i think weve planned to read and work in my boudoir which is to be our study now mamma will stay in her room so you and lucia can have the drawing room all to yourselves  thank you what will ned do  he will amuse mamma he says dear old ned i wish youd stir about and get him his commission he is so impatient to be doing something and yet so proud he wont ask again after you have neglected it so many times and refused uncles help  ill attend to it very soon dont worry me child he will do very well for a time quietly here with us  you always say that yet you know he chafes and is unhappy at being dependent on you mamma and i dont mind but he is a man and it frets him he said hed take matters into his own hands soon and then you may be sorry you were so slow in helping him  miss muir is looking out of the window youd better go and take your run else she will scold  not she im not a bit afraid of her shes so gentle and sweet im fond of her already youll get as brown as ned lying here in the sun by the way miss muir agrees with me in thinking him handsomer than you  i admire her taste and quite agree with her  she said he was manly and that was more attractive than beauty in a man she does express things so nicely now im off and away danced bella humming the burden of miss muirs sweetest song  energy is more attractive than beauty in a man she is right but how the deuce can a man be energetic with nothing to expend his energies upon mused coventry with his hat over his eyes  a few moments later the sweep of a dress caught his ear without stirring a sidelong glance showed him miss muir coming across the terrace as if to join bella two stone steps led down to the lawn he lay near them and miss muir did not see him till close upon him she started and slipped on the last step recovered herself and glided on with a glance of unmistakable contempt as she passed the recumbent figure of the apparent sleeper several things in bellas report had nettled him but this look made him angry though he would not own it even to himself  gerald come here quick presently called bella from the rustic seat where she stood beside her governess who sat with her hand over her face as if in pain  gathering himself up coventry slowly obeyed but involuntarily quickened his pace as he heard miss muir say dont call him he can do nothing for the emphasis on the word he was very significant  what is it bella he asked looking rather wider awake than usual  you startled miss muir and made her turn her ankle now help her to the house for she is in great pain and dont lie there anymore to frighten people like a snake in the grass said his sister petulantly  i beg your pardon will you allow me and coventry offered his arm  miss muir looked up with the expression which annoyed him and answered coldly thank you miss bella will do as well  permit me to doubt that and with a gesture too decided to be resisted coventry drew her arm through his and led her into the house she submitted quietly said the pain would soon be over and when settled on the couch in bellas room dismissed him with the briefest thanks considering the unwonted exertion he had made he thought she might have been a little more grateful and went away to lucia who always brightened when he came  no more was seen of miss muir till teatime for now while the family were in retirement they dined early and saw no company the governess had excused herself at dinner but came down in the evening a little paler than usual and with a slight limp in her gait sir john was there talking with his nephew and they merely acknowledged her presence by the sort of bow which gentlemen bestow on governesses as she slowly made her way to her place behind the urn coventry said to his brother take her a footstool and ask her how she is ned then as if necessary to account for his politeness to his uncle he explained how he was the cause of the accident  yes yes i understand rather a nice little person i fancy not exactly a beauty but accomplished and wellbred which is better for one of her class  some tea sir john said a soft voice at his elbow and there was miss muir offering cups to the gentlemen  thank you thank you said sir john sincerely hoping she had overheard him  as coventry took his he said graciously you are very forgiving miss muir to wait upon me after i have caused you so much pain  it is my duty sir was her reply in a tone which plainly said but not my pleasure and she returned to her place to smile and chat and be charming with bella and her brother  lucia hovering near her uncle and gerald kept them to herself but was disturbed to find that their eyes often wandered to the cheerful group about the table and that their attention seemed distracted by the frequent bursts of laughter and fragments of animated conversation which reached them in the midst of an account of a tragic affair which she endeavored to make as interesting and pathetic as possible sir john burst into a hearty laugh which betrayed that he had been listening to a livelier story than her own much annoyed she said hastily i knew it would be so bella has no idea of the proper manner in which to treat a governess she and ned will forget the difference of rank and spoil that person for her work she is inclined to be presumptuous already and if my aunt wont trouble herself to give miss muir a hint in time i shall  wait until she has finished that story i beg of you said coventry for sir john was already off  if you find that nonsense so entertaining why dont you follow uncles example i dont need you  thank you i will and lucia was deserted  but miss muir had ended and beckoning to bella left the room as if quite unconscious of the honor conferred upon her or the dullness she left behind her ned went up to his mother gerald returned to make his peace with lucia and bidding them goodnight sir john turned homeward strolling along the terrace he came to the lighted window of bellas study and wishing to say a word to her he half pushed aside the curtain and looked in a pleasant little scene bella working busily and near her in a low chair with the light falling on her fair hair and delicate profile sat miss muir reading aloud novels thought sir john and smiled at them for a pair of romantic girls but pausing to listen a moment before he spoke he found it was no novel but history read with a fluency which made every fact interesting every sketch of character memorable by the dramatic effect given to it sir john was fond of history and failing eyesight often curtailed his favorite amusement he had tried readers but none suited him and he had given up the plan now as he listened he thought how pleasantly the smoothly flowing voice would wile away his evenings and he envied bella her new acquisition  a bell rang and bella sprang up saying wait for me a minute i must run to mamma and then we will go on with this charming prince  away she went and sir john was about to retire as quietly as he came when miss muirs peculiar behavior arrested him for an instant dropping the book she threw her arms across the table laid her head down upon them and broke into a passion of tears like one who could bear restraint no longer shocked and amazed sir john stole away but all that night the kindhearted gentleman puzzled his brains with conjectures about his nieces interesting young governess quite unconscious that she intended he should do so     chapter iii   passion and pique  for several weeks the most monotonous tranquillity seemed to reign at coventry house and yet unseen unsuspected a storm was gathering the arrival of miss muir seemed to produce a change in everyone though no one could have explained how or why nothing could be more unobtrusive and retiring than her manners she was devoted to bella who soon adored her and was only happy when in her society she ministered in many ways to mrs coventrys comfort and that lady declared there never was such a nurse she amused interested and won edward with her wit and womanly sympathy she made lucia respect and envy her for her accomplishments and piqued indolent gerald by her persistent avoidance of him while sir john was charmed with her respectful deference and the graceful little attentions she paid him in a frank and artless way very winning to the lonely old man the very servants liked her and instead of being what most governesses are a forlorn creature hovering between superiors and inferiors jean muir was the life of the house and the friend of all but two  lucia disliked her and coventry distrusted her neither could exactly say why and neither owned the feeling even to themselves both watched her covertly yet found no shortcoming anywhere meek modest faithful and invariably sweettemperedthey could complain of nothing and wondered at their own doubts though they could not banish them  it soon came to pass that the family was divided or rather that two members were left very much to themselves pleading timidity jean muir kept much in bellas study and soon made it such a pleasant little nook that ned and his mother and often sir john came in to enjoy the music reading or cheerful chat which made the evenings so gay lucia at first was only too glad to have her cousin to herself and he too lazy to care what went on about him but presently he wearied of her society for she was not a brilliant girl and possessed few of those winning arts which charm a man and steal into his heart rumors of the merrymakings that went on reached him and made him curious to share them echoes of fine music went sounding through the house as he lounged about the empty drawing room and peals of laughter reached him while listening to lucias grave discourse  she soon discovered that her society had lost its charm and the more eagerly she tried to please him the more signally she failed before long coventry fell into a habit of strolling out upon the terrace of an evening and amusing himself by passing and repassing the window of bellas room catching glimpses of what was going on and reporting the result of his observations to lucia who was too proud to ask admission to the happy circle or to seem to desire it  i shall go to london tomorrow lucia gerald said one evening as he came back from what he called a survey looking very much annoyed  to london exclaimed his cousin surprised  yes i must bestir myself and get ned his commission or it will be all over with him  how do you mean  he is falling in love as fast as it is possible for a boy to do it that girl has bewitched him and he will make a fool of himself very soon unless i put a stop to it  i was afraid she would attempt a flirtation these persons always do they are such a mischiefmaking race  ah but there you are wrong as far as little muir is concerned she does not flirt and ned has too much sense and spirit to be caught by a silly coquette she treats him like an elder sister and mingles the most attractive friendliness with a quiet dignity that captivates the boy ive been watching them and there he is devouring her with his eyes while she reads a fascinating novel in the most fascinating style bella and mamma are absorbed in the tale and see nothing but ned makes himself the hero miss muir the heroine and lives the love scene with all the ardor of a man whose heart has just waked up poor lad poor lad  lucia looked at her cousin amazed by the energy with which he spoke the anxiety in his usually listless face the change became him for it showed what he might be making one regret still more what he was before she could speak he was gone again to return presently laughing yet looking a little angry  what now she asked  listeners never hear any good of themselves is the truest of proverbs i stopped a moment to look at ned and heard the following flattering remarks mamma is gone and ned was asking little muir to sing that delicious barcarole she gave us the other evening  not now not here she said  why not you sang it in the drawing room readily enough said ned imploringly  that is a very different thing and she looked at him with a little shake of the head for he was folding his hands and doing the passionate pathetic  come and sing it there then said innocent bella gerald likes your voice so much and complains that you will never sing to him  he never asks me said muir with an odd smile  he is too lazy but he wants to hear you  when he asks me i will singif i feel like it and she shrugged her shoulders with a provoking gesture of indifference  but it amuses him and he gets so bored down here began stupid little bella dont be shy or proud jean but come and entertain the poor old fellow  no thank you i engaged to teach miss coventry not to amuse mr coventry was all the answer she got  you amuse ned why not gerald are you afraid of him asked bella  miss muir laughed such a scornful laugh and said in that peculiar tone of hers i cannot fancy anyone being afraid of your elder brother  i am very often and so would you be if you ever saw him angry and bella looked as if id beaten her  does he ever wake up enough to be angry asked that girl with an air of surprise here ned broke into a fit of laughter and they are at it now i fancy by the sound  their foolish gossip is not worth getting excited about but i certainly would send ned away its no use trying to get rid of that girl as you say for my aunt is as deluded about her as ned and bella and she really does get the child along splendidly dispatch ned and then she can do no harm said lucia watching coventrys altered face as he stood in the moonlight just outside the window where she sat  have you no fears for me he asked smiling as if ashamed of his momentary petulance  no have you for yourself and a shade of anxiety passed over her face  i defy the scotch witch to enchant me except with her music he added moving down the terrace again for jean was singing like a nightingale  as the song ended he put aside the curtain and said abruptly has anyone any commands for london i am going there tomorrow  a pleasant trip to you said ned carelessly though usually his brothers movements interested him extremely  i want quantities of things but i must ask mamma first and bella began to make a list  may i trouble you with a letter mr coventry  jean muir turned around on the music stool and looked at him with the cold keen glance which always puzzled him  he bowed saying as if to them all i shall be off by the early train so you must give me your orders tonight  then come away ned and leave jean to write her letter  and bella took her reluctant brother from the room  i will give you the letter in the morning said miss muir with a curious quiver in her voice and the look of one who forcibly suppressed some strong emotion  as you please and coventry went back to lucia wondering who miss muir was going to write to he said nothing to his brother of the purpose which took him to town lest a word should produce the catastrophe which he hoped to prevent and ned who now lived in a sort of dream seemed to forget geralds existence altogether  with unwonted energy coventry was astir seven next morning lucia gave him his breakfast and as he left the room to order the carriage miss muir came gliding downstairs very pale and heavyeyed with a sleepless tearful night he thought and putting a delicate little letter into his hand said hurriedly please leave this at lady sydneys and if you see her say i have remembered  her peculiar manner and peculiar message struck him his eye involuntarily glanced at the address of the letter and read young sydneys name then conscious of his mistake he thrust it into his pocket with a hasty good morning and left miss muir standing with one hand pressed on her heart the other half extended as if to recall the letter  all the way to london coventry found it impossible to forget the almost tragical expression of the girls face and it haunted him through the bustle of two busy days neds affair was put in the way of being speedily accomplished bellas commissions were executed his mothers pet delicacies provided for her and a gift for lucia whom the family had given him for his future mate as he was too lazy to choose for himself  jean muirs letter he had not delivered for lady sydney was in the country and her townhouse closed curious to see how she would receive his tidings he went quietly in on his arrival at home everyone had dispersed to dress for dinner except miss muir who was in the garden the servant said  very well i have a message for her and turning the young master as they called him went to seek her in a remote corner he saw her sitting alone buried in thought as his step roused her a look of surprise followed by one of satisfaction passed over her face and rising she beckoned to him with an almost eager gesture much amazed he went to her and offered the letter saying kindly i regret that i could not deliver it lady sydney is in the country and i did not like to post it without your leave did i do right  quite right thank you very muchit is better so and with an air of relief she tore the letter to atoms and scattered them to the wind  more amazed than ever the young man was about to leave her when she said with a mixture of entreaty and command please stay a moment i want to speak to you  he paused eyeing her with visible surprise for a sudden color dyed her cheeks and her lips trembled only for a moment then she was quite selfpossessed again motioning him to the seat she had left she remained standing while she said in a low rapid tone full of pain and of decision  mr coventry as the head of the house i want to speak to you rather than to your mother of a most unhappy affair which has occurred during your absence my month of probation ends today your mother wishes me to remain i too wish it sincerely for i am happy here but i ought not read this and you will see why  she put a hastily written note into his hand and watched him intently while he read it she saw him flush with anger bite his lips and knit his brows then assume his haughtiest look as he lifted his eyes and said in his most sarcastic tone very well for a beginning the boy has eloquence pity that it should be wasted may i ask if you have replied to this rhapsody  i have  and what follows he begs you to fly with him to share his fortunes and be the good angel of his life of course you consent  there was no answer for standing erect before him miss muir regarded him with an expression of proud patience like one who expected reproaches yet was too generous to resent them her manner had its effect dropping his bitter tone coventry asked briefly why do you show me this what can i do  i show it that you may see how much in earnest the boy is and how open i desire to be you can control advise and comfort your brother and help me to see what is my duty  you love him demanded coventry bluntly  no was the quick decided answer  then why make him love you  i never tried to do it your sister will testify that i have endeavored to avoid him as i and he finished the sentence with an unconscious tone of pique as you have avoided me  she bowed silently and he went on  i will do you the justice to say that nothing can be more blameless than your conduct toward myself but why allow ned to haunt you evening after evening what could you expect of a romantic boy who had nothing to do but lose his heart to the first attractive woman he met  a momentary glisten shone in jean muirs steelblue eyes as the last words left the young mans lips but it was gone instantly and her voice was full of reproach as she said steadily impulsively if the romantic boy had been allowed to lead the life of a man as he longed to do he would have had no time to lose his heart to the first sorrowful girl whom he pitied mr coventry the fault is yours do not blame your brother but generously own your mistake and retrieve it in the speediest kindest manner  for an instant gerald sat dumb never since his father died had anyone reproved him seldom in his life had he been blamed it was a new experience and the very novelty added to the effect he saw his fault regretted it and admired the brave sincerity of the girl in telling him of it but he did not know how to deal with the case and was forced to confess not only past negligence but present incapacity he was as honorable as he was proud and with an effort he said frankly you are right miss muir i am to blame yet as soon as i saw the danger i tried to avert it my visit to town was on neds account he will have his commission very soon and then he will be sent out of harms way can i do more  no it is too late to send him away with a free and happy heart he must bear his pain as he can and it may help to make a man of him she said sadly  hell soon forget began coventry who found the thought of gay ned suffering an uncomfortable one  yes thank heaven that is possible for men  miss muir pressed her hands together with a dark expression on her halfaverted face something in her tone her manner touched coventry he fancied that some old wound bled some bitter memory awoke at the approach of a new lover he was young heartwhole and romantic under all his cool nonchalance of manner this girl who he fancied loved his friend and who was beloved by his brother became an object of interest to him he pitied her desired to help her and regretted his past distrust as a chivalrous man always regrets injustice to a woman she was happy here poor homeless soul and she should stay bella loved her his mother took comfort in her and when ned was gone no ones peace would be endangered by her winning ways her rich accomplishments these thoughts swept through his mind during a brief pause and when he spoke it was to say gently  miss muir i thank you for the frankness which must have been painful to you and i will do my best to be worthy of the confidence which you repose in me you were both discreet and kind to speak only to me this thing would have troubled my mother extremely and have done no good i shall see ned and try and repair my long neglect as promptly as possible i know you will help me and in return let me beg of you to remain for he will soon be gone  she looked at him with eyes full of tears and there was no coolness in the voice that answered softly you are too kind but i had better go it is not wise to stay  why not  she colored beautifully hesitated then spoke out in the clear steady voice which was her greatest charm if i had known there were sons in this family i never should have come lady sydney spoke only of your sister and when i found two gentlemen i was troubled becausei am so unfortunateor rather people are so kind as to like me more than i deserve i thought i could stay a month at least as your brother spoke of going away and you were already affianced but  i am not affianced  why he said that coventry could not tell but the words passed his lips hastily and could not be recalled jean muir took the announcement oddly enough she shrugged her shoulders with an air of extreme annoyance and said almost rudely then you should be you will be soon but that is nothing to me miss beaufort wishes me gone and i am too proud to remain and become the cause of disunion in a happy family no i will go and go at once  she turned away impetuously but edwards arm detained her and edwards voice demanded tenderly where will you go my jean  the tender touch and name seemed to rob her of her courage and calmness for leaning on her lover she hid her face and sobbed audibly  now dont make a scene for heavens sake began coventry impatiently as his brother eyed him fiercely divining at once what had passed for his letter was still in geralds hand and jeans last words had reached her lovers ear  who gave you the right to read that and to interfere in my affairs demanded edward hotly  miss muir was the reply as coventry threw away the paper  and you add to the insult by ordering her out of the house cried ned with increasing wrath  on the contrary i beg her to remain  the deuce you do and why  because she is useful and happy here and i am unwilling that your folly should rob her of a home which she likes  you are very thoughtful and devoted all at once but i beg you will not trouble yourself jeans happiness and home will be my care now  my dear boy do be reasonable the thing is impossible miss muir sees it herself she came to tell me to ask how best to arrange matters without troubling my mother ive been to town to attend to your affairs and you may be off now very soon  i have no desire to go last month it was the wish of my heart now ill accept nothing from you and edward turned moodily away from his brother  what folly ned you must leave home it is all arranged and cannot be given up now a change is what you need and it will make a man of you we shall miss you of course but you will be where youll see something of life and that is better for you than getting into mischief here  are you going away jean asked edward ignoring his brother entirely and bending over the girl who still hid her face and wept she did not speak and gerald answered for her  no why should she if you are gone  do you mean to stay asked the lover eagerly of jean  i wish to remain but she paused and looked up her eyes went from one face to the other and she added decidedly yes i must go it is not wise to stay even when you are gone  neither of the young men could have explained why that hurried glance affected them as it did but each felt conscious of a willful desire to oppose the other edward suddenly felt that his brother loved miss muir and was bent on removing her from his way gerald had a vague idea that miss muir feared to remain on his account and he longed to show her that he was quite safe each felt angry and each showed it in a different way one being violent the other satirical  you are right jean this is not the place for you and you must let me see you in a safer home before i go said ned significantly  it strikes me that this will be a particularly safe home when your dangerous self is removed began coventry with an aggravating smile of calm superiority  and i think that i leave a more dangerous person than myself behind me as poor lucia can testify  be careful what you say ned or i shall be forced to remind you that i am master here leave lucias name out of this disagreeable affair if you please  you are master here but not of me or my actions and you have no right to expect obedience or respect for you inspire neither jean i asked you to go with me secretly now i ask you openly to share my fortune in my brothers presence i ask and will have an answer  he caught her hand impetuously with a defiant look at coventry who still smiled as if at boys play though his eyes were kindling and his face changing with the still white wrath which is more terrible than any sudden outburst miss muir looked frightened she shrank away from her passionate young lover cast an appealing glance at gerald and seemed as if she longed to claim his protection yet dared not  speak cried edward desperately dont look to him tell me truly with your own lips do you can you love me jean  i have told you once why pain me by forcing another hard reply she said pitifully still shrinking from his grasp and seeming to appeal to his brother  you wrote a few lines but ill not be satisfied with that you shall answer ive seen love in your eyes heard it in your voice and i know it is hidden in your heart you fear to own it do not hesitate no one can part usspeak jean and satisfy me  drawing her hand decidedly away she went a step nearer coventry and answered slowly distinctly though her lips trembled and she evidently dreaded the effect of her words i will speak and speak truly you have seen love in my face it is in my heart and i do not hesitate to own it cruel as it is to force the truth from me but this love is not for you are you satisfied  he looked at her with a despairing glance and stretched his hand toward her beseechingly she seemed to fear a blow for suddenly she clung to gerald with a faint cry the act the look of fear the protecting gesture coventry involuntarily made were too much for edward already excited by conflicting passions in a paroxysm of blind wrath he caught up a large pruning knife left there by the gardener and would have dealt his brother a fatal blow had he not warded it off with his arm the stroke fell and another might have followed had not miss muir with unexpected courage and strength wrested the knife from edward and flung it into the little pond near by coventry dropped down upon the seat for the blood poured from a deep wound in his arm showing by its rapid flow that an artery had been severed edward stood aghast for with the blow his fury passed leaving him overwhelmed with remorse and shame  gerald looked up at him smiled faintly and said with no sign of reproach or anger never mind ned forgive and forget lend me a hand to the house and dont disturb anyone its not much i dare say but his lips whitened as he spoke and his strength failed him edward sprang to support him and miss muir forgetting her terrors proved herself a girl of uncommon skill and courage  quick lay him down give me your handkerchief and bring some water she said in a tone of quiet command poor ned obeyed and watched her with breathless suspense while she tied the handkerchief tightly around the arm thrust the handle of his riding whip underneath and pressed it firmly above the severed artery to stop the dangerous flow of blood  dr scott is with your mother i think go and bring him here was the next order and edward darted away thankful to do anything to ease the terror which possessed him he was gone some minutes and while they waited coventry watched the girl as she knelt beside him bathing his face with one hand while with the other she held the bandage firmly in its place she was pale but quite steady and selfpossessed and her eyes shone with a strange brilliancy as she looked down at him once meeting his look of grateful wonder she smiled a reassuring smile that made her lovely and said in a soft sweet tone never used to him before be quiet there is no danger i will stay by you till help comes  help did come speedily and the doctors first words were who improvised that tourniquet  she did murmured coventry  then you may thank her for saving your life by jove it was capitally done and the old doctor looked at the girl with as much admiration as curiosity in his face  never mind that see to the wound please while i ran for bandages and salts and wine  miss muir was gone as she spoke so fleetly that it was in vain to call her back or catch her during her brief absence the story was told by repentant ned and the wound examined  fortunately i have my case of instruments with me said the doctor spreading on the bench a long array of tiny glittering implements of torture now mr ned come here and hold the arm in that way while i tie the artery hey that will never do dont tremble so man look away and hold it steadily  i cant and poor ned turned faint and white not at the sight but with the bitter thought that he had longed to kill his brother  i will hold it and a slender white hand lifted the bare and bloody arm so firmly steadily that coventry sighed a sigh of relief and dr scott fell to work with an emphatic nod of approval  it was soon over and while edward ran in to bid the servants beware of alarming their mistress dr scott put up his instruments and miss muir used salts water and wine so skillfully that gerald was able to walk to his room leaning on the old man while the girl supported the wounded arm as no sling could be made on the spot as he entered the chamber coventry turned put out his left hand and with much feeling in his fine eyes said simply miss muir i thank you  the color came up beautifully in her pale cheeks as she pressed the hand and without a word vanished from the room lucia and the housekeeper came bustling in and there was no lack of attendance on the invalid he soon wearied of it and sent them all away but ned who remorsefully haunted the chamber looking like a comely young cain and feeling like an outcast  come here lad and tell me all about it i was wrong to be domineering forgive me and believe that i care for your happiness more sincerely than for my own  these frank and friendly words healed the breach between the two brothers and completely conquered ned gladly did he relate his love passages for no young lover ever tires of that amusement if he has a sympathizing auditor and gerald was sympathetic now for an hour did he lie listening patiently to the history of the growth of his brothers passion emotion gave the narrator eloquence and jean muirs character was painted in glowing colors all her unsuspected kindness to those about her was dwelt upon all her faithful care her sisterly interest in bella her gentle attentions to their mother her sweet forbearance with lucia who plainly showed her dislike and most of all her friendly counsel sympathy and regard for ned himself  she would make a man of me she puts strength and courage into me as no one else can she is unlike any girl i ever saw theres no sentimentality about her she is wise and kind and sweet she says what she means looks you straight in the eye and is as true as steel ive tried her i know her andah gerald i love her so  here the poor lad leaned his face into his hands and sighed a sigh that made his brothers heart ache  upon my soul ned i feel for you and if there was no obstacle on her part id do my best for you she loves sydney and so there is nothing for it but to bear your fate like a man  are you sure about sydney may it not be some one else and ned eyed his brother with a suspicious look  coventry told him all he knew and surmised concerning his friend not forgetting the letter edward mused a moment then seemed relieved and said frankly im glad its sydney and not you i can bear it better  me ejaculated gerald with a laugh  yes you ive been tormented lately with a fear that you cared for her or rather she for you  you jealous young fool we never see or speak to one another scarcely so how could we get up a tender interest  what do you lounge about on that terrace for every evening and why does she get fluttered when your shadow begins to come and go demanded edward  i like the music and dont care for the society of the singer thats why i walk there the fluttering is all your imagination miss muir isnt a woman to be fluttered by a mans shadow and coventry glanced at his useless arm  thank you for that and for not saying little muir as you generally do perhaps it was my imagination but she never makes fun of you now and so i fancied she might have lost her heart to the young master women often do you know  she used to ridicule me did she asked coventry taking no notice of the latter part of his brothers speech which was quite true nevertheless  not exactly she was too wellbred for that but sometimes when bella and i joked about you shed say something so odd or witty that it was irresistible youre used to being laughed at so you dont mind i know just among ourselves  not i laugh away as much as you like said gerald but he did mind and wanted exceedingly to know what miss muir had said yet was too proud to ask he turned restlessly and uttered a sigh of pain  im talking too much its bad for you dr scott said you must be quiet now go to sleep if you can  edward left the bedside but not the room for he would let no one take his place coventry tried to sleep found it impossible and after a restless hour called his brother back  if the bandage was loosened a bit it would ease my arm and then i could sleep can you do it ned  i dare not touch it the doctor gave orders to leave it till he came in the morning and i shall only do harm if i try  but i tell you its too tight my arm is swelling and the pain is intense it cant be right to leave it so dr scott dressed it in a hurry and did it too tight common sense will tell you that said coventry impatiently  ill call mrs morris she will understand whats best to be done and edward moved toward the door looking anxious  not she shell only make a stir and torment me with her chatter ill bear it as long as i can and perhaps dr scott will come tonight he said he would if possible go to your dinner ned i can ring for neal if i need anything i shall sleep if im alone perhaps  edward reluctantly obeyed and his brother was left to himself little rest did he find however for the pain of the wounded arm grew unbearable and taking a sudden resolution he rang for his servant  neal go to miss coventrys study and if miss muir is there ask her to be kind enough to come to me im in great pain and she understand wounds better than anyone else in the house  with much surprise in his face the man departed and a few moments after the door noiselessly opened and miss muir came in it had been a very warm day and for the first time she had left off her plain black dress all in white with no ornament but her fair hair and a fragrant posy of violets in her belt she looked a different woman from the meek nunlike creature one usually saw about the house her face was as altered as her dress for now a soft color glowed in her cheeks her eyes smiled shyly and her lips no longer wore the firm look of one who forcibly repressed every emotion a fresh gentle and charming woman she seemed and coventry found the dull room suddenly brightened by her presence going straight to him she said simply and with a happy helpful look very comforting to see im glad you sent for me what can i do for you  he told her and before the complaint was ended she began loosening the bandages with the decision of one who understood what was to be done and had faith in herself  ah thats relief thats comfort ejaculated coventry as the last tight fold fell away ned was afraid i should bleed to death if he touched me what will the doctor say to us  i neither know nor care i shall say to him that he is a bad surgeon to bind it so closely and not leave orders to have it untied if necessary now i shall make it easy and put you to sleep for that is what you need shall i may i  i wish you would if you can  and while she deftly rearranged the bandages the young man watched her curiously presently he asked how came you to know so much about these things  in the hospital where i was ill i saw much that interested me and when i got better i used to sing to the patients sometimes  do you mean to sing to me he asked in the submissive tone men unconsciously adopt when ill and in a womans care  if you like it better than reading aloud in a dreamy tone she answered as she tied the last knot  i do much better he said decidedly  you are feverish i shall wet your forehead and then you will be quite comfortable she moved about the room in the quiet way which made it a pleasure to watch her and having mingled a little cologne with water bathed his face as unconcernedly as if he had been a child her proceedings not only comforted but amused coventry who mentally contrasted her with the stout beerdrinking matron who had ruled over him in his last illness  a clever kindly little woman he thought and felt quite at his ease she was so perfectly easy herself  there now you look more like yourself she said with an approving nod as she finished and smoothed the dark locks off his forehead with a cool soft hand then seating herself in a large chair near by she began to sing while tidily rolling up the fresh bandages which had been left for the morning coventry lay watching her by the dim light that burned in the room and she sang on as easily as a bird a dreamy lowtoned lullaby which soothed the listener like a spell presently looking up to see the effect of her song she found the young man wide awake and regarding her with a curious mixture of pleasure interest and admiration  shut your eyes mr coventry she said with a reproving shake of the head and an odd little smile  he laughed and obeyed but could not resist an occasional covert glance from under his lashes at the slender white figure in the great velvet chair she saw him and frowned  you are very disobedient why wont you sleep  i cant i want to listen im fond of nightingales  then i shall sing no more but try something that has never failed yet give me your hand please  much amazed he gave it and taking it in both her small ones she sat down behind the curtain and remained as mute and motionless as a statue coventry smiled to himself at first and wondered which would tire first but soon a subtle warmth seemed to steal from the soft palms that enclosed his own his heart beat quicker his breath grew unequal and a thousand fancies danced through his brain he sighed and said dreamily as he turned his face toward her i like this and in the act of speaking seemed to sink into a soft cloud which encompassed him about with an atmosphere of perfect repose more than this he could not remember for sleep deep and dreamless fell upon him and when he woke daylight was shining in between the curtains his hand lay alone on the coverlet and his fairhaired enchantress was gone     chapter iv   a discovery  for several days coventry was confined to his room much against his will though everyone did their best to lighten his irksome captivity his mother petted him bella sang lucia read edward was devoted and all the household with one exception were eager to serve the young master jean muir never came near him and jean muir alone seemed to possess the power of amusing him he soon tired of the others wanted something new recalled the piquant character of the girl and took a fancy into his head that she would lighten his ennui after some hesitation he carelessly spoke of her to bella but nothing came of it for bella only said jean was well and very busy doing something lovely to surprise mamma with edward complained that he never saw her and lucia ignored her existence altogether the only intelligence the invalid received was from the gossip of two housemaids over their work in the next room from them he learned that the governess had been scolded by miss beaufort for going to mr coventrys room that she had taken it very sweetly and kept herself carefully out of the way of both young gentlemen though it was plain to see that mr ned was dying for her  mr gerald amused himself by thinking over this gossip and quite annoyed his sister by his absence of mind  gerald do you know neds commission has come  very interesting read on bella  you stupid boy you dont know a word i say and she put down the book to repeat her news  im glad of it now we must get him off as soon as possiblethat is i suppose he will want to be off as soon as possible and coventry woke up from his reverie  you neednt check yourself i know all about it i think ned was very foolish and that miss muir has behaved beautifully its quite impossible of course but i wish it wasnt i do so like to watch lovers you and lucia are so cold you are not a bit interesting  youll do me a favor if youll stop all that nonsense about lucia and me we are not lovers and never shall be i fancy at all events im tired of the thing and wish you and mamma would let it drop for the present at least  oh gerald you know mamma has set her heart upon it that papa desired it and poor lucia loves you so much how can you speak of dropping what will make us all so happy  it wont make me happy and i take the liberty of thinking that this is of some importance im not bound in any way and dont intend to be till i am ready now well talk about ned  much grieved and surprised bella obeyed and devoted herself to edward who very wisely submitted to his fate and prepared to leave home for some months for a week the house was in a state of excitement about his departure and everyone but jean was busied for him she was scarcely seen every morning she gave bella her lessons every afternoon drove out with mrs coventry and nearly every evening went up to the hall to read to sir john who found his wish granted without exactly knowing how it had been done  the day edward left he came down from bidding his mother goodbye looking very pale for he had lingered in his sisters little room with miss muir as long as he dared  goodbye dear be kind to jean he whispered as he kissed his sister  i will i will returned bella with tearful eyes  take care of mamma and remember lucia he said again as he touched his cousins beautiful cheek  fear nothing i will keep them apart she whispered back and coventry heard it  edward offered his hand to his brother saying significantly as he looked him in the eye i trust you gerald  you may ned  then he went and coventry tired himself with wondering what lucia meant a few days later he understood  now ned is gone little muir will appear i fancy he said to himself but little muir did not appear and seemed to shun him more carefully than she had done her lover if he went to the drawing room in the evening hoping for music lucia alone was there if he tapped at bellas door there was always a pause before she opened it and no sign of jean appeared though her voice had been audible when he knocked if he went to the library a hasty rustle and the sound of flying feet betrayed that the room was deserted at his approach in the garden miss muir never failed to avoid him and if by chance they met in hall or breakfast room she passed him with downcast eyes and the briefest coldest greeting all this annoyed him intensely and the more she eluded him the more he desired to see herfrom a spirit of opposition he said nothing more it fretted and yet it entertained him and he found a lazy sort of pleasure in thwarting the girls little maneuvers his patience gave out at last and he resolved to know what was the meaning of this peculiar conduct having locked and taken away the key of one door in the library he waited till miss muir went in to get a book for his uncle he had heard her speak to bella of it knew that she believed him with his mother and smiled to himself as he stole after her she was standing in a chair reaching up and he had time to see a slender waist a pretty foot before he spoke  can i help you miss muir  she started dropped several books and turned scarlet as she said hurriedly thank you no i can get the steps  my long arm will be less trouble ive got but one and that is tired of being idle so it is very much at your service what will you have  iiyou startled me so ive forgotten and jean laughed nervously as she looked about her as if planning to escape  i beg your pardon wait till you remember and let me thank you for the enchanted sleep you gave me ten days ago ive had no chance yet youve shunned me so pertinaciously  indeed i try not to be rude but she checked herself and turned her face away adding with an accent of pain in her voice it is not my fault mr coventry i only obey orders  whose orders he demanded still standing so that she could not escape  dont ask it is one who has a right to command where you are concerned be sure that it is kindly meant though it may seem folly to us nay dont be angry laugh at it as i do and let me run away please  she turned and looked down at him with tears in her eyes a smile on her lips and an expression half sad half arch which was altogether charming the frown passed from his face but he still looked grave and said decidedly no one has a right to command in this house but my mother or myself was it she who bade you avoid me as if i was a madman or a pest  ah dont ask i promised not to tell and you would not have me break my word i know and still smiling she regarded him with a look of merry malice which made any other reply unnecessary it was lucia he thought and disliked his cousin intensely just then miss muir moved as if to step down he detained her saying earnestly yet with a smile do you consider me the master here  yes and to the word she gave a sweet submissive intonation which made it expressive of the respect regard and confidence which men find pleasantest when women feel and show it unconsciously his face softened and he looked up at her with a different glance from any he had ever given her before  well then will you consent to obey me if i am not tyrannical or unreasonable in my demands  ill try  good now frankly i want to say that all this sort of thing is very disagreeable to me it annoys me to be a restraint upon anyones liberty or comfort and i beg you will go and come as freely as you like and not mind lucias absurdities she means well but hasnt a particle of penetration or tact will you promise this  no  why not  it is better as it is perhaps  but you called it folly just now  yes it seems so and yet she paused looking both confused and distressed  coventry lost patience and said hastily you women are such enigmas i never expect to understand you well ive done my best to make you comfortable but if you prefer to lead this sort of life i beg you will do so  i dont prefer it it is hateful to me i like to be myself to have my liberty and the confidence of those about me but i cannot think it kind to disturb the peace of anyone and so i try to obey ive promised bella to remain but i will go rather than have another scene with miss beaufort or with you  miss muir had burst out impetuously and stood there with a sudden fire in her eyes sudden warmth and spirit in her face and voice that amazed coventry she was angry hurt and haughty and the change only made her more attractive for not a trace of her former meek self remained coventry was electrified and still more surprised when she added imperiously with a gesture as if to put him aside hand me that book and move away i wish to go  he obeyed even offered his hand but she refused it stepped lightly down and went to the door there she turned and with the same indignant voice the same kindling eyes and glowing cheeks she said rapidly i know i have no right to speak in this way i restrain myself as long as i can but when i can bear no more my true self breaks loose and i defy everything i am tired of being a cold calm machine it is impossible with an ardent nature like mine and i shall try no longer i cannot help it if people love me i dont want their love i only ask to be left in peace and why i am tormented so i cannot see ive neither beauty money nor rank yet every foolish boy mistakes my frank interest for something warmer and makes me miserable it is my misfortune think of me what you will but beware of me in time for against my will i may do you harm  almost fiercely she had spoken and with a warning gesture she hurried from the room leaving the young man feeling as if a sudden thundergust had swept through the house for several minutes he sat in the chair she left thinking deeply suddenly he rose went to his sister and said in his usual tone of indolent good nature bella didnt i hear ned ask you to be kind to miss muir  yes and i try to be but she is so odd lately  odd how do you mean  why she is either as calm and cold as a statue or restless and queer she cries at night i know and sighs sadly when she thinks i dont hear something is the matter  she frets for ned perhaps began coventry  oh dear no its a great relief to her that he is gone im afraid that she likes someone very much and someone dont like her can it be mr sydney  she called him a titled fool once but perhaps that didnt mean anything did you ever ask her about him said coventry feeling rather ashamed of his curiosity yet unable to resist the temptation of questioning unsuspecting bella  yes but she only looked at me in her tragical way and said so pitifully my little friend i hope you will never have to pass through the scenes ive passed through but keep your peace unbroken all your life after that i dared say no more im very fond of her i want to make her happy but i dont know how can you propose anything  i was going to propose that you make her come among us more now ned is gone it must be dull for her moping about alone im sure it is for me she is an entertaining little person and i enjoy her music very much its good for mamma to have gay evenings so you bestir yourself and see what you can do for the general good of the family  thats all very charming and ive proposed it more than once but lucia spoils all my plans she is afraid youll follow neds example and that is so silly  lucia is ano i wont say fool because she has sense enough when she chooses but i wish youd just settle things with mamma and then lucia can do nothing but submit said gerald angrily  ill try but she goes up to read to uncle you know and since he has had the gout she stays later so i see little of her in the evening there she goes now i think she will captivate the old one as well as the young one she is so devoted  coventry looked after her slender black figure just vanishing through the great gate and an uncomfortable fancy took possession of him born of bellas careless words he sauntered away and after eluding his cousin who seemed looking for him he turned toward the hall saying to himself i will see what is going on up here such things have happened uncle is the simplest soul alive and if the girl is ambitious she can do what she will with him  here a servant came running after him and gave him a letter which he thrust into his pocket without examining it when he reached the hall he went quietly to his uncles study the door was ajar and looking in he saw a scene of tranquil comfort very pleasant to watch sir john leaned in his easy chair with one foot on a cushion he was dressed with his usual care and in spite of the gout looked like a handsome wellpreserved old gentleman he was smiling as he listened and his eyes rested complacently on jean muir who sat near him reading in her musical voice while the sunshine glittered on her hair and the soft rose of her cheek she read well yet coventry thought her heart was not in her task for once when she paused while sir john spoke her eyes had an absent expression and she leaned her head upon her hand with an air of patient weariness  poor girl i did her great injustice she has no thought of captivating the old man but amuses him from simple kindness she is tired ill put an end to her task and coventry entered without knocking  sir john received him with an air of polite resignation miss muir with a perfectly expressionless face  mothers love and how are you today sir  comfortable but dull so i want you to bring the girls over this evening to amuse the old gentleman mrs king has got out the antique costumes and trumpery as i promised bella she should have them and tonight we are to have a merrymaking as we used to do when ned was here  very well sir ill bring them weve all been out of sorts since the lad left and a little jollity will do us good are you going back miss muir asked coventry  no i shall keep her to give me my tea and get things ready dont read anymore my dear but go and amuse yourself with the pictures or whatever you like said sir john and like a dutiful daughter she obeyed as if glad to get away  thats a very charming girl gerald began sir john as she left the room im much interested in her both on her own account and on her mothers  her mothers what do you know of her mother asked coventry much surprised  her mother was lady grace howard who ran away with a poor scotch minister twenty years ago the family cast her off and she lived and died so obscurely that very little is known of her except that she left an orphan girl at some small french pension this is the girl and a fine girl too im surprised that you did not know this  so am i but it is like her not to tell she is a strange proud creature lady howards daughter upon my word that is a discovery and coventry felt his interest in his sisters governess much increased by this fact for like all wellborn englishmen he valued rank and gentle blood even more than he cared to own  she has had a hard life of it this poor little girl but she has a brave spirit and will make her way anywhere said sir john admiringly  did ned know this asked gerald suddenly  no she only told me yesterday i was looking in the peerage and chanced to speak of the howards she forgot herself and called lady grace her mother then i got the whole story for the lonely little thing was glad to make a confidant of someone  that accounts for her rejection of sydney and ned she knows she is their equal and will not snatch at the rank which is hers by right no shes not mercenary or ambitious  what do you say asked sir john for coventry had spoken more to himself than to his uncle  i wonder if lady sydney was aware of this was all geralds answer  no jean said she did not wish to be pitied and so told nothing to the mother i think the son knew but that was a delicate point and i asked no questions  i shall write to him as soon as i discover his address we have been so intimate i can venture to make a few inquiries about miss muir and prove the truth of her story  do you mean to say that you doubt it demanded sir john angrily  i beg your pardon uncle but i must confess i have an instinctive distrust of that young person it is unjust i dare say yet i cannot banish it  dont annoy me by expressing it if you please i have some penetration and experience and i respect and pity miss muir heartily this dislike of yours may be the cause of her late melancholy hey gerald and sir john looked suspiciously at his nephew  anxious to avert the rising storm coventry said hastily as he turned away ive neither time nor inclination to discuss the matter now sir but will be careful not to offend again ill take your message to bella so goodbye for an hour uncle  and coventry went his way through the park thinking within himself the dear old gentleman is getting fascinated like poor ned how the deuce does the girl do it lady howards daughter yet never told us i dont understand that     chapter v   how the girl did it  at home he found a party of young friends who hailed with delight the prospect of a revel at the hall an hour later the blithe company trooped into the great saloon where preparations had already been made for a dramatic evening  good sir john was in his element for he was never so happy as when his house was full of young people several persons were chosen and in a few moments the curtains were withdrawn from the first of these impromptu tableaux a swarthy darkly bearded man lay asleep on a tiger skin in the shadow of a tent oriental arms and drapery surrounded him an antique silver lamp burned dimly on a table where fruit lay heaped in costly dishes and wine shone redly in halfemptied goblets bending over the sleeper was a woman robed with barbaric splendor one hand turned back the embroidered sleeve from the arm which held a scimitar one slender foot in a scarlet sandal was visible under the white tunic her purple mantle swept down from snowy shoulders fillets of gold bound her hair and jewels shone on neck and arms she was looking over her shoulder toward the entrance of the tent with a steady yet stealthy look so effective that for a moment the spectators held their breath as if they also heard a passing footstep  who is it whispered lucia for the face was new to her  jean muir answered coventry with an absorbed look  impossible she is small and fair began lucia but a hasty hush let me look from her cousin silenced her  impossible as it seemed he was right nevertheless for jean muir it was she had darkened her skin painted her eyebrows disposed some wild black locks over her fair hair and thrown such an intensity of expression into her eyes that they darkened and dilated till they were as fierce as any southern eyes that ever flashed hatred the deepest and bitterest was written on her sternly beautiful face courage glowed in her glance power spoke in the nervous grip of the slender hand that held the weapon and the indomitable will of the woman was expressedeven the firm pressure of the little foot half hidden in the tiger skin  oh isnt she splendid cried bella under her breath  she looks as if shed use her sword well when the time comes said someone admiringly  good night to holofernes his fate is certain added another  he is the image of sydney with that beard on  doesnt she look as if she really hated him  perhaps she does  coventry uttered the last exclamation for the two which preceded it suggested an explanation of the marvelous change in jean it was not all art the intense detestation mingled with a savage joy that the object of her hatred was in her power was too perfect to be feigned and having the key to a part of her story coventry felt as if he caught a glimpse of the truth it was but a glimpse however for the curtain dropped before he had half analyzed the significance of that strange face  horrible im glad its over said lucia coldly  magnificent encore encore cried gerald enthusiastically  but the scene was over and no applause could recall the actress two or three graceful or gay pictures followed but jean was in none and each lacked the charm which real talent lends to the simplest part  coventry you are wanted called a voice and to everyones surprise coventry went though heretofore he had always refused to exert himself when handsome actors were in demand  what part am i to spoil he asked as he entered the green room where several excited young gentlemen were costuming and attitudinizing  a fugitive cavalier put yourself into this suit and lose no time asking questions miss muir will tell you what to do she is in the tableau so no one will mind you said the manager pro tem throwing a rich old suit toward coventry and resuming the painting of a moustache on his own boyish face  a gallant cavalier was the result of geralds hasty toilet and when he appeared before the ladies a general glance of admiration was bestowed upon him  come along and be placed jean is ready on the stage and bella ran before him exclaiming to her governess here he is quite splendid wasnt he good to do it  miss muir in the charmingly prim and puritanical dress of a roundhead damsel was arranging some shrubs but turned suddenly and dropped the green branch she held as her eye met the glittering figure advancing toward her  you she said with a troubled look adding low to bella why did you ask him i begged you not  he is the only handsome man here and the best actor if he likes he wont play usually so make the most of him and bella was off to finish powdering her hair for the marriage à la mode  i was sent for and i came do you prefer some other person asked coventry at a loss to understand the halfanxious halfeager expression of the face under the little cap  it changed to one of mingled annoyance and resignation as she said it is too late please kneel here half behind the shrubs put down your hat andallow meyou are too elegant for a fugitive  as he knelt before her she disheveled his hair pulled his lace collar awry threw away his gloves and sword and half untied the cloak that hung about his shoulders  that is better your paleness is excellentnay dont spoil it we are to represent the picture which hangs in the hall i need tell you no more now roundheads place yourselves and then ring up the curtain  with a smile coventry obeyed her for the picture was of two lovers the young cavalier kneeling with his arm around the waist of the girl who tries to hide him with her little mantle and presses his head to her bosom in an ecstasy of fear as she glances back at the approaching pursuers jean hesitated an instant and shrank a little as his hand touched her she blushed deeply and her eyes fell before his then as the bell rang she threw herself into her part with sudden spirit one arm half covered him with her cloak the other pillowed his head on the muslin kerchief folded over her bosom and she looked backward with such terror in her eyes that more than one chivalrous young spectator longed to hurry to the rescue it lasted but a moment yet in that moment coventry experienced another new sensation many women had smiled on him but he had remained heartwhole cool and careless quite unconscious of the power which a woman possesses and knows how to use for the weal or woe of man now as he knelt there with a soft arm about him a slender waist yielding to his touch and a maiden heart throbbing against his cheek for the first time in his life he felt the indescribable spell of womanhood and looked the ardent lover to perfection just as his face assumed this new and most becoming aspect the curtain dropped and clamorous encores recalled him to the fact that miss muir was trying to escape from his hold which had grown painful in its unconscious pressure he sprang up half bewildered and looking as he had never looked before  again again called sir john and the young men who played the roundheads eager to share in the applause begged for a repetition in new attitudes  a rustle has betrayed you we have fired and shot the brave girl and she lies dying you know that will be effective try it miss muir said one and with a long breath jean complied  the curtain went up showing the lover still on his knees unmindful of the captors who clutched him by the shoulder for at his feet the girl lay dying her head was on his breast now her eyes looked full into his no longer wild with fear but eloquent with the love which even death could not conquer the power of those tender eyes thrilled coventry with a strange delight and set his heart beating as rapidly as hers had done she felt his hands tremble saw the color flash into his cheek knew that she had touched him at last and when she rose it was with a sense of triumph which she found it hard to conceal others thought it fine acting coventry tried to believe so but lucia set her teeth and as the curtain fell on that second picture she left her place to hurry behind the scenes bent on putting an end to such dangerous play several actors were complimenting the mimic lovers jean took it merrily but coventry in spite of himself betrayed that he was excited by something deeper than mere gratified vanity  as lucia appeared his manner changed to its usual indifference but he could not quench the unwonted fire of his eyes or keep all trace of emotion out of his face and she saw this with a sharp pang  i have come to offer my help you must be tired miss muir can i relieve you said lucia hastily  yes thank you i shall be very glad to leave the rest to you and enjoy them from the front  so with a sweet smile jean tripped away and to lucias dismay coventry followed  i want you gerald please stay she cried  ive done my partno more tragedy for me tonight and he was gone before she could entreat or command  there was no help for it she must stay and do her duty or expose her jealousy to the quick eyes about her for a time she bore it but the sight of her cousin leaning over the chair she had left and chatting with the governess who now filled it grew unbearable and she dispatched a little girl with a message to miss muir  please miss beaufort wants you for queen bess as you are the only lady with red hair will you come whispered the child quite unconscious of any hidden sting in her words  yes dear willingly though im not stately enough for her majesty nor handsome enough said jean rising with an untroubled face though she resented the feminine insult  do you want an essex im all dressed for it said coventry following to the door with a wistful look  no miss beaufort said you were not to come she doesnt want you both together said the child decidedly  jean gave him a significant look shrugged her shoulders and went away smiling her odd smile while coventry paced up and down the hall in a curious state of unrest which made him forgetful of everything till the young people came gaily out to supper  come bonny prince charlie take me down and play the lover as charmingly as you did an hour ago i never thought you had so much warmth in you said bella taking his arm and drawing him on against his will  dont be foolish child where islucia  why he checked jeans name on his lips and substituted anothers he could not tell but a sudden shyness in speaking of her possessed him and though he saw her nowhere he would not ask for her his cousin came down looking lovely in a classical costume but gerald scarcely saw her and when the merriment was at its height he slipped away to discover what had become of miss muir  alone in the deserted drawing room he found her and paused to watch her a moment before he spoke for something in her attitude and face struck him she was leaning wearily back in the great chair which had served for a throne her royal robes were still unchanged though the crown was off and all her fair hair hung about her shoulders excitement and exertion made her brilliant the rich dress became her wonderfully and an air of luxurious indolence changed the meek governess into a charming woman she leaned on the velvet cushions as if she were used to such support she played with the jewels which had crowned her as carelessly as if she were born to wear them her attitude was full of negligent grace and the expression of her face half proud half pensive as if her thoughts were bittersweet  one would know she was wellborn to see her now poor girl what a burden a life of dependence must be to a spirit like hers i wonder what she is thinking of so intently and coventry indulged in another look before he spoke  shall i bring you some supper miss muir  supper she ejaculated with a start who thinks of ones body when ones soul is she stopped there knit her brows and laughed faintly as she added no thank you i want nothing but advice and that i dare not ask of anyone  why not  because i have no right  everyone has a right to ask help especially the weak of the strong can i help you believe me i most heartily offer my poor services  ah you forget this dress the borrowed splendor of these jewels the freedom of this gay evening the romance of the part you played all blind you to the reality for a moment i cease to be a servant and for a moment you treat me as an equal  it was true he had forgotten that soft reproachful glance touched him his distrust melted under the new charm and he answered with real feeling in voice and face i treat you as an equal because you are one and when i offered help it is not to my sisters governess alone but to lady howards daughter  who told you that she demanded sitting erect  my uncle do not reproach him it shall go no further if you forbid it are you sorry that i know it  yes  why  because i will not be pitied and her eyes flashed as she made a halfdefiant gesture  then if i may not pity the hard fate which has befallen an innocent life may i admire the courage which meets adverse fortune so bravely and conquers the world by winning the respect and regard of all who see and honor it  miss muir averted her face put up her hand and answered hastily no no not that do not be kind it destroys the only barrier now left between us be cold to me as before forget what i am and let me go on my way unknown unpitied and unloved  her voice faltered and failed as the last word was uttered and she bent her face upon her hand something jarred upon coventry in this speech and moved him to say almost rudely you need have no fears for me lucia will tell you what an iceberg i am  then lucia would tell me wrong i have the fatal power of reading character i know you better than she does and i see there she stopped abruptly  what tell me and prove your skill he said eagerly  turning she fixed her eyes on him with a penetrating power that made him shrink as she said slowly under the ice i see fire and warn you to beware lest it prove a volcano  for a moment he sat dumb wondering at the insight of the girl for she was the first to discover the hidden warmth of a nature too proud to confess its tender impulses or the ambitions that slept till some potent voice awoke them the blunt almost stern manner in which she warned him away from her only made her more attractive for there was no conceit or arrogance in it only a foreboding fear emboldened by past suffering to be frank suddenly he spoke impetuously  you are right i am not what i seem and my indolent indifference is but the mask under which i conceal my real self i could be as passionate as energetic and aspiring as ned if i had any aim in life i have none and so i am what you once called me a thing to pity and despise  i never said that cried jean indignantly  not in those words perhaps but you looked it and thought it though you phrased it more mildly i deserved it but i shall deserve it no longer i am beginning to wake from my disgraceful idleness and long for some work that shall make a man of me why do you go i annoy you with my confessions pardon me they are the first i ever made they shall be the last  no oh no i am too much honored by your confidence but is it wise is it loyal to tell me your hopes and aims has not miss beaufort the first right to be your confidante  coventry drew back looking intensely annoyed for the name recalled much that he would gladly have forgotten in the novel excitement of the hour lucias love edwards parting words his own reserve so strangely thrown aside so difficult to resume what he would have said was checked by the sight of a halfopen letter which fell from jeans dress as she moved away mechanically he took it up to return it and as he did so he recognized sydneys handwriting jean snatched it from him turning pale to the lips as she cried did you read it what did you see tell me tell me on your honor  on my honor i saw nothing but this single sentence by the love i bear you believe what i say no more as i am a gentleman i know the hand i guess the purport of the letter and as a friend of sydney i earnestly desire to help you if i can is this the matter upon which you want advice  yes  then let me give it  you cannot without knowing all and it is so hard to tell  let me guess it and spare you the pain of telling may i and coventry waited eagerly for her reply for the spell was still upon him  holding the letter fast she beckoned him to follow and glided before him to a secluded little nook half boudoir half conservatory there she paused stood an instant as if in doubt then looked up at him with confiding eyes and said decidedly i will do it for strange as it may seem you are the only person to whom i can speak you know sydney you have discovered that i am an equal you have offered your help i accept it but oh do not think me unwomanly remember how alone i am how young and how much i rely upon your sincerity your sympathy  speak freely i am indeed your friend and coventry sat down beside her forgetful of everything but the softeyed girl who confided in him so entirely  speaking rapidly jean went on you know that sydney loved me that i refused him and went away but you do not know that his importunities nearly drove me wild that he threatened to rob me of my only treasure my good name and that in desperation i tried to kill myself yes mad wicked as it was i did long to end the life which was at best a burden and under his persecution had become a torment you are shocked yet what i say is the living truth lady sydney will confirm it the nurses at the hospital will confess that it was not a fever which brought me there and here though the external wound is healed my heart still aches and burns with the shame and indignation which only a proud woman can feel  she paused and sat with kindling eyes glowing cheeks and both hands pressed to her heaving bosom as if the old insult roused her spirit anew coventry said not a word for surprise anger incredulity and admiration mingled so confusedly in his mind that he forgot to speak and jean went on that wild act of mine convinced him of my indomitable dislike he went away and i believed that this stormy love of his would be cured by absence it is not and i live in daily fear of fresh entreaties renewed persecution his mother promised not to betray where i had gone but he found me out and wrote to me the letter i asked you to take to lady sydney was a reply to his imploring him to leave me in peace you failed to deliver it and i was glad for i thought silence might quench hope all in vain this is a more passionate appeal than ever and he vows he will never desist from his endeavors till i give another man the right to protect me i can do thisi am sorely tempted to do it but i rebel against the cruelty i love my freedom i have no wish to marry at this mans bidding what can i do how cart i free myself be my friend and help me  tears streamed down her cheeks sobs choked her words and she clasped her hands imploringly as she turned toward the young man in all the abandonment of sorrow fear and supplication coventry found it hard to meet those eloquent eyes and answer calmly for he had no experience in such scenes and knew not how to play his part it is this absurd dress and that romantic nonsense which makes me feel so unlike myself he thought quite unconscious of the dangerous power which the dusky room the midsummer warmth and fragrance the memory of the romantic nonsense and most of all the presence of a beautiful afflicted woman had over him his usual selfpossession deserted him and he could only echo the words which had made the strongest impression upon him  you can do this you are tempted to do it is ned the man who can protect you  no was the soft reply  who then  do not ask me a good and honorable man one who loves me well and would devote his life to me one whom once it would have been happiness to marry but now  there her voice ended in a sigh and all her fair hair fell down about her face hiding it in a shining veil  why not now this is a sure and speedy way of ending your distress is it impossible  in spite of himself gerald leaned nearer took one of the little hands in his and pressed it as he spoke urgently compassionately nay almost tenderly from behind the veil came a heavy sigh and the brief answer it is impossible  why jean  she flung her hair back with a sudden gesture drew away her hand and answered almost fiercely because i do not love him why do you torment me with such questions i tell you i am in a sore strait and cannot see my way shall i deceive the good man and secure peace at the price of liberty and truth or shall i defy sydney and lead a life of dread if he menaced my life i should not fear but he menaces that which is dearer than lifemy good name a look a word can tarnish it a scornful smile a significant shrug can do me more harm than any blow for i am a womanfriendless poor and at the mercy of his tongue ah better to have died and so have been saved the bitter pain that has come now  she sprang up clasped her hands over her head and paced despairingly through the little room not weeping but wearing an expression more tragical than tears still feeling as if he had suddenly stepped into a romance yet finding a keen pleasure in the part assigned him coventry threw himself into it with spirit and heartily did his best to console the poor girl who needed help so much going to her he said as impetuously as ned ever did miss muirnay i will say jean if that will comfort youlisten and rest assured that no harm shall touch you if i can ward it off you are needlessly alarmed indignant you may well be but upon my life i think you wrong sydney he is violent i know but he is too honorable a man to injure you by a light word an unjust act he did but threaten hoping to soften you let me see him or write to him he is my friend he will listen to me of that i am sure  be sure of nothing when a man like sydney loves and is thwarted in his love nothing can control his headstrong will promise me you will not see or write to him much as i fear and despise him i will submit rather than any harm should befall youor your brother you promise me mr coventry  he hesitated she clung to his arm with unfeigned solicitude in her eager pleading face and he could not resist it  i promise but in return you must promise to let me give what help i can and jean never say again that you are friendless  you are so kind god bless you for it but i dare not accept your friendship she will not permit it and i have no right to mar her peace  who will not permit it he demanded hotly  miss beaufort  hang miss beaufort exclaimed coventry with such energy that jean broke into a musical laugh despite her trouble he joined in it and for an instant they stood looking at one another as if the last barrier were down and they were friends indeed jean paused suddenly with the smile on her lips the tears still on her cheek and made a warning gesture he listened the sound of feet mingled with calls and laughter proved that they were missed and sought  that laugh betrayed us stay and meet them i cannot and jean darted out upon the lawn coventry followed for the thought of confronting so many eyes so many questions daunted him and he fled like a coward the sound of jeans flying footsteps guided him and he overtook her just as she paused behind a rose thicket to take breath  fainthearted knight you should have stayed and covered my retreat hark they are coming hide hide she panted half in fear half in merriment as the gay pursuers rapidly drew nearer  kneel down the moon is coming out and the glitter of your embroidery will betray you whispered jean as they cowered behind the roses  your arms and hair will betray you come under my plaiddie as the song says and coventry tried to make his velvet cloak cover the white shoulders and fair locks  we are acting our parts in reality now how bella will enjoy the thing when i tell her said jean as the noises died away  do not tell her whispered coventry  and why not she asked looking up into the face so near her own with an artless glance  can you not guess why  ah you are so proud you cannot bear to be laughed at  it is not that it is because i do not want you to be annoyed by silly tongues you have enough to pain you without that i am your friend now and i do my best to prove it  so kind so kind how can i thank you murmured jean and she involuntarily nestled closer under the cloak that sheltered both  neither spoke for a moment and in the silence the rapid beating of two hearts was heard to drown the sound coventry said softly are you frightened  no i like it she answered as softly then added abruptly but why do we hide there is nothing to fear it is late i must go you are kneeling on my train please rise  why in such haste this flight and search only adds to the charm of the evening ill not get up yet will you have a rose jean  no i will not let me go mr coventry i insist there has been enough of this folly you forget yourself  she spoke imperiously flung off the cloak and put him from her he rose at once saying like one waking suddenly from a pleasant dream i do indeed forget myself  here the sound of voices broke on them nearer than before pointing to a covered walk that led to the house he said in his usually cool calm tone go in that way i will cover your retreat and turning he went to meet the merry hunters  half an hour later when the party broke up miss muir joined them in her usual quiet dress looking paler meeker and sadder than usual coventry saw this though he neither looked at her nor addressed her lucia saw it also and was glad that the dangerous girl had fallen back into her proper place again for she had suffered much that night she appropriated her cousins arm as they went through the park but he was in one of his taciturn moods and all her attempts at conversation were in vain miss muir walked alone singing softly to herself as she followed in the dusk was gerald so silent because he listened to that fitful song lucia thought so and felt her dislike rapidly deepening to hatred  when the young friends were gone and the family were exchanging goodnights among themselves jean was surprised by coventrys offering his hand for he had never done it before and whispering as he held it though lucia watched him all the while i have not given my advice yet  thanks i no longer need it i have decided for myself  may i ask how  to brave my enemy  good but what decided you so suddenly  the finding of a friend and with a grateful glance she was gone     chapter vi   on the watch  if you please mr coventry did you get the letter last night were the first words that greeted the young master as he left his room next morning  what letter dean i dont remember any he answered pausing for something in the maids manner struck him as peculiar  it came just as you left for the hall sir benson ran after you with it as it was marked haste didnt you get it sir asked the woman anxiously  yes but upon my life i forgot all about it till this minute its in my other coat i suppose if ive not lost it that absurd masquerading put everything else out of my head and speaking more to himself than to the maid coventry turned back to look for the missing letter  dean remained where she was apparently busy about the arrangement of the curtains at the hall window but furtively watching meanwhile with a most unwonted air of curiosity  not there i thought so she muttered as coventry impatiently thrust his hand into one pocket after another but as she spoke an expression of amazement appeared in her face for suddenly the letter was discovered  id have sworn it wasnt there i dont understand it but shes a deep one or im much deceived and dean shook her head like one perplexed but not convinced  coventry uttered an exclamation of satisfaction on glancing at the address and standing where he was tore open the letter      dear c      im off to baden come and join me then youll be out of harms way     for if you fall in love with jm and you cant escape if you stay     where she is you will incur the trifling inconvenience of having     your brains blown out by      yours truly fr sydney  the man is mad ejaculated coventry staring at the letter while an angry flush rose to his face what the deuce does he mean by writing to me in that style join himnot i and as for the threat i laugh at it poor jean this headstrong fool seems bent on tormenting her well dean what are you waiting for he demanded as if suddenly conscious of her presence  nothing sir i only stopped to see if you found the letter beg pardon sir  and she was moving on when coventry asked with a suspicious look what made you think it was lost you seem to take an uncommon interest in my affairs today  oh dear no sir i felt a bit anxious benson is so forgetful and it was me who sent him after you for i happened to see you go out so i felt responsible being marked that way i thought it might be important so i asked about it  very well you can go dean its all right you see  im not so sure of that muttered the woman as she curtsied respectfully and went away looking as if the letter had not been found  dean was miss beauforts maid a grave middleaged woman with keen eyes and a somewhat grim air having been long in the family she enjoyed all the privileges of a faithful and favorite servant she loved her young mistress with an almost jealous affection she watched over her with the vigilant care of a mother and resented any attempt at interference on the part of others at first she had pitied and liked jean muir then distrusted her and now heartily hated her as the cause of the increased indifference of coventry toward his cousin dean knew the depth of lucias love and though no man in her eyes was worthy of her mistress still having honored him with her regard dean felt bound to like him and the late change in his manner disturbed the maid almost as much as it did the mistress she watched jean narrowly causing that amiable creature much amusement but little annoyance as yet for deans slow english wit was no match for the subtle mind of the governess on the preceding night dean had been sent up to the hall with costumes and had there seen something which much disturbed her she began to speak of it while undressing her mistress but lucia being in an unhappy mood had so sternly ordered her not to gossip that the tale remained untold and she was forced to bide her tune  now ill see how she looks after it though theres not much to be got out of her face the deceitful hussy thought dean marching down the corridor and knitting her black brows as she went  good morning mrs dean i hope you are none the worse for last nights frolic you had the work and we the play said a blithe voice behind her and turning sharply she confronted miss muir fresh and smiling the governess nodded with an air of cordiality which would have been irresistible with anyone but dean  im quite well thank you miss she returned coldly as her keen eye fastened on the girl as if to watch the effect of her words i had a good rest when the young ladies and gentlemen were at supper for while the maids cleared up i sat in the little anteroom  yes i saw you and feared youd take cold very glad you didnt how is miss beaufort she seemed rather poorly last night was the tranquil reply as jean settled the little frills about her delicate wrists the cool question was a return shot for deans hint that she had been where she could oversee the interview between coventry and miss muir  she is a bit tired as any lady would be after such an evening people who are used to playacting wouldnt mind it perhaps but miss beaufort dont enjoy romps as much as some do  the emphasis upon certain words made deans speech as impertinent as she desired but jean only laughed and as coventrys step was heard behind them she ran downstairs saying blandly but with a wicked look i wont stop to thank you now lest mr coventry should bid me goodmorning and so increase miss beauforts indisposition  deans eyes flashed as she looked after the girl with a wrathful face and went her way saying grimly ill bide my time but ill get the better of her yet  fancying himself quite removed from last nights absurdity yet curious to see how jean would meet him coventry lounged into the breakfast room with his usual air of listless indifference a languid nod and murmur was all the reply he vouchsafed to the greetings of cousin sister and governess as he sat down and took up his paper  have you had a letter from ned asked bella looking at the note which her brother still held  no was the brief answer  who then you look as if you had received bad news  there was no reply and peeping over his arm bella caught sight of the seal and exclaimed in a disappointed tone it is the sydney crest i dont care about the note now mens letters to each other are not interesting  miss muir had been quietly feeding one of edwards dogs but at the name she looked up and met coventrys eyes coloring so distressfully that he pitied her why he should take the trouble to cover her confusion he did not stop to ask himself but seeing the curl of lucias lip he suddenly addressed her with an air of displeasure do you know that dean is getting impertinent she presumes too much on her age and your indulgence and forgets her place  what has she done asked lucia coldly  she troubles herself about my affairs and takes it upon herself to keep benson in order  here coventry told about the letter and the womans evident curiosity  poor dean she gets no thanks for reminding you of what you had forgotten next time she will leave your letters to their fate and perhaps it will be as well if they have such a bad effect upon your temper gerald  lucia spoke calmly but there was an angry color in her cheek as she rose and left the room coventry looked much annoyed for on jeans face he detected a faint smile half pitiful half satirical which disturbed him more than his cousins insinuation bella broke the awkward silence by saying with a sigh poor ned i do so long to hear again from him i thought a letter had come for some of us dean said she saw one bearing his writing on the hall table yesterday  she seems to have a mania for inspecting letters i wont allow it who was the letter for bella said coventry putting down his paper  she wouldnt or couldnt tell but looked very cross and told me to ask you  very odd ive had none began coventry  but i had one several days ago will you please read it and my reply and as she spoke jean laid two letters before him  certainly not it would be dishonorable to read what ned intended for no eyes but your own you are too scrupulous in one way and not enough so in another miss muir and coventry offered both the letters with an air of grave decision which could not conceal the interest and surprise he felt  you are right mr edwards note should be kept sacred for in it the poor boy has laid bare his heart to me but mine i beg you will read that you may see how well i try to keep my word to you oblige me in this mr coventry i have a right to ask it of you  so urgently she spoke so wistfully she looked that he could not refuse and going to the window read the letter it was evidently an answer to a passionate appeal from the young lover and was written with consummate skill as he read gerald could not help thinking if this girl writes in this way to a man whom she does not love with what a world of power and passion would she write to one whom she did love and this thought kept returning to him as his eye went over line after line of wise argument gentle reproof good counsel and friendly regard here and there a word a phrase betrayed what she had already confessed and coventry forgot to return the letter as he stood wondering who was the man whom jean loved  the sound of bellas voice recalled him for she was saying half kindly half petulantly dont look so sad jean ned will outlive it i dare say you remember you said once men never died of love though women might in his one note to me he spoke so beautifully of you and begged me to be kind to you for his sake that i try to be with all my heart though if it was anyone but you i really think i should hate them for making my dear boy so unhappy  you are too kind bella and i often think ill go away to relieve you of my presence but unwise and dangerous as it is to stay i havent the courage to go ive been so happy here and as she spoke jeans head dropped lower over the dog as it nestled to her affectionately  before bella could utter half the loving words that sprang to her lips coventry came to them with all languor gone from face and mien and laying jeans letter before her he said with an undertone of deep feeling in his usually emotionless voice a right womanly and eloquent letter but i fear it will only increase the fire it was meant to quench i pity my brother more than ever now  shall i send it asked jean looking straight up at him like one who had entire reliance on his judgment  yes i have not the heart to rob him of such a sweet sermon upon selfsacrifice shall i post it for you  thank you in a moment and with a grateful look jean dropped her eyes producing her little purse she selected a penny folded it in a bit of paper and then offered both letter and coin to coventry with such a pretty air of business that he could not control a laugh  so you wont be indebted to me for a penny what a proud woman you are miss muir  i am its a family failing and she gave him a significant glance which recalled to him the memory of who she was he understood her feeling and liked her the better for it knowing that he would have done the same had he been in her place it was a little thing but if done for effect it answered admirably for it showed a quick insight into his character on her part and betrayed to him the existence of a pride in which he sympathized heartily he stood by jean a moment watching her as she burnt edwards letter in the blaze of the spirit lamp under the urn  why do you do that he asked involuntarily  because it is my duty to forget was all her answer  can you always forget when it becomes a duty  i wish i could i wish i could  she spoke passionately as if the words broke from her against her will and rising hastily she went into the garden as if afraid to stay  poor dear jean is very unhappy about something but i cant discover what it is last night i found her crying over a rose and now she runs away looking as if her heart was broken im glad ive got no lessons  what kind of a rose asked coventry from behind his paper as bella paused  a lovely white one it must have come from the hall we have none like it i wonder if jean was ever going to be married and lost her lover and felt sad because the flower reminded her of bridal roses  coventry made no reply but felt himself change countenance as he recalled the little scene behind the rose hedge where he gave jean the flower which she had refused yet taken presently to bellas surprise he flung down the paper tore sydneys note to atoms and rang for his horse with an energy which amazed her  why gerald what has come over you one would think neds restless spirit had suddenly taken possession of you what are you going to do  im going to work was the unexpected answer as coventry turned toward her with an expression so rarely seen on his fine face  what has waked you up all at once asked bella looking more and more amazed  you did he said drawing her toward him  i when how  do you remember saying once that energy was better than beauty in a man and that no one could respect an idler  i never said anything half so sensible as that jean said something like it once i believe but i forgot are you tired of doing nothing at last gerald  yes i neglected my duty to ned till he got into trouble and now i reproach myself for it its not too late to do other neglected tasks so im going at them with a will dont say anything about it to anyone and dont laugh at me for im in earnest bell  i know you are and i admire and love you for it my dear old boy cried bella enthusiastically as she threw her arms about his neck and kissed him heartily what will you do first she asked as he stood thoughtfully smoothing the bright head that leaned upon his shoulder with that new expression still clear and steady in his face  im going to ride over the whole estate and attend to things as a master should not leave it all to bent of whom ive heard many complaints but have been too idle to inquire about them i shall consult uncle and endeavor to be all that my father was in his time is that a worthy ambition dear  oh gerald let me tell mamma it will make her so happy you are her idol and to hear you say these things to see you look so like dear papa would do more for her spirits than all the doctors in england  wait till i prove what my resolution is worth when i have really done something then ill surprise mamma with a sample of my work  of course youll tell lucia  not on any account it is a little secret between us so keep it till i give you leave to tell it  but jean will see it at once she knows everything that happens she is so quick and wise do you mind her knowing  i dont see that i can help it if she is so wonderfully gifted let her see what she can i dont mind her now im off and with a kiss to his sister a sudden smile on his face coventry sprang upon his horse and rode away at a pace which caused the groom to stare after him in blank amazement  nothing more was seen of him till dinnertime when he came in so exhilarated by his brisk ride and busy morning that he found some difficulty in assuming his customary manner and more than once astonished the family by talking animatedly on various subjects which till now had always seemed utterly uninteresting to him lucia was amazed his mother delighted and bella could hardly control her desire to explain the mystery but jean took it very calmly and regarded him with the air of one who said i understand but you will soon tire of it this nettled him more than he would confess and he exerted himself to silently contradict that prophecy  have you answered mr sydneys letter asked bella when they were all scattered about the drawing room after dinner  no answered her brother who was pacing up and down with restless steps instead of lounging near his beautiful cousin  i ask because i remembered that ned sent a message for him in my last note as he thought you would know sydneys address here it is something about a horse please put it in when you write and bella laid the note on the writing table nearby  ill send it at once and have done with it muttered coventry and seating himself he dashed off a few lines sealed and sent the letter and then resumed his march eyeing the three young ladies with three different expressions as he passed and repassed lucia sat apart feigning to be intent upon a book and her handsome face looked almost stern in its haughty composure for though her heart ached she was too proud to own it bella now lay on the sofa half asleep a rosy little creature as unconsciously pretty as a child miss muir sat in the recess of a deep window in a low lounging chair working at an embroidery frame with a graceful industry pleasant to see of late she had worn colors for bella had been generous in gifts and the pale blue muslin which flowed in soft waves about her was very becoming to her fair skin and golden hair the close braids were gone and loose curls dropped here and there from the heavy coil wound around her wellshaped head the tip of one dainty foot was visible and a petulant little gesture which now and then shook back the falling sleeve gave glimpses of a round white arm neds great hound lay nearby the sunshine flickered on her through the leaves and as she sat smiling to herself while the dexterous hands shaped leaf and flower she made a charming picture of all that is most womanly and winning a picture which few mens eyes would not have liked to rest upon  another chair stood near her and as coventry went up and down a strong desire to take it possessed him he was tired of his thoughts and wished to be amused by watching the changes of the girls expressive face listening to the varying tones of her voice and trying to discover the spell which so strongly attracted him in spite of himself more than once he swerved from his course to gratify his whim but lucias presence always restrained him and with a word to the dog or a glance from the window as pretext for a pause he resumed his walk again something in his cousins face reproached him but her manner of late was so repellent that he felt no desire to resume their former familiarity and wishing to show that he did not consider himself bound he kept aloof it was a quiet test of the power of each woman over this man they instinctively felt it and both tried to conquer lucia spoke several times and tried to speak frankly and affably but her manner was constrained and coventry having answered politely relapsed into silence jean said nothing but silently appealed to eye and ear by the pretty picture she made of herself the snatches of song she softly sang as if forgetting that she was not alone and a shy glance now and then half wistful half merry which was more alluring than graceful figure or sweet voice when she had tormented lucia and tempted coventry long enough she quietly asserted her supremacy in a way which astonished her rival who knew nothing of the secret of her birth which knowledge did much to attract and charm the young man letting a ball of silk escape from her lap she watched it roll toward the promenader who caught and returned it with an alacrity which added grace to the trifling service as she took it she said in the frank way that never failed to win him i think you must be tired but if exercise is necessary employ your energies to some purpose and put your mothers basket of silks in order they are in a tangle and it will please her to know that you did it as your brother used to do  hercules at the distaff said coventry gaily and down he sat in the longdesired seat jean put the basket on his knee and as he surveyed it as if daunted at his task she leaned back and indulged in a musical little peal of laughter charming to hear lucia sat dumb with surprise to see her proud indolent cousin obeying the commands of a governess and looking as if he heartily enjoyed it in ten minutes she was as entirely forgotten as if she had been miles away for jean seemed in her wittiest gayest mood and as she now treated the young master like an equal there was none of the former meek timidity yet often her eyes fell her color changed and the piquant sallies faltered on her tongue as coventry involuntarily looked deep into the fine eyes which had once shone on him so tenderly in that mimic tragedy he could not forget it and though neither alluded to it the memory of the previous evening seemed to haunt both and lend a secret charm to the present moment lucia bore this as long as she could and then left the room with the air of an insulted princess but coventry did not and jean feigned not to see her go bella was fast asleep and before he knew how it came to pass the young man was listening to the story of his companions life a sad tale told with wonderful skill for soon he was absorbed in it the basket slid unobserved from his knee the dog was pushed away and leaning forward he listened eagerly as the girls low voice recounted all the hardships loneliness and grief of her short life in the midst of a touching episode she started stopped and looked straight before her with an intent expression which changed to one of intense contempt and her eye turned to coventrys as she said pointing to the window behind him we are watched  by whom he demanded starting up angrily  hush say nothing let it pass i am used to it  but i am not and ill not submit to it who was it jean he answered hotly  she smiled significantly at a knot of rosecolored ribbon which a little gust was blowing toward them along the terrace a black frown darkened the young mans face as he sprang out of the long window and went rapidly out of sight scrutinizing each green nook as he passed jean laughed quietly as she watched him and said softly to herself with her eyes on the fluttering ribbon that was a fortunate accident and a happy inspiration yes my dear mrs dean you will find that playing the spy will only get your mistress as well as yourself into trouble you would not be warned and you must take the consequences reluctant as i am to injure a worthy creature like yourself  soon coventry was heard returning jean listened with suspended breath to catch his first words for he was not alone  since you insist that it was you and not your mistress i let it pass although i still have my suspicions tell miss beaufort i desire to see her for a few moments in the library now go dean and be careful for the future if you wish to stay in my house  the maid retired and the young man came in looking both ireful and stern  i wish i had said nothing but i was startled and spoke involuntarily now you are angry and i have made fresh trouble for poor miss lucia forgive me as i forgive her and let it pass i have learned to bear this surveillance and pity her causeless jealousy said jean with a selfreproachful air  i will forgive the dishonorable act but i cannot forget it and i intend to put a stop to it i am not betrothed to my cousin as i told you once but you like all the rest seem bent on believing that i am hitherto i have cared too little about the matter to settle it but now i shall prove beyond all doubt that i am free  as he uttered the last word coventry cast on jean a look that affected her strangely she grew pale her work dropped on her lap and her eyes rose to his with an eager questioning expression which slowly changed to one of mingled pain and pity as she turned her face away murmuring in a tone of tender sorrow poor lucia who will comfort her  for a moment coventry stood silent as if weighing some fateful purpose in his mind as jeans rapt sigh of compassion reached his ear he had echoed it within himself and half repented of his resolution then his eye rested on the girl before him looking so lonely in her sweet sympathy for another that his heart yearned toward her sudden fire shot into his eye sudden warmth replaced the cold sternness of his face and his steady voice faltered suddenly as he said very low yet very earnestly jean i have tried to love her but i cannot ought i to deceive her and make myself miserable to please my family  she is beautiful and good and loves you tenderly is there no hope for her asked jean still pale but very quiet though she held one hand against her heart as if to still or hide its rapid beating  none answered coventry  but can you not learn to love her your will is strong and most men would not find it a hard task  i cannot for something stronger than my own will controls me  what is that and jeans dark eyes were fixed upon him full of innocent wonder  his fell and he said hastily i dare not tell you yet  pardon i should not have asked do not consult me in this matter i am not the person to advise you i can only say that it seems to me as if any man with an empty heart would be glad to have so beautiful a woman as your cousin  my heart is not empty began coventry drawing a step nearer and speaking in a passionate voice jean i must speak hear me i cannot love my cousin because i love you  stop and jean sprang up with a commanding gesture i will not hear you while any promise binds you to another remember your mothers wishes lucias hopes edwards last words your own pride my humble lot you forget yourself mr coventry think well before you speak weigh the cost of this act and recollect who i am before you insult me by any transient passion any false vows  i have thought i do weigh the cost and i swear that i desire to woo you as humbly honestly as i would any lady in the land you speak of my pride do i stoop in loving my equal in rank you speak of your lowly lot but poverty is no disgrace and the courage with which you bear it makes it beautiful i should have broken with lucia before i spoke but i could not control myself my mother loves you and will be happy in my happiness edward must forgive me for i have tried to do my best but love is irresistible tell me jean is there any hope for me  he had seized her hand and was speaking impetuously with ardent face and tender tone but no answer came for as jean turned her eloquent countenance toward him full of maiden shame and timid love deans prim figure appeared at the door and her harsh voice broke the momentary silence saying sternly miss beaufort is waiting for you sir  go go at once and be kind for my sake gerald whispered jean far he stood as if deaf and blind to everything but her voice her face  as she drew his head down to whisper her cheek touched his and regardless of dean he kissed it passionately whispering back my little jean for your sake i can be anything  miss beaufort is waiting shall i say you will come sir demanded dean pale and grim with indignation  yes yes ill come wait for me in the garden jean and coventry hurried away in no mood for the interview but anxious to have it over  as the door closed behind him dean walked up to miss muir trembling with anger and laying a heavy hand on her arm she said below her breath ive been expecting this you artful creature i saw your game and did my best to spoil it but you are too quick for me you think youve got him there you are mistaken for as sure as my name is hester dean ill prevent it or sir john shall  take your hand away and treat me with proper respect or you will be dismissed from this house do you know who i am and jean drew herself up with a haughty air which impressed the woman more deeply than her words i am the daughter of lady howard and if i choose it can be the wife of mr coventry  dean drew back amazed yet not convinced being a welltrained servant as well as a prudent woman she feared to overstep the bounds of respect to go too far and get her mistress as well as herself into trouble so though she still doubted jean and hated her more than ever she controlled herself dropping a curtsy she assumed her usual air of deference and said meekly i beg pardon miss if id known i should have conducted myself differently of course but ordinary governesses make so much mischief in a house one cant help mistrusting them i dont wish to meddle or be overbold but being fond of my dear young lady i naturally take her part and must say that mr coventry has not acted like a gentleman  think what you please dean but i advise you to say as little as possible if you wish to remain i have not accepted mr coventry yet and if he chooses to set aside the engagement his family made for him i think he has a right to do so miss beaufort would hardly care to marry him against his will because he pities her for her unhappy love and with a tranquil smile miss muir walked away     chapter vii   the last chance  she will tell sir john will she then i must be before her and hasten events it will be as well to have all sure before there can be any danger my poor dean you are no match for me but you may prove annoying nevertheless  these thoughts passed through miss muirs mind as she went down the hall pausing an instant at the library door for the murmur of voices was heard she caught no word and had only time for an instants pause as deans heavy step followed her turning jean drew a chair before the door and beckoning to the woman she said smiling still sit here and play watchdog i am going to miss bella so you can nod if you will  thank you miss i will wait for my young lady she may need me when this hard time is over and dean seated herself with a resolute face  jean laughed and went on but her eyes gleamed with sudden malice and she glanced over her shoulder with an expression which boded ill for the faithful old servant  ive got a letter from ned and here is a tiny note for you cried bella as jean entered the boudoir mine is a very odd hasty letter with no news in it but his meeting with sydney i hope yours is better or it wont be very satisfactory  as sydneys name passed bellas lips all the color died out of miss muirs face and the note shook with the tremor of her hand her very lips were white but she said calmly thank you as you are busy ill go and read my letter on the lawn and before bella could speak she was gone  hurrying to a quiet nook jean tore open the note and read the few blotted lines it contained  i have seen sydney he has told me all and hard as i found it to believe it was impossible to doubt for he has discovered proofs which cannot be denied i make no reproaches shall demand no confession or atonement for i cannot forget that i once loved you i give you three days to find another home before i return to tell the family who you are go at once i beseech you and spare me the pain of seeing your disgrace  slowly steadily she read it twice over then sat motionless knitting her brows in deep thought presently she drew a long breath tore up the note and rising went slowly toward the hall saying to herself three days only three days can it be accomplished in so short a time it shall be if wit and will can do it for it is my last chance if this fails ill not go back to my old life but end all at once  setting her teeth and clenching her hands as if some memory stung her she went on through the twilight to find sir john waiting to give her a hearty welcome  you look tired my dear never mind the reading tonight rest yourself and let the book go he said kindly observing her worn look  thank you sir i am tired but id rather read else the book will not be finished before i go  go child where are you going demanded sir john looking anxiously at her as she sat down  i will tell you byandby sir and opening the book jean read for a little while  but the usual charm was gone there was no spirit in the voice of the reader no interest in the face of the listener and soon he said abruptly my dear pray stop i cannot listen with a divided mind what troubles you tell your friend and let him comfort you  as if the kind words overcame her jean dropped the book covered up her face and wept so bitterly that sir john was much alarmed for such a demonstration was doubly touching in one who usually was all gaiety and smiles as he tried to soothe her his words grew tender his solicitude full of a more than paternal anxiety and his kind heart overflowed with pity and affection for the weeping girl as she grew calmer he urged her to be frank promising to help and counsel her whatever the affliction or fault might be  ah you are too kind too generous how can i go away and leave my one friend sighed jean wiping the tears away and looking up at him with grateful eyes  then you do care a little for the old man said sir john with an eager look an involuntary pressure of the hand he held  jean turned her face away and answered very low no one ever was so kind to me as you have been can i help caring for you more than i can express  sir john was a little deaf at times but he heard that and looked well pleased he had been rather thoughtful of late had dressed with unusual care been particularly gallant and gay when the young ladies visited him and more than once when jean paused in the reading to ask a question he had been forced to confess that he had not been listening though as she well knew his eyes had been fixed upon her since the discovery of her birth his manner had been peculiarly benignant and many little acts had proved his interest and goodwill now when jean spoke of going a panic seized him and desolation seemed about to fall upon the old hall something in her unusual agitation struck him as peculiar and excited his curiosity never had she seemed so interesting as now when she sat beside him with tearful eyes and some soft trouble in her heart which she dared not confess  tell me everything child and let your friend help you if he can formerly he said father or the old man but lately he always spoke of himself as her friend  i will tell you for i have no one else to turn to i must go away because mr coventry has been weak enough to love me  what gerald cried sir john amazed  yes today he told me this and left me to break with lucia so i ran to you to help me prevent him from disappointing his mothers hopes and plans  sir john had started up and paced down the room but as jean paused he turned toward her saying with an altered face then you do not love him is it possible  no i do not love him she answered promptly  yet he is all that women usually find attractive how is it that you have escaped jean  i love someone else was the scarcely audible reply  sir john resumed his seat with the air of a man bent on getting at a mystery if possible  it will be unjust to let you suffer for the folly of these boys my little girl ned is gone and i was sure that gerald was safe but now that his turn has come i am perplexed for he cannot be sent away  no it is i who must go but it seems so hard to leave this safe and happy home and wander away into the wide cold world again you have all been too kind to me and now separation breaks my heart  a sob ended the speech and jeans head went down upon her hands again sir john looked at her a moment and his fine old face was full of genuine emotion as he said slowly jean will you stay and be a daughter to the solitary old man  no sir was the unexpected answer  and why not asked sir john looking surprised but rather pleased than angry  because i could not be a daughter to you and even if i could it would not be wise for the gossips would say you were not old enough to be the adopted father of a girl like me sir john young as i am i know much of the world and am sure that this kind plan is impractical but i thank you from the bottom of my heart  where will you go jean asked sir john after a pause  to london and try to find another situation where i can do no harm  will it be difficult to find another home  yes i cannot ask mrs coventry to recommend me when i have innocently brought so much trouble into her family and lady sydney is gone so i have no friend  except john coventry i will arrange all that when will you go jean  tomorrow  so soon and the old mans voice betrayed the trouble he was trying to conceal  jean had grown very calm but it was the calmness of desperation she had hoped that the first tears would produce the avowal for which she waited it had not and she began to fear that her last chance was slipping from her did the old man love her if so why did he not speak eager to profit by each moment she was on the alert for any hopeful hint any propitious word look or act and every nerve was strung to the utmost  jean may i ask one question said sir john  anything of me sir  this man whom you lovecan he not help you  he could if he knew but he must not  if he knew what your present trouble  no my love  he does not know this then  no thank heaven and he never will  why not  because i am too proud to own it  he loves you my child  i do not knowi dare not hope it murmured jean  can i not help you here believe me i desire to see you safe and happy is there nothing i can do  nothing nothing  may i know the name  no no let me go i cannot bear this questioning and jeans distressful face warned him to ask no more  forgive me and let me do what i may rest here quietly ill write a letter to a good friend of mine who will find you a home if you leave us  as sir john passed into his inner study jean watched him with despairing eyes and wrung her hands saying to herself has all my skill deserted me when i need it most how can i make him understand yet not overstep the bounds of maiden modesty he is so blind so timid or so dull he will not see and time is going fast what shall i do to open his eyes  her own eyes roved about the room seeking for some aid from inanimate things and soon she found it close behind the couch where she sat hung a fine miniature of sir john at first her eye rested on it as she contrasted its placid comeliness with the unusual pallor and disquiet of the living face seen through the open door as the old man sat at his desk trying to write and casting covert glances at the girlish figure he had left behind him affecting unconsciousness of this jean gazed on as if forgetful of everything but the picture and suddenly as if obeying an irresistible impulse she took it down looked long and fondly at it then shaking her curls about her face as if to hide the act pressed it to her lips and seemed to weep over it in an uncontrollable paroxysm of tender grief a sound startled her and like a guilty thing she turned to replace the picture but it dropped from her hand as she uttered a faint cry and hid her face for sir john stood before her with an expression which she could not mistake  jean why did you do that he asked in an eager agitated voice  no answer as the girl sank lower like one overwhelmed with shame laying his hand on the bent head and bending his own he whispered tell me is the name john coventry  still no answer but a stifled sound betrayed that his words had gone home  jean shall i go back and write the letter or may i stay and tell you that the old man loves you better than a daughter  she did not speak but a little hand stole out from under the falling hair as if to keep him with a broken exclamation he seized it drew her up into his arms and laid his gray head on her fan one too happy for words for a moment jean muir enjoyed her success then fearing lest some sudden mishap should destroy it she hastened to make all secure looking up with wellfeigned timidity and halfconfessed affection she said softly forgive me that i could not hide this better i meant to go away and never tell it but you were so kind it made the parting doubly hard why did you ask such dangerous questions why did you look when you should have been writing my dismissal  how could i dream that you loved me jean when you refused the only offer i dared make could i be presumptuous enough to fancy you would reject young lovers for an old man like me asked sir john caressing her  you are not old to me but everything i love and honor interrupted jean with a touch of genuine remorse as this generous honorable gentleman gave her both heart and home unconscious of deceit it is i who am presumptuous to dare to love one so far above me but i did not know how dear you were to me till i felt that i must go i ought not to accept this happiness i am not worthy of it and you will regret your kindness when the world blames you for giving a home to one so poor and plain and humble as i  hush my darling i care nothing for the idle gossip of the world if you are happy here let tongues wag as they will i shall be too busy enjoying the sunshine of your presence to heed anything that goes on about me but jean you are sure you love me it seems incredible that i should win the heart that has been so cold to younger better men than i  dear sir john be sure of this i love you truly i will do my best to be a good wife to you and prove that in spite of my many faults i possess the virtue of gratitude  if he had known the strait she was in he would have understood the cause of the sudden fervor of her words the intense thankfulness that shone in her face the real humility that made her stoop and kiss the generous hand that gave so much for a few moments she enjoyed and let him enjoy the happy present undisturbed but the anxiety which devoured her the danger which menaced her soon recalled her and forced her to wring yet more from the unsuspicious heart she had conquered  no need of letters now said sir john as they sat side by side with the summer moonlight glorifying all the room you have found a home for life may it prove a happy one  it is not mine yet and i have a strange foreboding that it never will be she answered sadly  why my child  because i have an enemy who will try to destroy my peace to poison your mind against me and to drive me out from my paradise to suffer again all i have suffered this last year  you mean that mad sydney of whom you told me  yes as soon as he hears of this good fortune to poor little jean he will hasten to mar it he is my fate i cannot escape him and wherever he goes my friends desert me for he has the power and uses it for my destruction let me go away and hide before he comes for having shared your confidence it will break my heart to see you distrust and turn from me instead of loving and protecting  my poor child you are superstitious be easy no one can harm you now no one would dare attempt it and as for my deserting you that will soon be out of my power if i have my way  how dear sir john asked jean with a flutter of intense relief at her heart for the way seemed smoothing before her  i will make you my wife at once if i may this will free you from geralds love protect you from sydneys persecution give you a safe home and me the right to cherish and defend with heart and hand shall it be so my child  yes but oh remember that i have no friend but you promise me to be faithful to the lastto believe in me to trust me protect and love me in spite of all misfortunes faults and follies i will be true as steel to you and make your life as happy as it deserves to be let us promise these things now and keep the promises unbroken to the end  her solemn air touched sir john too honorable and upright himself to suspect falsehood in others he saw only the natural impulse of a lovely girl in jeans words and taking the hand she gave him in both of his he promised all she asked and kept that promise to the end she paused an instant with a pale absent expression as if she searched herself then looked up clearly in the confiding face above her and promised what she faithfully performed in afteryears  when shall it be little sweetheart i leave all to you only let it be soon else some gay young lover will appear and take you from me said sir john playfully anxious to chase away the dark expression which had stolen over jeans face  can you keep a secret asked the girl smiling up at him all her charming self again  try me  i will edward is coming home in three days i must be gone before he comes tell no one of this he wishes to surprise them and if you love me tell nobody of your approaching marriage do not betray that you care for me until i am really yours there will be such a stir such remonstrances explanations and reproaches that i shall be worn out and run away from you all to escape the trial if i could have my wish i would go to some quiet place tomorrow and wait till you come for me i know so little of such things i cannot tell how soon we may be married not for some weeks i think  tomorrow if we like a special license permits people to marry when and where they please my plan is better than yours listen and tell me if it can be carried out i will go to town tomorrow get the license invite my friend the reverend paul fairfax to return with me and tomorrow evening you come at your usual time and in the presence of my discreet old servants make me the happiest man in england how does this suit you my little lady coventry  the plan which seemed made to meet her ends the name which was the height of her ambition and the blessed sense of safety which came to her filled jean muir with such intense satisfaction that tears of real feeling stood in her eyes and the glad assent she gave was the truest word that had passed her lips for months  we will go abroad or to scotland for our honeymoon till the storm blows over said sir john well knowing that this hasty marriage would surprise or offend all his relations and feeling as glad as jean to escape the first excitement  to scotland please i long to see my fathers home said jean who dreaded to meet sydney on the continent  they talked a little longer arranging all things sir john so intent on hurrying the event that jean had nothing to do but give a ready assent to all his suggestions one fear alone disturbed her if sir john went to town he might meet edward might hear and believe his statements then all would be lost yet this risk must be incurred if the marriage was to be speedily and safely accomplished and to guard against the meeting was jeans sole care as they went through the parkfor sir john insisted upon taking her homeshe said clinging to his arm  dear friend bear one thing in mind else we shall be much annoyed and all our plans disarranged avoid your nephews you are so frank your face will betray you they both love me are both hottempered and in the first excitement of the discovery might be violent you must incur no danger no disrespect for my sake so shun them both till we are safeparticularly edward he will feel that his brother has wronged him and that you have succeeded where he failed this will irritate him and i fear a stormy scene promise to avoid both for a day or two do not listen to them do not see them do not write to or receive letters from them it is foolish i know but you are all i have and i am haunted by a strange foreboding that i am to lose you  touched and flattered by her tender solicitude sir john promised everything even while he laughed at her fears love blinded the good gentleman to the peculiarity of the request the novelty romance and secrecy of the affair rather bewildered though it charmed him and the knowledge that he had outrivaled three young and ardent lovers gratified his vanity more than he would confess parting from the girl at the garden gate he turned homeward feeling like a boy again and loitered back humming a love lay quite forgetful of evening damps gout and the fiveandfifty years which lay so lightly on his shoulders since jeans arms had rested there she hurried toward the house anxious to escape coventry but he was waiting for her and she was forced to meet him  how could you linger so long and keep me in suspense he said reproachfully as he took her hand and tried to catch a glimpse of her face in the shadow of her hat brim come and rest in the grotto i have so much to say to hear and enjoy  not now i am too tired let me go in and sleep tomorrow we will talk it is damp and chilly and my head aches with all this worry jean spoke wearily yet with a touch of petulance and coventry fancying that she was piqued at his not coming for her hastened to explain with eager tenderness  my poor little jean you do need rest we wear you out among us and you never complain i should have come to bring you home but lucia detained me and when i got away i saw my uncle had forestalled me i shall be jealous of the old gentleman if he is so devoted jean tell me one thing before we part i am free as air now and have a right to speak do you love me am i the happy man who has won your heart i dare to think so to believe that this telltale face of yours has betrayed you and to hope that i have gained what poor ned and wild sydney have lost  before i answer tell me of your interview with lucia i have a right to know said jean  coventry hesitated for pity and remorse were busy at his heart when he recalled poor lucias grief jean was bent on hearing the humiliation of her rival as the young man paused she frowned then lifted up her face wreathed in softest smiles and laying her hand on his arm she said with most effective emphasis half shy half fond upon his name please tell me gerald  he could not resist the look the touch the tone and taking the little hand in his he said rapidly as if the task was distasteful to him i told her that i did not could not love her that i had submitted to my mothers wish and for a time had felt tacitly bound to her though no words had passed between us but now i demanded my liberty regretting that the separation was not mutually desired  and shewhat did she say how did she bear it asked jean feeling in her own womans heart how deeply lucias must have been wounded by that avowal  poor girl it was hard to bear but her pride sustained her to the end she owned that no pledge tied me fully relinquished any claim my past behavior had seemed to have given her and prayed that i might find another woman to love me as truly tenderly as she had done jean i felt like a villain and yet i never plighted my word to her never really loved her and had a perfect right to leave her if i would  did she speak of me  yes  what did she say  must i tell you  yes tell me everything i know she hates me and i forgive her knowing that i should hate any woman whom you loved  are you jealous dear  of you gerald and the fine eyes glanced up at him full of a brilliancy that looked like the light of love  you make a slave of me already how do you do it i never obeyed a woman before jean i think you are a witch scotland is the home of weird uncanny creatures who take lovely shapes for the bedevilment of poor weak souls are you one of those fair deceivers  you are complimentary laughed the girl i am a witch and one day my disguise will drop away and you will see me as i am old ugly bad and lost beware of me in time ive warned you now love me at your peril  coventry had paused as he spoke and eyed her with an unquiet look conscious of some fascination which conquered yet brought no happiness a feverish yet pleasurable excitement possessed him a reckless mood making him eager to obliterate the past by any rash act any new experience which his passion brought jean regarded him with a wistful almost woeful face for one short moment then a strange smile broke over it as she spoke in a tone of malicious mockery under which lurked the bitterness of a sad truth coventry looked half bewildered and his eye went from the girls mysterious face to a dimly lighted window behind whose curtains poor lucia hid her aching heart praying for him the tender prayers that loving women give to those whose sins are all forgiven for loves sake his heart smote him and a momentary feeling of repulsion came over him as he looked at jean she saw it felt angry yet conscious of a sense of relief for now that her own safety was so nearly secured she felt no wish to do mischief but rather a desire to undo what was already done and be at peace with all the world to recall him to his allegiance she sighed and walked on saying gently yet coldly will you tell me what i ask before i answer your question mr coventry  what lucia said of you well it was this beware of miss muir we instinctively distrusted her when we had no cause i believe in instincts and mine have never changed for she has not tried to delude me her art is wonderful i feel yet cannot explain or detect it except in the working of events which her hand seems to guide she has brought sorrow and dissension into this hitherto happy family we are all changed and this girl has done it me she can harm no further you she will ruin if she can beware of her in tune or you win bitterly repent your blind infatuation  and what answer did you make asked jean as the last words came reluctantly from coventrys lips  i told her that i loved you in spite of myself and would make you my wife in the face of all opposition now jean your answer  give me three days to think of it good night and gliding from him she vanished into the house leaving him to roam about half the night tormented with remorse suspense and the old distrust which would return when jean was not there to banish it by her art     chapter viii   suspense  all the next day jean was in a state of the most intense anxiety as every hour brought the crisis nearer and every hour might bring defeat for the subtlest human skill is often thwarted by some unforeseen accident she longed to assure herself that sir john was gone but no servants came or went that day and she could devise no pretext for sending to glean intelligence she dared not go herself lest the unusual act should excite suspicion for she never went till evening even had she determined to venture there was no time for mrs coventry was in one of her nervous states and no one but miss muir could amuse her lucia was ill and miss muir must give orders bella had a studious fit and jean must help her coventry lingered about the house for several hours but jean dared not send him lest some hint of the truth might reach him he had ridden away to his new duties when jean did not appear and the day dragged on wearisomely night came at last and as jean dressed for the late dinner she hardly knew herself when she stood before her mirror excitement lent such color and brilliancy to her countenance remembering the wedding which was to take place that evening she put on a simple white dress and added a cluster of white roses in bosom and hair she often wore flowers but in spite of her desire to look and seem as usual bellas first words as she entered the drawing room were why jean how like a bride you look a veil and gloves would make you quite complete  you forget one other trifle bell said gerald with eyes that brightened as they rested on miss muir  what is that asked his sister  a bridegroom  bella looked to see how jean received this but she seemed quite composed as she smiled one of her sudden smiles and merely said that trifle will doubtless be found when the time comes is miss beaufort too ill for dinner  she begs to be excused and said you would be willing to take her place she thought  as innocent bella delivered this message jean glanced at coventry who evaded her eye and looked ill at ease  a little remorse will do him good and prepare him for repentance after the grand coup she said to herself and was particularly gay at dinnertime though coventry looked often at lucias empty seat as if he missed her as soon as they left the table miss muir sent bella to her mother and knowing that coventry would not linger long at his wine she hurried away to the hall a servant was lounging at the door and of him she asked in a tone which was eager in spite of all efforts to be calm is sir john at home  no miss hes just gone to town  just gone when do you mean cried jean forgetting the relief she felt in hearing of his absence in surprise at his late departure  he went half an hour ago in the last train miss  i thought he was going early this morning he told me he should be back this evening  i believe he did mean to go but was delayed by company the steward came up on business and a load of gentlemen called so sir john could not get off till night when he wasnt fit to go being worn out and far from well  do you think he will be ill did he look so and as jean spoke a thrill of fear passed over her lest death should rob her of her prize  well you know miss hurry of any kind is bad for elderly gentlemen inclined to apoplexy sir john was in a worry all day and not like himself i wanted him to take his man but he wouldnt and drove off looking flushed and excited like im anxious about him for i know something is amiss to hurry him off in this way  when will he be back ralph  tomorrow noon if possible at night certainly he bid me tell anyone that called  did he leave no note or message for miss coventry or someone of the family  no miss nothing  thank you and jean walked back to spend a restless night and rise to meet renewed suspense  the morning seemed endless but noon came at last and under the pretense of seeking coolness in the grotto jean stole away to a slope whence the gate to the hall park was visible for two long hours she watched and no one came she was just turning away when a horseman dashed through the gate and came galloping toward the hall heedless of everything but the uncontrollable longing to gain some tidings she ran to meet him feeling assured that he brought ill news it was a young man from the station and as he caught sight of her he drew bridle looking agitated and undecided  has anything happened she cried breathlessly  a dreadful accident on the railroad just the other side of croydon news telegraphed half an hour ago answered the man wiping his hot face  the noon train was sir john in it quick tell me all  it was that train miss but whether sir john was in it or not we dont know for the guard is killed and everything is in such confusion that nothing can be certain they are at work getting out the dead and wounded we heard that sir john was expected and i came up to tell mr coventry thinking he would wish to go down a train leaves in fifteen minutes where shall i find him i was told he was at the hall  ride on ride on and find him if he is there ill run home and look for him lose no time ride ride and turning jean sped back like a deer while the man tore up the avenue to rouse the hall  coventry was there and went off at once leaving both hall and house in dismay fearing to betray the horrible anxiety that possessed her jean shut herself up in her room and suffered untold agonies as the day wore on and no news came at dark a sudden cry rang through the house and jean rushed down to learn the cause bella was standing in the hall holding a letter while a group of excited servants hovered near her  what is it demanded miss muir pale and steady though her heart died within her as she recognized geralds handwriting bella gave her the note and hushed her sobbing to hear again the heavy tidings that had come      dear bella      uncle is safe he did not go in the noon train but several persons     are sure that ned was there no trace of him as yet but many bodies     are in the river under the ruins of the bridge and i am doing my     best to find the poor lad if he is there i have sent to all his     haunts in town and as he has not been seen i hope it is a false     report and he is safe with his regiment keep this from my mother     till we are sure i write you because lucia is ill miss muir will     comfort and sustain you hope for the best dear      yours gc  those who watched miss muir as she read these words wondered at the strange expressions which passed over her face for the joy which appeared there as sir johns safety was made known did not change to grief or horror at poor edwards possible fate the smile died on her lips but her voice did not falter and in her downcast eyes shone an inexplicable look of something like triumph no wonder for if this was true the danger which menaced her was averted for a time and the marriage might be consummated without such desperate haste this sad and sudden event seemed to her the mysterious fulfilment of a secret wish and though startled she was not daunted but inspirited for fate seemed to favor her designs she did comfort bella control the excited household and keep the rumors from mrs coventry all that dreadful night  at dawn gerald came home exhausted and bringing no tiding of the missing man he had telegraphed to the headquarters of the regiment and received a reply stating that edward had left for london the previous day meaning to go home before returning the fact of his having been at the london station was also established but whether he left by the train or not was still uncertain the ruins were still being searched and the body might yet appear  is sir john coming at noon asked jean as the three sat together in the rosy hush of dawn trying to hope against hope  no he had been ill i learned from young gower who is just from town and so had not completed his business i sent him word to wait till night for the bridge wont be passable till then now i must try and rest an hour ive worked all night and have no strength left call me the instant any messenger arrives  with that coventry went to his room bella followed to wait on him and jean roamed through house and grounds unable to rest the morning was far spent when the messenger arrived jean went to receive his tidings with the wicked hope still lurking at her heart  is he found she asked calmly as the man hesitated to speak  yes maam  you are sure  i am certain maam though some wont say till mr coventry comes to look  is he alive and jeans white lips trembled as she put the question  oh no maam that warnt possible under all them stones and water the poor young gentleman is so wet and crushed and torn no one would know him except for the uniform and the white hand with the ring on it  jean sat down very pale and the man described the finding of the poor shattered body as he finished coventry appeared and with one look of mingled remorse shame and sorrow the elder brother went away to find and bring the younger home jean crept into the garden like a guilty thing trying to hide the satisfaction which struggled with a womans natural pity for so sad an end for this brave young life  why waste tears or feign sorrow when i must be glad she muttered as she paced to and fro along the terrace the poor boy is out of pain and i am out of danger  she got no further for turning as she spoke she stood face to face with edward bearing no mark of peril on dress or person but stalwart and strong as ever he stood there looking at her with contempt and compassion struggling in his face as if turned to stone she remained motionless with dilated eyes arrested breath and paling cheek he did not speak but watched her silently till she put out a trembling hand as if to assure herself by touch that it was really he then he drew back and as if the act convinced as fully as words she said slowly they told me you were dead  and you were glad to believe it no it was my comrade young courtney who unconsciously deceived you all and lost his life as i should have done if i had not gone to ascot after seeing him off yesterday  to ascot echoed jean shrinking back for edwards eye was on her and his voice was stern and cold  yes you know the place i went there to make inquiries concerning you and was well satisfied why are you still here  the three days are not over yet i hold you to your promise before night i shall be gone till then you will be silent if you have honor enough to keep your word  i have edward took out his watch and as he put it back said with cool precision it is now two the train leaves for london at halfpast six a carriage will wait for you at the side door allow me to advise you to go then for the instant dinner is over i shall speak and with a bow he went into the house leaving jean nearly suffocated with a throng of contending emotions  for a few minutes she seemed paralyzed but the native energy of the woman forbade utter despair till the last hope was gone frail as that now was she still clung to it tenaciously resolving to win the game in defiance of everything springing up she went to her room packed her few valuables dressed herself with care and then sat down to wait she heard a joyful stir below saw coventry come hurrying back and from a garrulous maid learned that the body was that of young courtney the uniform being the same as edwards and the ring a gift from him had caused the men to believe the disfigured corpse to be that of the younger coventry no one but the maid came near her once bellas voice called her but some one checked the girl and the call was not repeated at five an envelope was brought her directed in edwards hand and containing a check which more than paid a years salary no word accompanied the gift yet the generosity of it touched her for jean muir had the relics of a once honest nature and despite her falsehood could still admire nobleness and respect virtue a tear of genuine shame dropped on the paper and real gratitude filled her heart as she thought that even if all else failed she was not thrust out penniless into the world which had no pity for poverty  as the clock struck six she heard a carriage drive around and went down to meet it a servant put on her trunk gave the order to the station james and she drove away without meeting anyone speaking to anyone or apparently being seen by anyone a sense of utter weariness came over her and she longed to lie down and forget but the last chance still remained and till that failed she would not give up dismissing the carriage she seated herself to watch for the quarterpastsix train from london for in that sir john would come if he came at all that night she was haunted by the fear that edward had met and told him the first glimpse of sir johns frank face would betray the truth if he knew all there was no hope and she would go her way alone if he knew nothing there was yet time for the marriage and once his wife she knew she was safe because for the honor of his name he would screen and protect her  up rushed the train out stepped sir john and jeans heart died within her grave and pale and worn he looked and leaned heavily on the arm of a portly gentleman in black the reverend mr fairfax why has he come if the secret is out thought jean slowly advancing to meet them and fearing to read her fate in sir johns face he saw her dropped his friends arm and hurried forward with the ardor of a young man exclaiming as he seized her hand with a beaming face a glad voice my little girl did you think i would never come  she could not answer the reaction was too strong but she clung to him regardless of time or place and felt that her last hope had not failed mr fairfax proved himself equal to the occasion asking no questions he hurried sir john and jean into a carriage and stepped in after them with a bland apology jean was soon herself again and having told her fears at his delay listened eagerly while he related the various mishaps which had detained him  have you seen edward was her first question  not yet but i know he has come and have heard of his narrow escape i should have been in that train if i had not been delayed by the indisposition which i then cursed but now bless are you ready jean do you repent your choice my child  no no i am ready i am only too happy to become your wife dear generous sir john cried jean with a glad alacrity which touched the old man to the heart and charmed the reverend mr fairfax who concealed the romance of a boy under his clerical suit  they reached the hall sir john gave orders to admit no one and after a hasty dinner sent for his old housekeeper and his steward told them of his purpose and desired them to witness his marriage obedience had been the law of their lives and master could do nothing wrong in their eyes so they played their parts willingly for jean was a favorite at the hall pale as her gown but calm and steady she stood beside sir john uttering her vows in a clear tone and taking upon herself the vows of a wife with more than a brides usual docility when the ring was fairly on a smile broke over her face when sir john kissed and called her his little wife she shed a tear or two of sincere happiness and when mr fairfax addressed her as my lady she laughed her musical laugh and glanced up at a picture of gerald with eyes full of exultation as the servants left the room a message was brought from mrs coventry begging sir john to come to her at once  you will not go and leave me so soon pleaded jean well knowing why he was sent for  my darling i must and in spite of its tenderness sir johns manner was too decided to be withstood  then i shall go with you cried jean resolving that no earthly power should part them     chapter ix   lady coventry  when the first excitement of edwards return had subsided and before they could question him as to the cause of this unexpected visit he told them that after dinner their curiosity should be gratified and meantime he begged them to leave miss muir alone for she had received bad news and must not be disturbed the family with difficulty restrained their tongues and waited impatiently gerald confessed his love for jean and asked his brothers pardon for betraying his trust he had expected an outbreak but edward only looked at him with pitying eyes and said sadly you too i have no reproaches to make for i know what you will suffer when the truth is known  what do you mean demanded coventry  you will soon know my poor gerald and we will comfort one another  nothing more could be drawn from edward till dinner was over the servants gone and all the family alone together then pale and grave but very selfpossessed for trouble had made a man of him he produced a packet of letters and said addressing himself to his brother jean muir has deceived us all i know her story let me tell it before i read her letters  stop ill not listen to any false tales against her the poor girl has enemies who belie her cried gerald starting up  for the honor of the family you must listen and learn what fools she has made of us i can prove what i say and convince you that she has the art of a devil sit still ten minutes then go if you will  edward spoke with authority and his brother obeyed him with a foreboding heart  i met sydney and he begged me to beware of her nay listen gerald i know she has told her story and that you believe it but her own letters convict her she tried to charm sydney as she did us and nearly succeeded in inducing him to marry her rash and wild as he is he is still a gentleman and when an incautious word of hers roused his suspicions he refused to make her his wife a stormy scene ensued and hoping to intimidate him she feigned to stab herself as if in despair she did wound herself but failed to gain her point and insisted upon going to a hospital to die lady sydney good simple soul believed the girls version of the story thought her son was in the wrong and when he was gone tried to atone for his fault by finding jean muir another home she thought gerald was soon to marry lucia and that i was away so sent her here as a safe and comfortable retreat  but ned are you sure of all this is sydney to be believed began coventry still incredulous  to convince you ill read jeans letters before i say more they were written to an accomplice and were purchased by sydney there was a compact between the two women that each should keep the other informed of all adventures plots and plans and share whatever good fortune fell to the lot of either thus jean wrote freely as you shall judge the letters concern us alone the first was written a few days after she came      dear hortense      another failure sydney was more wily than i thought all was going     well when one day my old fault beset me i took too much wine and     i carelessly owned that i had been an actress he was shocked and     retreated i got up a scene and gave myself a safe little wound to     frighten him the brute was not frightened but coolly left me to my     fate id have died to spite him if i dared but as i didnt i     lived to torment him as yet i have had no chance but i will not     forget him his mother is a poor weak creature whom i could use as     i would and through her i found an excellent place a sick mother     silly daughter and two eligible sons one is engaged to a handsome     iceberg but that only renders him more interesting in my eyes     rivalry adds so much to the charm of ones conquests well my dear     i went got up in the meek style intending to do the pathetic but     before i saw the family i was so angry i could hardly control     myself through the indolence of monsieur the young master no     carriage was sent for me and i intend he shall atone for that     rudeness byandby the younger son the mother and the girl     received me patronizingly and i understood the simple souls at     once monsieur as i shall call him as names are unsafe was     unapproachable and took no pains to conceal his dislike of     governesses the cousin was lovely but detestable with her pride     her coldness and her very visible adoration of monsieur who let     her worship him like an inanimate idol as he is i hated them both     of course and in return for their insolence shall torment her with     jealousy and teach him how to woo a woman by making his heart ache     they are an intensely proud family but i can humble them all i     think by captivating the sons and when they have committed     themselves cast them off and marry the old uncle whose title     takes my fancy  she never wrote that it is impossible a woman could not do it cried lucia indignantly while bella sat bewildered and mrs coventry supported herself with salts and fan coventry went to his brother examined the writing and returned to his seat saying in a tone of suppressed wrath she did write it i posted some of those letters myself go on ned      i made myself useful and agreeable to the amiable ones and     overheard the chat of the lovers it did not suit me so i fainted     away to stop it and excite interest in the provoking pair i     thought i had succeeded but monsieur suspected me and showed me     that he did i forgot my meek role and gave him a stage look it had     a good effect and i shall try it again the man is well worth     winning but i prefer the title and as the uncle is a hale     handsome gentleman i cant wait for him to die though monsieur is     very charming with his elegant languor and his heart so fast     asleep no woman has had power to wake it yet i told my story and     they believed it though i had the audacity to say i was but     nineteen to talk scotch and bashfully confess that sydney wished     to marry me monsieur knows s and evidently suspects something i     must watch him and keep the truth from him if possible      i was very miserable that night when i got alone something in the     atmosphere of this happy home made me wish i was anything but what i     am as i sat there trying to pluck up my spirits i thought of the     days when i was lovely and young good and gay my glass showed me     an old woman of thirty for my false locks were off my paint gone     and my face was without its mask bah how i hate sentiment i drank     your health from your own little flask and went to bed to dream     that i was playing lady tartuffeas i am adieu more soon  no one spoke as edward paused and taking up another letter he read on      my dear creature      all goes well next day i began my task and having caught a hint     of the character of each tried my power over them early in the     morning i ran over to see the hall approved of it highly and took     the first step toward becoming its mistress by piquing the     curiosity and flattering the pride of its master his estate is his     idol i praised it with a few artless compliments to himself and he     was charmed the cadet of the family adores horses i risked my neck     to pet his beast and he was charmed the little girl is romantic     about flowers i made a posy and was sentimental and she was     charmed the fair icicle loves her departed mamma i had raptures     over an old picture and she thawed monsieur is used to being     worshipped i took no notice of him and by the natural perversity     of human nature he began to take notice of me he likes music i     sang and stopped when hed listened long enough to want more he is     lazily fond of being amused i showed him my skill but refused to     exert it in his behalf in short i gave him no peace till he began     to wake up in order to get rid of the boy i fascinated him and he     was sent away poor lad i rather liked him and if the title had     been nearer would have married him  many thanks for the honor and edwards lip curled with intense scorn but gerald sat like a statue his teeth set his eyes fiery his brows bent waiting for the end      the passionate boy nearly killed his brother but i turned the     affair to good account and bewitched monsieur by playing nurse     till vashti the icicle interfered then i enacted injured virtue     and kept out of his way knowing that he would miss me i mystified     him about s by sending a letter where s would not get it and got     up all manner of soft scenes to win this proud creature i get on     well and meanwhile privately fascinate sir j by being daughterly     and devoted he is a worthy old man simple as a child honest as     the day and generous as a prince i shall be a happy woman if i win     him and you shall share my good fortune so wish me success  this is the third and contains something which will surprise you edward said as he lifted another paper      hortense      ive done what i once planned to do on another occasion you know     my handsome dissipated father married a lady of rank for his second     wife i never saw lady hd but once for i was kept out of the     way finding that this good sir j knew something of her when a     girl and being sure that he did not know of the death of her little     daughter i boldly said i was the child and told a pitiful tale of     my early life it worked like a charm he told monsieur and both     felt the most chivalrous compassion for lady howards daughter     though before they had secretly looked down on me and my real     poverty and my lowliness that boy pitied me with an honest warmth     and never waited to learn my birth i dont forget that and shall     repay it if i can wishing to bring monsieurs affair to a     successful crisis i got up a theatrical evening and was in my     element one little event i must tell you because i committed an     actionable offense and was nearly discovered i did not go down to     supper knowing that the moth would return to flutter about the     candle and preferring that the fluttering should be done in     private as vashtis jealousy is getting uncontrollable passing     throught the gentlemens dressing room my quick eye caught sight of     a letter lying among the costumes it was no stage affair and an     odd sensation of fear ran through me as i recognized the hand of s     i had feared this but i believe in chance and having found the     letter i examined it you know i can imitate almost any hand when     i read in this paper the whole story of my affair with s truly     told and also that he had made inquiries into my past life and     discovered the truth i was in a fury to be so near success and     fail was terrible and i resolved to risk everything i opened the     letter by means of a heated knife blade under the seal therefore     the envelope was perfect imitating ss hand i penned a few lines     in his hasty style saying he was at baden so that if monsieur     answered the reply would not reach him for he is in london it     seems this letter i put into the pocket whence the other must have     fallen and was just congratulating myself on this narrow escape     when dean the maid of vashti appeared as if watching me she had     evidently seen the letter in my hand and suspected something i     took no notice of her but must be careful for she is on the watch     after this the evening closed with strictly private theatricals in     which monsieur and myself were the only actors to make sure that he     received my version of the story first i told him a romantic story     of ss persecution and he believed it this i followed up by a     moonlight episode behind a rose hedge and sent the young gentleman     home in a halfdazed condition what fools men are  she is right muttered coventry who had flushed scarlet with shame and anger as his folly became known and lucia listened in astonished silence  only one more and my distasteful task will be nearly over said edward unfolding the last of the papers this is not a letter but a copy of one written three nights ago dean boldly ransacked jean muirs desk while she was at the hall and fearing to betray the deed by keeping the letter she made a hasty copy which she gave me today begging me to save the family from disgrace this makes the chain complete go now if you will gerald i would gladly spare you the pain of hearing this  i will not spare myself i deserve it read on replied coventry guessing what was to follow and nerving himself to hear it reluctantly his brother read these lines      the enemy has surrendered give me joy hortense i can be the     wife of this proud monsieur if i will think what an honor for the     divorced wife of a disreputable actor i laugh at the farce and     enjoy it for i only wait till the prize i desire is fairly mine to     turn and reject this lover who has proved himself false to brother     mistress and his own conscience i resolved to be revenged on both     and i have kept my word for my sake he cast off the beautiful woman     who truly loved him he forgot his promise to his brother and put     by his pride to beg of me the wornout heart that is not worth a     good mans love ah well i am satisfied for vashti has suffered     the sharpest pain a proud woman can endure and will feel another     pang when i tell her that i scorn her recreant lover and give him     back to her to deal with as she will  coventry started from his seat with a fierce exclamation but lucia bowed her face upon her hands weeping as if the pang had been sharper than even jean foresaw  send for sir john i am mortally afraid of this creature take her away do something to her my poor bella what a companion for you send for sir john at once cried mrs coventry incoherently and clasped her daughter in her arms as if jean muir would burst in to annihilate the whole family edward alone was calm  i have already sent and while we wait let me finish this story it is true that jean is the daughter of lady howards husband the pretended clergyman but really a worthless man who married her for her money her own child died but this girl having beauty wit and a bold spirit took her fate into her own hands and became an actress she married an actor led a reckless life for some years quarreled with her husband was divorced and went to paris left the stage and tried to support herself as governess and companion you know how she fared with the sydneys how she has duped us and but for this discovery would have duped sir john i was in time to prevent this thank heaven she is gone no one knows the truth but sydney and ourselves he will be silent for his own sake we will be for ours and leave this dangerous woman to the fate which will surely overtake her  thank you it has overtaken her and a very happy one she finds it  a soft voice uttered the words and an apparition appeared at the door which made all start and recoil with amazementjean muir leaning on the arm of sir john  how dare you return began edward losing the selfcontrol so long preserved how dare you insult us by coming back to enjoy the mischief you have done uncle you do not know that woman  hush boy i will not listen to a word unless you remember where you are said sir john with a commanding gesture  remember your promise love me forgive me protect me and do not listen to their accusations whispered jean whose quick eye had discovered the letters  i will have no fears my child he answered drawing her nearer as he took his accustomed place before the fire always lighted when mrs coventry was down  gerald who had been pacing the room excitedly paused behind lucias chair as if to shield her from insult bella clung to her mother and edward calming himself by a strong effort handed his uncle the letters saying briefly look at those sir and let them speak  i will look at nothing hear nothing believe nothing which can in any way lessen my respect and affection for this young lady she has prepared me for this i know the enemy who is unmanly enough to belie and threaten her i know that you both are unsuccessful lovers and this explains your unjust uncourteous treatment now we all have committed faults and follies i freely forgive jean hers and desire to know nothing of them from your lips if she has innocently offended pardon it for my sake and forget the past  but uncle we have proofs that this woman is not what she seems her own letters convict her read them and do not blindly deceive yourself cried edward indignant at his uncles words  a low laugh startled them all and in an instant they saw the cause of it while sir john spoke jean had taken the letters from the hand which he had put behind him a favorite gesture of his and unobserved had dropped them on the fire the mocking laugh the sudden blaze showed what had been done both young men sprang forward but it was too late the proofs were ashes and jean muirs bold bright eyes defied them as she said with a disdainful little gesture hands off gentlemen you may degrade yourselves to the work of detectives but i am not a prisoner yet poor jean muir you might harm but lady coventry is beyond your reach  lady coventry echoed the dismayed family in varying tones of incredulity indignation and amazement  aye my dear and honored wife said sir john with a protecting arm about the slender figure at his side and in the act the words there was a tender dignity that touched the listeners with pity and respect for the deceived man receive her as such and for my sake forbear all further accusation he continued steadily i know what i have done i have no fear that i shall repent it if i am blind let me remain so till time opens my eyes we are going away for a little while and when we return let the old life return again unchanged except that jean makes sunshine for me as well as for you  no one spoke for no one knew what to say jean broke the silence saying coolly may i ask how those letters came into your possession  in tracing out your past life sydney found your friend hortense she was poor money bribed her and your letters were given up to him as soon as received traitors are always betrayed in the end replied edward sternly  jean shrugged her shoulders and shot a glance at gerald saying with her significant smile remember that monsieur and allow me to hope that in wedding you will be happier than in wooing receive my congratulations miss beaufort and let me beg of you to follow my example if you would keep your lovers  here all the sarcasm passed from her voice the defiance from her eye and the one unspoiled attribute which still lingered in this womans artful nature shone in her face as she turned toward edward and bella at their mothers side  you have been kind to me she said with grateful warmth i thank you for it and will repay it if i can to you i will acknowledge that i am not worthy to be this good mans wife and to you i will solemnly promise to devote my life to his happiness for his sake forgive me and let there be peace between us  there was no reply but edwards indignant eyes fell before hers bella half put out her hand and mrs coventry sobbed as if some regret mingled with her resentment jean seemed to expect no friendly demonstration and to understand that they forbore for sir johns sake not for hers and to accept their contempt as her just punishment  come home love and forget all this said her husband ringing the bell and eager to be gone lady coventrys carriage  and as he gave the order a smile broke over her face for the sound assured her that the game was won pausing an instant on the threshold before she vanished from their sight she looked backward and fixing on gerald the strange glance he remembered well she said in her penetrating voice is not the last scene better than the first
