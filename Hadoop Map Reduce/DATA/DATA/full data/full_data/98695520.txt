98695520	sunk at sea by rm ballantyne   this story starts with the childhood of one of ballantynes perpetual heroes will osten  will would love to have a career at sea but his father a very successful businessman thinks otherwise so eventually will agrees to study medicine  however before his studies are over he decides that he really must go to sea and he joins a friend of his captain dall on his ship  they travel to the pacific where they encounter some very heavy weather as a result of which a plank is started in the ships hull and she starts to sink  all attempts to find and stop the leak fail and she does indeed sink with the crew taking to the boats  eventually they reach a small coral island but they have not been there long before a visiting native warcanoe perceives them and takes them to another much larger island where preparations are made to kill and eat them  luckily there is an old white man there who has long been accepted by the natives and who gets our heroes and his friends off this rather dire treatment but was too late for some of the crew  a visiting sandalwood trader who does not wish to pay for the cargo he has taken on board fires on the natives causing our heroes to flee for their lives  a hunt is set up for them  luckily a missionary ship comes in a few days later and manages to restore peace  our heroes return to the village  a mission is set up and a small church complete with a spire is built  another vessel calls for water and would have opened fire just for spite but they see the spire and restrain themselves  our heroes persuade the captain to take them on board  will has fallen in love with the missionarys daughter but nevertheless joins the party leaving for the ship the rover  for the sequel see lost in the forest   sunk at sea by rm ballantyne    chapter one  treats of our heros early life and touches on domestic matters  william osten was a wanderer by nature  he was born with a thirst for adventure that nothing could quench and with a desire to rove that nothing could subdue  even in babyhood when his limbs were fat and feeble and his visage was round and red he displayed his tendency to wander in ways and under circumstances that other babies never dreamt of  he kept his poor mother in a chronic fever of alarm and all but broke the heart of his nurse long before he could walk by making his escape from the nursery over and over again on his hands and knees which latter bore constant marks of being compelled to do the duty of feet in dirty places  baby will never cried  to have heard him yell would have rejoiced the hearts of mother and nurse for that would have assured them of his being near at hand and out of mischiefat least not engaged in more than ordinary mischief  but baby will was a natural philosopher from his birth  he displayed his wisdom by holding his peace at all times except when very hard pressed by hunger or pain and appeared to regard life in general in a grave earnest inquiring spirit  nevertheless we would not have it understood that will was a slow phlegmatic baby  by no means  his silence was deep his gravity profound and his earnestness intense so that as a rule his existence was unobtrusive but his energy was tremendous  what he undertook to do he usually did with all his might and mainwhether it was the rending of his pinafore or the smashing of his drum  we have said that he seldom or never cried but he sometimes laughed and that not unfrequently and when he did so you could not choose but hear for his whole soul gushed out in his laugh which was rich racy and riotous  he usually lay down and rolled when he laughed being quite incapable of standing to do itat least during the early period of babyhood  but will would not laugh at everything  you could not make him laugh by cooing and smirking and talking nonsense and otherwise making an ass of yourself before him  maryann the nurse had long tried that in vain and had almost broken her heart about it  she was always breaking her heart more or less about her charge yet strange to say she survived that dreadful operation and ultimately lived to an extreme old age  only think she was wont to say to jemima scrubbins her bosom friend the monthly nurse who had attended wills mother and whose body was so stiff thin and angular that some of her most intimate friends thought and said she must have been born in her skeleton aloneonly think jemimar i give it as my morial opinion that that hinfant asnt larfed onceno not oncedurin the last three days although ive chirruped an smiled an made the most smudgin faces to it an heaped all sorts o blandishments upon it till  oh you cant imagine but nothinks of any use trying of wen you cant do it as my usband as was in the muttonpie line said to the doctor the night afore he diedmy art is quite broken about it so it is  to which jemima was wont to reply with much earnestnessfor she was a sympathetic soul though stiff thin and angularyou dont say so maryhann  praps its pains  whereupon maryann would deny that pains had anything to do with it and jemima would opine that it was koorious to say the least of it  no as we have said baby will would not laugh at everything  he required to see something really worth laughing at before he would give way and when he did give way his eyes invariably disappeared for his face was too fat to admit of eyes and mouth being open at the same time this was fortunate for it prevented him for a little from seeing the object that tickled his fancy and so gave him time to breathe and recruit for another burst  had it been otherwise he would certainly have suffocated himself in infancy and this his veracious biography would have remained unwritten  to creep about the house into dangerous and forbidden places at the risk of life and limb was our heros chief delight in early childhood to fall out of his cradle and crib to tumble down stairs and to bruise his little body until it was black and blue were among his most ordinary experiences  such mishaps never drew tears however from his large blue eyes  after struggling violently to get over the rail of his crib and falling heavily on the floor he was wont to rise with a gasp and gaze in bewilderment straight before him as if he were rediscovering the law of gravitation  no phrenologist ever conceived half the number of bumps that were developed on his luckless cranium  we make no apology to the reader for entering thus minutely into the character and experiences of a baby  that baby is the hero of our tale true it is as a young man that he is to play his part but a great philosopher has told us that he always felt constrained to look upon children with respect and a proverb states that the child is the father of the man  without either pinning our faith to the philosopher or the proverb we think it both appropriate and interesting to note the budding genius of the wanderer whose footsteps we are about to follow  baby wills mother was a gentle and loving but weak woman  his father william horace osten by name was a large hearty affectionate but coarse man  he appreciated his wifes gentle loving nature but could not understand her weakness  she admired her husbands manly energetic spirit but could not understand his roughness  he loved the baby and resolved to make a man of him  she loved the baby and wished to make him a good boy  in the furtherance of their designs the one tried to make him a lion the other sought to convert him into a lamb  which of the two would have succeeded can never be known  it is probable that both would have failed by counteracting each other as is no uncommon experience when fathers and mothers act separately in such a matter  if the one had succeeded he would have made him a bear  the other if successful would have made him a nincompoop  fortunately for our hero a higher power saved him and by training him in the school of adversity made him both a lion and a lamb  the training was very severe and prolonged however  it was long before the lion would consent to lie down in the same breast with the lamb  certainly it was not during the season of childhood the lion appeared to have it all his own way during that interesting epoch and the father was proportionately gratified while the mother was dismayed  boyhood came and with it an increased desire to rove and a more fervent thirst for adventure  at school our hero obtained the name that stuck to him through lifewandering will  the seaport town in the west of england in which he dwelt had been explored by him in all its ramifications  there was not a retired court a dark lane or a blind alley with which he was unfamiliar  every height crag cliff plantation and moor within ten miles of his fathers mansion had been thoroughly explored by will before he was eight years of age and his aspiring spirit longed to take a wider flight  i want to go to sea father said he one evening after tea looking in his fathers face with much more of the leonine gaze than the father had bargained for  his training up to that point had been almost too successful  this was not the first time that the boy had stated the same wish his gaze therefore did not quail when his father looked up from his newspaper and said sternlyfiddlesticks boy hold your tongue  father repeated will in a tone that caused mr osten to lay down his paper i want to go to sea  then the sooner you give up the idea the better for i wont let you  father continued will you remember the proverb that youve often told me has been your motto through life never venture never win  certainly you know that i have often urged you to act on that principle at school  why do you ask the question  because i mean to act on it now and go to sea replied will firmly  what without permission without clothes and without money for you shant have a sixpence from me  yes replied will  mr osten was one of those stern despotic men who cannot bear to be thwarted  he was a rich merchant and almost the king of the little town in which he dwelt  his greatest ambition was to make his only son a thorough man of business  to be spoken to in such a tone by that rebellious son was too much for him  he lost his temper leaped up and seizing will by the collar thrust him out of the room  the boy ran to his own bedroom and seating himself in front of the dressingtable hit that piece of furniture with his clenched fist so violently that all its contents leaped up and rattled  dear dear will said a gentle voice at his side while a loving hand fell on his shoulder why do you frown so fiercely  how can i help it mother when he treats me like that  he is harsh and unfair to me  not so unfair as you think dear will said his mother  we will not detail the arguments by which the good lady sought to combat her sons desires  suffice it to say that she succeededas only mothers know howin lulling the lion to sleep at that time and in awakening the lamb  wandering will went back to school with a good grace and gave up all idea of going to sea    chapter two  records a sudden departure and maryanns opinion thereon  there is a fallacy into which men and women of mature years are apt to fallnamely that the cares and sorrows of the young are light  how many fathers and mothers there are who reason thusoh the child will grow out of this folly  tis a mere whima youthful fancy not worthy of respectforgetting or shutting their eyes to the fact that light though the whim or fancy may be in their eyes it has positive weight to those who cherish it and the thwarting of it is as destructive of peace and joy to the young as the heavier disappointments of life are to themselves  true the cares and sorrows of the young are light in the sense that they are not usually permanent  time generally blows them away while the cares of later years often remain with us to the end  but they are not the less real heavy and momentous at the time on that account  those troubles cannot with propriety be called light which drive so many young men and women to rebellion and to destruction  well would it have been for mr osten if he had treated his son like a rational being instead of calling him a young fool and commanding him to obey  will however was not an untractable young lion  he went through school and entered college despite his unconquerable desire to go to sea in obedience to his fathers wishes  then he resolved to study medicine  mr osten regarded the time thus spent as lost inasmuch as his son might have been better employed in learning the business to which he was destined still he had no great objection to his son taking the degree of md so he offered no opposition but when will at the age of eighteen spoke to him of his intention to take a run to the north or south seas as surgeon in a whaler he broke out on him  so it seems that your ridiculous old fancy still sticks to you said mr osten in great wrath for the recurrence of the subject was like the lacerating of an old sore  yes father it has never left me  if you will listen for a few moments to my reasons  no boy interrupted his father i will not listen to your reasons i have heard them often enoughtoo oftenand they are foolish false utterly inconclusive  you may go to jericho as far as i am concerned but if you do go you shall never darken my doors again  when i was a boy father said will earnestly your speaking sharply to me was natural for i was foolish and acted on impulse  i am thankful now that i did not give way to rebellion as i was tempted to do but i am not now a boy father  if you will talk calmly with me  calmly interrupted mr osten growing still more angry at the quiet demeanour of his son do you mean to insinuate thatthat  what do you mean sir  i insinuate nothing father i mean that i wish you to hear me patiently  i wont hear you cried mr osten rising from his chair ive heard you till im tired of it  go if you choose if you dare  you know the result  saying this he left the room hastily shutting the door behind him with a bang  a grave stern expression settled on the youths countenance as he arose and followed him into the passage  meeting his mother there he seized her suddenly in his arms and held her in a long embrace then without explaining the cause of his strong emotion he ran down stairs and left his fathers house  in a dirty narrow street near the harbour of the town there stood a small publichouse which was frequented chiefly by the sailors who chanced to be in the port and by the squalid population in its immediate neighbourhood  although small the red lion inn was superior in many respects to its surroundings  it was larger than the decayed buildings that propped it cleaner than the locality that owned it brighter and warmer than the homes of the lean crew on whom it fattened it was a pretty light cheery snug place of temptation where men and women and even children assembled at nights to waste their hardearned cash and ruin their health  it was a place where the devil reigned and where the work of murdering souls was carried on continually nevertheless it was a jolly place  many good songs were sung there as well as bad ones and many a rough grasp of hearty friendship was exchanged  few people going into the house for a few minutes could have brought themselves to believe that it was such a very broad part of the road leading to destruction but the landlord had some hazy notion on that point  he sat there day and night and saw the destruction going on  he saw the bleareyed fuddled men that came to drown conscience in his stalls and the slatternly women who came and went  nevertheless he was a rosy jocund fellow who appeared to have a good deal of the milk of human kindness about him and would have looked on you with great surprise if not scorn had you told him that he had a hand in murdering souls  yes the red lion might have been appropriately styled the roaring lion for it drove a roaring trade among the poor in that dirty little street near the harbour  the gas was flaring with attractive brilliancy in the red lion when will osten entered it and asked if captain dall was within  no sir answered the landlord he wont be here for halfanhour yet  a pot of beer said will entering one of the stalls and sitting down opposite a tall darkcountenanced man who sat smoking moodily in a corner  it was evident that our hero had not gone there to drink for the beer remained untouched at his elbow as he sat with his face buried in his hands  the dark man in the corner eyed him steadily through the smoke which issued from his lips but will paid no attention to him  he was too deeply absorbed in his own reflections  a fine night stranger he said at length in a slightly nasal tone  still will remained absorbed and it was not until the remark had been twice repeated that he looked up with a start  i beg pardon did you speak he said  well yes drawled the dark man puffing a long white cloud from his lips i did make an observation regardin the weather  it looks fine dont it  it does said will  youre waitin for captain dall aint you  why how did you come to know that said will  i didnt come to know it i guessed it said the dark man  at that moment the door opened and a short thickset man in a glazed hat and peajacket with huge whiskers meeting under his chin entered  his eye at once fell upon the dark man whom he saluted familiarlyall ready mr cupples  all ready sir replied the other its now more than halfflood in three hours we can drop down the river with the first of the ebb and if this breeze holds well be in blue water before noon tomorrow  hallo doctor is that yourself said the captain whose eye had for some moments rested on will  it is said the youth extending his hand which the other grasped and shook warmly  what changed your mindeh  yes im going with you  the governor bein agreeable inquired the captain  will shook his head  hope there aint bin a flareup said the captain earnestly  not exactly said will but he is displeased and will not give his consent so i have come away without it  at this the jovial skipper who was styled captain by courtesy sat down and shook his head gravely while he removed his hat and wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead  its a bad business to run agin the wishes of ones parents he said it seldom turns out well couldnt you come round him nohow  impossible  he wont listen to reason  ah then its of no manner of use said the captain with a pitying sigh when a man wont listen to reason whats the consequence why hes unreasonable which means bein destitoot of that which raises him above the brutes that perish  such bein the case give it up for a bad job thats my advice  come ill have a bottle o gingerbeer not bein given to strong drink an well talk over this matter  accordingly the beer was ordered and the three sat there talking for a couple of hours in reference to a long long voyage to the southern seas  after that they rose and leaving the red lion went down to the pier where a boat was in waiting  it conveyed them to a large ship whose sails were hanging in the loose condition peculiar to a vessel ready to set sail  an hour after that the anchor was raised and wind and tide carried the ship gently down to the sea  there seemed to will something very solemn and mysterious in the quiet way in which during these still and dark hours of the night the great ship was slowly moved towards her ocean cradle  at length she floated on the sea and soon after the moon arose on the distant horizon streaming across the rippling surface as if to kiss and welcome an old friend  the wind increased the ship became submissive to the breeze obedient to the helm and ere long moved on the waters like a thing of life leaving old england far behind her  it was then that young osten leaning over the taffrail and looking wistfully back at the point where he had seen the last glimpse of the chalk cliffs began to experience the first feelings of regret  he tried to quiet his conscience by recalling the harsh and unjustifiable conduct of his father but conscience would not be quieted thus and faithful memory reminded him of the many acts of kindness he had experienced at his fathers hands while she pointed to his gentle mother and bade him reflect what a tremendous blow this sudden departure would be to her  starting up and shaking off such thoughts sternly he went below and threw himself into his narrow cot where conscience assailed him still more powerfully and vividly in dreams  thus did wandering will leave his native land  commenting on his sudden departure two days afterwards maryann said in strict confidence to her bosom friend jemimar that she knowd it would appenor somethink simular for even wen a hinfant he had refused to larf at her most smudgin blandishments and that she knew somethink strange would come of it though she would willingly have given her last shilling to have prevented it but nothink was of any use tryin of wen one couldnt do it as her usband as was in the muttonpie line said to the doctor the night afore he diedand that her art was quite broken about it so it was  whereupon jemima finished to the dregs her last cup of tea and burst into a flood of tears    chapter three  tells of the sea and some of the mysteries connected therewith  for many days and nights the good ship foam sailed the wide ocean without encountering anything more than the ordinary vicissitudes and experiences of sealife  dolphins were seen and captured sharks were fished for and caught stiff breezes and calms succeeded each other constellations in the far north began to disappear and new constellations arose in the southern skies  in fact during many weeks the voyage was prosperous and young will osten began to experience those peculiar feelings with which all travellers are more or less acquaintedhe felt that the ship was home that his cabin with its furniture which had appeared so small and confined at first was quite a large and roomy place that all the things about him were positive realities and that the home of his childhood was a shadow of the past a sort of dream  during all this time the young doctor led a busy life  he was one of those active intelligent inquiring spirits which cannot rest  to acquire information was with him not a duty but a pleasure  before he had been many days at sea he knew the name and use of every rope sail block tackle and spar in the ship and made himself quite a favourite with the men by the earnestness with which he questioned them in regard to nautical matters and their own personal experiences  george goff the sailmaker said he was a fustrate feller and larry ohale the cook declared he was a trump intirely an ought to have been born an irishman  moreover the affections of long mr cupples as the first mate was styled by the men were quite won by the way in which he laboured to understand the use of the sextant and other matters connected with the mysteries of navigation and stout jonathan dall the captain was overjoyed when he discovered that he was a good player on the violin of which instrument he was passionately fond  in short will osten became a general favourite on board the foam and the regard of all from the cabinboy to the captain deepened into respect when they found that although only an advanced student and not quite a doctor he treated their few ailments with success and acted his part with much selfpossession gentleness and precision  larry ohale was particularly eloquent in his praises of him ever after the drawing of a tooth which had been the source of much annoyance to the worthy cook  why messmates he was wont to say it bait everything the way he tuk it out  open yer mouth says he an sure i opened it an before i cud wink off wint my headso i thoughtbut faix it wor only my tutha real grinder wi three fangs no lessoch hes a cliver lad intirely  but will did not confine his inquiries to the objects contained within his wooden home  the various phases and phenomena of the weather the aspects of the sky and the wonders of the deep claimed his earnest attention  to know the reason of everything was with him a species of mania and in pursuit of this knowledge he stuck at nothing  never venture never win became with him as favourite a motto as it had been with his father and he acted on it more vigorously than his father had ever done  one calm evening as he was leaning over the side of the ship near the bow gazing contemplatively down into the unfathomable sea he overheard a conversation between the cook and one of the sailors named muggins they were smoking their pipes seated on the heel of the bowsprit  larry said muggins i think we have got into the doldrums  yere out there boy said larry for i heerd the capting say we wos past em a long way  the men relapsed into silence for a time  then muggins removed his pipe and said  wot ever caused the doldrums  thats more nor i can tell said larry all i know about them is that its aisy to git into them but uncommon hard to git out again  if my ould grandmother was here shed be able to tell us i make no doubt but shes in erin poor thing mong the pigs and the taties  wot could she tell about the doldrums said muggins with a look of contempt  more nor ye think boy sure there isnt nothin in the univarse but she can spaik about just like a book an though she niver was in the doldrums as far as i knows shes been in the dumps often enough maybe its cousins they are  anyhow shes not here an so we must be contint with spekilation  whats that you say larry inquired the captain who walked towards the bow at the moment  the cook explained his difficulty  why theres no mystery about the doldrums said captain dall  ive read a book by an officer in the united states navy which explains it all and the gulf stream and the currents an everything  come ill spin you a yarn about it  saying this the captain filled and lighted his pipe and seating himself on the shank of the anchor said  you know the cause of ocean currents i dare say  niver a taste said larry  its meself is as innocent about em as the babe unborn an as for muggins there he dont know more about em than my ould shoes  or your old grandmother growled muggins  dont be irriverent ye spalpeen said larry  i ax her reverences pardon but i didnt know she wos a priest said mugginsgo on capn dall  well continued the captain you know at all events that theres salt in the sea and i may tell you that there is lime also besides other things  at the equator the heat bein great water is evaporated faster than anywhere else so that there the sea is salter and has more lime in it than elsewhere  besides that it is hotter  of course that being the case its weight is different from the waters of the cold polar seas so it is bound to move away an get itself freshened and cooled  in like manner the cold water round the poles feels obliged to flow to the equator to get itself salted and warmed  this state of things as a natural consequence causes commotion in the sea  the commotion is moreover increased by the millions of shellfish that dwell there  these creatures not satisfied with their natural skins must needs have shells on their backs and they extract lime from the seawater for the purpose of makin these shells  this process is called secretin the lime coral insects do the same and as many of the islands of the south seas are made by coral insects you may guess that a considerable lot of lime is made away with  the commotion or disturbance thus created produces two great currentsfrom the equator to the poles and from the poles to the equator  but there are many little odds and ends about the world that affect and modify these currents such as depth and local heat and cold and rivers and icebergs but the chief modifiers are continents  the currents flowin north from the indian ocean and southern seas rush up between africa and america  the space bein narrowcomparativelythey form one strong current on doublin the cape of good hope which flies right across to the gulf of mexico  here it is turned aside and flows in a noreasterly direction across the atlantic towards england and norway under the name of the gulf stream but the gulf of mexico has no more to do with it than the man in the moon xcept in the way of turnin it out of its natral course  this gulf stream is a river of warm water flowing through the cold waters of the atlantic it keeps separate and wherever it flows the climate is softened  it embraces ireland and makes the climate there so mild that there is as you know scarcely any frost all the year round  blissins on it broke in larry sure that accounts for the purty green face of erin which bates all other lands in the world  good luck to the gulf stream say i  youre right larry and england scotland and norway have reason to bless it too for the same latitudes with these places in america have a rigorous winter extendin over more than half the year  but what i was comin to was thisthere are as you know eddies and stagnant places in ornary rivers where sticks leaves and other odds and ends collect and remain fixed  so in this great ocean river there are eddies where seaweed collects and stagnates and where the air above also stagnates for the air currents are very much like those of the sea  these eddies or stagnant parts are called sargasso seas  there are several of them of various sizes all over the ocean but there is one big one in the atlantic which is known by the name of the doldrums  it has bothered navigators in all ages  columbus got into it on his way to america and hundreds of ships have been becalmed for weeks in it since the days of that great discoverer  it is not very long since it was found out that by keeping well out of their way and sailing round em navigators could escape the doldrums altogether  the captain paused at this point and larry ohale took the opportunity to break in  dye know sir said he that same gulf strame has rose a lot o pecooliar spekilations in my mind which if i may make so bowld ill  here the mates voice interrupted him gruffly with  shake out a reef in that topgalln sl look alive lads  larry and his comrades sprang to obey  when they returned to their former place in the bow the captain had left it so that the cooks pecooliar spekilations were not at that time made known    chapter four  a storm and its consequences  in course of time the foam proceeding prosperously on her voyage reached the region of cape hornthe cape of storms  here in days of old magellan and the early voyagers were fiercely buffeted by winds and waves  in later days cook and others met with the same reception  in fact the cape is infamous for its inhospitality nevertheless it shone with bright smiles when the foam passed by and a gentle fairwind wafted her into the great pacific ocean  never since that eventful day when the adventurous castilian vasco nunez de balboa discovered this mighty sea did the pacific look more peaceful than it did during the first week in which the foam floated on its calm breast  but the calm was deceitful  it resembled the quiet of the tiger while crouching to make a fatal spring  will osten reclined against the top of the mainmast to which he had ascended in order to enjoy undisturbed the quiet of a magnificent evening  the sun was setting in a world of clouds which took the form of mountains fringed with glittering gold and with shadows of pearly grey  oh what castles young osten did build on these mountains to be sure structures so magnificent that eastern architects had they seen them would have hung their heads and confessed themselves outdone  but you must not imagine reader that the magnificence of all of these depended on their magnitude or richness  on the contrary one of them was a mere cottagebut then it was a pattern cottage  it stood in a palmwood on a coral island near the seashore with a stream trickling at its side and a lake full of wild fowl behind and the most gorgeous tropical plants clustering round its open windows and door while inside seated on a couch was a beautiful girl of fifteen whom will had often imagined but had not yet seen whose auburn hair shone like gold in the sun contrasting well with her lovely complexion and enhancing the sweetness of a smile which conveyed to the beholder only one idealove  many other castles were built in the clouds at that time by will but the cottage made the most lasting impression on his mind  sleepin inquired cupples the mate thrusting his head through that orifice in the maintop which is technically called the lubbers hole  no meditating answered will ive been thinking of the coral islands  humph ejaculated the mate contemptuously for cupples although a kindhearted man was somewhat cynical and had not a particle of sentiment in his soul  indeed he showed so little of this that larry was wont to say he didnt belave he had a sowl at all but was only a koorious specimen of an animated body  its my opinion doctor that youd as well come down for its goin to blow hard  will looked in the direction in which the mate pointed and saw a bank of black clouds rising on the horizon  at the same moment the captains voice was heard below shoutingstand by there to reef topsails  this was followed by the command to closereef  then as the squall drew rapidly nearer a hurried order was giving to take in all sail  the squall was evidently a worse one than had at first been expected  on it came hissing and curling up the sea before it  mind your helmport a little port  port it is sir answered the man at the wheel in the deep quiet voice of a welldisciplined sailor whose only concern is to do his duty  steady cried the captain  the words had barely left his lips and the men who had been furling the sails had just gained the deck when the squall struck them and the foam was laid on her beamends hurling all her crew into the scuppers  at the same time terrible darkness overspread the sky like a pall  when the men regained their footing some of them stood bewildered not knowing what to do others whose presence of mind never deserted them sprang to where the axes were kept in order to be ready to cut away the masts if necessary  but the order was not given  captain dall and will who had been standing near the binnacle seized and clung to the wheel  she will right herself said the former as he observed that the masts rose a little out of the sea  fortunately the good ship did so and then although there was scarcely a rag of canvas upon her she sprang away before the hurricane like a seagull  terrible indeed is the situation of those who are compelled to scud under bare poles when he who formed the great deep puts forth his mighty power causing them to stagger and be at their wits end  for hours the foam rushed wildly over the sea now rising like a cork on the crest of the billows anon sinking like lead into the valleys between  she was exposed to double danger that of being cast upon one of the numerous coral reefs with which the pacific in some parts abounds or being pooped and overwhelmed by the seas which followed her  during this anxious period little was said or done except in reference to the working of the ship  men snatched sleep and food at intervals as they best might  at length after two days the gale began to abate and the sea to go down  it was sharp while it lasted captain but it seems to have done us little harm said will osten on the evening of the second day  true said the captain heartily well soon repair damages and make all snugis there much water in the hold mr cupples  the mate answered gloomily that there was a good deal  it must not be supposed that mr cupples gloominess arose from anxiety not at all  it was simply his nature to be gloomy  if it had been his duty to have proclaimed the approach of his own marriage he would have done it as sadly as if it had been the announcement of his death  his thoughts were gloomy and his tones were appropriate thereto  even his jokes were grave and his countenance was lugubrious  it is gaining on us sir added mr cupples  then get all the spare hands to work with buckets immediately said the captain and send the carpenter here we must have the leak discovered  yes sir sighed mr cupples as if he had given way to despair nevertheless he went off actively to obey the order  a strange man that said the captain turning to will he is a capital seaman and a kindhearted honest fellow yet he is melancholy enough to throw a man into the blues  he and i get on famously notwithstanding said will with a laugh see he is running aftwith bad news i fear for his face is longer if possible than  leaks increasing sir said the mate hurriedly we must have started a plank  this seemed to be too true  all hands were now plying pumps and buckets vigorously and every effort was being made to discover the leak but in vain  hour by hour inch by inch the water gained on them and it soon became apparent that the ship must sink  it is difficult for those who have never been at sea to realise the feelings of men who are thus suddenly awakened to the awful fact that the vessel which has been their home for many weeks or months can no longer be counted on and that in a few hours they shall be left in open boats far from land at the mercy of the wide and stormy sea  so terrible was the thought to those on board the foam that every man from the captain to the cabinboy toiled for hours at the pumps in silent desperation  at last when it was found that the water gained on them rapidly and that there was no hope of saving the ship the captain quietly left off working and put on his coat  avast pumping my lads said he in a grave earnest tone the good ship is doomed and now it behoves us to bow to the will of the lord and do the best we can to save our lives  stand by to hoist out the boats  get up bread and water steward and stow in them as much as you can with safety  mr cupples see my orders carried out and have the provisions properly divided among the boats  i want you doctor to come below and help me to get up a few things that will be of use to us  the prompt energy of the captain infused confidence into the men who soon executed the orders given them  ere long the boats were ready to be launched over the side but this was a matter of the greatest difficulty and danger for the sea was still running high and the ship rolled heavily  and now the great evil of not being provided with proper tackling to launch the boats became apparent  one of the quarterboats was the first to be lowered it was full of men  the order was given to lower and it dropped on the water all right  then the order to unhook the tackle was given  the man at the stern tackle succeeded in unhooking but the man at the bow failed  the result was fatal and instantaneous when the ship rose on the next wave the boat was lifted by the bow out of the water until she hung from the davits and a terrible cry was uttered as all the men were thrown out of her into the sea  next moment the boat was plunged into the waves the tackle snapt and she was swept away  lower away the longboat shouted the captain  this was eagerly and quickly done and the mate with a number of men leaped into it  the lowering was successfully accomplished but when they pulled to the spot where the quarterboat had gone down not one of those who had manned her could be found  all had perished  the remaining four boats were lowered in safety and all of them pulled away from the sinking ship for latterly she had been settling down so deep that it was feared every pitch would be her last and had she sunk while the boats were alongside their destruction would have been inevitable  they were rowed therefore to a safe distance and there awaited the end  there was something inexpressibly sad in this  it seemed like standing at the deathbed of an old friend  the sea was still heaving violently the gale although moderated was still pretty stiff and the sun was setting in wild lurid clouds when the foam rose for the last time every spar and rope standing out sharply against the sky  then she bent forward slowly as she overtopped a huge billow  into the hollow she rushed  like an expert diver she went down head foremost into the deep and next moment those who had so lately trod her deck saw nothing around them save the lowering sky and the angry waters of the pacific ocean    chapter five  adrift on the wide ocean  for some time after the disappearance of the ship the men in the boats continued to gaze in a species of unbelief at the place where she had gone down  they evidently felt it difficult to realise the truth of what they had seen  the suddenness of the change and the extreme danger of their position might have shaken the stoutest hearts for the sea still ran high and none of the boats were fitted to live in rough weather  they were as far as could be judged many hundreds of miles from land and to add to the horror of their circumstances night was coming on  my lads said captain dall sitting down in the stern of his boat and grasping the tiller it has pleased the almighty to sink our ship and to spare our lives  let us be thankful that we didnt go to the bottom along with her  to the best of my knowledge were a long way from land and all of us will have to take in a reef in our appetites for some time to come  i have taken care to have a good supply of salt junk biscuit water and limejuice put aboard so that if the weather dont turn out uncommon bad we may manage with gods blessing to make the land  in circumstances of this kind mens endurance is sometimes tried pretty sharply and men in distress are occasionally driven to forgetting their duty to their comrades  i tell you beforehand lads that i will do all that in me lies to steer you to the nearest port and to make your lot as comfortable as may be in an open boat but if any of you should take a fancy to having his own way ive brought with me a little leaden pillbox here the captain drew aside the breast of his coat and exposed the handle of a revolver which will tend to keep up discipline and prevent discord  now lads ship your oars and hoist the foresail closereefed and look alive for it seems to me that well have a squally night  the effect of this speech was very striking  there is nothing that men dislike so much in critical circumstances where action is necessary as uncertainty or want of decision on the part of their leader  the loss of their ship and their forlorn almost desperate condition had sunk their spirits so much that an air of apathetic recklessness had for a few minutes crossed the countenances of some of the boldest among the sailors but while the captain was speaking this expression passed away and when he had finished they all gave one hearty cheer and obeyed his orders with alacrity  in a few minutes the sails closely reefed were hoisted and the longboat rushed swiftly over the waves  at first the four boats kept companythe other three having also made sailbut as darkness set in they lost sight of each other  the first mate had charge of the jollyboat and the second mate and carpenter had the two others  in the captains boat were will osten larry ohale goff muggins and several of the best seamen  soon after the sails were set a heavy sea broke inboard and nearly filled the boat  bail her out lads shouted the captain  there was no occasion for the order the men knew their danger well enough and every one seized anything that came to hand and began to bail for life  there was only one bucket on board and this was appropriated by the cook who being one of the strongest men in the boat thought himself entitled to the post of honour and truly the way in which larry handled that bucket and showered the water over the side justified his opinion of himself  we must rig up something to prevent that happening again said captain dall set to work goff and cut a slice out of the tarpaulin and nail it over the bows  this was done without delay and in less than an hour a sort of halfdeck was made which turned off the spray and rendered the task of bailing much lightera matter of considerable importance for in such a sea there was no possibility of an open boat remaining afloat without constant bailing  at first the men talked a good deal in comparatively cheerful tones while they worked and the irrepressible larry ohale even ventured to cut one or two jokes but when night began to cover the deep with thick darkness one after another dropped out of the conversation and at last all were perfectly silent except when it became necessary to give an order or answer a question and nothing was heard save the whistling of the wind and the gurgling of the waves as they rushed past their white crests curling over the edge of the boat as if greedy to swallow her and gleaming like lambent fire all around  this is a terrible situation said will osten in a low tone with an involuntary shudder  do you think there is much chance of our surviving captain  thats not an easy question to answer doctor replied captain dall in a tone so hearty that our hero was much cheered by it  you see there is much in our favour as well as much against us  in the first place this is the pacific and according to its name we have a right to expect more fine weather than bad especially at this time of the year then we have the trade winds to help us and our boat is a good one with at least two weeks provisions aboard  but then on the other hand were a terrible long way off land and we must count upon a gale now and then which an open boat however good is not calclated to weather easily  see that now added the captain looking back over the stern where from out of the darkness osten could just see a huge wave like a black mountain with a snowy top rolling towards them  if we were only a little more down in the stern that fellow would drop on board of us and send us to the bottom in half a minute  will felt that although the captains tones were reassuring his words were startling  he was ill at ease and clutched the seat when the billow rolled under them raising the stern of the boat so high that it seemed as if about to be thrown completely over but the wave passed on and they fell back into the trough of the sea  musha but that was a wathery mountain no less exclaimed larry  youve heard of captain bligh larry i suppose said the captain in a loud voice with the intention of letting the men hear his remarks  may be i have replied larry with caution but if so i misremimber  he was the captain of the bounty whose crew mutinied and turned him adrift in an open boat in the middle of the pacific  what i was goin to tell ye was that his circumstances were a trifle worse than ours for he was full four thousand miles from the nearest land and with short allowance of provisions on board  an did he make out the voyage sur asked larry  he did and did it nobly too in the face of great trouble and danger but its too long a yarn to spin just now some day when the weathers fine ill spin it to ee  he weathered some heavy gales too and what one man has done another man may do so weve no reason to get downhearted for were nearer land than he was and better off in every way  i wish i could say as much for the other boats  the captains voice dropped a little in spite of himself as he concluded for despite the strength and buoyancy of his spirit he could not help feeling deep anxiety as to the fate of his companions in misfortune  thus talking at intervals in hopeful tones and relapsing into long periods of silence they spent that stormy night without refreshment and without rest  the minutes seemed to float on leaden wings and the weary watchers experienced in its highest degree that dreary feelingso common in the sick roomthat morning would never come  but morning came at lengtha faint glimmer on the eastern horizon  it was hailed by larry with a deep sigh and the earnest exclamation  ah then theres the blessed sun at last good luck to it  gradually the glimmer increased into grey dawn then a warm tint brightened up the sky and golden clouds appeared  at last the glorious sun arose in all its splendour sending rays of warmth to the exhausted frames of the seamen and hope to their hearts  they much needed both for want of sleep anxiety and cold had already stamped a haggard look of suffering on their faces  as the morning advanced however this passed away and by degrees they began to cheer up and bestir themselvesspreading out their clothes to dry and scanning the horizon at intervals in search of the other boats  about eight oclock as nearly as he could guess the captain said  now lads lets have breakfast get out the breadcan  come larry look alive  youve no cooking to do this morning but i doubt not that your teeth are as sharp and your twist as strong as ever  stronger than iver sur av ye plaze  im sorry to hear it for youll have to go on short allowance i fear  ochone groaned the cook  never mind larry said will osten assisting to spread the seabiscuit and salt junk on one of the thwarts theres a good time coming  sure sos christmas doctor but its a long way off said larry  fetch me the scales now then doctor hold em said the captain carefully weighing out a portion of biscuit and meat which he handed to one of the men  this process was continued until all had been supplied after which a small quantity of water and limejuice was also measured out to each  the breakfast was meagre but it was much needed and as the sea had gone down during the night and the morning was beautiful it was eaten not only in comfort but with some degree of cheerfulness  while they were thus engaged goff looked up and exclaimed suddenly hallo look here boys  every one started up and gazed in the direction indicated where they saw something black floating on the water  the captain who had taken the precaution before leaving the ship to sling his telescope over his shoulder applied it to his eye and in a few seconds exclaimed its the jollyboat capsized  out with the oars boysbe smart  theres some of em clinging to the keel  it need scarcely be said that the men seized the oars and plied them with all their might  under the influence of these and the sail together they soon drew near and then it was distinctly seen that three men were clinging to the boatit followed of course that all the rest must have been drowned  silently and swiftly they pulled alongside and in a few minutes had rescued mr cupples and the steward and one of the sailors all of whom were so much exhausted that they could not speak for some time after being taken on board  when they could tell what had happened their tale was brief and sad  they had kept in sight of the longboat while light enabled them to do so  after that they had run before the gale until a heavy sea capsized them from which time they could remember nothing except that they had managed to get on the bottom of the upturned boat to which they had clung for many hours in a state of partial insensibility    chapter six  describes a boat voyage and touches on coral islands  the gale moderated to a fresh breeze and all that day the longboat of the illfated foam flew over the sea towards the west  you see said captain dall in answer to a question put to him by will osten i dont know exactly whereabouts we are because there was a longish spell of dirty weather afore the foam went down and i hadnt got a sight o the sun for more than a week but its my belief that we are nearer to some of the coral islands than to the coast of south america though how near i cannot tell  five hundred miles more or less perhaps  a mere trifle sure said larry filling his pipe carefullyfor his was the only pipe that had been rescued from the sinking ship and the supply of tobacco was very small  small as it was however the captain had taken the precaution to collect it all together causing every man to empty his pockets of every inch that he possessed and doled it out in small equal quantities  the pipe however could not be treated thus so it had to be passed roundeach man possessing it in turn for a stated number of minutes when if he had not consumed his portion he was obliged to empty the pipe and give it up  its my turn larry cried muggins holding out his hand for the coveted implement of fumigation  no ye spalpeen its not said larry continuing to press down the precious weed owld bob had it last an ivery wan knows that i come after him  its the first time i ever heard ye admit that you comed after anybody answered muggins with a grin ye ginerally go before us all at least ye want to  not at all retorted the cook whin theres dirty work to be done i most usually kape modestly in the background an lets you go first bekase its your natral callin  arrah the suns goin to set boys he added with a sigh as he commenced to smoke  this was true and the knowledge that another long night of darkness was about to set in depressed the spirits which had begun to revive a little  silence gradually ensued as they sat watching the waves or gazing wistfully towards the gorgeous mass of clouds in which the sun was setting  for a considerable time they sat thus when suddenly will osten started up and pointing towards the horizon a little to the left of the sun exclaimed  look there captain whats that  land ho shouted larry ohale at that moment springing up on the thwart and holding on to the foremast  all the rest leaped up in great excitement  its only a cloud said one  its a fogbank cried another  i never seed a fogbank with an edge like that observed old bob an ive sailed the salt sea long enough to know  land it is thank god said the captain earnestly shutting up his telescope  get out the oars again lads  we cant make it before dark but the sooner we get there the better for landing on these coral islands isnt always an easy job  the oars were got out at once and the men pulled with a will but it was late at night before they drew near to the land and heard the roar of the surf on the coral reef that stood as a sentinel to guard the island  captain said will osten the wind has almost died away yet it seems to me that the surf roars as violently as if a storm were raging  that surf never goes down in those seas doctor  even in calm weather the swell of the big ocean gathers into a huge billow and bursts in foam upon the coral islands  surely then said will it must make landing both difficult and dangerous  it is sometimes but not always replied the captain for a channel of safety has been provided as you shall see before long  take the boathook goff and look out in the bows  the man rose and stood up with the boathook ready to fend off if necessary  a word or two here about the coral islandsthose wonderful productions of the coral insectmay perhaps render the position of the boat and her subsequent proceedings more intelligible  they are of all sizes and shapes  some are small and low like emeralds just rising out of the ocean with a few cocoanut palms waving their tufted heads above the sandy soil  others are many miles in extent covered with large forest trees and rich vegetation  some are inhabited others are the abode only of seafowl  in many of them the natives are naked savages of the most depraved character  in a few where the blessed gospel of jesus christ has been planted the natives are to be seen clothed and in their right minds  wherever the gospel has taken root commerce has naturally sprung up and the evils that invariably follow in her train have in too many cases been attributed to christianity  poor indeed must be that mans knowledge of the influence of christianity who would judge of its quality or value by the fruit of its professors  by their fruits ye shall know them trulythem but not christianity  the world is an hospital and life the period of convalescence  christianity is the one grand and allsufficient medicine  shall we the afflicted and jaundiced patients still suffering from the virulence and effect of sin condemn the medicine because it does not turn us out cured in a single day still even to fruits we can appeal mingled and confounded with crabapples though they be  come sceptic make a trial of it  go to the fiji islands get yourself wrecked among them  be cast into the stormy deep buffet the waves manfully and succeed in struggling exhausted to the shore  the savages there if not christianised will haul you out of the sea roast you and eat you  they do this in compliance with a humane little law which maintains that all who are shipwrecked and cast on shore are thus to be disposed of  ha you need not smile  the record of this fact may be read in unquestionable authorities in every public library in the kingdom  search and see  on the other hand go and get cast on one of the fiji group where christianity holds sway and there despite the errors inconsistencies and sins of its professors and enemies the same natives will haul you out of the sea receive you into their houses feed and clothe you and send you on your way rejoicing  there is one peculiarity which applies to most of the coral islands each is partially surrounded by a coral reef which lies at a distance from the shore varying from less than one to two miles  outside of this reef the sea may heave tumultuously but the lagoon within remains calm the great breakers may thunder on the reef and even send their spray over for it is little above the level of the sea and nowhere much more than a few yards in breadth but inside all is peaceful and motionless in this reef there are several openings by which a ship of the largest size may enter and find a safe commodious harbour  it is found that these openings occur usually opposite to any part of the islands where a stream flows into the sea and the openings have frequently a little herbage sometimes a few cocoanut palms growing on either side which form a good natural landmark to the navigator  towards one of these openings the longboat of the foam was rowed with all speed  the night was dark but there was light sufficient to enable them to see their way  as they drew near they came within the influence of the enormous breakers which rose like long gigantic snakes and rolled in the form of perpendicular walls to the reef where they fell with a thunderous roar in a flood of milky foam  here it was necessary to exercise the utmost caution in steering for if the boat had turned broadside on to one of these monstrous waves it would have been rolled over and over like a cask  pull gently lads said the captain as they began to get within the influence of the breakers  i dont quite see my way yet  when i give the word pull with a will till i tell ye to hold on  your lives depend on it  this caution was necessary for when a boat is fairly within the grasp of what we may term a shoregoing wave the only chance of safety lies in going quite as fast as it if not faster  presently the captain gave the word the men bent to their oars and away they rushed on the crest of a billow which launched them through the opening in the reef in the midst of a turmoil of seething foam  next moment they were rowing quietly over the calm lagoon and approaching what appeared to be a lowlying island covered with cocoanut trees but the light rendered it difficult to distinguish objects clearly  a few minutes later the boats keel grated on the sand and the whole party leaped on shore  the first impulse of some of the men was to cheer but the feelings of others were too deep for expression in this way  thanks be to god murmured captain dall as he landed  amen said will osten earnestly  some of the men shook hands and congratulated each other on their escape from what all had expected would prove to be a terrible death  as for larry ohale he fell on his knees and with characteristic enthusiasm kissed the ground  my best blissins on ye said he with emotion  och whither ye be a coral island or a granite wan no matter good luck to the insict that made ye is the prayer of larry ohale    chapter seven  hopes fears and prospects on the coral island  few conditions of life are more difficult to bear than that which is described in the proverb hope deferred maketh the heart sick  day after day week after week passed by and every morning the unfortunate men who had been cast on the coral island rose with revived hope to spend the day in anxiety and to lie down in disappointment  the island proved to be a low one not more than four miles in length by about half a mile in breadth on which nothing grew except a few cocoanut palms  these afforded the wrecked crew a scanty supply of food which with the provisions they had brought enabled them to live but the prospect of a residence on such a spot was so hopeless that they would have left it immediately had not an accident happened which deprived them of their boat  a few mornings after landing several of the men rose early and without obtaining the captains permission went to fish in the lagoon intending to surprise their comrades by bringing a supply of fresh fish they were unsuccessful but supposing that their chance would be better in the open sea they rowed through the opening in the reef they had however miscalculated the size and power of the breakers that continually thundered there  the boat was heavy and unmanageable except by a strong crew  she turned broadside to the breakers and in a few seconds was hurled upon the reef and dashed to pieces  the men were saved almost by a miracle  they succeeded in landing on the reef and afterwards with the aid of broken pieces of the wreck swam across the lagoon to the island  the loss was irreparable so that they had now no hope left except in the passing of a ship or a native canoe  this latter contingency they were led to hope for by the discovery one very clear morning of what appeared to be the mountain tops of a cluster of islands barely visible on the horizon  but as day after day passed without the appearance of a canoe they came to the conclusion that these islands were not inhabited  as weeks passed by and no sail appeared their hearts began to fail them for the small stock of provisions was rapidly diminishing  one morning captain dall ascended to the highest point on the island where he was wont to spend the greater part of each day on the lookout he found will osten there before him  goodmorning doctor said the captain with a dash of the old hearty spirit in his voice for he was not easily depressed anything in sight  nothing replied will with a degree of energy in his tone that caused the captain to look at him in surprise  hallo doctor have you made a discovery or have you made up your mind to swim off the island that you speak and look so resolute this morning  yes i have made a discovery  i have discovered that the provisions will not last us another week that our vigour is not what it used to be that a sort of apathy is stealing over us all that the sands of life in short are running out while we are sitting idle here making no effort to help ourselves  what can we do lad said the captain sadly supposing that the youth was merely giving vent to a spirit of desperation  ill tell you what we can do said will rising we can cut down most of the trees and make a huge pile of them which with the broken pieces of the longboat to kindle them will create a blaze that will attract the attention of the people who live on yonder islandif there be any i know the character of south sea islanders but it is better to live in captivity or die by the hand of savages than to perish of hunger and thirst  come captain dall we must stir the men up to make a last effort  rather than die here i will make a raft and hoist a sail on it and commit myself to the winds and waves  what say you  shall we try  there is something in what you say doctor replied the captain pondering the subject at all events no harm can come of making the attempt  ill go speak to the men  in pursuance of this intention he left the place of outlook accompanied by will and the result of their consultation with the men was that in a few minutes larry ohale and mr cupples set to work with all the energy in their natures to fell trees with the two axes they possessed when they were exhausted will osten and goff relieved them and then the captain and old bob took the axes  thus the work went on all day and in the evening a pile of logs was raised almost as large as a mediumsized cottage  there was something hopeful in the mere act of working with a view to deliverance that raised the spirits of the men and when the sun began to sink towards the western horizon they sat down to their slight meal of biscuit and cocoanut milk with more appetite and relish than they had experienced for many days  ive bin thinkin said larry pausing in the midst of his supper  well wot have ee bin thinkin lad said muggins wiping his mouth with the sleeve of his coat and wishing for more foodbut wishing in vain for he had finished his allowanceyoure a good deal given to thinkin but theres not much ever comes on it xcept wind in the shape o words  and whats words retorted the cook in supreme contempt but the expression o sintiment widout which there wouldnt have bin nuthin wotsomediver in the univarse  sintiment is the mother of all things as owld father odowd used to say to my grandmother whin he wanted to come the blarney over her  it was a philosopher sintimentilisin over a taykittle im towld as caused the diskivery o the steamingine it was a sintimintal love o country as indooced saint patrick to banish the varmin from ireland an it was religious sintiment as made noah for to build the ark but for which nother you nor me would have bin born to git cast upon a coral island  sintiment is iverything muggins and of that same there isnt more in your whole body than i cud shove into the small end of a baccypipe  but to return to the pint ive bin thinkin as to whether it would be best to set a light to this here little pile in the daylight or in the dark bekase in the wan case its the smoke that would call attintion an in the other case its the flame  that is true larry said the captain im inclined to think it would be better seen at night fire being more powerful than smoke  but theyre more likely to be asleep at night and to miss seein it observed cupples in a hollow tone  it may be remarked in passing that the mates voice had become much more sepulchral and his aspect more cadaverous since his arrival on the island  true for ye chimed in larry an who knows if they did see it but they might take it for the moon in a fogor for a volkainy  wouldnt the best way to settle the matter be to kindle the fire just now before it grows dark suggested will osten so that they will have a chance of seeing the smoke and then when it grows dark the fire will be getting brighter  right doctor youre right  come well put the light to it at once cried the captain rising  hand me the matchbox mr cupples its in the head o the bread cask  the whole party rose and went to the pile of timber which was on the highest part of the islet and towered to a height of nearly twelve feet captain dall applied a match to the tarry pieces of the longboat which had been placed at the foundation and the flames at once leaped up and began to lick greedily round the timber winding through the interstices and withering up the leaves  soon a thick smoke began to ascend for much of the timber in the pile was green and before the sun had set a dense black cloud was rising straight up like a pillar and spreading out into the sky  as the fire gathered strength a great tongue of flame flashed up ever and anon into the midst of the rolling cloud and rent it for a single instant by degrees those tongues waged fierce war with the smoke  they shot through it more and more frequently licked and twined round itin and outuntil they gained the mastery at last and rose with a magnificent roar into the heavens then it was that larry ohale gave vent to his excitement and admiration in an irrepressible shout and his comrades burst into a mingled cheer and fit of laughter as they moved actively round the blazing mass and stirred it into fiercer heat with boathooks and oars  when night had closed in the brilliancy of the bonfire was intense and the hopes of the party rose with the flames for they felt certain that any human beings who chanced to be within fifty miles of them could not fail to see the signal of distress  so the greater part of the night was passed in wild excitement and energetic action  at last exhausted yet hopeful they left the bonfire to burn itself out and sat down to watch  during the first halfhour they gazed earnestly over the sea and so powerfully had their hopes been raised that they expected to see a ship or a boat approaching every minute  but ere long their hopes sank as quickly as they had been raised  they ceased to move about and talk of the prospect of speedy deliverance  the hearts of men who have been long exposed to the depressing influence of hope deferred and whose frames are somewhat weakened by suffering and insufficient food are easily chilled  one after another they silently crept under the sail which had been spread out in the form of a tent to shelter them and with a sigh lay down to rest  weariness and exposure soon closed their eyes in kind natures sweet restorerbalmy sleep and the coral island vanished utterly from their minds as they dreamed of home and friends and other days  so starving men dream of sumptuous fare and captives dream of freedom  will osten was last to give way to the feeling of disappointment and last to lie down under the folds of the rude tent  he was young and strong and sanguine  it was hard for one in whose veins the hot blood careered so vigorously to believe in the possibility of a few days reducing him to the weakness of infancyharder still for him to realise the approach of death yet when he lay meditating there in the silence of the calm night a chill crept over his frame for his judgment told him that if a merciful god did not send deliverance the end was assuredly drawing very nigh    chapter eight  in which our hero suggests a plan which gets the party out of one difficulty but plunges them into another  how long wandering will would have lain in the midst of his slumbering comrades indulging in gloomy reveries it is impossible to say for he was suddenly startled out of them by the appearance of a black object on the sea at a considerable distance from the shore  wills couch was near the open entrance to the tent and from the spot where his head lay pillowed on his coat he could see the lagoon the opening in the reef and the ocean beyond  he rose softly but quickly and went out to assure himself that his disturbed fancy had not misled him  nothere could be no doubt about it  grey dawn was already breaking and enabled him to see it distinctlya dark moving speck on the sea far outside the reef  it could not be a gull or seabird he felt persuaded neither was it a ship for his eye during the voyage had become a practised one in observing distant vessels  it might be a boat  full of this idea and trembling with hope and anxiety he returned to the tent and gently awoke the captain  sh dont speak he whispered laying his hand on the captains mouth  im convinced it is a boat continued will as he stood beside the now smouldering fire while the captain gazed long and earnestly through his telescope at the object on the sea  youre only halfright said the other with unusual seriousness as he handed the glass to his companion its a canoea large one i think and apparently full of men but we shant be left long in doubt as to that our fire has evidently attracted them and now we must prepare for their reception  do you then doubt their friendliness asked will returning the glass to the captain who again examined the approaching canoe carefully  whether they shall turn out to be friends or foes doctor depends entirely on whether they are christians or heathens  if the missionaries have got a footing amongst em we are saved if noti wouldnt give much for our chance of seeing old england again  the captains voice dropped as he said this and his face was overspread with an expression of profound gravity  do you really believe in all the stories we have heard of the bloodthirstiness of these savages and their taste for human flesh asked will with some anxiety  believe them exclaimed the captain with a bitter almost ferocious laugh of course i do  i have seen them at their bloody work lad its all very well for shoregoin folk in the old country to make their jokes about cold missionary on the sideboard and to sing of the king of the cannibal islands but as sure as there is a sky over your head and a coral island under your feet so certainly do the south sea savages kill roast and eat their enemies and so fond are they of human flesh that when they cant get hold of enemies they kill and eat their slaves  look you can make out the canoe well enough now without the glass shes makin straight for the opening in the reef  the sun will be up in half an hour and theyll arrive about the same time come let us rouse the men  hastening down to the tent the captain raised the curtain and shouted hoarsely  hallo lads turn out thereturn out  heres a canoe in sightlook alive  had a bombshell fallen into the midst of the sleepers it could scarcely have produced more commotion among them  every one sprang up violently  hooroo shouted larry ohale didnt i say so  sure its mysilf was draimin of ould ireland an the cabin in the bog wi that purty little crature he stopped abruptly and added och captain dear whats wrong  hold you tongue larry for a little and keep your cheerin till you have done fightin for its my opinion we may have something to do in that way ere long  faix its mysilf as can enjoy a taste o that too said larry buttoning his jacket and turning up his cuffs  by this time the canoe was approaching the passage in the reef and the whole party hastened to the beach where they held a hasty council of war for it was now clear that the canoe was one of the largest size capable of holding nearly a hundred menand that it was quite full of naked savages  in a few words the captain explained to the men the character of the islanders as ascertained by himself on previous voyages and showed how hopeless would be their case if they turned out to be heathens  now said he we are fifteen in number all told with two muskets one pistol three or four cutlasses and a small supply of ammunition if these men prove to be enemies shall we attack them and try to take their canoe or shall we at once lay down our arms and trust to their generosity  peace or war thats the question  larry at once declared for war and several of the more fiery spirits joined him among whom was will osten for the young doctor shrank with horror from the idea of being roasted and eaten  i vote for peace said the mate gloomily  sure mr cupples exclaimed larry i wonder at that for its little pace ye gave us aboord the foam  its not possible continued the matetaking no notice of the cooks remark nor of the short laugh which followed itits not possible for fifteen men armed as we are to beat a hundred savages well supplied with clubs and spearsas i make no doubt they areso i think we should trust to their friendliness  bah whispered larry to the man next him he knows that hes too tough and dry for any savage in his siven sinses to ait him cooked or raw and so he hopes to escape  mr cupples is right lads said the captain wed have no chance in a fair fight an though i make no doubt we should kill double our number in the scrimmage what good would that do  some of the men here seconded the captain the others began to waver and it was finally decided that they should at least begin with pacific advances  when the council broke up the sailors went down to the waters edge and awaited her arrival  as she came nearer it became apparent that she was a warcanoe fill with warriors  steadily and swiftly she advanced to within a short distance of the shore  then the paddlers suddenly ceased and she was allowed to drift slowly in while a splendid looking savage stood up in the bow with a shield on his left arm and a javelin in his right hand  the chief for such he evidently was wore no clothing except a piece of native cloth round his loins but his whole body was elaborately tatooed with various devices and this species of decoration coupled with the darkness of his skin did away very much with the appearance of nakedness  he seemed as if he had been clothed in a dark skintight dress  but the most conspicuous part about him was the top of his head on which there seemed to be a large turban which on closer inspection turned out to be his own hair curled and fizzed out artificially altogether he was an imposing and gigantic fellow  when about fifty yards from the shore the savages checked the canoes progress and stood up  now was the time for action so according to previous arrangement the sailors laid their weapons down on the beach and held up their hands at the same time making such signs of friendship as they thought would be understood  the savages who were quickwitted fellows at once ran the canoe ashore leaped out and hastened towards the white men  as they did so captain dall put his telescope to his eye for a moment wishing to scan closely the features of the chief  instantly the whole band turned with a howl and making towards the canoe jumped in and pushed off  ha exclaimed the captain with a smile these fellows have been fired at by europeans before now  they evidently mistook my telescope for a musket  the savages paused and again faced about at a short distance from the beach and the captain sought by every imaginable sign and gesticulation to remove the bad impression he had so innocently created  he succeeded  in a short time the natives again landed and advanced towards them  on drawing near the chief stopped and made a short speechwhich of course none of the white men understood  to this captain dall replied in a short speechwhich of course none of the natives understood  both parties looked very amiably however at each other and by degrees drew closer together when the natives began to manifest much curiosity in reference to the costume of the sailors soon they became more familiar and the truth of the proverb that familiarity breeds contempt was quickly illustrated by one of the savages seizing hold of the musket which larry ohale carried  the hot blood of the irishman instantly fired  let go ye dirty bit o mahogany he cried holding the musket tight with his left hand and clenching his right in a threatening manner  captain dall foreseeing what would be the result of a blow sought to create a diversion by raising his telescope to his eye  the quicksighted savage observed the motion let go his hold of the musket and shrank behind his comrades who however did not appear disposed to screen him for they all began to dodge behind each other until the telescope was lowered  the temporary distraction of attention which this incident caused emboldened another savage to pounce upon the other musket which was carried by old bob  he wrenched it out of the sailors hand and bounded away with a shout swinging it over his head  unfortunately his fingers touched the trigger and the piece exploded knocking down the man who held it and sending the ball close past the chiefs ear  instantly there followed a loud yell clubs were brandished cutlasses gleamed and blood would certainly have been spilt had not captain dall suddenly seized the chief by the shoulders and rubbed noses with him he knew this to be the mode of salutation among some of the south sea tribes and sought to make a last effort at conciliation  the act was reciprocated by the chief who signed to his men to forbear  captain dall now felt convinced that any undecided course of action would only render their case more desperate so he turned to his men with a look of authority and said sternly  my lads we have only one hope left to us and that is submission throw down your weapons and put your trust in the almighty  the men obeyedsome with hesitation and others sullenly they flung their cutlasses on the sand and crossed their arms on their breasts  no sooner was this done than the savages rushed upon them in overwhelming numbers and they were instantly overpowered  larry ohale and will osten with some of the younger men struggled fiercely and knocked down several of their opponents before they were subdued but against such overwhelming odds they had no chance  it would have been better for them had they acted on the captains advice  whatever is worth doing is worth doing well and this truth is not less applicable to the act of submission than to that of resistance  the only result of their illtimed display of valour was the tighter fastening of the cords with which the savages bound them hand and foot and somewhat rough handling when they with their comrades were tossed into the bottom of the canoe  after the sailors were secured the natives collected the provisions that had been brought by them to the island and stowed these also in the canoe  this occupied a considerable time for they were so careful to avoid missing anything that they ranged over the whole island examining every part minutely and leaving nothing behind that had the slightest appearance of value in their eyes  during all this time the white men were left lying in the water which had leaked into the canoe indeed the valiant larry would certainly have been drowned but for the aid extended to him by our hero for he chanced to have been thrown into the canoe with his face downwards near the stern and as the water gradually settled down there from the prow which was raised on the sand it covered his mouth  fortunately will who was near him managed to assist the unfortunate man in his struggles so as to enable him to rest his head on the blade of a paddle  when everything belonging to the crew of the foam had been collected the savages returned to their canoe relaunched her paddled out to sea and ere long left the little coral island out of sight behind them    chapter nine  contains an account of the desperate circumstances of the prisoners  five hours passed away during which the savages continued to paddle almost without intermission and our hero with his friends lay fast bound in the bottom of the canoe  they suffered great pain from the swelling of their limbs and the tightening of the cords that bound them but although larry ohale in the exasperation of his spirit gave vent to one or two howls accompanied by expressions that were the reverse of complimentary no attention was paid to them until the island towards which they steered was reached  the instant the canoe touched the sand the captives were lifted out their hands and feet were tied together in a bunch and each being slung on a stout pole as one might sling a bundle they were carried up to a native village on the margin of a wood  on the way wandering will could see that the beach swarmed with nativesa fact however of which his ears had already assured him for the air was filled with yells of delight as the captives were successively lifted out of the canoe  he also observed that the island appeared to be a large one for he got a glimpse of a huge mountain rising over the tree tops  neither he nor any of his comrades however had time to make many observations for they were hurried up the beach and into the village where they were thrown down under a rudely built hut which was covered with broad leaves  here the cords that fastened them were unloosed but if this for a moment raised the hope that they were about to be set free they were quickly undeceived by the savages who rebound their hands behind them our hero captain dall mr cupples larry ohale and muggins were then fastened with cords of cocoanut fibre to the several posts of the hut in such a manner that they could stand up or lie down at pleasure george goff old bob and the others were led away  seeing that they were about to be separated captain dall suddenly called out farewell lads in a tone so sad that goff looked back at him in surprise but his captors forced him away before he could reply  you think we wont see them again said osten when they were left alone  i think not  from what i know of those savages i fear they have taken our comrades away to be sacrificed and that our own time will soon come  something between a groan and a growl escaped from ohale when this was said  cudnt we break thim ropes and run amuck amongst the murtherin blackguards he exclaimed seizing the rope that bound him with his teeth and endeavouring to tear itan effort which it is needless to say was futile and nearly cost him a tooth  its of no use larry said the captain we cant help ourselves  if the lord dont help us were dead men  although will osten was much depressed not to say alarmed by what he heard he could not help wondering why the captain had so suddenly lost his buoyant spirit  at the time when a slow death by starvation had stared him in the face he had not only retained his own heartiness of spirit but had kept up wonderfully the spirits of his companions  now howeverwhen as will thought they had the chance of escaping by stratagem or by force from their captors or at the worst of selling their lives dearlyhis spirit seemed to have utterly forsaken him  yet the captain was only despondentnot despairing  he had seen the deeds of savages in former years and knew that with them there was seldom a long period between the resolve to kill and the accomplishment of the crime  he feared for the lives of his shipmates and would have given his right hand at that moment to have been free to aid them but the attempts of himself and his comrades to break their bonds were fruitless so after making one or two desperate efforts they sat down doggedly to await their fate  it might have been a curious study to have noted the different spirit in which these unfortunate men submitted to their unavoidable doom on that occasion  the captain sat down on a log of wood that chanced to be near him folded his hands quietly on his knees allowed his head to sink forward on his chest and remained for a long time quite motionless will osten on the other hand stood up at first and leaning his head on his arm against the wall of the hut appeared to be lost in reverie doubtless he was thinking of home perhaps reproaching himself for the manner and spirit in which he had quitted itas many a poor wanderer has done before when too late  he quickly changed his thoughts however and with them his position sat down and got up frequently frowned clenched his hands shook his head stamped his foot bit his lips and altogether betrayed a spirit ill at ease  mr cupples whose soul had from the moment of their capture given way to the deepest possible dejection lay down and resting his elbow on the floor and his head on his hand gazed at his comrades with a look so dreadfully dolorous that despite their anxiety they could hardly suppress a smile  as for muggins and ohale the former being a phlegmatic man and a courageous sat down with his back against the wall his hands thrust into his pockets and a quid in his cheek and shook his head slowly from side to side while he remarked that every one had to die once an when the time came no one couldnt escape and that was all about it  poor larry ohale could not thus calm his mercurial spirit he twisted his hard features into every possible contortion apostrophised his luck and his grandmother and ould ireland in the most pathetic manner bewailed his fate and used improper language in reference to savages in general and those of the south seas in particular while at intervals he leaped up and tried to tear his bonds asunder  thus several hours were spent  evening approached and darkness set in still no one came near the prisoners  during this period however they heard the continual shouting and singing of the savages and sometimes caught a glimpse of them through crevices between the logs of which the hut was built  it was not possible for them to ascertain what they were about however until night set in when several large fires were lighted and then it could be seen that they were feasting and dancing suddenly in the midst of the din an appalling shriek was heard  it was quickly succeeded by another and another  then the yells of the revellers increased in fury and presently a procession of them was observed approaching the hut headed by four men bearing a sort of stage on their shoulders  the shrieks had struck like a deathchill to the hearts of the prisoners  no one spoke but each had recognised familiar tones in the terrible cries  for the first time some of them began to realise the fact that they were really in the hands of murderers and that the bloody work had actually begun  great drops of sweat rolled down the face of muggins as he gazed in horror through one of the crevices and his broad chest heaved convulsively as he exclaimed god be merciful to us its george goff  this was too true  on the stage carried by four natives sat the unfortunate seaman  it required no second glance to tell that his spirit had fled and that nothing but a corpse sat swaying there supported by means of a pole in a sitting posture  the cannibals were conveying it to their temple there to cut it up and prepare it for that dreadful feast which is regarded as inexpressibly repulsive by all the human race except these islanders of the south seas who incredible though it may appear absolutely relish human flesh as a dainty morsel  at sight of this poor will osten who had never quite believed in such terrible things sank down on his knees with a deep groan and for the first time in his life perhaps prayed earnestly  ohales spirit blazed up in ungovernable fury  like a wild beast he tore and wrenched at the rope which bound him and then finding his efforts unavailing he flung himself on the ground while deep sobs burst at intervals from his oppressed heart  a few minutes elapsed then there was a rush of footsteps without accompanied by fierce yells and the waving of torches  the prisoners leaped up feeling almost instinctively that there hour had come  a moment later and the hut was filled with natives  all were naked with the exception of a small piece of cloth round their loins  they were tatooed however and painted nearly from head to foot  the prisoners were instantly seized and overpowered and preparations were being rapidly made to carry them away when a shout was heard outside and a remarkably tall powerful and thickly painted savage sprang in  he pushed the natives violently aside and gave some stern orders to those who held the prisoners  the immediate result was that the latter were released and allowed to rise although their hands were still bound behind them  meanwhile the tall savage standing beside them harangued his comrades with great energy of tone and action  while this was going on larry ohale whispered excitedly to his companions  howld on lads a bit  sure ive burst the ropes at last  the moment i git howld o that blackguards knife ill cut yer lashins  stand by for a rush  as larry spoke the tall savage drew the knife referred to from his girdle and glancing over his shoulder said in english  keep quiet lads  ill do my best to save ee but if you offer to fight youre dead men all in five minutes  amazement if no other feeling had operated would have rendered the prisoners perfectly quiet after that  they waited in deep anxiety and wonder while the tall savage continued his harangue at the conclusion of which his hearers uttered an expressive grunt or growl as if of assent and then they all filed out of the hut leaving the prisoners alone with their deliverer    chapter ten  our hero and his comrades in distress become savage warriors for the nonce  friend said captain dall taking the hand of the tall savage in his and speaking with some emotion you have been sent as our deliverer i know but how a south sea islander should happen to befriend us and how you should come to speak english as well as ye do is more than i can understand  onderstand exclaimed larry its past belaif  it baits cockfightin intirely  a grim smile crossed the painted face of the savage as he said somewhat hurriedly  im no more a south sea islander than you are lads but this is not the time for explanations  its enough for you to know in the meantime that im an englishman and will befriend you if you agree to obey me  obey ye cried larry with enthusiasm blissins on yer painted mug its warship ye we will av ye only git us out o this scrape  thats so said muggins nodding his head emphatically while mr cupples in tones of the most awful solemnity and with a look that cannot be described vowed eternal friendship  well then said the tall man we have no time to waste for you are in a greater fix just now than ye think for  about myself its enough to know that im a runaway sailor that i made my way among these fellers here by offering to join em and fight for em and that i won their respect at first by knocking down in fair standup fight all the biggest men o the tribe  i dont think they would have spared me even after that but i curried favour with the chief and married one of his daughters  now im a great man among them  i didnt hear of your having been brought here till half an hour ago havin bin away with a war party in canoes  i returned just too late to save your comrades  what are they all dead asked will osten  ay all and if you dont follow them it will only be by attending to what i tell you  my name is buchanan but the savages can only manage to make bukawanga out o that  the word means fire and aint a bad one after all  the man smiled grimly as he said this and then resumed more rapidly and sternly than before  you have but one chance and that is to join us  i have come to the village with the news that a neighbouring tribe is about to attack us if you agree to help us to fight i may manage to save you if not your case is hopeless  there is no time for consideration  ay or no thats the word  sure ill jine ye mr bukkie whangy said larry ohale wid all the pleasure in life  its always for fightin i am at laist whin  i dont like to shed human blood said captain dall interrupting where ive no quarrel  then your own must be shed said bukawanga firmly  theres no help for it captain said will osten  tis better to fight for these men than to be murdered by them  what say you mr cupples  war replied the mate emphatically  ditto said muggins nodding his head and buttoning his jacket  then strip and well paint you right off said bukawanga look alive now  he fastened the torch which he held in his hand to a beam of the hut and cut the bonds of the prisoners then going to the door he summoned two men who came in with a basket made of leaves in which were several cocoanut shells filled with red white and black earth or paint  what exclaimed will osten must we fight without clothing  an wid painted skins said larry  yes unless you would be a special mark for the enemy replied bukawanga but you have no chance if you dont become in every way like one of us  seeing that the man was in earnest they were fain to submit  after removing their clothes the natives began diligently to paint them from head to foot laying on the colours so thickly and in such bold effective strokes that ere long all appearance of nudity was removed man is a strange being  even in the midst of the most solemn scenes he cannot resist giving way at times to bursts of mirth  philosophy may fail to account for it and propriety may shudder at it but the fact is undeniable  with death hovering they knew not how near over them and the memory of the fearful things they had just witnessed strong upon them they were compelled now and then to smile and even to laugh aloud as the process of painting went on  there was some variety in the adornment of each but let that of larry ohale serve as an example first of all his legs were rubbed all over with white earth and his body with yellow  then down each lower limb behind a palmtree was drawn in redthe roots beginning at his heels and the branches above spreading out on his calves  various fanciful devices were drawn on his breast and arms and some striking circles on his back  last of all onehalf of his face was painted red and the other half black with a stripe of white extending from the root of his hair down to the point of his nose  it is needless to say that during the process the enthusiastic irishman commented freely on the work and offered many pieces of advice to the operator  indeed his tendency to improve upon existing customs had wellnigh put an end to the friendly relations which now subsisted between the white men and the natives for he took a fancy to have a red stripe down each of his legs  either the native did not understand him or would not agree to the proposal whereupon larry took the brush and continued the work himself  at this the savage indignantly seized him by the arm and pinched him so violently that he lost temper and thrusting the red brush into the natives face hurled him to the ground  there was a yell and a rush at once and it is probable that blood would have been shed had not bukawanga interposed  when the painting was completed their protector led the white men now no longer white to the hut of the chief  bukawanga was received somewhat coldly at first  the chief a large finelooking old man named thackombau with an enormous head of frizzled hair looked askance at the newcomers and was evidently disposed to be unfriendly observing this and that the warriors around him scowled on them in a peculiarly savage manner most of the prisoners felt that their lives hung as it were upon a thread  the aspect of things changed however when their friend stood up and addressed the assembly  bukawanga had not yet said a word about the cause of his sudden return from the war expedition  it was therefore with much concern that the chief and his men learned that a neighbouring and powerful tribe with which they had always been at enmity were actually on the way to attack them and when bukawanga talked of the needful preparations for defence and pointing to the prisoners said that they were his countrymen able to fight well and willing to help them there was a perceptible improvement in the looks of the party  finally thackombau condescended to rub noses with them all and they were ordered off to another hut to have supper  this latter arrangement was brought about by their deliverer who knew that if they remained to sup with the natives they would be shocked and perhaps roused to some act of desperate violence by the horrible sight of portions of the bodies of their poor comrades which he knew were to be eaten that night  he therefore sought to divert their thoughts from the subject by sitting down and relating many anecdotes connected with his own adventurous history while they partook of a meal of which they stood much in need  the dishes although new to them were by no means unpalatable  they consisted of baked pig and yams served on banana leaves and soup in cocoanut shells  also a dish made of tarotops and filled with a creamy preparation of cocoanut done in an oven  breadfruits were also served and these tasted so like the crumb of wheaten loaf that it was difficult to believe them to be the fruit of a tree  for drink they had the juice of the young cocoaa liquid which resembles lemonade and of which each nut contains about a tumblerful  there was also offered to them a beverage named ava which is intoxicating in its nature and very disgusting in its preparation  this however bukawanga advised them not to touch  now mr bukkie whangy said larry after having appeased his appetite if i may make so bowld as to axhow came ye here  the story is short enough and sad enough replied his new friend the fact is i came here in a sandalwood traders ship i was so disgusted with the captain and crew that i ran away from them when they touched at this island for water  tis eight years ago now and i have bin here ever since  i have regretted the step that i took for the devilry that goes on here is ten times worse than i ever saw aboard ship  however its too late for regret now  ah too late murmured will osten and his thoughts leaped back to england  the worst of it is continued the runaway sailor that i have no chance of gettin away for the cruelty of sailors to the natives of this island has rendered them desperate and they murder every white man they can get hold of  indeed there would have been no chance for you but for the breaking out of war and the fact that they are somewhat short of fightin men just now  not long after i landed on the island an american whaler sent her boats ashore for water  they quarrelled somehow with the natives who drove them into their boats with tremendous hooting and yells and some hard blows although no blood was spilt  well what did the scoundrels do but pulled aboard their ship brought their big guns to bear on the people and fired on several villageskilling and wounding a good many of em women and children among the rest  thats the way these fellows set the natives against white men  it was all i could do to prevent them from knocking out my brains after the thing happened  while bukawanga was speaking a great commotion was heard outside  theyre gettin ready for action he said springing up  now lads follow me  ill get you weapons and harkee he added with a somewhat peculiar smile i heerd some of ee say ye dont want to spill blood where ye have no quarrel  well theres no occasion to do so only act in selfdefence and thatll do well enough dye understand  the man gave vent to a short chuckle as he said this and then leading his countrymen from the hut conducted them towards a temple near to which a large band of warriors was busily engaged in making preparations for the approaching fight    chapter eleven  a fight which results in a mistake and a hasty flight  the horrors of war are neither agreeable to write about nor to reflect upon  however much therefore it may disappoint those readers whose minds delight to wallow in the abominations of human cruelty we will refrain from entering into the full particulars of the sanguinary fight that ensued just after the arrival of wandering will and his friends in the island  it is sufficient to say that many lives were lost  of course the loss of life bore no proportion to that which occurs in civilised warfare  one roar from the throats of our terrific engines of destruction will sometimes send more souls into eternity in one moment than all the fierce fury of a hundred savages can accomplish in an hour but what the savage lacks in power he more than makes up for in cruelty and brutality  during the few days in which the fight raged the sights that met the eyes of the white men and the appalling sounds that filled their ears turned their hearts sick and induced a longing desire to escape  the war was carried on chiefly in the way of bush fighting  our sailors found this mode of warfare convenient for it enabled them to act very much as spectators  passing over the details of the brief campaign we touch only on those points which affected the subsequent movements of the whites  bukawanga who virtually acted the part of commanderinchief although all the chiefs considered themselves above him moved about actively at all times to make sure that the village was properly guarded at every point  while thus employed he had on one occasion to pass through a piece of scrub or thick bush in which he heard the shriek of a woman turning aside he came to an opening where a man was endeavouring to kill a little boy whose mother was doing her best to defend him  he evidently wished to kill the child and to spare the woman but she stooped over the child and warded off the blows with her arms so cleverly that it was still uninjured although the poor mother was bleeding profusely from many wounds  bukawanga instantly rushed to the rescue and raised his club to deal the savage a deadly blow unobserved by him however another savage had been attracted to the spot and seeing what was about to happen he ran up behind bukawanga and felled him with a blow of his club  during the scuffle the woman snatched up her boy and escaped  the two savages then began to dispute as to which had the best right to cut off the head of their fallen foe and carry it away in triumph  both of them were much fatigued with fighting so they sat down on the back of the prostrate seaman to conduct the discussion more comfortably  the point was still undecided when bukawanga recovered consciousness felt the heavy pressure on his back and loins and heard part of the interesting dialogue  it chanced at this point that will osten and larry ohale who from natural affinity or some other cause always kept together came to the spot and peeped through the bushes  seeing two men sitting on the body of a third and engaged in an animated dispute they did not see cause to interfere but remained for a few minutes almost amused spectators of the scene being utterly ignorant of course as to the purport of their dispute  suddenly to their great surprise they beheld the two men leap into the air the supposed dead body sprang up and before either savage could use his weapons each received a strong british fist between his eyes and measured his length on the sward while the conqueror sprang over them into the bush and disappeared  man alive exclaimed larry if it isnt bukkie whangy himself  och the murtherin daimons  with that larry leaped over the bushes flourishing his club and yelling like a very savage  but will osten was before him  both savages had risen immediately after being knocked down and now faced their new enemies  they were no match for them  being expert in all athletic exercises young osten found no difficulty in felling the first of the men while larry disposed of the other with equal celerity  the irishmans blood had fired at the thought of the narrow escape of his deliverer and still whirling his club round his head he looked about eagerly as if desirous of finding another foe on whom to expend his fury  at that moment he caught sight of a pair of savage eyes gleaming at him from the bushes  hah ye dirty polecat he cried throwing his club at the eyes with all his force  never was there a worse aim or a better shot  the club flew high into the air and would have fallen some fifty yards or more wide of the mark had it not touched the limb of a tree in passing  it glanced obliquely down and striking the owner of the eyes between the shoulders felled him to the earth  larry sprang upon him with a yell of triumph but the yell was changed into a howl of consternation when he made the discovery that he had knocked down if not killed one of the principal chiefs of the village to say that poor ohale wrung his hands and wished bad luck to fightin in general and to himself in particular gives but a feeble idea of the distress of his mind at this untoward event  dye think ive kilt him intirely doctor dear he asked of will osten who was on his knees beside the fallen chief examining his hurt  no not quite  see he breathes a little  come larry the moment he shows symptoms of reviving we must bolt  of course he knows who knocked him down and will never forgive us  thats true o murther exclaimed larry with a mingled look of contrition and anxiety  depend upon it theyll kill us all continued osten  and bake an ait us groaned larry  come said will rising hastily as the stunned chief began to move well go search for our comrades  they hurried away but not before the chief had risen on one elbow and shaken his clenched fist at them besides displaying a terrible double row of teeth through which he hissed an unintelligible malediction  they soon found their comrades and related what had occurred  a hurried council of war was held on the spot and it was resolved that as a return to the village would ensure their destruction the only chance of life which remained to them was to take to the mountains indeed so urgent was the necessity for flight that they started off at once naked though they were and covered with blood paint and dust as well as being destitute of provisions  all that night they travelled without halt and penetrated into the wildest fastnesses of the mountains of the interior  bukawanga had already told them during intervals in the fight when they had met and eaten their hasty meals together that the island was a large well wooded and fruitful onenearly thirty miles in diameter and that the highest mountain in the centre was an active volcano  there were several tribes of natives on it all of whom were usually at war with each other but these tribes dwelt chiefly on the coast leaving the interior uninhabited  the fugitives therefore agreed that they should endeavour to find a retreat amongst some of the most secluded and inaccessible heights and there hide themselves until a ship should chance to anchor off the coast or some other mode of escape present itself  the difficulties of the way were greater than had been anticipated there was no path the rocks cliffs and gullies were precipitous and the underwood was thick and tangled insomuch that mr cupples sat down once or twice and begged to be left where he was saying that he would take his chance of being caught and could feed quite well on cocoanuts  this however was not listened to  poor cupples was dragged along half by persuasion and half by force  sailors as a class are not celebrated for pedestrian powers and cupples was a singularly bad specimen of his class  muggins although pretty well knocked up before morning held on manfully without a murmur  the captain too albeit a heavy man and fat and addicted to panting and profuse perspiration declared that he was game for anything and would never be guilty of saying die as long as there was a shot in the locker  as for larry ohale he was a man of iron mould one of those giants who seem to be incapable of being worn out or crushed by any amount of physical exertion  so far was he from being exhausted that he threatened to carry mr cupples if he should again talk of falling behind  we need scarcely say that wandering will was quite equal to the occasion  besides being a powerful fellow for his age he was lithe active and hopeful and having been accustomed to hillclimbing from boyhood could have left the whole party behind with ease  grey dawn found the fugitives far up the sides of the mountainsfairly lost as muggins said in a waste howlin wilderness  it was sunrise when they reached the top of a high cliff that commanded a magnificent view of land and sea  a good place this for us said the captain wiping his forehead as he sat down on a piece of rock  the pass up to it is narrow two or three stout fellows could hold it against an army of savages  av there was only a cave now for to live in said larry looking round him  wots that exclaimed muggins pointing to a hole in the perpendicular cliff a short distance above the spot where they stoodaint that a cave  will osten clambered up and disappeared in the hole  soon after he reappeared with the gratifying intelligence that it was a cave and a capital dry one whereupon they all ascended with some difficulty and took possession of their new home    chapter twelve  shows how south sea missionaries do their work and that if the whites can surprise the natives the latter can sometimes astonish the whites  for three months did wandering will and his friends remain concealed in the mountains  of course they were pursued and diligently sought for by the natives and undoubtedly they would have been discovered had the search been continued for any length of time but to their great surprise after the first week of their flight the search was apparently given up  at all events from that period they saw nothing more of the natives and gradually became more fearless in venturing to ramble from the cave in search of food  they puzzled over the matter greatly for to say the least of it there appeared to be something mysterious in the total indifference so suddenly manifested towards them by the savages but although many were the guesses made they were very far from hitting on the real cause  during this period they subsisted on the numerous fruits and vegetables which grew wild in great abundance on the island and spent their days in gathering them and hunting wild pigs and snaring birds  as larry was wont to observe with great satisfaction and usually with his mouth full of victuals  sure its the hoith o livin we havewhat with cockynuts an taros an bananas an young pigs for the killin an gingerbeer for the drinkin an penny loaves growin on the trees for nothin wid no end o birds an pots ready bilin night an day to cook em inoch it would be hiven intirely but for the dirty savages bad luck to em  there was more truth in larrys remark than may be apparent at first sight  vegetation was not only prolific and beautiful everywhere but exceedingly fruitful  the breadfruit tree in particular supplied them with more than they required of a substance that was nearly as palatable and nutritious as bread  captain dall fortunately knew the method of cooking it in an oven for the uncooked fruit is not eatable  the milk of the young cocoanuts was what the facetious irishman referred to under the name of gingerbeer but his remark about boiling pots was literally correct  the summit of that mountainous island was as we have already said an active volcano from which sulphurous fumes were constantly issuingsometimes gently and occasionally with violence  several of the springs in the neighbourhood were hota few being almost at the boiling point so that it was absolutely possible to boil the wild pigs and birds which they succeeded in capturing without the use of a fire  strange to say they also found springs of clear cold water not far from the hot springs  there is a species of thin tough bark round the upper part of the stem of the cocoanut palma sort of natural clothwhich is much used by the south sea islanders  of this they fashioned some rude but useful garments  it seems curious doesnt it said will osten to captain dall one day referring to these things and the beauty of the island that the almighty should make such a terrestrial paradise as this and leave it to be used or rather abused by such devils in human shape  im not sure answered the captain slowly that we are right in saying that he has left it to be so abused  im afraid that it is we who are to blame in the matter  how so exclaimed will in surprise  you believe the bible to be the word of god dont you said captain dall somewhat abruptly and that its tendency is to improve men  of course i do how can you ask such a question  did you ever continued the captain pointedly hear of a text that says something about going and teaching all nations and have you ever given anything to send missionaries with the bible to these islands  ii cant say i ever have replied will with a smile and a slight blush  no more have i lad said the captain smiting his knee emphatically the thought has only entered my head for the first time but i do think that it is we who leave islands such as this to be abused by the human devils you speak of and who moreover are not a whit worsenay not so badas many civilised human devils who in times not long past and under the cloak of religion have torn men and tender women limb from limb and bound them at the stake and tortured them on the rack in order to make them swallow a false creed  this was the commencement of one of the numerous discussions on religion philosophy and politics with which the echoes of that cavern were frequently awakened after the somewhat fatiguing labours of each days chase were over for a true briton is the same everywhere  he is a reasoning if you will an argumentative animal and our little band of fugitives in those mountain fastnesses was no exception to the rule  meanwhile two events occurred at the native village which require notice  their occurrence was not observed by our friends in hiding because the summit of the mountain completely shut out their view in that direction and they never wandered far from their place of retreat  the first event was very sad and is soon told  one morning a schooner anchored off the village and a party of armed seamen landed the leader of whom through the medium of an interpreter had an interview with the chief  he wished to be permitted to cut sandalwood and an agreement was entered into  after a considerable quantity had been cut and sent on board the chief wanted payment  this was refused on some trivial ground  the savages remonstrated  the white men threatened and the result was that the latter were driven into their boats  they pulled off to their vessel loaded a large brass gun that occupied the centre of the schooners deck and sent a shower of cannister shot among the savages killing and wounding not only many of the men but some of the women and children who chanced to be on the skirt of the wood  they then set sail and as they coasted along fired into several villages the people of which had nothing to do with their quarrel  only a week after this event another little schooner anchored off the village  it was a missionary ship sent by the london missionary society to spread the good news of salvation through christ among the people  some time before a native teacherone who on another island had embraced christianity and been carefully instructed in its leading truthshad been sent to this island and was well received but war having broken out the chief had compelled him to leave  a second attempt was now being made and this time an english missionary with his wife and daughter were about to trust themselves in the hands of the savages  they could not have arrived at a worse time  the islanders still smarting under a sense of the wrong and cruelty so recently done them rushed upon the little boat of the schooner brandishing clubs and spears the instant it touched the land and it was with the utmost difficulty that the missionary prevailed on them to stay their hands and give him a hearing  he soon explained the object of his visit and by distributing a few presents so far mollified the people that he was allowed to land but it was plain that they regarded him with distrust the tide was turned in the missionarys favour however by the runaway sailor buchanan or bukawanga  that worthy happened at the time to be recovering slowly from the effects of the wound he had received in the fight which had so nearly proved to be his last  on hearing of the arrival of strangers he feared that the savages would kill them out of revenge and hastened weak and ill though he was to meet and if possible protect them  his efforts were successful  he managed to convince the natives that among christians there were two classesthose who merely called themselves by the name and those who really did their best to practise christianity that the sandalwood traders probably did not even pretend to the name but that those who had just arrived would soon give proof that they were of a very different spirit  the result of this explanation was that the chiefs agreed to receive the missionary who accordingly landed with his family and with all that was necessary for the establishment of a mission  those who have not read of missionary enterprise in the south seas can form no conception of the difficulties that missionaries have to contend with and the dangers to which they are exposed on the one hand and on the other the rapidity with which success is sometimes vouchsafed to them  in some instances they have passed years in the midst of idolatry and bloody rites the mere recital of which causes one to shudder while their lives have hung on the caprice of a volatile chief at other times god has so signally blessed their efforts that a whole tribe has adopted christianity in the course of a few weeks misunderstand us not reader  we do not say that they all became true christians nevertheless it is a glorious fact that such changes have occurred that idolatry has been given up and christianity embraced within that short period and that the end has been the civilisation of the people doubtless also the salvation of some immortal souls  in about two months after their arrival a marvellous change had taken place in the village  the natives like very children came with delight to be taught the use of the white mans tools and to assist in clearing land and building a cottage  when this was finished a small church was begun  it was this busy occupation that caused the savages to forget for a time the very existence of wandering will and his friends and if bukawanga thought of them it was to conclude that they had taken refuge with one of the tribes on the other side of the island  that which seemed to amuse and delight the natives most in the new arrivals was the clothing which was distributed among them  they proved very untractable however in the matter of putting it on  one man insisted on putting the body of a dress which had been meant for his wife on his own nether limbsthrusting his great feet through the sleeves and thereby splitting them to the shoulder  another tied a tippet round his waist and a woman was found strutting about in a pair of fishermans boots and a straw bonnet with the back to the front  one of the chiefs thus absurdly arrayed was the means of letting the fugitive white men have an idea that something strange had occurred at the village  this man had appropriated a scarlet flannel petticoat which had been presented to his mother and putting it on with the waistband tied round his neck sallied forth to hunt in the mountains he was suddenly met by larry ohale and will osten  musha tis a owrangytang cried the irishman  his companion burst into a fit of loud laughter  the terrified native turned to flee but larry darted after him tripped up his heels and held him down  kape quiet wont ye he said giving the struggling man a severe punch on the chest  the savage thought it best to obey  being allowed to get on his legs he was blindfolded and then with will grasping him on one side and the irishman on the other he was led up to the mountaincave and introduced to the family circle there just as they were about to sit down to their midday meal    chapter thirteen  remarkable changes for the better  it will not surprise the reader to be told that the savage with the red flannel petticoat tied round his neck was received with shouts of laughter by the inmates of the cave and that his costume filled them with mingled feelings of astonishment and curiosity  the information obtained from him by signs did not enlighten them much but it was sufficient to convince them that something unusual had occurred at the native village and to induce will osten to act in accordance with his favourite motto  i tell you what comrades said he after a few minutes deliberation i have made up my mind to go back to the village with this redcoated gentleman and see whether they are all decked out in the same fashion to tell the truth i have been thinking for some time back that we have been living here to no purpose  only hear that now said larry ohale interrupting havent we bin livin like fightin cocks an gettin as fat as pigs  why mr cupples hisself begins to throw a shadow on the ground whin the suns pretty strong an as for muggins there  you let muggins alone growled the seaman if we are fatterer praps itll only be for the good o the niggers when they come to eat us  well well said will at all events we shall never escape from this place by remaining heretrue for ye said larrytherefore i shall go to the village as i have said  if they receive me well and good i will return to you  if notwhy thats the end of me and youll have to look out for yourselves  as usual an energetic discussion followed this announcement  the captain said it was madness mr cupples shook his head and groaned muggins thought that they should all go together and take their chance and larry protested that he would sooner be eaten alive than allow his comrade to go without him but in time will osten convinced them all that his plan was best  what would be the good of the whole of them being killed together he saidbetter that the risk should fall on one and that the rest should have a chance of escape  besides he was the best runner of the party and if he should manage to wriggle out of the clutches of the savages would be quite able to outrun them and regain the cave  at length the youths arguments and determination prevailed and in the afternoon he set off accompanied by his sable friend in female attire  on nearing the village the first thing that greeted the eyes of our hero was a savage clothed in a yellow cotton vest and a blue jacket both of which were much too small for him he also had the leg of a chair hung round his neck by way of ornament  this turned out to be the principal chief of the village thackombau and a very proud man he obviously was on that occasion  to refrain from smiling and embrace this fellow by rubbing noses with him was no easy matter but will osten did it nevertheless  while they were endeavouring to converse by signs will was suddenly bereft of speech and motion by the unexpected appearance of a white mana gentleman clothed in sombre costumeon whose arm leaned a pleasantfaced lady the gentleman smiled on observing the young mans gaze of astonishment and advancing held out his hand  will osten grasped and shook it but still remained speechless  doubtless you are one of the party who escaped into the hills lately said the gentleman  indeed i am sir replied will finding words at last and bowing to the lady but from what star have you dropt for when i left the village there were none but savages in it  i dropt from the star of hope answered the gentleman laughing you have hit the mark young sir nearer than you think for that is the name of the vessel that brought me here  i am a missionary my name is westwood and i am thankful to say i have been successful in making a good commencement on this island  this is my wifeallow me to introduce youand if you will come with me to my cottage  cottage exclaimed will  ay tis a good and pretty one too notwithstanding the short time we took to build it  the islanders are smart fellows when they have a mind to labour and it is wonderful what an amount can be done when the lord prospers the work  these good fellows added the missionary casting a glance at the two natives who as you see are somewhat confused in their ideas about dress have already done me much service in the building of the church  church echoed will  again the missionary laughed and offering his arm to his wife turned towards the village saying  come mr ostenyou see i know your name having heard of you from your friend buchanancome i will show you what we have been about while you were absent but firsttell mehow fares it with your comrades  will osten at once entered into a full account of the doings of himself and his friends and had just concluded when he was once more rendered speechless by the sight of the missionarys cottage  it was almost the realisation of the waking dream which had captivated him so much on the evening when the storm arose that proved fatal to the foam  he was still gazing at it in silent admiration listening to an enthusiastic account of the zeal and kindness of the natives who helped to build it when a young girl apparently bordering on seventeen or eighteen years of age with nutbrown curls rosy cheeks and hazel eyes sprang out and hastened to meet them  oh father she exclaimed while the colour of her face came and went fitfully im so glad you have come  the natives have been soso  not rude to you flora surely interrupted the missionary  no not exactly rude but but  flora could not explain  the fact turned out to be that never having seen any woman so wonderfully and bewitchingly beautiful before the natives had crowded uninvited into the cottage and there seated on their hams round the walls quietly gazed at her to their hearts contentutterly ignorant of the fact that they were violating the rules of polite society  will osten to his disgrace be it said violated the same rules in much the same way for he continued to gaze at flora in rapt admiration until mr westwood turned to introduce her to him  that same evening bukawanga accompanied by thackombau went to the mountaincave and having explained to its occupants the altered state of things at the village brought them down to the missionhouse where they took up their abode  it need scarcely be said that they were hospitably received  mr westwood had not met with countrymen for many months and the mere sight of white faces and the sound of english voices were pleasant to him  he entertained them with innumerable anecdotes of his experiences and adventures as a missionary and on the following morning took them out to see the church which had just been begun  already said mr westwood as they were about to set forth after breakfast my wife and flora have got up a class of women and girls to whom they teach needlework and we have a large attendance of natives at our meetings on the sabbath  a school also has been started which is managed by a native teacher who came with me from the island of raratonga and most of the boys in the village attend it  but it does seem to me sir said captain dall as they sauntered along that needlework and booklearning can be of no use to such people  not of much just now captain but these are only means to a great end already you see they are beginning to be clothedfantastically enough at present no doubtand i hope ere long to see them in their right mind through the blessed influence of the bible  look there he added pointing to an open space in the forest where the four walls of a large wooden building were beginning to rise there is evidence of what the gospel of jesus christ can do  the labourers at that building are many of them bitter enemies to each other  only yesterday we succeeded in getting some of the men of the neighbouring village to come and help us  after much persuasion they agreed but they work with their weapons in their hands as you see  this was indeed the case  the men who had formerly been enemies were seen assisting to build the same church  they took care however to work as far from each other as possible and were evidently distrustful for clubs and spears were either carried in their hands or placed within reach while they laboured  fortunately however they restrained their passions at that time and it is due to them to add that before that church was finished their differences were made up and they with all the others ultimately completed the work in perfect harmony without thinking it necessary to bring their clubs or spears with them  the reader must not suppose that all missionary efforts in the south seas have been as quickly successful as this one  the records of that interesting region tell a very different tale nevertheless there are many islands in which the prejudices of the natives were overcome almost at the commencement and where heathen practices seemed to melt away at once before the light of the glorious gospel  during two months wandering will and the wrecked seamen remained here assisting the missionary in his building and other operations  then an event occurred which sent them once more afloat and broke the spell of their happy and busy life among the islanders    chapter fourteen  contains more than one surprise and touches on loves young dream  one quiet and beautiful sabbath morning the inhabitants of the south sea island village wended their way to the house of god which they had so recently erected  among them were will osten and his friends with the clergymans wife and daughter  poor wandering will was very unhappy  the sunshine was bright the natives were blithe and the birds were joyous but our hero was despondent  the fact was that he had fallen head and ears in love with flora westwood and he felt that he might as well have fallen in love with the moonas far as any chance of getting married to her was concerned  will was therefore very miserable and like all ardent and very youthful lovers he hugged his misery to his bosomrather enjoyed it in fact than otherwise  in short if truth must be told he took pleasure in being miserable for her sake  when he allowed himself to take romantic views of the subject and thought of the heights of bliss that might be attained he was so to speak miserably happy  when he looked the stern realities in the face he was miserably sad  that sabbath morning poor will felt more impressed than ever with the hopelessness of his case as he walked slowly and silently to church beside the modest flora and her mother  he also became impressed with the ridiculousness of his position and determined to overcome his weakness  he therefore looked at flora with the intention of cutting a joke of some sort but suddenly recollecting that it was sunday he checked himself  then he thought of getting into a serious talk and was about to begin when his eye happened to fall on thackombau who in honour of the day had got himself up with unusual care having covered his shoulders with a cotton jacket his loins with a ladys shawl and his head with a white nightcaphis dark tatooed legs forming a curious and striking contrast to the whole  before will could think of another mode of opening the conversation they had arrived at the church and here in front of the open door there lay the most singular contribution that ever was offered to the cause of christianity  many dozens of churchdoor plates rolled into one enormous trencher would have been insufficient to contain it for it was given not in money of course but in kind  there were a number of lengths of hollow bamboo containing cocoanut oil various fine mats and pieces of native cloth and sundry articles of an ornamental character besides a large supply of fruits and vegetables with four or five baked pigs cold and ready for table  the entire pile was several feet in diameter and height and was a freewill offering of the natives to the churchthe beginning of a liberality which was destined in future years to continue and extenda species of liberality which is by no means uncommon among the south sea islanders for there are some of those who were savage idolators not many years ago who now give annually and largely to the support of the missions with which their churches are connected  larry ohale had just made a remark in reference to the plate which was not conducive to the gravity of his companions when the echoes of the mountains were awakened by a cannonshot and a large ship was seen to round the point of land that stretched out to the westward of the island  instantly the natives poured out of the church rushed down to the shore launched their canoes and paddled over the lagoon to meet the vessel which running before a stiff breeze soon entered the natural gateway in the reef  the congregation having dispersed thus unceremoniously the clergyman and his friends were compelled to postpone service for a time  the ship which had created such a sensation in the village was also the means of causing great disturbance in sundry breasts as shall be seen she had called for water  being in a hurry her captain had resolved not to waste time by conciliating the natives but rather to frighten them away by a cannonade of blank cartridge land a strong party to procure water while they were panicstricken and then up anchor and away  his surprise was great therefore when the natives came fearlessly off to him for he had been warned to beware of them and he was about to give them a warm reception when he caught a glimpse of the small spire of the new church which at once explained the cause of the change  with rollicking good humourfor he was a strong healthy man with a sleeping consciencecaptain blathers on landing swaggered up to the clergyman and shook him heartily and gratefully by the hand exclaiming with a characteristic oath that he had not much opinion of religion in his own country but he was bound to say it was a firstrate institootion in the south seas  mr westwood rebuked the oath and attempted to correct the erroneous opinion but captain blathers laughed and said he knew nothing about these matters and had no time for anything but getting fresh water just then  he added that he had a batch of noosepapers which hed send ashore for the use of all and sundry  accordingly off he went about his business and left the clergyman and natives to return to church which they all did without delay  that night the missionary went on board the ship to see the captain and preach to the crew  while he was thus engaged our friends captain dall mr cupples ohale muggins and wandering will in a retired part of the forest held an earnest conversation as to whether they should avail themselves of the arrival of the ship to quit the island captain dall had already spoken with captain blathers who said he was quite willing to let them work their passage to england  now you see comrades said captain dall thrusting his right fist into his left palm the only trouble is that hes not goin direct homegot to visit the coast of south america and san francisco first an that will make it a long voyage  but sure said larry it wont be so long as waitin here till next year for the missionary schooner and then goin a viage among the islands before gettin a chance of boording a homewardbound ship  thats so said muggins with a nod of approval  i says go ov coorse  mr cupples also signified that this was his opinion  and what says the doctor asked captain dall turning to will osten with an inquiring look  eh well ah exclaimed will who had been in a reverie ii dont exactly see my way tothat isif we only could find out if she isis to remain here always or hopes some day to return to england  poor will stopped in sudden confusion and blushed but as it was very dark that did not matter much  what does the man mean exclaimed captain dall  how can she remain here always when shes to be off at daybreak  true true interrupted will hurriedly not sorry to find that his reference to flora was supposed to be to the ship  the fact is i was thinking of other mattersof course i agree with you  its too good an opportunity to be missed so goodnight for ive enough to do to get ready for such an abrupt departure  saying this he started up and strode rapidly away  halloo shouted larry after him dont be latebe on the baich at daybreak  arrah hes gone mad intirely  ravin said muggins with a shake of his head as he turned the quid in his cheek  meanwhile wandering will rushed he knew not whither but a natural impulse led him in the most natural way to the quiet bay which he knew to be floras favourite walk on moonlight nights  the poor youths brain was whirling with conflicting emotions  as he reached the bay the moon strange to say broke forth in great splendour and revealed whatcould it beyes the graceful figure of flora  never venture thought will never  in another moment he was by her side he seized her hand she started suppressed a scream and tried to free her hand but will held it fast forgive me flora dearest girl he said in impassioned tones i would not dare to act thus but at daybreak i leave this island perhaps for ever yet i cannot go without telling you that i love you to distraction thatthatoh say tell me  at that moment he observed that flora blushed smiled in a peculiar manner and instead of looking in his face glanced over his shoulder as if at some object behind him  turning quickly round he beheld thackombau still decked out in his sunday clothes gazing at them in openmouthed amazement  almost mad with rage will osten rushed at him  the astonished savage fled to the woods will followed and in a few minutes lost himself how he passed that night he never could tell all that he could be sure of was that he had wandered about in distraction and emerged upon the shore about daybreak  his appointment suddenly recurring to him he ran swiftly in the direction of the village  as he drew near he observed a boat pushing off from the shore  howld on shouted a wellknown voice sure its himself after all  come along young sir youre late and had wellnigh lost your passage growled captain blathers  will jumped into the boat and in a few minutes found himself on board the rover which by the time he reached it was under weigh and making for the opening in the reef  another hour and the island was a mere speck on the horizon  gradually it faded from view and the good ship bending over to the freshening breeze bounded lightly away over the billows of the mighty sea  the end
