63748603	the history of mr polly  by  h g wells    chapter the first  beginnings and the bazaar   i  hole said mr polly and then for a change and with greatly increased emphasis ole he paused and then broke out with one of his private and peculiar idioms oh beastly silly wheeze of a hole  he was sitting on a stile between two threadbare looking fields and suffering acutely from indigestion  he suffered from indigestion now nearly every afternoon in his life but as he lacked introspection he projected the associated discomfort upon the world every afternoon he discovered afresh that life as a whole and every aspect of life that presented itself was beastly and this afternoon lured by the delusive blueness of a sky that was blue because the wind was in the east he had come out in the hope of snatching something of the joyousness of spring the mysterious alchemy of mind and body refused however to permit any joyousness whatever in the spring  he had had a little difficulty in finding his cap before he came out he wanted his capthe new golf capand mrs polly must needs fish out his old soft brown felt hat eres your at she said in a tone of insincere encouragement  he had been routing among the piled newspapers under the kitchen dresser and had turned quite hopefully and taken the thing he put it on but it didnt feel right nothing felt right he put a trembling hand upon the crown of the thing and pressed it on his head and tried it askew to the right and then askew to the left  then the full sense of the indignity offered him came home to him the hat masked the upper sinister quarter of his face and he spoke with a wrathful eye regarding his wife from under the brim in a voice thick with fury he said i spose youd like me to wear that silly mud pie for ever eh i tell you i wont im sick of it im pretty near sick of everything comes to that hat  he clutched it with quivering fingers hat he repeated then he flung it to the ground and kicked it with extraordinary fury across the kitchen it flew up against the door and dropped to the ground with its ribbon band half off  shant go out he said and sticking his hands into his jacket pockets discovered the missing cap in the right one  there was nothing for it but to go straight upstairs without a word and out slamming the shop door hard  beauty said mrs polly at last to a tremendous silence picking up and dusting the rejected headdress tantrums she added i avent patience and moving with the slow reluctance of a deeply offended woman she began to pile together the simple apparatus of their recent meal for transportation to the scullery sink  the repast she had prepared for him did not seem to her to justify his ingratitude there had been the cold pork from sunday and some nice cold potatoes and rashdalls mixed pickles of which he was inordinately fond he had eaten three gherkins two onions a small cauliflower head and several capers with every appearance of appetite and indeed with avidity and then there had been cold suet pudding to follow with treacle and then a nice bit of cheese it was the pale hard sort of cheese he liked red cheese he declared was indigestible he had also had three big slices of greyish bakers bread and had drunk the best part of the jugful of beer but there seems to be no pleasing some people  tantrums said mrs polly at the sink struggling with the mustard on his plate and expressing the only solution of the problem that occurred to her  and mr polly sat on the stile and hated the whole scheme of lifewhich was at once excessive and inadequate as a solution he hated foxbourne he hated foxbourne high street he hated his shop and his wife and his neighboursevery blessed neighbourand with indescribable bitterness he hated himself  why did i ever get in this silly hole he said why did i ever  he sat on the stile and looked with eyes that seemed blurred with impalpable flaws at a world in which even the spring buds were wilted the sunlight metallic and the shadows mixed with blueblack ink  to the moralist i know he might have served as a figure of sinful discontent but that is because it is the habit of moralists to ignore material circumstancesif indeed one may speak of a recent meal as a circumstancewith mr polly circum drink indeed our teachers will criticise nowadays both as regards quantity and quality but neither church nor state nor school will raise a warning finger between a man and his hunger and his wifes catering so on nearly every day in his life mr polly fell into a violent rage and hatred against the outer world in the afternoon and never suspected that it was this inner world to which i am with such masterly delicacy alluding that was thus reflecting its sinister disorder upon the things without it is a pity that some human beings are not more transparent if mr polly for example had been transparent or even passably translucent then perhaps he might have realised from the laocoon struggle he would have glimpsed that indeed he was not so much a human being as a civil war  wonderful things must have been going on inside mr polly oh wonderful things it must have been like a badly managed industrial city during a period of depression agitators acts of violence strikes the forces of law and order doing their best rushings to and fro upheavals the marseillaise tumbrils the rumble and the thunder of the tumbrils  i do not know why the east wind aggravates life to unhealthy people it made mr pollys teeth seem loose in his head and his skin feel like a misfit and his hair a dry stringy exasperation  why cannot doctors give us an antidote to the east wind  never have the sense to get your hair cut till its too long said mr polly catching sight of his shadow you blighted degenerated paintbrush ugh and he flattened down the projecting tails with an urgent hand   ii  mr pollys age was exactly thirtyfive years and a half he was a short compact figure and a little inclined to a localised embonpoint his face was not unpleasing the features fine but a trifle too pointed about the nose to be classically perfect the corners of his sensitive mouth were depressed his eyes were ruddy brown and troubled and the left one was round with more of wonder in it than its fellow his complexion was dull and yellowish that as i have explained on account of those civil disturbances he was in the technical sense of the word clean shaved with a small sallow patch under the right ear and a cut on the chin his brow had the little puckerings of a thoroughly discontented man little wrinklings and lumps particularly over his right eye and he sat with his hands in his pockets a little askew on the stile and swung one leg hole he repeated presently  he broke into a quavering song roootten beeastly silly hole  his voice thickened with rage and the rest of his discourse was marred by an unfortunate choice of epithets  he was dressed in a shabby black morning coat and vest the braid that bound these garments was a little loose in places his collar was chosen from stock and with projecting corners technically a wingpoke that and his tie which was new and loose and rich in colouring had been selected to encourage and stimulate customersfor he dealt in gentlemens outfitting his golf cap which was also from stock and aslant over his eye gave his misery a desperate touch he wore brown leather bootsbecause he hated the smell of blacking  perhaps after all it was not simply indigestion that troubled him  behind the superficialities of mr pollys being moved a larger and vaguer distress the elementary education he had acquired had left him with the impression that arithmetic was a fluky science and best avoided in practical affairs but even the absence of bookkeeping and a total inability to distinguish between capital and interest could not blind him for ever to the fact that the little shop in the high street was not paying an absence of returns a constriction of credit a depleted till the most valiant resolves to keep smiling could not prevail for ever against these insistent phenomena one might bustle about in the morning before dinner and in the afternoon after tea and forget that huge dark cloud of insolvency that gathered and spread in the background but it was part of the desolation of these afternoon periods these grey spaces of time after meals when all ones courage had descended to the unseen battles of the pit that life seemed stripped to the bone and one saw with a hopeless clearness  let me tell the history of mr polly from the cradle to these present difficulties  first the infant mewling and puking in its nurses arms  there had been a time when two people had thought mr polly the most wonderful and adorable thing in the world had kissed his toenails saying myum myum and marvelled at the exquisite softness and delicacy of his hair had called to one another to remark the peculiar distinction with which he bubbled had disputed whether the sound he had made was just da da or truly and intentionally dadda had washed him in the utmost detail and wrapped him up in soft warm blankets and smothered him with kisses a regal time that was and four and thirty years ago and a merciful forgetfulness barred mr polly from ever bringing its careless luxury its autocratic demands and instant obedience into contrast with his present condition of life these two people had worshipped him from the crown of his head to the soles of his exquisite feet and also they had fed him rather unwisely for no one had ever troubled to teach his mother anything about the mysteries of a childs upbringingthough of course the monthly nurse and her charwoman gave some valuable hintsand by his fifth birthday the perfect rhythms of his nice new interior were already darkened with perplexity   his mother died when he was seven  he began only to have distinctive memories of himself in the time when his education had already begun  i remember seeing a picture of educationin some place i think it was education but quite conceivably it represented the empire teaching her sons and i have a strong impression that it was a wall painting upon some public building in manchester or birmingham or glasgow but very possibly i am mistaken about that it represented a glorious woman with a wise and fearless face stooping over her children and pointing them to far horizons the sky displayed the pearly warmth of a summer dawn and all the painting was marvellously bright as if with the youth and hope of the delicately beautiful children in the foreground she was telling them one felt of the great prospect of life that opened before them of the spectacle of the world the splendours of sea and mountain they might travel and see the joys of skill they might acquire of effort and the pride of effort and the devotions and nobilities it was theirs to achieve perhaps even she whispered of the warm triumphant mystery of love that comes at last to those who have patience and unblemished hearts she was reminding them of their great heritage as english children rulers of more than onefifth of mankind of the obligation to do and be the best that such a pride of empire entails of their essential nobility and knighthood and the restraints and the charities and the disciplined strength that is becoming in knights and rulers  the education of mr polly did not follow this picture very closely he went for some time to a national school which was run on severely economical lines to keep down the rates by a largely untrained staff he was set sums to do that he did not understand and that no one made him understand he was made to read the catechism and bible with the utmost industry and an entire disregard of punctuation or significance and caused to imitate writing copies and drawing copies and given object lessons upon sealing wax and silkworms and potato bugs and ginger and iron and such like things and taught various other subjects his mind refused to entertain and afterwards when he was about twelve he was jerked by his parent to finish off in a private school of dingy aspect and still dingier pretensions where there were no object lessons and the studies of bookkeeping and french were pursued but never effectually overtaken under the guidance of an elderly gentleman who wore a nondescript gown and took snuff wrote copperplate explained nothing and used a cane with remarkable dexterity and gusto  mr polly went into the national school at six and he left the private school at fourteen and by that time his mind was in much the same state that you would be in dear reader if you were operated upon for appendicitis by a wellmeaning boldly enterprising but rather overworked and underpaid butcher boy who was superseded towards the climax of the operation by a lefthanded clerk of high principles but intemperate habitsthat is to say it was in a thorough mess the nice little curiosities and willingnesses of a child were in a jumbled and thwarted condition hacked and cut aboutthe operators had left so to speak all their sponges and ligatures in the mangled confusionand mr polly had lost much of his natural confidence so far as figures and sciences and languages and the possibilities of learning things were concerned he thought of the present world no longer as a wonderland of experiences but as geography and history as the repeating of names that were hard to pronounce and lists of products and populations and heights and lengths and as lists and datesoh and boredom indescribable he thought of religion as the recital of more or less incomprehensible words that were hard to remember and of the divinity as of a limitless being having the nature of a schoolmaster and making infinite rules known and unknown rules that were always ruthlessly enforced and with an infinite capacity for punishment and most horrible of all to think of limitless powers of espial so to the best of his ability he did not think of that unrelenting eye he was uncertain about the spelling and pronunciation of most of the words in our beautiful but abundant and perplexing tonguethat especially was a pity because words attracted him and under happier conditions he might have used them wellhe was always doubtful whether it was eight sevens or nine eights that was sixtythreehe knew no method for settling the difficulty and he thought the merit of a drawing consisted in the care with which it was lined in lining in bored him beyond measure  but the indigestions of mind and body that were to play so large a part in his subsequent career were still only beginning his liver and his gastric juice his wonder and imagination kept up a fight against the things that threatened to overwhelm soul and body together outside the regions devastated by the school curriculum he was still intensely curious he had cheerful phases of enterprise and about thirteen he suddenly discovered reading and its joys he began to read stories voraciously and books of travel provided they were also adventurous he got these chiefly from the local institute and he also took in irregularly but thoroughly one of those inspiring weeklies that dull people used to call penny dreadfuls admirable weeklies crammed with imagination that the cheap boys comics of today have replaced at fourteen when he emerged from the valley of the shadow of education there survived something indeed it survived still obscured and thwarted at five and thirty that pointednot with a visible and prevailing finger like the finger of that beautiful woman in the picture but pointed neverthelessto the idea that there was interest and happiness in the world deep in the being of mr polly deep in that darkness like a creature which has been beaten about the head and left for dead but still lives crawled a persuasion that over and above the things that are jolly and bits of all right there was beauty there was delight that somewheremagically inaccessible perhaps but still somewhere were pure and easy and joyous states of body and mind  he would sneak out on moonless winter nights and stare up at the stars and afterwards find it difficult to tell his father where he had been  he would read tales about hunters and explorers and imagine himself riding mustangs as fleet as the wind across the prairies of western america or coming as a conquering and adored white man into the swarming villages of central africa he shot bears with a revolvera cigarette in the other handand made a necklace of their teeth and claws for the chiefs beautiful young daughter also he killed a lion with a pointed stake stabbing through the beasts heart as it stood over him  he thought it would be splendid to be a diver and go down into the dark green mysteries of the sea  he led stormers against wellnigh impregnable forts and died on the ramparts at the moment of victory his grave was watered by a nations tears  he rammed and torpedoed ships one against ten  he was beloved by queens in barbaric lands and reconciled whole nations to the christian faith  he was martyred and took it very calmly and beautifullybut only once or twice after the revivalist week it did not become a habit with him  he explored the amazon and found newly exposed by the fall of a great tree a rock of gold  engaged in these pursuits he would neglect the work immediately in hand sitting somewhat slackly on the form and projecting himself in a manner tempting to a schoolmaster with a cane and twice he had books confiscated  recalled to the realities of life he would rub himself or sigh deeply as the occasion required and resume his attempts to write as good as copperplate he hated writing the ink always crept up his fingers and the smell of ink offended him and he was filled with unexpressed doubts why should writing slope down from right to left why should downstrokes be thick and upstrokes thin why should the handle of ones pen point over ones right shoulder  his copy books towards the end foreshadowed his destiny and took the form of commercial documents dear sir they ran referring to your esteemed order of the 26th ult we beg to inform you and so on  the compression of mr pollys mind and soul in the educational institutions of his time was terminated abruptly by his father between his fourteenth and fifteenth birthday his fatherwho had long since forgotten the time when his sons little limbs seemed to have come straight from gods hand and when he had kissed five minute toenails in a rapture of loving tendernessremarked  its time that dratted boy did something for a living  and a month or so later mr polly began that career in business that led him at last to the sole proprietorship of a bankrupt outfitters shopand to the stile on which he was sitting   iii  mr polly was not naturally interested in hosiery and gentlemens outfitting at times indeed he urged himself to a spurious curiosity about that trade but presently something more congenial came along and checked the effort he was apprenticed in one of those large rather lowclass establishments which sell everything from pianos and furniture to books and millinery a department store in fact the port burdock drapery bazaar at port burdock one of the three townships that are grouped around the port burdock naval dockyards there he remained six years he spent most of the time inattentive to business in a sort of uncomfortable happiness increasing his indigestion  on the whole he preferred business to school the hours were longer but the tension was not nearly so great the place was better aired you were not kept in for no reason at all and the cane was not employed you watched the growth of your moustache with interest and impatience and mastered the beginnings of social intercourse you talked and found there were things amusing to say also you had regular pocket money and a voice in the purchase of your clothes and presently a small salary and there were girls and friendship in the retrospect port burdock sparkled with the facets of quite a cluster of remembered jolly times  didnt save much money though said mr polly  the first apprentices dormitory was a long bleak room with six beds six chests of drawers and looking glasses and a number of boxes of wood or tin it opened into a still longer and bleaker room of eight beds and this into a third apartment with yellow grained paper and american cloth tables which was the diningroom by day and the mens sittingand smokingroom after nine here mr polly who had been an only child first tasted the joys of social intercourse at first there were attempts to bully him on account of his refusal to consider face washing a diurnal duty but two fights with the apprentices next above him established a useful reputation for choler and the presence of girl apprentices in the shop somehow raised his standard of cleanliness to a more acceptable level he didnt of course have very much to do with the feminine staff in his department but he spoke to them casually as he traversed foreign parts of the bazaar or got out of their way politely or helped them to lift down heavy boxes and on such occasions he felt their scrutiny except in the course of business or at meal times the men and women of the establishment had very little opportunity of meeting the men were in their rooms and the girls in theirs yet these feminine creatures at once so near and so remote affected him profoundly he would watch them going to and fro and marvel secretly at the beauty of their hair or the roundness of their necks or the warm softness of their cheeks or the delicacy of their hands he would fall into passions for them at dinner time and try and show devotions by his manner of passing the bread and margarine at tea there was a very fairhaired fairskinned apprentice in the adjacent haberdashery to whom he said goodmorning every morning and for a period it seemed to him the most significant event in his day when she said i do hope it will be fine tomorrow he felt it marked an epoch he had had no sisters and was innately disposed to worship womankind but he did not betray as much to platt and parsons  to platt and parsons he affected an attitude of seasoned depravity towards womankind platt and parsons were his contemporary apprentices in departments of the drapery shop and the three were drawn together into a close friendship by the fact that all their names began with p they decided they were the three ps and went about together of an evening with the bearing of desperate dogs sometimes when they had money they went into public houses and had drinks then they would become more desperate than ever and walk along the pavement under the gas lamps arm in arm singing platt had a good tenor voice and had been in a church choir and so he led the singing parsons had a serviceable bellow which roared and faded and roared again very wonderfully mr pollys share was an extraordinary lowing noise a sort of flat recitative which he called singing seconds they would have sung catches if they had known how to do it but as it was they sang melancholy music hall songs about dying soldiers and the old folks far away  they would sometimes go into the quieter residential quarters of port burdock where policemen and other obstacles were infrequent and really let their voices soar like hawks and feel very happy the dogs of the district would be stirred to hopeless emulation and would keep it up for long after the three ps had been swallowed up by the night one jealous brute of an irish terrier made a gallant attempt to bite parsons but was beaten by numbers and solidarity  the three ps took the utmost interest in each other and found no other company so good they talked about everything in the world and would go on talking in their dormitory after the gas was out until the other men were reduced to throwing boots they skulked from their departments in the slack hours of the afternoon to gossip in the packingroom of the warehouse on sundays and bank holidays they went for long walks together talking  platt was whitefaced and dark and disposed to undertones and mystery and a curiosity about society and the demimonde he kept himself au courant by reading a penny paper of infinite suggestion called modern society parsons was of an ampler build already promising fatness with curly hair and a lot of rolling rollicking curly features and a large blobshaped nose he had a great memory and a real interest in literature he knew great portions of shakespeare and milton by heart and would recite them at the slightest provocation he read everything he could get hold of and if he liked it he read it aloud it did not matter who else liked it at first mr polly was disposed to be suspicious of this literature but was carried away by parsons enthusiasm the three ps went to a performance of romeo and juliet at the port burdock theatre royal and hung over the gallery fascinated after that they made a sort of password of do you bite your thumbs at us sir  to which the countersign was we bite our thumbs  for weeks the glory of shakespeares verona lit mr pollys life he walked as though he carried a sword at his side and swung a mantle from his shoulders he went through the grimy streets of port burdock with his eye on the first floor windowslooking for balconies a ladder in the yard flooded his mind with romantic ideas then parsons discovered an italian writer whose name mr polly rendered as bocashieu and after some excursions into that authors remains the talk of parsons became infested with the word amours and mr polly would stand in front of his hosiery fixtures trifling with paper and string and thinking of perennial picnics under dark olive trees in the everlasting sunshine of italy  and about that time it was that all three ps adopted turndown collars and large loose artistic silk ties which they tied very much on one side and wore with an air of defiance and a certain swashbuckling carriage  and then came the glorious revelation of that great frenchman whom mr polly called rabooloose the three ps thought the birth feast of gargantua the most glorious piece of writing in the world and i am not certain they were wrong and on wet sunday evenings where there was danger of hymn singing they would get parsons to read it aloud  towards the several members of the y m c a who shared the dormitory the three ps always maintained a sarcastic and defiant attitude  we got a perfect right to do what we like in our corner platt maintained you do what you like in yours  but the language objected morrison the whitefaced earnesteyed improver who was leading a profoundly religious life under great difficulties  language man roared parsons why its literature  sunday isnt the time for literature  its the only time weve got and besides  the horrors of religious controversy would begin  mr polly stuck loyally to the three ps but in the secret places of his heart he was torn a fire of conviction burnt in morrisons eyes and spoke in his urgent persuasive voice he lived the better life manifestly chaste in word and deed industrious studiously kindly when the junior apprentice had sore feet and homesickness morrison washed the feet and comforted the heart and he helped other men to get through with their work when he might have gone early a superhuman thing to do polly was secretly a little afraid to be left alone with this man and the power of the spirit that was in him he felt watched  platt also struggling with things his mind could not contrive to reconcile said that confounded hypocrite  hes no hypocrite said parsons hes no hypocrite o man but hes got no blessed joy de vive thats whats wrong with him lets go down to the harbour arms and see some of those blessed old captains getting drunk  short of sugar o man said mr polly slapping his trouser pocket  oh carm on said parsons always do it on tuppence for a bitter  lemme get my pipe on said platt who had recently taken to smoking with great ferocity then im with you  pause and struggle  dont ram it down o man said parsons watching with knitted brows dont ram it down give it air seen my stick o man right o  and leaning on his cane he composed himself in an attitude of sympathetic patience towards platts incendiary efforts   iv  jolly days of companionship they were for the incipient bankrupt on the stile to look back upon  the interminable working hours of the bazaar had long since faded from his memoryexcept for one or two conspicuous rows and one or two larksbut the rare sundays and holidays shone out like diamonds among pebbles they shone with the mellow splendour of evening skies reflected in calm water and athwart them all went old parsons bellowing an interpretation of life gesticulating appreciating and making appreciate expounding books talking of that mystery of his the joy de vive  there were some particularly splendid walks on bank holidays the three ps would start on sunday morning early and find a room in some modest inn and talk themselves asleep and return singing through the night or having an argy bargy about the stars on monday evening they would come over the hills out of the pleasant english countryside in which they had wandered and see port burdock spread out below a network of interlacing street lamps and shifting tram lights against the black beacongemmed immensity of the harbour waters  back to the collar o man parsons would say there is no satisfactory plural to o man so he always used it in the singular  dont mention it said platt  and once they got a boat for the whole summer day and rowed up past the moored ironclads and the black old hulks and the various shipping of the harbour past a white troopship and past the trim front and the ships and interesting vistas of the dockyard to the shallow channels and rocky weedy wildernesses of the upper harbour and parsons and mr polly had a great dispute and quarrel that day as to how far a big gun could shoot  the country over the hills behind port burdock is all that an oldfashioned scarcely disturbed english countryside should be in those days the bicycle was still rare and costly and the motor car had yet to come and stir up rural serenities the three ps would take footpaths haphazard across fields and plunge into unknown winding lanes between high hedges of honeysuckle and dogrose greatly daring they would follow green bridle paths through primrose studded undergrowths or wander waist deep in the bracken of beech woods about twenty miles from port burdock there came a region of hop gardens and hoast crowned farms and further on to be reached only by cheap tickets at bank holiday times was a sterile ridge of very clean roads and red sand pits and pines and gorse and heather the three ps could not afford to buy bicycles and they found boots the greatest item of their skimpy expenditure they threw appearances to the winds at last and got readymade workingmens hobnails there was much discussion and strong feeling over this step in the dormitory  there is no countryside like the english countryside for those who have learnt to love it its firm yet gentle lines of hill and dale its ordered confusion of features its deer parks and downland its castles and stately houses its hamlets and old churches its farms and ricks and great barns and ancient trees its pools and ponds and shining threads of rivers its flowerstarred hedgerows its orchards and woodland patches its village greens and kindly inns other countrysides have their pleasant aspects but none such variety none that shine so steadfastly throughout the year picardy is pink and white and pleasant in the blossom time burgundy goes on with its sunshine and wide hillsides and cramped vineyards a beautiful tune repeated and repeated italy gives salitas and wayside chapels and chestnuts and olive orchards the ardennes has its woods and gorgestouraine and the rhineland the wide campagna with its distant apennines and the neat prosperities and mountain backgrounds of south germany all clamour their especial merits at ones memory and there are the hills and fields of virginia like an england grown very big and slovenly the woods and big river sweeps of pennsylvania the trim new england landscape a little bleak and rather fine like the new england mind and the wide rough country roads and hills and woodland of new york state but none of these change scene and character in three miles of walking nor have so mellow a sunlight nor so diversified a cloudland nor confess the perpetual refreshment of the strong soft winds that blow from off the sea as our mother england does  it was good for the three ps to walk through such a land and forget for a time that indeed they had no footing in it all that they were doomed to toil behind counters in such places as port burdock for the better part of their lives they would forget the customers and shopwalkers and department buyers and everything and become just happy wanderers in a world of pleasant breezes and song birds and shady trees  the arrival at the inn was a great affair no one they were convinced would take them for drapers and there might be a pretty serving girl or a jolly old lady or what parsons called a bit of character drinking in the bar  there would always be weighty enquiries as to what they could have and it would work out always at cold beef and pickles or fried ham and eggs and shandygaff two pints of beer and two bottles of ginger beer foaming in a huge roundbellied jug  the glorious moment of standing lordly in the inn doorway and staring out at the world the swinging sign the geese upon the green the duckpond a waiting waggon the church tower a sleepy cat the blue heavens with the sizzle of the frying audible behind one the keen smell of the bacon the trotting of feet bearing the repast the click and clatter as the tableware is finally arranged a clean white cloth  ready sir or ready gentlemen better hearing that than forward polly look sharp  the going in the sitting down the falling to  bread o man  right o dont bag all the crust o man  once a simple mannered girl in a pink print dress stayed and talked with them as they ate led by the gallant parsons they professed to be all desperately in love with her and courted her to say which she preferred of them it was so manifest she did prefer one and so impossible to say which it was held her there until a distant maternal voice called her away afterwards as they left the inn she waylaid them at the orchard corner and gave them a little shyly three keen yellowgreen applesand wished them to come again some day and vanished and reappeared looking after them as they turned the cornerwaving a white handkerchief all the rest of that day they disputed over the signs of her favour and the next sunday they went there again  but she had vanished and a mother of forbidding aspect afforded no explanations  if platt and parsons and mr polly live to be a hundred they will none of them forget that girl as she stood with a pink flush upon her faintly smiling and yet earnest parting the branches of the hedgerows and reaching down apple in hand which of them was it had caught her spirit to attend to them  and once they went along the coast following it as closely as possible and so came at last to foxbourne that easternmost suburb of brayling and hampstedonthesea  foxbourne seemed a very jolly little place to mr polly that afternoon it has a clean sandy beach instead of the mud and pebbles and coaly défilements of port burdock a row of six bathing machines and a shelter on the parade in which the three ps sat after a satisfying but rather expensive lunch that had included celery rows of verandahed villas proffered apartments they had feasted in an hotel with a porch painted white and gay with geraniums above and the high street with the old church at the head had been full of an agreeable afternoon stillness  nice little place for business said platt sagely from behind his big pipe  it stuck in mr pollys memory   v  mr polly was not so picturesque a youth as parsons he lacked richness in his voice and went about in those days with his hands in his pockets looking quietly speculative  he specialised in slang and the disuse of english and he played the rôle of an appreciative stimulant to parsons words attracted him curiously words rich in suggestion and he loved a novel and striking phrase his school training had given him little or no mastery of the mysterious pronunciation of english and no confidence in himself his schoolmaster indeed had been both unsound and variable new words had terror and fascination for him he did not acquire them he could not avoid them and so he plunged into them his only rule was not to be misled by the spelling that was no guide anyhow he avoided every recognised phrase in the language and mispronounced everything in order that he shouldnt be suspected of ignorance but whim  sesquippledan he would say sesquippledan verboojuice  eh said platt  eloquent rapsodooce  where asked platt  in the warehouse o man all among the tablecloths and blankets carlyle hes reading aloud doing the high froth spuming windmilling waw waw its a sight worth seeing hell bark his blessed knuckles one of these days on the fixtures o man  he held an imaginary book in one hand and waved an eloquent gesture so too shall every hero inasmuch as notwithstanding for evermore come back to reality he parodied the enthusiastic parsons so that in fashion and thereby upon things and not under things articulariously he stands  i should laugh if the governor dropped on him said platt hed never hear him coming  the o mans drunk with itfair drunk said polly i never did its worse than when he got on to raboloose    chapter the second  the dismissal of parsons   i  suddenly parsons got himself dismissed  he got himself dismissed under circumstances of peculiar violence that left a deep impression on mr pollys mind he wondered about it for years afterwards trying to get the rights of the case  parsons apprenticeship was over he had reached the status of an improver and he dressed the window of the manchester department by all the standards available he dressed it very well by his own standards he dressed it wonderfully well o man he used to say theres one thing about my position herei can dress a window  and when trouble was under discussion he would hold that little fluffumswhich was the apprentices name for mr garvace the senior partner and managing director of the bazaarwould think twice before he got rid of the only man in the place who could make a windowful of manchester goods tell  then like many a fellow artist he fell a prey to theories  the art of window dressing is in its infancy o manin its blooming infancy all balance and stiffness like a blessed egyptian picture no joy in it no blooming joy conventional a shop window ought to get hold of people grip em as they go along it stands to reason grip  his voice would sink to a kind of quiet bellow do they grip  then after a pause a savage roar naw  hes got a heavy on said mr polly go it o man lets have some more of it  look at old morrisons dressstuff windows tidy tasteful correct i grant you but bleak he let out the word reinforced to a shout bleak  bleak echoed mr polly  just pieces of stuff in rows rows of tidy little puffs perhaps one bit just unrolled quiet tickets  might as well be in church o man said mr polly  a window ought to be exciting said parsons it ought to make you say ello when you see it  he paused and platt watched him over a snorting pipe  rockcockyo said mr polly  we want a new school of window dressing said parsons regardless of the comment a new school the port burdock school day after tomorrow i change the fitzallan street stuff this time its going to be a change i mean to have a crowd or bust  and as a matter of fact he did both  his voice dropped to a note of selfreproach ive been timid o man ive been holding myself in i havent done myself justice ive kept down the simmering seething teeming ideas all thats over now  over gulped polly  over for good and all o man   ii  platt came to polly who was sorting up collar boxes o mans doing his blooming window  what window  what he said  polly remembered  he went on with his collar boxes with his eye on his senior mansfield mansfield was presently called away to the counting house and instantly polly shot out by the street door and made a rapid transit along the street front past the manchester window and so into the silkroom door he could not linger long but he gathered joy a swift and fearful joy from his brief inspection of parsons unconscious back parsons had his tail coat off and was working with vigour his habit of pulling his waistcoat straps to the utmost brought out all the agreeable promise of corpulence in his youthful frame he was blowing excitedly and running his fingers through his hair and then moving with all the swift eagerness of a man inspired all about his feet and knees were scarlet blankets not folded not formally unfolded butthe only phrase isshied about and a great bar sinister of roller towelling stretched across the front of the window on which was a ticket and the ticket said in bold black letters look  so soon as mr polly got into the silk department and met platt he knew he had not lingered nearly long enough outside did you see the boards at the back said platt  he hadnt the high egrugious is fairly on he said and dived down to return by devious subterranean routes to the outfitting department  presently the street door opened and platt with an air of intense devotion to business assumed to cover his adoption of that unusual route came in and made for the staircase down to the warehouse he rolled up his eyes at polly oh lor he said and vanished  irresistible curiosity seized polly should he go through the shop to the manchester department or risk a second transit outside  he was impelled to make a dive at the street door  where are you going asked mansfield  lill dog said polly with an air of lucid explanation and left him to get any meaning he could from it  parsons was worth the subsequent trouble parsons really was extremely rich this time polly stopped to take it in  parsons had made a huge symmetrical pile of thick white and red blankets twisted and rolled to accentuate their woolly richness heaped up in a warm disorder with large window tickets inscribed in blazing red letters cosy comfort at cut prices and curl up and cuddle below cost regardless of the daylight he had turned up the electric light on that side of the window to reflect a warm glow upon the heap and behind in pursuit of contrasted bleakness he was now hanging long strips of grey silesia and chilly coloured linen dusterings  it was wonderful but  mr polly decided that it was time he went in he found platt in the silk department apparently on the verge of another plunge into the exterior world cosy comfort at cut prices said polly allittritions artful aid  he did not dare go into the street for the third time and he was hovering feverishly near the window when he saw the governor mr garvace that is to say the managing director of the bazaar walking along the pavement after his manner to assure himself all was well with the establishment he guided  mr garvace was a short stout man with that air of modest pride that so often goes with corpulence choleric and decisive in manner and with hands that looked like bunches of fingers he was redhaired and ruddy and after the custom of such complexions hairs sprang from the tip of his nose when he wished to bring the power of the human eye to bear upon an assistant he projected his chest knitted one brow and partially closed the left eyelid  an expression of speculative wonder overspread the countenance of mr polly he felt he must see yes whatever happened he must see  want to speak to parsons sir he said to mr mansfield and deserted his post hastily dashed through the intervening departments and was in position behind a pile of bolton sheeting as the governor came in out of the street  what on earth do you think you are doing with that window parsons began mr garvace  only the legs of parsons and the lower part of his waistcoat and an intervening inch of shirt were visible he was standing inside the window on the steps hanging up the last strip of his background from the brass rail along the ceiling within the manchester shop window was cut off by a partition rather like the partition of an oldfashioned church pew from the general space of the shop there was a panelled barrier that is to say with a little door like a pew door in it parsons face appeared staring with round eyes at his employer  mr garvace had to repeat his question  dressing it siron new lines  come out of it said mr garvace  parsons stared and mr garvace had to repeat his command  parsons with a dazed expression began to descend the steps slowly  mr garvace turned about wheres morrison morrison  morrison appeared  take this window over said mr garvace pointing his bunch of fingers at parsons take all this muddle out and dress it properly  morrison advanced and hesitated  i beg your pardon sir said parsons with an immense politeness but this is my window  take it all out said mr garvace turning away  morrison advanced parsons shut the door with a click that arrested mr garvace  come out of that window he said you cant dress it if you want to play the fool with a window  this windows all right said the genius in window dressing and there was a little pause  open the door and go right in said mr garvace to morrison  you leave that door alone morrison said parsons  polly was no longer even trying to hide behind the stack of bolton sheetings he realised he was in the presence of forces too stupendous to heed him  get him out said mr garvace  morrison seemed to be thinking out the ethics of his position the idea of loyalty to his employer prevailed with him he laid his hand on the door to open it parsons tried to disengage his hand mr garvace joined his effort to morrisons then the heart of polly leapt and the world blazed up to wonder and splendour parsons disappeared behind the partition for a moment and reappeared instantly gripping a thin cylinder of rolled huckaback with this he smote at morrisons head morrisons head ducked under the resounding impact but he clung on and so did mr garvace the door came open and then mr garvace was staggering back hand to head his autocratic his sacred baldness smitten parsons was beyond all controla strangeness a marvel heaven knows how the artistic struggle had strained that richly endowed temperament say i cant dress a window you thundering old humbug he said and hurled the huckaback at his master he followed this up by hurling first a blanket then an armful of silesia then a window support out of the window into the shop it leapt into pollys mind that parsons hated his own effort and was glad to demolish it for a crowded second pollys mind was concentrated upon parsons infuriated active like a figure of earthquake with its coat off shying things headlong  then he perceived the back of mr garvace and heard his gubernatorial voice crying to no one in particular and everybody in general get him out of the window hes mad hes dangerous get him out of the window  then a crimson blanket was for a moment over the head of mr garvace and his voice muffled for an instant broke out into unwonted expletive  then people had arrived from all parts of the bazaar luck the ledger clerk blundered against polly and said help him somerville from the silks vaulted the counter and seized a chair by the back polly lost his head he clawed at the bolton sheeting before him and if he could have detached a piece he would certainly have hit somebody with it as it was he simply upset the pile it fell away from polly and he had an impression of somebody squeaking as it went down it was the sort of impression one disregards the collapse of the pile of goods just sufficed to end his subconscious efforts to get something to hit somebody with and his whole attention focussed itself upon the struggle in the window for a splendid instant parsons towered up over the active backs that clustered about the shop window door an active whirl of gesture tearing things down and throwing them and then he went under there was an instants furious struggle a crash a second crash and the crack of broken plate glass then a stillness and heavy breathing  parsons was overpowered  polly stepping over scattered pieces of bolton sheeting saw his transfigured friend with a dark cut that was not at present bleeding on the forehead one arm held by somerville and the other by morrison  youyouyouyou annoyed me said parsons sobbing for breath   iii  there are events that detach themselves from the general stream of occurrences and seem to partake of the nature of revelations such was this parsons affair it began by seeming grotesque it ended disconcertingly the fabric of mr pollys daily life was torn and beneath it he discovered depths and terrors  life was not altogether a lark  the calling in of a policeman seemed at the moment a pantomime touch but when it became manifest that mr garvace was in a fury of vindictiveness the affair took on a different complexion the way in which the policeman made a note of everything and aspirated nothing impressed the sensitive mind of polly profoundly polly presently found himself straightening up ties to the refrain of e then it you on the ed and  in the dormitory that night parsons had become heroic he sat on the edge of the bed with his head bandaged packing very slowly and insisting over and again he ought to have left my window alone o man he didnt ought to have touched my window  polly was to go to the police court in the morning as a witness the terror of that ordeal almost overshadowed the tragic fact that parsons was not only summoned for assault but swapped and packing his box polly knew himself well enough to know he would make a bad witness he felt sure of one fact only namely that e then it im on the ed and all the rest danced about in his mind now and how it would dance about on the morrow heaven only knew would there be a crossexamination is it perjoocery to make a slip people did sometimes perjuice themselves serious offence  platt was doing his best to help parsons and inciting public opinion against morrison but parsons would not hear of anything against morrison he was all right o manaccording to his lights said parsons it isnt him i complain of  he speculated on the morrow i shall ave to pay a fine he said no good trying to get out of it its true i hit him i hit himhe paused and seemed to be seeking an exquisite accuracy his voice sank to a confidential noteon the headabout here  he answered the suggestion of a bright junior apprentice in a corner of the dormitory whats the good of a cross summons he replied with old corks the chemist and mottishead the house agent and all that lot on the bench humble pie thats my meal tomorrow o man humble pie  packing went on for a time  but lord what a life it is said parsons giving his deep notes scope tenthirtyfive a man trying to do his duty mistaken perhaps but trying his best tenfortyruined ruined he lifted his voice to a shout ruined and dropped it to like an earthquake  heated altaclation said polly  like a blooming earthquake said parsons with the notes of a rising wind  he meditated gloomily upon his future and a colder chill invaded pollys mind likely to get another crib aint iwith assaulted the guvnor on my reference i suppose though he wont give me refs hard enough to get a crib at the best of times said parsons  you ought to go round with a show o man said mr polly  things were not so dreadful in the police court as mr polly had expected he was given a seat with other witnesses against the wall of the court and after an interesting larceny case parsons appeared and stood not in the dock but at the table by that time mr pollys legs which had been tucked up at first under his chair out of respect to the court were extended straight before him and his hands were in his trouser pockets he was inventing names for the four magistrates on the bench and had got to the grave and reverend signor with the palatial boko when his thoughts were recalled to gravity by the sound of his name he rose with alacrity and was fielded by an expert policeman from a brisk attempt to get into the vacant dock the clerk to the justices repeated the oath with incredible rapidity  right o said mr polly but quite respectfully and kissed the book  his evidence was simple and quite audible after one warning from the superintendent of police to speak up he tried to put in a good word for parsons by saying he was naturally of a choleraic disposition but the start and the slow grin of enjoyment upon the face of the grave and reverend signor with the palatial boko suggested that the word was not so good as he had thought it the rest of the bench was frankly puzzled and there were hasty consultations  you mean e as a ot temper said the presiding magistrate  i mean e as a ot temper replied polly magically incapable of aspirates for the moment  you dont mean e ketches cholera  i meanhes easily put out  then why cant you say so said the presiding magistrate  parsons was bound over  he came for his luggage while every one was in the shop and garvace would not let him invade the business to say goodby when mr polly went upstairs for margarine and bread and tea he slipped on into the dormitory at once to see what was happening further in the parsons case but parsons had vanished there was no parsons no trace of parsons his cubicle was swept and garnished for the first time in his life polly had a sense of irreparable loss  a minute or so after platt dashed in  ugh he said and then discovered polly polly was leaning out of the window and did not look around platt went up to him  hes gone already said platt might have stopped to say goodby to a chap  there was a little pause before polly replied he thrust his finger into his mouth and gulped  bit on that beastly tooth of mine he said still not looking at platt its made my eyes water something chronic any one might think id been doing a blooming pipe by the look of me    chapter the third  cribs   i  port burdock was never the same place for mr polly after parsons had left it there were no chest notes in his occasional letters and little of the joy de vive got through by them parsons had gone he said to london and found a place as warehouseman in a cheap outfitting shop near st pauls churchyard where references were not required it became apparent as time passed that new interests were absorbing him he wrote of socialism and the rights of man things that had no appeal for mr polly he felt strangers had got hold of his parsons were at work upon him making him into someone else something less picturesque port burdock became a dreariness full of faded memories of parsons and work a bore platt revealed himself alone as a tiresome companion obsessed by romantic ideas about intrigues and vices and society women  mr pollys depression manifested itself in a general slackness a certain impatience in the manner of mr garvace presently got upon his nerves relations were becoming strained he asked for a rise of salary to test his position and gave notice to leave when it was refused  it took him two months to place himself in another situation and during that time he had quite a disagreeable amount of loneliness disappointment anxiety and humiliation  he went at first to stay with a married cousin who had a house at easewood his widowed father had recently given up the music and bicycle shop with the post of organist at the parish church that had sustained his home and was living upon a small annuity as a guest with this cousin and growing a little tiresome on account of some mysterious internal discomfort that the local practitioner diagnosed as imagination he had aged with mysterious rapidity and become excessively irritable but the cousins wife was a born manager and contrived to get along with him our mr pollys status was that of a guest pure and simple but after a fortnight of congested hospitality in which he wrote nearly a hundred letters beginning  sir  referring to your advt in the christian world for an improver in gents outfitting i beg to submit myself for the situation have had six years experience  and upset a bottle of ink over a toilet cover and the bedroom carpet his cousin took him for a walk and pointed out the superior advantages of apartments in london from which to swoop upon the briefly yawning vacancy  helpful said mr polly very helpful o man indeed i might have gone on there for weeks and packed  he got a room in an institution that was partly a benevolent hostel for men in his circumstances and partly a high minded but forbidding coffee house and a centre for pleasant sunday afternoons mr polly spent a critical but pleasant sunday afternoon in a back seat inventing such phrases as  soulful owner of the exorbiant largenial developmentan adams apple being in question  earnest joy  exultant urgent loogoobuosity  a manly young curate marking and misunderstanding his preoccupied face and moving lips came and sat by him and entered into conversation with the idea of making him feel more at home the conversation was awkward and disconnected for a minute or so and then suddenly a memory of the port burdock bazaar occurred to mr polly and with a baffling whisper of lill dog and a reassuring nod he rose up and escaped to wander out relieved and observant into the varied london streets  he found the collection of men he found waiting about in wholesale establishments in wood street and st pauls churchyard where they interview the buyers who have come up from the country interesting and stimulating but far too strongly charged with the suggestion of his own fate to be really joyful there were men in all degrees between confidence and distress and in every stage between extravagant smartness and the last stages of decay there were sunny young men full of an abounding and elbowing energy before whom the soul of polly sank in hate and dismay smart juniors said polly to himself full of smart juniosity the shoveacious cult there were hungry looking individuals of thirtyfive or so that he decided must be proletelerianshe had often wanted to find someone who fitted that attractive word middleaged men too old at forty discoursed in the waitingrooms on the outlook in the trade it had never been so bad they said while mr polly wondered if dejuiced was a permissible epithet there were men with an overweening sense of their importance manifestly annoyed and angry to find themselves still disengaged and inclined to suspect a plot and men so fainthearted one was terrified to imagine their behaviour when it came to an interview there was a freshfaced young man with an unintelligent face who seemed to think himself equipped against the world beyond all misadventure by a collar of exceptional height and another who introduced a note of gaiety by wearing a flannel shirt and a check suit of remarkable virulence every day mr polly looked round to mark how many of the familiar faces had gone and the deepening anxiety reflecting his own on the faces that remained and every day some new type joined the drifting shoal he realised how small a chance his poor letter from easewood ran against this hungry cluster of competitors at the fountain head  at the back of mr pollys mind while he made his observations was a disagreeable flavour of dentists parlour at any moment his name might be shouted and he might have to haul himself into the presence of some fresh specimen of employer and to repeat once more his passionate protestation of interest in the business his possession of a capacity for zealzeal on behalf of anyone who would pay him a yearly salary of twentysix pounds a year  the prospective employer would unfold his ideals of the employee i want a smart willing young man thoroughly willingwho wont object to take trouble i dont want a slacker the sort of fellow who has to be pushed up to his work and held there ive got no use for him  at the back of mr pollys mind and quite beyond his control the insubordinate phrasemaker would be proffering such combinations as chubby chops or chubby charmer as suitable for the gentleman very much as a hat salesman proffers hats  i dont think youd find much slackness about me sir said mr polly brightly trying to disregard his deeper self  i want a young man who means getting on  exactly sir excelsior  i beg your pardon  i said excelsior sir its a sort of motto of mine from longfellow would you want me to serve through  the chubby gentleman explained and reverted to his ideals with a faint air of suspicion do you mean getting on he asked  i hope so sir said mr polly  get on or get out eh  mr polly made a rapturous noise nodded appreciation and said indistinctlyquite my style  some of my people have been with me twenty years said the employer my manchester buyer came to me as a boy of twelve youre a christian  church of england said mr polly  hm said the employer a little checked for good all round business work i should have preferred a baptist still  he studied mr pollys tie which was severely neat and businesslike as became an aspiring outfitter mr pollys conception of his own pose and expression was rendered by that uncontrollable phrasemonger at the back as obsequies deference  i am inclined said the prospective employer in a conclusive manner to look up your reference  mr polly stood up abruptly  thank you said the employer and dismissed him  chump chops how about chump chops said the phrasemonger with an air of inspiration  i hope then to hear from you sir said mr polly in his best salesman manner  if everything is satisfactory said the prospective employer   ii  a man whose brain devotes its hinterland to making odd phrases and nicknames out of illconceived words whose conception of life is a lump of auriferous rock to which all the value is given by rare veins of unbusinesslike joy who reads boccaccio and rabelais and shakespeare with gusto and uses stertoraneous shover and smart junior as terms of bitterest opprobrium is not likely to make a great success under modern business conditions mr polly dreamt always of picturesque and mellow things and had an instinctive hatred of the strenuous life he would have resisted the spell of expresident roosevelt or general baden powell or mr peter keary or the late dr samuel smiles quite easily and he loved falstaff and hudibras and coarse laughter and the old england of washington irving and the memory of charles the seconds courtly days his progress was necessarily slow he did not get rises he lost situations there was something in his eye employers did not like he would have lost his places oftener if he had not been at times an exceptionally brilliant salesman rather carefully neat and a slow but very fair windowdresser  he went from situation to situation he invented a great wealth of nicknames he conceived enmities and made friendsbut none so richly satisfying as parsons he was frequently but mildly and discursively in love and sometimes he thought of that girl who had given him a yellowgreen apple he had an idea amounting to a flattering certainty whose youthful freshness it was had stirred her to selfforgetfulness and sometimes he thought of foxbourne sleeping prosperously in the sun and he began to have moods of discomfort and lassitude and illtemper due to the beginnings of indigestion  various forces and suggestions came into his life and swayed him for longer and shorter periods  he went to canterbury and came under the influence of gothic architecture there was a blood affinity between mr polly and the gothic in the middle ages he would no doubt have sat upon a scaffolding and carved out penetrating and none too flattering portraits of church dignitaries upon the capitals and when he strolled with his hands behind his back along the cloisters behind the cathedral and looked at the rich grass plot in the centre he had the strangest sense of being at homefar more than he had ever been at home before portly capóns he used to murmur to himself under the impression that he was naming a characteristic type of medieval churchman  he liked to sit in the nave during the service and look through the great gates at the candles and choristers and listen to the organsustained voices but the transepts he never penetrated because of the charge for admission the music and the long vista of the fretted roof filled him with a vague and mystical happiness that he had no words even mispronounceable words to express but some of the smug monuments in the aisles got a wreath of epithets metrorious urnfuls funererial claims dejected angelosity for example he wandered about the precincts and speculated about the people who lived in the ripe and cosy houses of grey stone that cluster there so comfortably through green doors in high stone walls he caught glimpses of level lawns and blazing flower beds mullioned windows revealed shaded reading lamps and disciplined shelves of brown bound books now and then a dignitary in gaiters would pass him portly capon or a drift of whiterobed choir boys cross a distant arcade and vanish in a doorway or the pink and cream of some girlish dress flit like a butterfly across the cool still spaces of the place particularly he responded to the ruined arches of the benedictines infirmary and the view of bell harry tower from the school buildings he was stirred to read the canterbury tales but he could not get on with chaucers oldfashioned english it fatigued his attention and he would have given all the story telling very readily for a few adventures on the road he wanted these nice people to live more and yarn less he liked the wife of bath very much he would have liked to have known that woman  at canterbury too he first to his knowledge saw americans  his shop did a good class trade in westgate street and he would see them go by on the way to stare at chaucers chequers and then turn down mercery lane to prior goldstones gate it impressed him that they were always in a kind of quiet hurry and very determined and methodical peoplemuch more so than any english he knew  cultured rapacicity he tried  vorocious return to the heritage  he would expound them incidentally to his attendant apprentices he had overheard a little lady putting her view to a friend near the christchurch gate the accent and intonation had hung in his memory and he would reproduce them more or less accurately now does this marlowe monument really and truly matter he had heard the little lady enquire weve no time for side shows and second rate stunts mamie we want just the big simple things of the place just the broad elemental canterbury praposition what is it saying to us i want to get right hold of that and then have tea in the very room that chaucer did and hustle to get that foureighteen train back to london  he would go over these precious phrases finding them full of an indescribable flavour just the broad elemental canterbury praposition he would repeat  he would try to imagine parsons confronted with americans for his own part he knew himself to be altogether inadequate  canterbury was the most congenial situation mr polly ever found during these wander years albeit a very desert so far as companionship went   iii  it was after canterbury that the universe became really disagreeable to mr polly it was brought home to him not so much vividly as with a harsh and ungainly insistence that he was a failure in his trade it was not the trade he ought to have chosen though what trade he ought to have chosen was by no means clear  he made great but irregular efforts and produced a forced smartness that like a cheap dye refused to stand sunshine he acquired a sort of parsimony also in which acquisition he was helped by one or two phases of absolute impecuniosity but he was hopeless in competition against the naturally gifted the born hustlers the young men who meant to get on  he left the canterbury place very regretfully he and another commercial gentleman took a boat one sunday afternoon at sturryonthestour when the wind was in the west and sailed it very happily eastward for an hour they had never sailed a boat before and it seemed simple and wonderful when they turned they found the river too narrow for tacking and the tide running out like a sluice they battled back to sturry in the course of six hours at a shilling the first hour and sixpence for each hour afterwards rowing a mile in an hour and a half or so until the turn of the tide came to help them and then they had a night walk to canterbury and found themselves remorselessly locked out  the canterbury employer was an amiable religiousspirited man and he would probably not have dismissed mr polly if that unfortunate tendency to phrase things had not shocked him a tides a tide sir said mr polly feeling that things were not so bad ive no luneattic power to alter that  it proved impossible to explain to the canterbury employer that this was not a highly disrespectful and blasphemous remark  and besides what good are you to me this morning do you think said the canterbury employer with your arms pulled out of their sockets  so mr polly resumed his observations in the wood street warehouses once more and had some dismal times the shoal of fish waiting for the crumbs of employment seemed larger than ever  he took counsel with himself should he chuck the outfitting it wasnt any good for him now and presently when he was older and his youthful smartness had passed into the dulness of middle age it would be worse what else could he do  he could think of nothing he went one night to a music hall and developed a vague idea of a comic performance the comic men seemed violent rowdies and not at all funny but when he thought of the great pit of the audience yawning before him he realised that his was an altogether too delicate talent for such a use he was impressed by the charm of selling vegetables by auction in one of those open shops near london bridge but admitted upon reflection his general want of technical knowledge he made some enquiries about emigration but none of the colonies were in want of shop assistants without capital he kept up his attendance in wood street  he subdued his ideal of salary by the sum of five pounds a year and was taken at that into a driving establishment in clapham which dealt chiefly in readymade suits fed its assistants in an underground diningroom and kept them until twelve on saturdays he found it hard to be cheerful there his fits of indigestion became worse and he began to lie awake at night and think sunshine and laughter seemed things lost for ever picnics and shouting in the moonlight  the chief shopwalker took a dislike to him and nagged him nar then polly look alive polly became the burthen of his days as smart a chap as you could have said the chief shopwalker but no zest no zest no vim whats the matter with you  during his night vigils mr polly had a feelinga young rabbit must have very much the feeling when after a youth of gambolling in sunny woods and furtive jolly raids upon the growing wheat and exciting triumphant bolts before ineffectual casual dogs it finds itself at last for a long night of floundering effort and perplexity in a netfor the rest of its life  he could not grasp what was wrong with him he made enormous efforts to diagnose his case was he really just a lazy slacker who ought to buck up he couldnt find it in him to believe it he blamed his father a good dealit is what fathers are forin putting him to a trade he wasnt happy to follow but he found it impossible to say what he ought to have followed he felt there had been something stupid about his school but just where that came in he couldnt say he made some perfectly sincere efforts to buck up and shove ruthlessly but that was infernalimpossible he had to admit himself miserable with all the misery of a social misfit and with no clear prospect of more than the most incidental happiness ahead of him and for all his attempts at selfreproach or selfdiscipline he felt at bottom that he wasnt at fault  as a matter of fact all the elements of his troubles had been adequately diagnosed by a certain highbrowed spectacled gentleman living at highbury wearing a gold pincenez and writing for the most part in the beautiful library of the reform club this gentleman did not know mr polly personally but he had dealt with him generally as one of those illadjusted units that abound in a society that has failed to develop a collective intelligence and a collective will for order commensurate with its complexities  but phrases of that sort had no appeal for mr polly    chapter the fourth  mr polly an orphan   i  then a great change was brought about in the life of mr polly by the death of his father his father had died suddenlythe local practitioner still clung to his theory that it was imagination he suffered from but compromised in the certificate with the appendicitis that was then so fashionableand mr polly found himself heir to a debateable number of pieces of furniture in the house of his cousin near easewood junction a family bible an engraved portrait of garibaldi and a bust of mr gladstone an invalid gold watch a gold locket formerly belonging to his mother some minor jewelry and bricabrac a quantity of nearly valueless old clothes and an insurance policy and money in the bank amounting altogether to the sum of three hundred and ninetyfive pounds  mr polly had always regarded his father as an immortal as an eternal fact and his father being of a reserved nature in his declining years had said nothing about the insurance policy both wealth and bereavement therefore took mr polly by surprise and found him a little inadequate his mothers death had been a childish grief and long forgotten and the strongest affection in his life had been for parsons an only child of sociable tendencies necessarily turns his back a good deal upon home and the aunt who had succeeded his mother was an economist and furniture polisher a knuckle rapper and sharp silencer no friend for a slovenly little boy he had loved other little boys and girls transitorily none had been frequent and familiar enough to strike deep roots in his heart and he had grown up with a tattered and dissipated affectionateness that was becoming wildly shy his father had always been a stranger an irritable stranger with exceptional powers of intervention and comment and an air of being disappointed about his offspring it was shocking to lose him it was like an unexpected hole in the universe and the writing of death upon the sky but it did not tear mr pollys heartstrings at first so much as rouse him to a pitch of vivid attention  he came down to the cottage at easewood in response to an urgent telegram and found his father already dead his cousin johnson received him with much solemnity and ushered him upstairs to look at a stiff straight shrouded form with a face unwontedly quiet and as it seemed with its pinched nostrils scornful  looks peaceful said mr polly disregarding the scorn to the best of his ability  it was a merciful relief said mr johnson  there was a pause  secondsecond departed ive ever seen not counting mummies said mr polly feeling it necessary to say something  we did all we could  no doubt of it o man said mr polly  a second long pause followed and then much to mr pollys great relief johnson moved towards the door  afterwards mr polly went for a solitary walk in the evening light and as he walked suddenly his dead father became real to him he thought of things far away down the perspective of memory of jolly moments when his father had skylarked with a wildly excited little boy of a certain annual visit to the crystal palace pantomime full of trivial glittering incidents and wonders of his fathers dread back while customers were in the old minutely known shop it is curious that the memory which seemed to link him nearest to the dead man was the memory of a fit of passion his father had wanted to get a small sofa up the narrow winding staircase from the little room behind the shop to the bedroom above and it had jammed for a time his father had coaxed and then groaned like a soul in torment and given way to blind fury had sworn kicked and struck at the offending piece of furniture and finally wrenched it upstairs with considerable incidental damage to lath and plaster and one of the castors that moment when selfcontrol was altogether torn aside the shocked discovery of his fathers perfect humanity had left a singular impression on mr pollys queer mind it was as if something extravagantly vital had come out of his father and laid a warmly passionate hand upon his heart he remembered that now very vividly and it became a clue to endless other memories that had else been dispersed and confusing  a weakly wilful being struggling to get obdurate things round impossible cornersin that symbol mr polly could recognise himself and all the trouble of humanity  he hadnt had a particularly good time poor old chap and now it was all over finished  johnson was the sort of man who derives great satisfaction from a funeral a melancholy serious practicalminded man of five and thirty with great powers of advice he was the upline ticket clerk at easewood junction and felt the responsibilities of his position he was naturally thoughtful and reserved and greatly sustained in that by an innate rectitude of body and an overhanging and forward inclination of the upper part of his face and head he was pale but freckled and his dark grey eyes were deeply set his lightest interest was cricket but he did not take that lightly his chief holiday was to go to a cricket match which he did as if he was going to church and he watched critically applauded sparingly and was darkly offended by any unorthodox play his convictions upon all subjects were taciturnly inflexible he was an obstinate player of draughts and chess and an earnest and persistent reader of the british weekly his wife was a pink short wilfully smiling managing ingratiating talkative woman who was determined to be pleasant and take a bright hopeful view of everything even when it was not really bright and hopeful she had large blue expressive eyes and a round face and she always spoke of her husband as harold she addressed sympathetic and considerate remarks about the deceased to mr polly in notes of brisk encouragement he was really quite cheerful at the end she said several times with congratulatory gusto quite cheerful  she made dying seem almost agreeable  both these people were resolved to treat mr polly very well and to help his exceptional incompetence in every possible way and after a simple supper of ham and bread and cheese and pickles and cold apple tart and small beer had been cleared away they put him into the armchair almost as though he was an invalid and sat on chairs that made them look down on him and opened a directive discussion of the arrangements for the funeral after all a funeral is a distinct social opportunity and rare when you have no family and few relations and they did not want to see it spoilt and wasted  youll have a hearse of course said mrs johnson not one of them combinations with the driver sitting on the coffin disrespectful i think they are i cant fancy how people can bring themselves to be buried in combinations she flattened her voice in a manner she used to intimate aesthetic feeling i do like them glass hearses she said so refined and nice they are  podgers hearse youll have said johnson conclusively its the best in easewood  everything thats right and proper said mr polly  podgers ready to come and measure at any time said johnson  then youll want a mourners carriage or two according as to whom youre going to invite said mr johnson  didnt think of inviting any one said polly  oh youll have to ask a few friends said mr johnson you cant let your father go to his grave without asking a few friends  funerial baked meats like said mr polly  not baked but of course youll have to give them something ham and chickens very suitable you dont want a lot of cooking with the ceremony coming into the middle of it i wonder who alfred ought to invite harold just the immediate relations one doesnt want a great crowd of people and one doesnt want not to show respect  but he hated our relationsmost of them  hes not hating them now said mrs johnson you may be sure of that its just because of that i think they ought to comeall of themeven your aunt mildred  bit vulturial isnt it said mr polly unheeded  wouldnt be more than twelve or thirteen people if they all came said mr johnson  we could have everything put out ready in the back room and the gloves and whiskey in the front room and while we were all at the ceremony bessie could bring it all into the front room on a tray and put it out nice and proper thered have to be whiskey and sherry or port for the ladies  wherell you get your mourning asked johnson abruptly  mr polly had not yet considered this byproduct of sorrow havent thought of it yet o man  a disagreeable feeling spread over his body as though he was blackening as he sat he hated black garments  i suppose i must have mourning he said  well said johnson with a solemn smile  got to see it through said mr polly indistinctly  if i were you said johnson i should get readymade trousers thats all you really want and a black satin tie and a top hat with a deep mourning band and gloves  jet cuff links he ought to haveas chief mourner said mrs johnson  not obligatory said johnson  it shows respect said mrs johnson  it shows respect of course said johnson  and then mrs johnson went on with the utmost gusto to the details of the casket while mr polly sat more and more deeply and droopingly into the armchair assenting with a note of protest to all they said after he had retired for the night he remained for a long time perched  on the edge of the sofa which was his bed staring at the prospect before him chasing the o man about up to the last he said  he hated the thought and elaboration of death as a healthy animal must hate it his mind struggled with unwonted social problems  got to put em away somehow i suppose said mr polly  wish id looked him up a bit more while he was alive said mr polly   ii  bereavement came to mr polly before the realisation of opulence and its anxieties and responsibilities that only dawned upon him on the morrowwhich chanced to be sundayas he walked with johnson before church time about the tangle of struggling building enterprise that constituted the rising urban district of easewood johnson was off duty that morning and devoted the time very generously to the admonitory discussion of mr pollys worldly outlook  dont seem to get the hang of the business somehow said mr polly too much blooming humbug in it for my way of thinking  if i were you said mr johnson i should push for a firstclass place in londontake almost nothing and live on my reserves thats what i should do  come the heavy said mr polly  get a better class reference  there was a pause think of investing your money asked johnson  hardly got used to the idea of having it yet o man  youll have to do something with it give you nearly twenty pounds a year if you invest it properly  havent seen it yet in that light said mr polly defensively  theres no end of things you could put it into  its getting it out again i shouldnt feel sure of im no sort of fiancianier sooner back horses  i wouldnt do that if i were you  not my style o man  its a nest egg said johnson  mr polly made an indeterminate noise  theres building societies johnson threw out in a speculative tone mr polly with detached brevity admitted there were  you might lend it on mortgage said johnson very safe form of investment  shant think anything about itnot till the o mans underground said mr polly with an inspiration  they turned a corner that led towards the junction  might do worse said johnson than put it into a small shop  at the moment this remark made very little appeal to mr polly but afterwards it developed it fell into his mind like some small obscure seed and germinated  these shops arent in a bad position said johnson  the row he referred to gaped in the late painful stage in building before the healing touch of the plasterer assuages the roughness of the brickwork the space for the shop yawned an oblong gap below framed above by an iron girder windows and fittings to suit tenant a board at the end of the row promised and behind was the door space and a glimpse of stairs going up to the living rooms above not a bad position said johnson and led the way into the establishment room for fixtures there he said pointing to the blank wall the two men went upstairs to the little sittingroom or best bedroom it would have to be above the shop then they descended to the kitchen below  rooms in a new house always look a bit small said johnson  they came out of the house again by the prospective back door and picked their way through builders litter across the yard space to the road again they drew nearer the junction to where a pavement and shops already open and active formed the commercial centre of easewood on the opposite side of the way the side door of a flourishing little establishment opened and a man and his wife and a little boy in a sailor suit came into the street the wife was a pretty woman in brown with a floriferous straw hat and the group was altogether very sundayfied and shiny and spick and span the shop itself had a large plateglass window whose contents were now veiled by a buff blind on which was inscribed in scrolly letters rymer pork butcher and provision merchant and then with voluptuous elaboration the worldfamed easewood sausage  greetings were exchanged between mr johnson and this distinguished comestible  off to church already said johnson  walking across the fields to little dorington said mr rymer  very pleasant walk said johnson  very said mr rymer  hope youll enjoy it said mr johnson  that chaps done well said johnson sotto voce as they went on came here with nothingpractically four years ago and as thin as a lath look at him now  hes worked hard of course said johnson improving the occasion  thought fell between the cousins for a space  some men can do one thing said johnson and some another for a man who sticks to it theres a lot to be done in a shop   iii  all the preparations for the funeral ran easily and happily under mrs johnsons skilful hands on the eve of the sad event she produced a reserve of black sateen the kitchen steps and a box of tintacks and decorated the house with festoons and bows of black in the best possible taste she tied up the knocker with black crape and put a large bow over the corner of the steel engraving of garibaldi and swathed the bust of mr gladstone that had belonged to the deceased with inky swathings she turned the two vases that had views of tivoli and the bay of naples round so that these rather brilliant landscapes were hidden and only the plain blue enamel showed and she anticipated the longcontemplated purchase of a tablecloth for the front room and substituted a violet purple cover for the now very worn and faded raptures and roses in plushette that had hitherto done duty there everything that loving consideration could do to impart a dignified solemnity to her little home was done  she had released mr polly from the irksome duty of issuing invitations and as the moments of assembly drew near she sent him and mr johnson out into the narrow long strip of garden at the back of the house to be free to put a finishing touch or so to her preparations she sent them out together because she had a queer little persuasion at the back of her mind that mr polly wanted to bolt from his sacred duties and there was no way out of the garden except through the house  mr johnson was a steady successful gardener and particularly good with celery and peas he walked slowly along the narrow path down the centre pointing out to mr polly a number of interesting points in the management of peas wrinkles neatly applied and difficulties wisely overcome and all that he did for the comfort and propitiation of that fitful but rewarding vegetable presently a sound of nervous laughter and raised voices from the house proclaimed the arrival of the earlier guests and the worst of that anticipatory tension was over  when mr polly reentered the house he found three entirely strange young women with pink faces demonstrative manners and emphatic mourning engaged in an incoherent conversation with mrs johnson all three kissed him with great gusto after the ancient english fashion these are your cousins larkins said mrs johnson thats annie unexpected hug and smack thats miriam resolute hug and smack and thats minnie prolonged hug and smack  righto said mr polly emerging a little crumpled and breathless from this hearty introduction i see  heres aunt larkins said mrs johnson as an elderly and stouter edition of the three young women appeared in the doorway  mr polly backed rather faintheartedly but aunt larkins was not to be denied having hugged and kissed her nephew resoundingly she gripped him by the wrists and scanned his features she had a round sentimental freckled face i should ave known im anywhere she said with fervour  hark at mother said the cousin called annie why shes never set eyes on him before  i should ave known im anywhere said mrs larkins for lizzies child youve got her eyes its a resemblance and as for never seeing im ive dandled him miss imperence ive dandled him  you couldnt dandle him now ma miss annie remarked with a shriek of laughter  all the sisters laughed at that the things you say annie said miriam and for a time the room was full of mirth  mr polly felt it incumbent upon him to say something my dandling days are over he said  the reception of this remark would have convinced a far more modest character than mr polly that it was extremely witty  mr polly followed it up by another one almost equally good my turn to dandle he said with a sly look at his aunt and convulsed everyone  not me said mrs larkins taking his point thank you and achieved a climax  it was queer but they seemed to be easy people to get on with anyhow they were still picking little ripples and giggles of mirth from the idea of mr polly dandling aunt larkins when mr johnson who had answered the door ushered in a stooping figure who was at once hailed by mrs johnson as why uncle pentstemon uncle pentstemon was rather a shock his was an aged rather than venerable figure time had removed the hair from the top of his head and distributed a small dividend of the plunder in little bunches carelessly and impartially over the rest of his features he was dressed in a very big old frock coat and a long cylindrical top hat which he had kept on he was very much bent and he carried a rush basket from which protruded coy intimations of the lettuces and onions he had brought to grace the occasion he hobbled into the room resisting the efforts of johnson to divest him of his various encumbrances halted and surveyed the company with an expression of profound hostility breathing hard recognition quickened in his eyes  you here he said to aunt larkins and then you would be these your gals  they are said aunt larkins and better gals  that annie asked uncle pentstemon pointing a horny thumbnail  fancy your remembering her name  she mucked up my mushroom bed the baggage said uncle pentstemon ungenially and i give it to her to rights trounced her i didfairly i remember her heres some green stuff for you grace fresh it is and wholesome i shall be wanting the basket back and mind you let me have it have you nailed him down yet you always was a bit in front of what was needful  his attention was drawn inward by a troublesome tooth and he sucked at it spitefully there was something potent about this old man that silenced everyone for a moment or so he seemed a fragment from the ruder agricultural past of our race like a lump of soil among things of paper he put his basket of vegetables very deliberately on the new violet tablecloth removed his hat carefully and dabbled his brow and wiped out his hat brim with a crimson and yellow pocket handkerchief  im glad you were able to come uncle said mrs johnson  oh i came said uncle pentstemon i came  he turned on mrs larkins gals in service he asked  they arent and they wont be said mrs larkins  no he said with infinite meaning and turned his eye on mr polly  you lizzies boy he said  mr polly was spared much selfexposition by the tumult occasioned by further arrivals  ah heres may punt said mrs johnson and a small woman dressed in the borrowed mourning of a large woman and leading a very small longhaired observant little boyit was his first funeralappeared closely followed by several friends of mrs johnson who had come to swell the display of respect and made only vague confused impressions upon mr pollys mind aunt mildred who was an unexplained family scandal had declined mrs johnsons hospitality  everybody was in profound mourning of course mourning in the modern english style with the dyers handiwork only too apparent and hats and jackets of the current cut there was very little crape and the costumes had none of the goodness and specialisation and genuine enjoyment of mourning for mournings sake that a similar continental gathering would have displayed still that congestion of strangers in black sufficed to stun and confuse mr pollys impressionable mind it seemed to him much more extraordinary than anything he had expected  now gals said mrs larkins see if you can help and the three daughters became confusingly active between the front room and the back  i hope everyonell take a glass of sherry and a biscuit said mrs johnson we dont stand on ceremony and a decanter appeared in the place of uncle pentstemons vegetables  uncle pentstemon had refused to be relieved of his hat he sat stiffly down on a chair against the wall with that venerable headdress between his feet watching the approach of anyone jealously dont you go squashing my hat he said conversation became confused and general uncle pentstemon addressed himself to mr polly youre a little chap he said a puny little chap i never did agree to lizzie marrying him but i suppose bygones must be bygones now i suppose they made you a clerk or something  outfitter said mr polly  i remember them girls pretend to be dressmakers  they are dressmakers said mrs larkins across the room  i will take a glass of sherry they old to it you see  he took the glass mrs johnson handed him and poised it critically between a horny finger and thumb youll be paying for this he said to mr polly heres to you dont you go treading on my hat young woman you brush your skirts against it and you take a shillin off its value it aint the sort of at you see nowadays  he drank noisily  the sherry presently loosened everybodys tongue and the early coldness passed  there ought to have been a postmortem polly heard mrs punt remarking to one of mrs johnsons friends and miriam and another were lost in admiration of mrs johnsons decorations so very nice and refined they were both repeating at intervals  the sherry and biscuits were still being discussed when mr podger the undertaker arrived a broad cheerfully sorrowful cleanshaven little man accompanied by a melancholyfaced assistant he conversed for a time with johnson in the passage outside the sense of his business stilled the rising waves of chatter and carried off everyones attention in the wake of his heavy footsteps to the room above   iv  things crowded upon mr polly everyone he noticed took sherry with a solemn avidity and a small portion even was administered sacramentally to the punt boy there followed a distribution of black kid gloves and much trying on and humouring of fingers good gloves said one of mrs johnsons friends theres a little pair there for willie said mrs johnson triumphantly everyone seemed gravely content with the amazing procedure of the occasion presently mr podger was picking mr polly out as chief mourner to go with mrs johnson mrs larkins and annie in the first mourning carriage  right o said mr polly and repented instantly of the alacrity of the phrase  therell have to be a walking party said mrs johnson cheerfully theres only two coaches i daresay we can put in six in each but that leaves three over  there was a generous struggle to be pedestrian and the two other larkins girls confessing coyly to tight new boots and displaying a certain eagerness were added to the contents of the first carriage  itll be a squeeze said annie  i dont mind a squeeze said mr polly  he decided privately that the proper phrase for the result of that remark was hysterial catechunations  mr podger reentered the room from a momentary supervision of the bumping business that was now proceeding down the staircase  bearing up he said cheerfully rubbing his hands together bearing up  that stuck very vividly in mr pollys mind and so did the closewedged drive to the churchyard bunched in between two young women in confused dull and shiny black and the fact that the wind was bleak and that the officiating clergyman had a cold and sniffed between his sentences the wonder of life the wonder of everything what had he expected that this should all be so astoundingly different  he found his attention converging more and more upon the larkins cousins the interest was reciprocal they watched him with a kind of suppressed excitement and became risible with his every word and gesture he was more and more aware of their personal quality annie had blue eyes and a red attractive mouth a harsh voice and a habit of extreme liveliness that even this occasion could not suppress minnie was fond extremely free about the touching of hands and suchlike endearments miriam was quieter and regarded him earnestly mrs larkins was very happy in her daughters and they had the naïve affectionateness of those who see few people and find a strange cousin a wonderful outlet mr polly had never been very much kissed and it made his mind swim he did not know for the life of him whether he liked or disliked all or any of the larkins cousins it was rather attractive to make them laugh they laughed at anything  there they were tugging at his mind and the funeral tugging at his mind too and the sense of himself as chief mourner in a brand new silk hat with a broad mourning band he watched the ceremony and missed his responses and strange feelings twisted at his heartstrings   v  mr polly walked back to the house because he wanted to be alone miriam and minnie would have accompanied him but finding uncle pentstemon beside the chief mourner they went on in front  youre wise said uncle pentstemon  glad you think so said mr polly rousing himself to talk  i likes a bit of walking before a meal said uncle pentstemon and made a kind of large hiccup that sherry rises he remarked grocers stuff i expect  he went on to ask how much the funeral might be costing and seemed pleased to find mr polly didnt know  in that case he said impressively its pretty certain to cost moren you expect my boy  he meditated for a time ive seen a mort of undertakers he declared a mort of undertakers  the larkins girls attracted his attention  lets lodgins and chars he commented leastways she goes out to cook dinners and look at em  dressed up to the nines if it aint borryd clothes that is and they goes out to work at a factory  did you know my father much uncle pentstemon asked mr polly  couldnt stand lizzie throwin herself away like that said uncle pentstemon and repeated his hiccup on a larger scale  that werent good sherry said uncle pentstemon with the first note of pathos mr polly had detected in his quavering voice  the funeral in the rather cold wind had proved wonderfully appetising and every eye brightened at the sight of the cold collation that was now spread in the front room mrs johnson was very brisk and mr polly when he reentered the house found everybody sitting down come along alfred cried the hostess cheerfully we cant very well begin without you have you got the bottled beer ready to open betsy uncle youll have a drop of whiskey i expect  put it where i can mix for myself said uncle pentstemon placing his hat very carefully out of harms way on the bookcase  there were two cold boiled chickens which johnson carved with great care and justice and a nice piece of ham some brawn and a steak and kidney pie a large bowl of salad and several sorts of pickles and afterwards came cold apple tart jam roll and a good piece of stilton cheese lots of bottled beer some lemonade for the ladies and milk for master punt a very bright and satisfying meal mr polly found himself seated between mrs punt who was much preoccupied with master punts table manners and one of mrs johnsons school friends who was exchanging reminiscences of school days and news of how various common friends had changed and married with mrs johnson opposite him was miriam and another of the johnson circle and also he had brawn to carve and there was hardly room for the helpful betsy to pass behind his chair so that altogether his mind would have been amply distracted from any mortuary broodings even if a wordy warfare about the education of the modern young woman had not sprung up between uncle pentstemon and mrs larkins and threatened for a time in spite of a word or so in season from johnson to wreck all the harmony of the sad occasion  the general effect was after this fashion  first an impression of mrs punt on the right speaking in a refined undertone you didnt i suppose mr polly think to ave your poor dear father postmortemed  lady on the left side breaking in i was just reminding grace of the dear dead days beyond recall  attempted reply to mrs punt didnt think of it for a moment cant give you a piece of this brawn can i  fragment from the left grace and beauty they used to call us and we used to sit at the same desk  mrs punt breaking out suddenly dont swaller your fork willy you see mr polly i used to ave a young gentleman a medical student lodging with me  voice from down the table am alfred i didnt give you very much  bessie became evident at the back of mr pollys chair struggling wildly to get past mr polly did his best to be helpful can you get past lemme sit forward a bit urroo right o  lady to the left going on valiantly and speaking to everyone who cares to listen while mrs johnson beams beside her there she used to sit as bold as brass and the fun she used to make of things no one could believeknowing her now she used to make faces at the mistress through the  mrs punt keeping steadily on the contents of the stummik at any rate ought to be examined  voice of mr johnson elfrid pass the mustid down  miriam leaning across the table elfrid  once she got us all kept in the whole school  miriam more insistently elfrid  uncle pentstemon raising his voice defiantly trounce er again i would if she did as much now that i would dratted mischief  miriam catching mr pollys eye elfrid this lady knows canterbury i been telling her you been there  mr polly glad you know it  the lady shouting i like it  mrs larkins raising her voice i wont ave my girls spoken of not by nobody old or young  pop imperfectly located  mr johnson at large aint the beer up its the eated room  bessie scuse me sir passing so soon again but rest inaudible mr polly accommodating himself urroo right right o  the knives and forks probably by some secret common agreement clash and clatter together and drown every other sound  nobody ad the least idea ow e diednobody willie dont golp so you aint in a urry are you you dont want to ketch a train or anythinggolping like that  dyou remember grace ow one day we ad writing lesson  nicer girls no one ever adthough i say it who shouldnt  mrs johnson in a shrill clear hospitable voice harold wont mrs larkins ave a teeny bit more fowl  mr polly rising to the situation or some brawn mrs larkins catching uncle pentstemons eye cant send you some brawn sir  elfrid  loud hiccup from uncle pentstemon momentary consternation followed by giggle from annie  the narration at mr pollys elbow pursued a quiet but relentless course directly the new doctor came in he said everything must be took out and put in spiritseverything  willieaudible ingurgitation  the narration on the left was flourishing up to a climax ladies she sez dip their pens in their ink and keep their noses out of it  elfridpersuasively  certain people may cast snacks at other peoples daughters never having had any of their own though two poor souls of wives dead and buried through their goings on  johnson ruling the storm we dont want old scores dug up on such a day as this  old scores you may call them but worth a dozen of them that put them to their rest poor dears  elfridwith a note of remonstrance  if you choke yourself my lord not another mouthful do you ave no nice puddin nothing  and kept us in she did every afternoon for a week  it seemed to be the end and mr polly replied with an air of being profoundly impressed really  elfrida little disheartened  and then they ad it they found hed swallowed the very key to unlock the drawer  then dont let people go casting snacks  whos casting snacks  elfrid this lady wants to know ave the prossers left canterbury  no wish to make myself disagreeable not to gods umblest worm  alf you arent very busy with that brawn up there  and so on for the hour  the general effect upon mr polly at the time was at once confusing and exhilarating but it led him to eat copiously and carelessly and long before the end when after an hour and a quarter a movement took the party and it pushed away its cheese plates and rose sighing and stretching from the remains of the repast little streaks and bands of dyspeptic irritation and melancholy were darkening the serenity of his mind  he stood between the mantel shelf and the windowthe blinds were up nowand the larkins sisters clustered about him he battled with the oncoming depression and forced himself to be extremely facetious about two noticeable rings on annies hand they aint real said annie coquettishly got em out of a prize packet  prize packet in trousers i expect said mr polly and awakened inextinguishable laughter  oh the things you say said minnie slapping his shoulder  suddenly something he had quite extraordinarily forgotten came into his head  bless my heart he cried suddenly serious  whats the matter asked johnson  ought to have gone back to shopthree days ago theyll make no end of a row  lor you are a treat said cousin annie and screamed with laughter at a delicious idea youll get the chuck she said  mr polly made a convulsing grimace at her  ill die she said i dont believe you care a bit  feeling a little disorganized by her hilarity and a shocked expression that had come to the face of cousin miriam he made some indistinct excuse and went out through the back room and scullery into the little garden the cool air and a very slight drizzle of rain was a reliefanyhow but the black mood of the replete dyspeptic had come upon him his soul darkened hopelessly he walked with his hands in his pockets down the path between the rows of exceptionally cultured peas and unreasonably overwhelmingly he was smitten by sorrow for his father the heady noise and muddle and confused excitement of the feast passed from him like a curtain drawn away he thought of that hot and angry and struggling creature who had tugged and sworn so foolishly at the sofa upon the twisted staircase and who was now lying still and hidden at the bottom of a wallsided oblong pit beside the heaped gravel that would presently cover him the stillness of it the wonder of it the infinite reproach hatred for all these peopleall of thempossessed mr pollys soul  henwitted gigglers said mr polly  he went down to the fence and stood with his hands on it staring away at nothing he stayed there for what seemed a long time from the house came a sound of raised voices that subsided and then mrs johnson calling for bessie  gowlish gusto said mr polly jumping it in funererial games dont hurt him of course doesnt matter to him  nobody missed mr polly for a long time  when at last he reappeared among them his eye was almost grim but nobody noticed his eye they were looking at watches and johnson was being omniscient about trains they seemed to discover mr polly afresh just at the moment of parting and said a number of more or less appropriate things but uncle pentstemon was far too worried about his rush basket which had been carelessly mislaid he seemed to think with larcenous intentions to remember mr polly at all mrs johnson had tried to fob him off with a similar but inferior baskethis own had one handle mended with string according to a method of peculiar virtue and inimitable distinction known only to himselfand the old gentleman had taken her attempt as the gravest reflection upon his years and intelligence mr polly was left very largely to the larkins trio cousin minnie became shameless and kept kissing him goodbyand then finding out it wasnt time to go cousin miriam seemed to think her silly and caught mr pollys eye sympathetically cousin annie ceased to giggle and lapsed into a nearly sentimental state she said with real feeling that she had enjoyed the funeral more than words could tell    chapter the fifth  mr polly takes a vacation   i  mr polly returned to clapham from the funeral celebration prepared for trouble and took his dismissal in a manly spirit  youve merely antiseparated me by a hair he said politely  and he told them in the dormitory that he meant to take a little holiday before his next crib though a certain inherited reticence suppressed the fact of the legacy  youll do that all right said ascough the head of the boot shop its quite the fashion just at present six weeks in wonderful wood street theyre running excursions  a little holiday that was the form his sense of wealth took first that it made a little holiday possible holidays were his life and the rest merely adulterated living and now he might take a little holiday and have money for railway fares and money for meals and money for inns buthe wanted someone to take the holiday with  for a time he cherished a design of hunting up parsons getting him to throw up his situation and going with him to stratfordonavon and shrewsbury and the welsh mountains and the wye and a lot of places like that for a really gorgeous careless illimitable old holiday of a month but alas parsons had gone from the st pauls churchyard outfitters long ago and left no address  mr polly tried to think he would be almost as happy wandering alone but he knew better he had dreamt of casual encounters with delightfully interesting people by the waysideeven romantic encounters such things happened in chaucer and bocashiew they happened with extreme facility in mr richard le galliennes very detrimental book the quest of the golden girl which he had read at canterbury but he had no confidence they would happen in englandto him  when a month later he came out of the clapham side door at last into the bright sunshine of a fine london day with a dazzling sense of limitless freedom upon him he did nothing more adventurous than order the cabman to drive to waterloo and there take a ticket for easewood  he wantedwhat did he want most in life i think his distinctive craving is best expressed as funfun in companionship he had already spent a pound or two upon three select feasts to his fellow assistants sprat suppers they were and there had been a great and very successful sunday pilgrimage to richmond by wandsworth and wimbledons open common a trailing garrulous company walking about a solemnly happy host to wonderful cold meat and salad at the roebuck a bowl of punch punch and a bill to correspond but now it was a weekday and he went down to easewood with his bag and portmanteau in a solitary compartment and looked out of the window upon a world in which every possible congenial seemed either toiling in a situation or else looking for one with a gnawing and hopelessly preoccupying anxiety he stared out of the window at the exploitation roads of suburbs and rows of houses all very much alike either emphatically and impatiently to let or full of rather busy unsocial people near wimbledon he had a glimpse of golf links and saw two elderly gentlemen who had they chosen might have been gentlemen of grace and leisure addressing themselves to smite little hunted white balls great distances with the utmost bitterness and dexterity mr polly could not understand them  every road he remarked as freshly as though he had never observed it before was bordered by inflexible palings or iron fences or severely disciplined hedges he wondered if perhaps abroad there might be beautifully careless unenclosed high roads perhaps after all the best way of taking a holiday is to go abroad  he was haunted by the memory of what was either a halfforgotten picture or a dream a carriage was drawn up by the wayside and four beautiful people two men and two women graciously dressed were dancing a formal ceremonious dance full of bows and curtseys to the music of a wandering fiddler they had encountered they had been driving one way and he walking anothera happy encounter with this obvious result they might have come straight out of happy theleme whose motto is do what thou wilt the driver had taken his two sleek horses out they grazed unchallenged and he sat on a stone clapping time with his hands while the fiddler played the shade of the trees did not altogether shut out the sunshine the grass in the wood was lush and full of still daffodils the turf they danced on was starred with daisies  mr polly dear heart firmly believed that things like that could and did happensomewhere only it puzzled him that morning that he never saw them happening perhaps they happened south of guilford perhaps they happened in italy perhaps they ceased to happen a hundred years ago perhaps they happened just round the corneron weekdays when all good mr pollys are safely shut up in shops and so dreaming of delightful impossibilities until his heart ached for them he was rattled along in the suburban train to johnsons discreet home and the briskly stimulating welcome of mrs johnson   ii  mr polly translated his restless craving for joy and leisure into harold johnsonese by saying that he meant to look about him for a bit before going into another situation it was a decision johnson very warmly approved it was arranged that mr polly should occupy his former room and board with the johnsons in consideration of a weekly payment of eighteen shillings and the next morning mr polly went out early and reappeared with a purchase a safety bicycle which he proposed to study and master in the sandy lane below the johnsons house but over the struggles that preceded his mastery it is humane to draw a veil  and also mr polly bought a number of books rabelais for his own and the arabian nights the works of sterne a pile of tales from blackwood cheap in a secondhand bookshop the plays of william shakespeare a secondhand copy of bellocs road to rome an odd volume of purchas his pilgrimes and the life and death of jason  better get yourself a good book on bookkeeping said johnson turning over perplexing pages  a belated spring was now advancing with great strides to make up for lost time sunshine and a stirring wind were poured out over the land fleets of towering clouds sailed upon urgent tremendous missions across the blue seas of heaven and presently mr polly was riding a little unstably along unfamiliar surrey roads wondering always what was round the next corner and marking the blackthorn and looking out for the first white flowerbuds of the may he was perplexed and distressed as indeed are all right thinking souls that there is no may in early may  he did not ride at the even pace sensible people use who have marked out a journey from one place to another and settled what time it will take them he rode at variable speeds and always as though he was looking for something that missing left life attractive still but a little wanting in significance and sometimes he was so unreasonably happy he had to whistle and sing and sometimes he was incredibly but not at all painfully sad his indigestion vanished with air and exercise and it was quite pleasant in the evening to stroll about the garden with johnson and discuss plans for the future johnson was full of ideas moreover mr polly had marked the road that led to stamton that rising populous suburb and as his bicycle legs grew strong his wheel with a sort of inevitableness carried him towards the row of houses in a back street in which his larkins cousins made their home together  he was received with great enthusiasm  the street was a dingy little street a culdesac of very small houses in a row each with an almost flattened bow window and a blistered brown door with a black knocker he poised his bright new bicycle against the window and knocked and stood waiting and felt himself in his straw hat and black serge suit a very pleasant and prosperouslooking figure the door was opened by cousin miriam she was wearing a bluish print dress that brought out a kind of sallow warmth in her skin and although it was nearly four oclock in the afternoon her sleeves were tucked up as if for some domestic work above the elbows showing her rather slender but very shapely yellowish arms the loosely pinned bodice confessed a delicately rounded neck  for a moment she regarded him with suspicion and a faint hostility and then recognition dawned in her eyes  why she said its cousin elfrid  thought id look you up he said  fancy you coming to see us like this she answered  they stood confronting one another for a moment while miriam collected herself for the unexpected emergency  explorations menanderings said mr polly indicating the bicycle  miriams face betrayed no appreciation of the remark  wait a moment she said coming to a rapid decision and ill tell ma  she closed the door on him abruptly leaving him a little surprised in the street ma he heard her calling and swift speech followed the import of which he didnt catch then she reappeared it seemed but an instant but she was changed the arms had vanished into sleeves the apron had gone a certain pleasing disorder of the hair had been at least reproved  i didnt mean to shut you out she said coming out upon the step i just told ma how are you elfrid you are looking well i didnt know you rode a bicycle is it a new one  she leaned upon his bicycle bright it is she said what a trouble you must have to keep it clean  mr polly was aware of a rustling transit along the passage and of the house suddenly full of hushed but strenuous movement  its plated mostly said mr polly  what do you carry in that little bag thing she asked and then branched off to were all in a mess today you know its my cleaning up day today im not a bit tidy i know but i do like to ave a go in at things now and then you got to take us as you find us elfrid mercy we wasnt all out she paused she was talking against time i am glad to see you again she repeated  couldnt keep away said mr polly gallantly had to come over and see my pretty cousins again  miriam did not answer for a moment she coloured deeply you do say things she said  she stared at mr polly and his unfortunate sense of fitness made him nod his head towards her regard her firmly with a round brown eye and add impressively i dont say which of them  her answering expression made him realise for an instant the terrible dangers he trifled with avidity flared up in her eyes minnies voice came happily to dissolve the situation  ello elfrid she said from the doorstep  her hair was just passably tidy and she was a little effaced by a red blouse but there was no mistaking the genuine brightness of her welcome  he was to come in to tea and mrs larkins exuberantly genial in a floriferous but dingy flannel dressing gown appeared to confirm that he brought in his bicycle and put it in the narrow empty passage and everyone crowded into a small untidy kitchen whose table had been hastily cleared of the débris of the midday repast  you must come in ere said mrs larkins for miriams turning out the front room i never did see such a girl for cleanin up miriams olidays a scrub youve caught us on the op as the sayin is but welcome all the same pity annies at work today she wont be ome till seven  miriam put chairs and attended to the fire minnie edged up to mr polly and said i am glad to see you again elfrid with a warm contiguous intimacy that betrayed a broken tooth mrs larkins got out tea things and descanted on the noble simplicity of their lives and how he mustnt mind our simple ways they enveloped mr polly with a geniality that intoxicated his amiable nature he insisted upon helping lay the things and created enormous laughter by pretending not to know where plates and knives and cups ought to go whom i going to sit next he said and developed voluminous amusement by attempts to arrange the plates so that he could rub elbows with all three mrs larkins had to sit down in the windsor chair by the grandfather clock which was dark with dirt and not going to laugh at her ease at his wellacted perplexity  they got seated at last and mr polly struck a vein of humour in telling them how he learnt to ride the bicycle he found the mere repetition of the word wabble sufficient to produce almost inextinguishable mirth  no foreseeing little accidentulous misadventures he said none whatever  giggle from minnie  stout elderly gentlemanshirt sleeveslarge straw wastepaper basket sort of hatstarts to cross the roadgoing to the oil shopprodic refreshment of oil can  dont say you run im down said mrs larkins gasping dont say you run im down elfrid  run im down not me madam i never run anything down wabble ring the bell wabble wabble  laughter and tears  no ones going to run him down hears the bell wabble gust of wind off comes the hat smack into the wheel wabble lord whats going to happen hat across the road old gentleman after it bell shriek he ran into me didnt ring his bell hadnt got a belljust ran into me over i went clinging to his venerable head down he went with me clinging to him oil can blump blump into the road  interlude while minnie is attended to for crumb in the windpipe  well what happened to the old man with the oil can said mrs larkins  we sat about among the debreece and had a bit of an argument i told him he oughtnt to come out wearing such a dangerous hatflying at things said if he couldnt control his hat he ought to leave it at home high old jawbacious argument we had i tell you i tell you sir i tell you sir wawwawwaw infuriacious but thats the sort of thing thats constantly happening you knowon a bicycle people run into you hens and cats and dogs and things everything seems to have its mark on you everything  you never run into anything  never swelpme said mr polly very solemnly  never e say squealed minnie hark at im and relapsed into a condition that urgently demanded back thumping dont be so silly said miriam thumping hard  mr polly had never been such a social success before they hung upon his every wordand laughed what a family they were for laughter and he loved laughter the background he apprehended dimly it was very much the sort of background his life had always had there was a threadbare tablecloth on the table and the slop basin and teapot did not go with the cups and saucers the plates were different again the knives worn down the butter lived in a greenish glass dish of its own behind was a dresser hung with spare and miscellaneous crockery with a workbox and an untidy workbasket there was an ailing musk plant in the window and the tattered and blotched wallpaper was covered by brightcoloured grocers almanacs feminine wrappings hung from pegs upon the door and the floor was covered with a varied collection of fragments of oilcloth the windsor chair he sat in was unstablewhich presently afforded material for humour steady old nag he said whoa my friskiacious palfry  the things he says you never know what he wont say next   iii  you aint talkin of goin cried mrs larkins  supper at eight  stay to supper with us now you ave come over said mrs larkins with corroborating cries from minnie ave a bit of a walk with the gals and then come back to supper you might all go and meet annie while i straighten up and lay things out  youre not to go touching the front room mind said miriam  whos going to touch yer front room said mrs larkins apparently forgetful for a moment of mr polly  both girls dressed with some care while mrs larkins sketched the better side of their characters and then the three young people went out to see something of stamton in the streets their risible mood gave way to a selfconscious propriety that was particularly evident in miriams bearing they took mr polly to the stamton wreckeryation groundthat at least was what they called itwith its handsome custodians cottage its asphalt paths its jubilee drinking fountain its clumps of wallflower and daffodils and so to the new cemetery and a distant view of the surrey hills and round by the gasworks to the canal to the factory that presently disgorged a surprised and radiant annie  ello said annie  it is very pleasant to every properly constituted mind to be a centre of amiable interest for ones fellow creatures and when one is a young man conscious of becoming mourning and a certain wit and the fellow creatures are three young and ardent and sufficiently expressive young women who dispute for the honour of walking by ones side one may be excused a secret exaltation they did dispute  im going to ave im now said annie you twove been aving im all the afternoon besides ive got something to say to him  she had something to say to him it came presently i say she said abruptly i did get them rings out of a prize packet  what rings asked mr polly  what you saw at your poor fathers funeral you made out they meant something they didntstraight  then some people have been very remiss about their chances said mr polly understanding  they havent had any chances said annie i dont believe in making oneself too free with people  nor me said mr polly  i may be a bit larky and cheerful in my manner annie admitted but it dont mean anything i aint that sort  right o said mr polly   iv  it was past ten when mr polly found himself riding back towards easewood in a broad moonlight with a little japanese lantern dangling from his handle bar and making a fiery circle of pinkish light on and round about his front wheel he was mightily pleased with himself and the day there had been fourale to drink at supper mixed with gingerbeer very free and jolly in a jug no shadow fell upon the agreeable excitement of his mind until he faced the anxious and reproachful face of johnson who had been sitting up for him smoking and trying to read the odd volume of purchas his pilgrimesabout the monk who went into sarmatia and saw the tartar carts  not had an accident elfrid said johnson  the weakness of mr pollys character came out in his reply not much he said pedal got a bit loose in stamton o man couldnt ride it so i looked up the cousins while i waited  not the larkins lot  yes  johnson yawned hugely and asked for and was given friendly particulars well he said better get to bed i have been reading that book of yoursrum stuff cant make it out quite quite out of date i should say if you asked me  thats all right o man said mr polly  not a bit of use for anything i can see  not a bit  see any shops in stamton  nothing to speak of said mr polly goonight o man  before and after this brief conversation his mind ran on his cousins very warmly and prettily in the vein of high spring mr polly had been drinking at the poisoned fountains of english literature fountains so unsuited to the needs of a decent clerk or shopman fountains charged with the dangerous suggestion that it becomes a man of gaiety and spirit to make love gallantly and rather carelessly it seemed to him that evening to be handsome and humorous and practicable to make love to all his cousins it wasnt that he liked any of them particularly but he liked something about them he liked their youth and femininity their resolute high spirits and their interest in him  they laughed at nothing and knew nothing and minnie had lost a tooth and annie screamed and shouted but they were interesting intensely interesting  and miriam wasnt so bad as the others he had kissed them all and had been kissed in addition several times by minnieoscoolatory exercise  he buried his nose in his pillow and went to sleepto dream of anything rather than getting on in the world as a sensible young man in his position ought to have done   v  and now mr polly began to lead a divided life with the johnsons he professed to be inclined but not so conclusively inclined as to be inconvenient to get a shop for himself to be to use the phrase he preferred looking for an opening he would ride off in the afternoon upon that research remarking that he was going to cast a strategetical eye on chertsey or weybridge but if not all roads still a great majority of them led by however devious ways to stamton and to laughter and increasing familiarity relations developed with annie and minnie and miriam their various characters were increasingly interesting the laughter became perceptibly less abundant something of the fizz had gone from the first opening still these visits remained wonderfully friendly and upholding then back he would come to grave but evasive discussions with johnson  johnson was really anxious to get mr polly into something his was a reserved honest character and he would really have preferred to see his lodger doing things for himself than receive his money for housekeeping he hated waste anybodys waste much more than he desired profit but mrs johnson was all for mr pollys loitering she seemed much the more human and likeable of the two to mr polly  he tried at times to work up enthusiasm for the various avenues to wellbeing his discussion with johnson opened but they remained disheartening prospects he imagined himself wonderfully smartened up acquiring style and value in a london shop but the picture was stiff and unconvincing he tried to rouse himself to enthusiasm by the idea of his property increasing by leaps and bounds by twenty pounds a year or so let us say each year in a wellplaced little shop the corner shop johnson favoured there was a certain picturesque interest in imagining cutthroat economies but his heart told him there would be little in practising them  and then it happened to mr polly that real romance came out of dreamland into life and intoxicated and gladdened him with sweetly beautiful suggestionsand left him she came and left him as that dear lady leaves so many of us alas not sparing him one jot or one tittle of the hollowness of her retreating aspect  it was all the more to mr pollys taste that the thing should happen as things happen in books  in a resolute attempt not to get to stamton that day he had turned due southward from easewood towards a country where the abundance of bracken jungles ladys smock stitchwork bluebells and grassy stretches by the wayside under shady trees does much to compensate the lighter type of mind for the absence of promising openings he turned aside from the road wheeled his machine along a faintly marked attractive trail through bracken until he came to a heap of logs against a high old stone wall with a damaged coping and wallflower plants already gone to seed he sat down balanced the straw hat on a convenient lump of wood lit a cigarette and abandoned himself to agreeable musings and the friendly observation of a cheerful little brown and grey bird his stillness presently encouraged to approach him this is all right said mr polly softly to the little brown and grey bird businesslater  he reflected that he might go on this way for four or five years and then be scarcely worse off than he had been in his fathers lifetime  vile business said mr polly  then romance appeared or to be exact romance became audible  romance began as a series of small but increasingly vigorous movements on the other side of the wall then as a voice murmuring then as a falling of little fragments on the hither side and as ten pink finger tips scarcely apprehended before romance became startling and emphatically a leg remained for a time a fine slender actively struggling limb brown stockinged and wearing a brown toeworn shoe and then a handsome redhaired girl wearing a short dress of blue linen was sitting astride the wall panting considerably disarranged by her climbing and as yet unaware of mr polly  his fine instincts made him turn his head away and assume an attitude of negligent contemplation with his ears and mind alive to every sound behind him  goodness said a voice with a sharp note of surprise  mr polly was on his feet in an instant dear me can i be of any assistance he said with deferential gallantry  i dont know said the young lady and regarded him calmly with clear blue eyes  i didnt know there was anyone here she added  sorry said mr polly if i am intrudaceous i didnt know you didnt want me to be here  she reflected for a moment on the word it isnt that she said surveying him  i oughtnt to get over the wall she explained its out of bounds at least in term time but this being holidays  her manner placed the matter before him  holidays is different said mr polly  i dont want to actually break the rules she said  leave them behind you said mr polly with a catch of the breath where they are safe and marvelling at his own wit and daring and indeed trembling within himself he held out a hand for her  she brought another brown leg from the unknown and arranged her skirt with a dexterity altogether feminine i think ill stay on the wall she decided so long as some of mes in bounds  she continued to regard him with eyes that presently joined dancing in an irresistible smile of satisfaction mr polly smiled in return  you bicycle she said  mr polly admitted the fact and she said she did too  all my people are in india she explained its beastly roti mean its frightfully dull being left here alone  all my people said mr polly are in heaven  i say  fact said mr polly got nobody  and thats why she checked her artless comment on his mourning i say she said in a sympathetic voice i am sorry i really am was it a fire or a shipor something  her sympathy was very delightful he shook his head the ordinary table of mortality he said first one and then another  behind his outward melancholy delight was dancing wildly are you lonely asked the girl  mr polly nodded  i was just sitting there in melancholy rectrospectatiousness he said indicating the logs and again a swift thoughtfulness swept across her face  theres no harm in our talking she reflected  its a kindness wont you get down  she reflected and surveyed the turf below and the scene around and him  ill stay on the wall she said if only for bounds sake  she certainly looked quite adorable on the wall she had a fine neck and pointed chin that was particularly admirable from below and pretty eyes and fine eyebrows are never so pretty as when they look down upon one but no calculation of that sort thank heaven was going on beneath her ruddy shock of hair   vi  lets talk she said and for a time they were both tonguetied  mr pollys literary proclivities had taught him that under such circumstances a strain of gallantry was demanded and something in his blood repeated that lesson  you make me feel like one of those old knights he said who rode about the country looking for dragons and beautiful maidens and chivalresque adventures  oh she said why  beautiful maiden he said  she flushed under her freckles with the quick bright flush those pretty redhaired people have nonsense she said  you are im not the first to tell you that a beautiful maiden imprisoned in an enchanted school  you wouldnt think it enchanted  and here am iclad in steel well not exactly but my fiery war horse is anyhow ready to absquatulate all the dragons and rescue you  she laughed a jolly laugh that showed delightfully gleaming teeth i wish you could see the dragons she said with great enjoyment mr polly felt they were a suns distance from the world of everyday  fly with me he dared  she stared for a moment and then went off into peals of laughter you are funny she said why i havent known you five minutes  one doesntin this medevial world my mind is made up anyhow  he was proud and pleased with his joke and quick to change his key neatly i wish one could he said  i wonder if people ever did  if there were people like you  we dont even know each others names she remarked with a descent to matters of fact  yours is the prettiest name in the world  how do you know  it must beanyhow  it is rather pretty you knowits christabel  what did i tell you  and yours  poorer than i deserve its alfred  i cant call you alfred  well polly  its a girls name  for a moment he was out of tune i wish it was he said and could have bitten out his tongue at the larkins sound of it  i shant forget it she remarked consolingly  i say she said in the pause that followed why are you riding about the country on a bicycle  im doing it because i like it  she sought to estimate his social status on her limited basis of experience he stood leaning with one hand against the wall looking up at her and tingling with daring thoughts he was a littleish man you must remember but neither meanlooking nor unhandsome in those days sunburnt by his holiday and now warmly flushed he had an inspiration to simple speech that no practised trifler with love could have bettered there is love at first sight he said and said it sincerely  she stared at him with eyes round and big with excitement  i think she said slowly and without any signs of fear or retreat i ought to get back over the wall  it neednt matter to you he said im just a nobody but i know you are the best and most beautiful thing ive ever spoken to his breath caught against something no harm in telling you that he said  i should have to go back if i thought you were serious she said after a pause and they both smiled together  after that they talked in a fragmentary way for some time the blue eyes surveyed mr polly with kindly curiosity from under a broad finely modelled brow much as an exceptionally intelligent cat might survey a new sort of dog she meant to find out all about him she asked questions that riddled the honest knight in armour below and probed ever nearer to the hateful secret of the shop and his normal servitude and when he made a flourish and mispronounced a word a thoughtful shade passed like the shadow of a cloud across her face  boom came the sound of a gong  lordy cried the girl and flashed a pair of brown legs at him and was gone  then her pink finger tips reappeared and the top of her red hair knight she cried from the other side of the wall knight there  lady he answered  come again tomorrow  at your command but  yes  just one finger  what do you mean  to kiss  the rustle of retreating footsteps and silence  but after he had waited next day for twenty minutes she reappeared a little out of breath with the effort to surmount the walland head first this time and it seemed to him she was lighter and more daring and altogether prettier than the dreams and enchanted memories that had filled the interval   vii  from first to last their acquaintance lasted ten days but into that time mr polly packed ten years of dreams  he dont seem said johnson to take a serious interest in anything that shop at the corners bound to be snapped up if he dont look out  the girl and mr polly did not meet on every one of those ten days one was sunday and she could not come and on the eighth the school reassembled and she made vague excuses all their meetings amounted to this that she sat on the wall more or less in bounds as she expressed it and let mr polly fall in love with her and try to express it below she sat in a state of irresponsible exaltation watching him and at intervals prodding a vivisecting point of encouragement into himwith that strange passive cruelty which is natural to her sex and age  and mr polly fell in love as though the world had given way beneath him and he had dropped through into another into a world of luminous clouds and of desolate hopeless wildernesses of desiring and of wild valleys of unreasonable ecstasies a world whose infinite miseries were finer and in some inexplicable way sweeter than the purest gold of the daily life whose joysthey were indeed but the merest remote glimpses of joywere brighter than a dying martyrs vision of heaven her smiling face looked down upon him out of heaven her careless pose was the living body of life it was senseless it was utterly foolish but all that was best and richest in mr pollys nature broke like a wave and foamed up at that girls feet and died and never touched her and she sat on the wall and marvelled at him and was amused and once suddenly moved and wrung by his pleading she bent down rather shamefacedly and gave him a freckled tennisblistered little paw to kiss and she looked into his eyes and suddenly felt a perplexity a curious swimming of the mind that made her recoil and stiffen and wonder afterwards and dream  and then with some dim instinct of selfprotection she went and told her three best friends great students of character all of this remarkable phenomenon she had discovered on the other side of the wall  look here said mr polly im wild for the love of you i cant keep up this gesticulations game any more im not a knight treat me as a human man you may sit up there smiling but id die in torments to have you mine for an hour im nobody and nothing but look here will you wait for me for five years youre just a girl yet and it wouldnt be hard  shut up said christabel in an aside he did not hear and something he did not see touched her hand  ive always been just dilletentytating about till now but i could work ive just woke up wait till ive got a chance with the money ive got  but you havent got much money  ive got enough to take a chance with some sort of a chance id find a chance ill do that anyhow ill go away i mean what i sayill stop trifling and shirking if i dont come back it wont matter if i do  her expression had become uneasy suddenly she bent down towards him  dont she said in an undertone  dontwhat  dont go on like this youre different go on being the knight who wants to kiss my hand as hiswhat did you call it the ghost of a smile curved her face gurdrum  but  then through a pause they both stared at each other listening  a muffled tumult on the other side of the wall asserted itself  shut up rosie said a voice  i tell you i will see i cant half hear give me a leg up  you idiot hell see you youre spoiling everything  the bottom dropped out of mr pollys world he felt as people must feel who are going to faint  youve got someone he said aghast  she found life inexpressible to mr polly she addressed some unseen hearers you filthy little beasts she cried with a sharp note of agony in her voice and swung herself back over the wall and vanished there was a squeal of pain and fear and a swift fierce altercation  for a couple of seconds he stood agape  then a wild resolve to confirm his worst sense of what was on the other side of the wall made him seize a log put it against the stones clutch the parapet with insecure fingers and lug himself to a momentary balance on the wall  romance and his goddess had vanished  a redhaired girl with a pigtail was wringing the wrist of a schoolfellow who shrieked with pain and cried mercy mercy ooo christabel  you idiot cried christabel you giggling idiot  two other young ladies made off through the beech trees from this outburst of savagery  then the grip of mr pollys fingers gave and he hit his chin against the stones and slipped clumsily to the ground again scraping his cheek against the wall and hurting his shin against the log by which he had reached the top just for a moment he crouched against the wall  he swore staggered to the pile of logs and sat down  he remained very still for some time with his lips pressed together  fool he said at last you blithering fool and began to rub his shin as though he had just discovered its bruises  afterwards he found his face was wet with bloodwhich was none the less red stuff from the heart because it came from slight abrasions    chapter the sixth  miriam   i  it is an illogical consequence of one human beings illtreatment that we should fly immediately to another but that is the way with us it seemed to mr polly that only a human touch could assuage the smart of his humiliation moreover it had for some undefined reason to be a feminine touch and the number of women in his world was limited  he thought of the larkins familythe larkins whom he had not been near now for ten long days healing people they seemed to him nowhealing simple people they had good hearts and he had neglected them for a mirage if he rode over to them he would be able to talk nonsense and laugh and forget the whirl of memories and thoughts that was spinning round and round so unendurably in his brain  law said mrs larkins come in youre quite a stranger elfrid  been seeing to business said the unveracious polly  none of em aint at ome but miriams just out to do a bit of shopping wont let me shop she wont because im so keerless shes a wonderful manager that girl minnies got some work at the carpet place ope it wont make er ill again shes a loving deliket sort is minnie come into the front parlour its a bit untidy but you got to take us as you find us wot you been doing to your face  bit of a scrase with the bicycle said mr polly  trying to pass a carriage on the on side and he drew up and ran me against a wall  mrs larkins scrutinised it you ought to ave someone look after your scrases she said thats all red and rough it ought to be coldcreamed bring your bicycle into the passage and come in  she straightened up a bit that is to say she increased the dislocation of a number of scattered articles put a workbasket on the top of several books swept two or three dogseared numbers of the ladys own novelist from the table into the broken armchair and proceeded to sketch together the teathings with various such interpolations as law if i aint forgot the butter all the while she talked of annies good spirits and cleverness with her millinery and of minnies affection and miriams relative love of order and management mr polly stood by the window uneasily and thought how good and sincere was the larkins tone it was well to be back again  youre a long time finding that shop of yours said mrs larkins  dont do to be precipitous said mr polly  no said mrs larkins once you got it you got it like choosing a usband you better see you got it good i kept larkins esitating two years i did until i felt sure of him a ansom man e was as you can see by the looks of the girls but ansom is as ansom does youd like a bit of jam to your tea i expect i ope theyll keep their men waiting when the time comes i tell them if they think of marrying it only shows they dont know when theyre well off heres miriam  miriam entered with several parcels in a net and a peevish expression mother she said you might ave prevented my going out with the net with the broken handle ive been cutting my fingers with the string all the way ome then she discovered mr polly and her face brightened  ello elfrid she said where you been all this time  looking round said mr polly  found a shop  one or two likely ones but it takes time  youve got the wrong cups mother  she went into the kitchen disposed of her purchases and returned with the right cups what you done to your face elfrid she asked and came and scrutinised his scratches all rough it is  he repeated his story of the accident and she was sympathetic in a pleasant homely way  you are quiet today she said as they sat down to tea  meditatious said mr polly  quite by accident he touched her hand on the table and she answered his touch  why not thought mr polly and looking up caught mrs larkins eye and flushed guiltily but mrs larkins with unusual restraint said nothing she merely made a grimace enigmatical but in its essence friendly  presently minnie came in with some vague grievance against the manager of the carpetmaking place about his method of estimating piece work her account was redundant defective and highly technical but redeemed by a certain earnestness im never within sixpence of what i reckon to be she said its a bit too ot then mr polly feeling that he was being conspicuously dull launched into a description of the shop he was looking for and the shops he had seen his mind warmed up as he talked  found your tongue again said mrs larkins he had he began to embroider the subject and work upon it for the first time it assumed picturesque and desirable qualities in his mind it stimulated him to see how readily and willingly they accepted his sketches bright ideas appeared in his mind from nowhere he was suddenly enthusiastic  when i get this shop of mine i shall have a cat must make a home for a cat you know  what to catch the mice said mrs larkins  nosleep in the window a venerable signor of a cat tabby cats no good if it isnt tabby cat im going to have and a canary didnt think of that before but a cat and a canary seem to go you know summer weather i shall sit at breakfast in the little room behind the shop sun streaming in the window to rights cat on a chair canary singing andmrs polly  ello said mrs larkins  mrs polly frying an extra bit of bacon bacon singing cat singing canary singing kettle singing mrs polly  but whos mrs polly going to be said mrs larkins  figment of the imagination maam said mr polly put in to fill up picture no face to figure as yet still thats how it will be i can assure you i think i must have a bit of garden johnsons the man for a garden of course he said going off at a tangent but i dont mean a fierce sort of garden earnest industry anxious moments fervous digging shant go in for that sort of garden maam no too much backache for me my garden will be just a patch of sturtiums and sweet pea red brick yard clothes line trellis put up in odd time humorous wind vane creeper up the back of the house  virginia creeper asked miriam  canary creeper said mr polly  you will ave it nice said miriam desirously  rather said mr polly tingalingaling shop  he straightened himself up and then they all laughed  smart little shop he said counter desk all complete umbrella stand carpet on the floor cat asleep on the counter ties and hose on a rail over the counter all right  i wonder you dont set about it right off said miriam  mean to get it exactly right mam said mr polly  have to have a tomcat said mr polly and paused for an expectant moment wouldnt do to open shop one morning you know and find the window full of kittens cant sell kittens  when tea was over he was left alone with minnie for a few minutes and an odd intimation of an incident occurred that left mr polly rather scared and shaken a silence fell between theman uneasy silence he sat with his elbows on the table looking at her all the way from easewood to stamton his erratic imagination had been running upon neat ways of proposing marriage i dont know why it should have done but it had it was a kind of secret exercise that had not had any definite aim at the time but which now recurred to him with extraordinary force he couldnt think of anything in the world that wasnt the gambit to a proposal it was almost irresistibly fascinating to think how immensely a few words from him would excite and revolutionise minnie she was sitting at the table with a workbasket among the tea things mending a glove in order to avoid her share of clearing away  i like cats said minnie after a thoughtful pause im always saying to mother i wish we ad a cat but we couldnt ave a cat erenot with no yard  never had a cat myself said mr polly no  im fond of them said minnie  i like the look of them said mr polly cant exactly call myself fond  i expect i shall get one some day when about you get your shop  i shall have my shop all right before long said mr polly trust me canary bird and all  she shook her head i shall get a cat first she said you never mean anything you say  might get em together said mr polly with his sense of a neat thing outrunning his discretion  why ow dyou mean said minnie suddenly alert  shop and cat thrown in said mr polly in spite of himself and his head swam and he broke out into a cold sweat as he said it  he found her eyes fixed on him with an eager expression mean to say she began as if for verification he sprang to his feet and turned to the window little dog he said and moved doorward hastily eating my bicycle tire i believe he explained and so escaped  he saw his bicycle in the hall and cut it dead  he heard mrs larkins in the passage behind him as he opened the front door  he turned to her thought my bicycle was on fire he said outside funny fancy all right reely little dog outside miriam ready  what for  to go and meet annie  mrs larkins stared at him youre stopping for a bit of supper  if i may said mr polly  youre a rum un said mrs larkins and called miriam  minnie appeared at the door of the room looking infinitely perplexed there aint a little dog anywhere elfrid she said  mr polly passed his hand over his brow i had a most curious sensation felt exactly as though something was up somewhere thats why i said little dog all right now  he bent down and pinched his bicycle tire  you was saying something about a cat elfrid said minnie  give you one he answered without looking up the very day my shop is opened  he straightened himself up and smiled reassuringly trust me he said   ii  when after imperceptible manoeuvres by mrs larkins he found himself starting circuitously through the inevitable recreation ground with miriam to meet annie he found himself quite unable to avoid the topic of the shop that had now taken such a grip upon him a sense of danger only increased the attraction minnies persistent disposition to accompany them had been crushed by a novel and violent and urgently expressed desire on the part of mrs larkins to see her do something in the house sometimes  you really think youll open a shop asked miriam  i hate cribs said mr polly adopting a moderate tone in a shop theres this drawback and that but one is ones own master  that wasnt all talk  not a bit of it  after all he went on a little shop neednt be so bad  its a ome said miriam  its a home  pause  theres no need to keep accounts and that sort of thing if theres no assistant i daresay i could run a shop all right if i wasnt interfered with  i should like to see you in your shop said miriam i expect youd keep everything tremendously neat  the conversation flagged  lets sit down on one of those seats over there said miriam where we can see those blue flowers  they did as she suggested and sat down in a corner where a triangular bed of stock and delphinium brightened the asphalted traceries of the recreation ground  i wonder what they call those flowers she said i always like them theyre handsome  delphicums and larkspurs said mr polly they used to be in the park at port burdock  floriferous corner he added approvingly  he put an arm over the back of the seat and assumed a more comfortable attitude he glanced at miriam who was sitting in a lax thoughtful pose with her eyes on the flowers she was wearing her old dress she had not had time to change and the blue tones of her old dress brought out a certain warmth in her skin and her pose exaggerated whatever was feminine in her rather lean and insufficient body and rounded her flat chest delusively a little line of light lay along her profile the afternoon was full of transfiguring sunshine children were playing noisily in the adjacent sandpit some judas trees were brightly abloom in the villa gardens that bordered the recreation ground and all the place was bright with touches of young summer colour it all merged with the effect of miriam in mr pollys mind  her thoughts found speech one did ought to be happy in a shop she said with a note of unusual softness in her voice  it seemed to him that she was right one did ought to be happy in a shop folly not to banish dreams that made one ache of townless woods and bracken tangles and redhaired linenclad figures sitting in dappled sunshine upon grey and crumbling walls and looking queenly down on one with clear blue eyes cruel and foolish dreams they were that ended in ones being laughed at and made a mock of there was no mockery here  a shops such a respectable thing to be said miriam thoughtfully  i could be happy in a shop he said  his sense of effect made him pause  if i had the right company he added  she became very still  mr polly swerved a little from the conversational icerun upon which he had embarked  im not such a blooming geezer he said as not to be able to sell goods a bit one has to be nosy over ones buying of course but i shall do all right  he stopped and felt falling falling through the aching silence that followed  if you get the right company said miriam  i shall get that all right  you dont mean youve got someone  he found himself plunging  ive got someone in my eye this minute he said  elfrid she said turning on him you dont mean  well did he mean i do he said  not reely she clenched her hands to keep still  he took the conclusive step  well you and me miriam in a little shopwith a cat and a canary he tried too late to get back to a hypothetical note just suppose it  you mean said miriam youre in love with me elfrid  what possible answer can a man give to such a question but yes  regardless of the public park the children in the sandpit and everyone she bent forward and seized his shoulder and kissed him on the lips something lit up in mr polly at the touch he put an arm about her and kissed her back and felt an irrevocable act was sealed he had a curious feeling that it would be very satisfying to marry and have a wifeonly somehow he wished it wasnt miriam her lips were very pleasant to him and the feel of her in his arm  they recoiled a little from each other and sat for a moment flushed and awkwardly silent his mind was altogether incapable of controlling its confusion  i didnt dream said miriam you cared sometimes i thought it was annie sometimes minnie  always liked you better than them said mr polly  i loved you elfrid said miriam since ever we met at your poor fathers funeral leastways i would have done if i had thought you didnt seem to mean anything you said  i cant believe it she added  nor i said mr polly  you mean to marry me and start that little shop  soon as ever i find it said mr polly  i had no more idea when i came out with you  nor me  its like a dream  they said no more for a little while  i got to pinch myself to think its real said miriam what theyll do without me at ome i cant imagine when i tell them  for the life of him mr polly could not tell whether he was fullest of tender anticipations or regretful panic  mothers no good at managingnot a bit annie dont care for ouse work and minnies got no ed for it what theyll do without me i cant imagine  theyll have to do without you said mr polly sticking to his guns  a clock in the town began striking  lor said miriam we shall miss anniesitting ere and lovemaking  she rose and made as if to take mr pollys arm but mr polly felt that their condition must be nakedly exposed to the ridicule of the world by such a linking and evaded her movement  annie was already in sight before a flood of hesitation and terrors assailed mr polly  dont tell anyone yet a bit he said  only mother said miriam firmly   iii  figures are the most shocking things in the world the prettiest little squiggles of blacklooked at in the right light and yet consider the blow they can give you upon the heart you return from a little careless holiday abroad and turn over the page of a newspaper and against the name of that distant vagueconceived railway in mortgages upon which you have embarked the bulk of your capital you see instead of the familiar persistent 956 varying at most to 93 ex div this slightly richer arrangement of marks 76 1278 12  it is like the opening of a pit just under your feet  so too mr pollys happy sense of limitless resources was obliterated suddenly by a vision of this tracery  298  instead of the  350  he had come to regard as the fixed symbol of his affluence  it gave him a disagreeable feeling about the diaphragm akin in a remote degree to the sensation he had when the perfidy of the redhaired schoolgirl became plain to him it made his brow moist  going down a vortex he whispered  by a characteristic feat of subtraction he decided that he must have spent sixtytwo pounds  funererial baked meats he said recalling possible items  the happy dream in which he had been living of long warm days of open roads of limitless unchecked hours of infinite time to look about him vanished like a thing enchanted he was suddenly back in the hard old economic world that exacts work that limits range that discourages phrasing and dispels laughter he saw wood street and its fearful suspenses yawning beneath his feet  and also he had promised to marry miriam and on the whole rather wanted to  he was distraught at supper afterwards when mrs johnson had gone to bed with a slight headache he opened a conversation with johnson  its about time o man i saw about doing something he said riding about and looking at shops all very debonnairious o man but its time i took one for keeps  what did i tell you said johnson  how do you think that corner shop of yours will figure out mr polly asked  youre really meaning it  if its a practable proposition o man assuming its practable whats your idea of the figures  johnson went to the chiffonier got out a letter and tore off the back sheet lets figure it out he said with solemn satisfaction lets see the lowest you could do it on  he squared himself to the task and mr polly sat beside him like a pupil watching the evolution of the grey distasteful figures that were to dispose of his little hoard  what running expenses have we got to provide for said johnson wetting his pencil lets have them first rent  at the end of an hour of hideous speculations johnson decided its close but youll have a chance  mm said mr polly what more does a brave man want  one thing you can do quite easily ive asked about it  whats that o man said mr polly  take the shop without the house above it  i suppose i might put my head in to mind it said mr polly and get a job with my body  not exactly that but i thought youd save a lot if you stayed on herebeing all alone as you are  never thought of that o man said mr polly and reflected silently upon the needlessness of miriam  we were talking of eighty pounds for stock said johnson of course seventyfive is five pounds less isnt it not much else we can cut  no said mr polly  its very interesting all this said johnson folding up the half sheet of paper and unfolding it i wish sometimes i had a business of my own instead of a fixed salary youll have to keep books of course  one wants to know where one is  i should do it all by double entry said johnson a little troublesome at first but far the best in the end  lemme see that paper said mr polly and took it with the feeling of a man who takes a nauseating medicine and scrutinised his cousins neat figures with listless eyes  well said johnson rising and stretching bed better sleep on it o man  right o said mr polly without moving but indeed he could as well have slept upon a bed of thorns  he had a dreadful night it was like the end of the annual holiday only infinitely worse it was like a newly arrived prisoners backward glance at the trees and heather through the prison gates he had to go back to harness and he was as fitted to go in harness as the ordinary domestic cat all night fate with the quiet complacency and indeed at times the very face and gestures of johnson guided him towards that undesired establishment at the corner near the station oh lord he cried id rather go back to cribs i should keep my money anyhow fate never winced  run away to sea whispered mr polly but he knew he wasnt man enough  cut my blooming throat  some braver strain urged him to think of miriam and for a little while he lay still  well o man said johnson when mr polly came down to breakfast and mrs johnson looked up brightly mr polly had never felt breakfast so unattractive before  just a day or so more o manto turn it over in my mind he said  youll get the place snapped up said johnson  there were times in those last few days of coyness with his destiny when his engagement seemed the most negligible of circumstances and timesand these happened for the most part at nights after mrs johnson had indulged everybody in a welsh rarebitwhen it assumed so sinister and portentous an appearance as to make him think of suicide and there were times too when he very distinctly desired to be married now that the idea had got into his head at any cost also he tried to recall all the circumstances of his proposal time after time and never quite succeeded in recalling what had brought the thing off he went over to stamton with a becoming frequency and kissed all his cousins and miriam especially a great deal and found it very stirring and refreshing they all appeared to know and minnie was tearful but resigned mrs larkins met him and indeed enveloped him with unwonted warmth and there was a big pot of household jam for tea and he could not make up his mind to sign his name to anything about the shop though it crawled nearer and nearer to him though the project had materialised now to the extent of a draft agreement with the place for his signature indicated in pencil  one morning just after mr johnson had gone to the station mr polly wheeled his bicycle out into the road went up to his bedroom packed his long white nightdress a comb and a toothbrush in a manner that was as offhand as he could make it informed mrs johnson who was manifestly curious that he was off for a day or two to clear his head and fled forthright into the road and mounting turned his wheel towards the tropics and the equator and the south coast of england and indeed more particularly to where the little village of fishbourne slumbers and sleeps  when he returned four days later he astonished johnson beyond measure by remarking so soon as the shop project was reopened  ive took a little contraption at fishbourne o man that i fancy suits me better  he paused and then added in a manner if possible even more offhand  oh and im going to have a bit of a nuptial over at stamton with one of the larkins cousins  nuptial said johnson  wedding bells o man benedictine collapse  on the whole johnson showed great selfcontrol its your own affair o man he said when things had been more clearly explained and i hope you wont feel sorry when its too late  but mrs johnson was first of all angrily silent and then reproachful i dont see what weve done to be made fools of like this she said after all the trouble weve ad to make you comfortable and see after you out late and sitting up and everything and then you go off as sly as sly without a word and get a shop behind our backs as though you thought we meant to steal your money i avent patience with such deceitfulness and i didnt think it of you elfrid and now the letting seasons arf gone by and what i shall do with that room of yours ive no idea frank is frank and fair play fair play so i was told anyow when i was a girl just as long as it suits you to stay ere you stay ere and then its off and no thank you whether we like it or not johnsons too easy with you e sits there and doesnt say a word and night after night es been addin and thinkin for you instead of seeing to his own affairs  she paused for breath  unfortunate amoor said mr polly apologetically and indistinctly didnt expect it myself   iv  mr pollys marriage followed with a certain inevitableness  he tried to assure himself that he was acting upon his own forceful initiative but at the back of his mind was the completest realisation of his powerlessness to resist the gigantic social forces he had set in motion he had got to marry under the will of society even as in times past it has been appointed for other sunny souls under the will of society that they should be led out by serious and unavoidable fellowcreatures and ceremoniously drowned or burnt or hung he would have preferred infinitely a more observant and less conspicuous rôle but the choice was no longer open to him he did his best to play his part and he procured some particularly neat check trousers to do it in the rest of his costume except for some bright yellow gloves a grey and blue mixture tie and that the broad crape hatband was changed for a livelier piece of silk were the things he had worn at the funeral of his father so nearly akin are human joy and sorrow  the larkins sisters had done wonders with grey sateen the idea of orange blossom and white veils had been abandoned reluctantly on account of the expense of cabs a novelette in which the heroine had stood at the altar in a modest goingaway dress had materially assisted this decision miriam was frankly tearful and so indeed was annie but with laughter as well to carry it off mr polly heard annie say something vague about never getting a chance because of miriam always sticking about at home like a cat at a mousehole that became as people say food for thought mrs larkins was from the first flushed garrulous and wet and smeared by copious weeping an incredibly soaked and crumpled and usedup pocket handkerchief never left the clutch of her plump red hand goo girls all of them she kept on saying in a tremulous voice suchgoogoogoogirls she wetted mr polly dreadfully when she kissed him her emotion affected the buttons down the back of her bodice and almost the last filial duty miriam did before entering on her new life was to close that gaping orifice for the eleventh time her bonnet was small and illbalanced black adorned with red roses and first it got over her right eye until annie told her of it and then she pushed it over her left eye and looked ferocious for a space and after that baptismal kissing of mr polly the delicate millinery took fright and climbed right up to the back part of her head and hung on there by a pin and flapped piteously at all the larger waves of emotion that filled the gathering mr polly became more and more aware of that bonnet as time went on until he felt for it like a thing alive towards the end it had yawning fits  the company did not include mrs johnson but johnson came with a manifest surreptitiousness and backed against walls and watched mr polly with doubt and speculation in his large grey eyes and whistled noiselessly and doubtful on the edge of things he was so to speak to be best man sotto voce a sprinkling of girls in gay hats from miriams place of business appeared in church great nudgers all of them but only two came on afterwards to the house mrs punt brought her son with his everwidening mind it was his first wedding and a larkins uncle a mr voules a licenced victualler very kindly drove over in a gig from sommershill with a plump welldressed wife to give the bride away one or two total strangers drifted into the church and sat down observantly far away  this sprinkling of people seemed only to enhance the cool brown emptiness of the church the rows and rows of empty pews disengaged prayerbooks and abandoned hassocks it had the effect of a preposterous misfit johnson consulted with a thinlegged shortskirted verger about the disposition of the party the officiating clergy appeared distantly in the doorway of the vestry putting on his surplice and relapsed into a contemplative cheekscratching that was manifestly habitual before the bride arrived mr pollys sense of the church found an outlet in whispered criticisms of ecclesiastical architecture with johnson early norman arches eh he said or perpendicular  cant say said johnson  telessated pavements all right  its well laid anyhow  cant say i admire the altar scrappy rather with those flowers  he coughed behind his hand and cleared his throat at the back of his mind he was speculating whether flight at this eleventh hour would be criminal or merely reprehensible bad taste a murmur from the nudgers announced the arrival of the bridal party  the little procession from a remote door became one of the enduring memories of mr pollys life the little verger had bustled to meet it and arrange it according to tradition and morality in spite of mrs larkins dont take her from me yet he made miriam go first with mr voules the bridesmaids followed and then himself hopelessly unable to disentangle himself from the whispering maternal anguish of mrs larkins mrs voules a compact rounded woman with a square expressionless face imperturbable dignity and a dress of considerable fashion completed the procession  mr pollys eye fell first upon the bride the sight of her filled him with a curious stir of emotion alarm desire affection respectand a queer element of reluctant dislike all played their part in that complex eddy the grey dress made her a stranger to him made her stiff and commonplace she was not even the rather drooping form that had caught his facile sense of beauty when he had proposed to her in the recreation ground there was something too that did not please him in the angle of her hat it was indeed an illconceived hat with large aimless rosettes of pink and grey then his mind passed to mrs larkins and the bonnet that was to gain such a hold upon him it seemed to be flagsignalling as she advanced and to the two eager unrefined sisters he was acquiring  a freak of fancy set him wondering where and when in the future a beautiful girl with red hair might march along some splendid aisle never mind he became aware of mr voules  he became aware of mr voules as a watchful blue eye of intense forcefulness it was the eye of a man who has got hold of a situation he was a fat short redfaced man clad in a tightfitting tail coat of black and white check with a coquettish bow tie under the lowest of a number of crisp little red chins he held the bride under his arm with an air of invincible championship and his free arm flourished a grey top hat of an equestrian type mr polly instantly learnt from the eye that mr voules knew all about his longing for flight its azure pupil glowed with disciplined resolution it said ive come to give this girl away and give her away i will im here now and things have to go on all right so dont think of it any moreand mr polly didnt a faint phantom of a certain lill dog that had hovered just beneath the threshold of consciousness vanished into black impossibility until the conclusive moment of the service was attained the eye of mr voules watched mr polly relentlessly and then instantly he relieved guard and blew his nose into a voluminous and richly patterned handkerchief and sighed and looked round for the approval and sympathy of mrs voules and nodded to her brightly like one who has always foretold a successful issue to things mr polly felt then like a marionette that has just dropped off its wire but it was long before that release arrived  he became aware of miriam breathing close to him  hullo he said and feeling that was clumsy and would meet the eyes disapproval grey dresssuits you no end  miriams eyes shone under her hatbrim  not reely she whispered  youre all right he said with the feeling of observation and criticism stiffening his lips he cleared his throat  the vergers hand pushed at him from behind someone was driving miriam towards the altar rail and the clergyman were in for it said mr polly to her sympathetically where here right o he was interested for a moment or so in something indescribably habitual in the clergymans pose what a lot of weddings he must have seen sick he must be of them  dont let your attention wander said the eye  got the ring whispered johnson  pawned it yesterday answered mr polly and then had a dreadful moment under that pitiless scrutiny while he felt in the wrong waistcoat pocket  the officiating clergy sighed deeply began and married them wearily and without any hitch  dbloved we gathd gether sight o gard n face this congation join gather man worn holy matmy which is onbl state stooted by gard in times mans innocency  mr pollys thoughts wandered wide and far and once again something like a cold hand touched his heart and he saw a sweet face in sunshine under the shadow of trees  someone was nudging him it was johnsons finger diverted his eyes to the crucial place in the prayerbook to which they had come  wiltou lover cumfer oner keeper sickness and health  say i will  mr polly moistened his lips i will he said hoarsely  miriam nearly inaudible answered some similar demand  then the clergyman said who gifs worn married to this man  well im doing that said mr voules in a refreshingly full voice and looking round the church you see me and martha larkins being cousins  he was silenced by the clergymans rapid grip directing the exchange of hands  pete arf me said the clergyman to mr polly take thee mirum wed wife  take thee mirum wed wife said mr polly  have hold this day ford  have hold this day ford  betworse richpoo  bet worsh richpoo  then came miriams turn  lego hands said the clergyman got the ring no on the book so here pete arf me withis ring ivy wed  withis ring ivy wed  so it went on blurred and hurried like the momentary vision of an utterly beautiful thing seen through the smoke of a passing train  now my boy said mr voules at last gripping mr pollys elbow tightly youve got to sign the registry and there you are done  before him stood miriam a little stiffly the hat with a slight rake across her forehead and a kind of questioning hesitation in her face mr voules urged him past her  it was astounding she was his wife  and for some reason miriam and mrs larkins were sobbing and annie was looking grave hadnt they after all wanted him to marry her because if that was the case  he became aware for the first time of the presence of uncle pentstemon in the background but approaching wearing a tie of a light mineral blue colour and grinning and sucking enigmatically and judiciously round his principal tooth   v  it was in the vestry that the force of mr voules personality began to show at its true value he seemed to open out and spread over things directly the restraints of the ceremony were at an end  everything he said to the clergyman excellent he also shook hands with mrs larkins who clung to him for a space and kissed miriam on the cheek first kiss for me he said anyhow  he led mr polly to the register by the arm and then got chairs for mrs larkins and his wife he then turned on miriam now young people he said one or i shall again  thats right said mr voules same again miss  mr polly was overcome with modest confusion and turning found a refuge from this publicity in the arms of mrs larkins then in a state of profuse moisture he was assaulted and kissed by annie and minnie who were immediately kissed upon some indistinctly stated grounds by mr voules who then kissed the entirely impassive mrs voules and smacked his lips and remarked home again safe and sound then with a strange harrowing cry mrs larkins seized upon and bedewed miriam with kisses annie and minnie kissed each other and johnson went abruptly to the door of the vestry and stared into the churchno doubt with ideas of sanctuary in his mind like a bit of a kiss round sometimes said mr voules and made a kind of hissing noise with his teeth and suddenly smacked his hands together with great éclat several times meanwhile the clergyman scratched his cheek with one hand and fiddled the pen with the other and the verger coughed protestingly  the dog carts just outside said mr voules no walking home today for the bride mam  not going to drive us cried annie  the happy pair miss your turn soon  get out said annie i shant marryever  you wont be able to help it youll have to do itjust to disperse the crowd mr voules laid his hand on mr pollys shoulder the bridegroom gives his arm to the bride hands across and down the middle prump prump perumppumppumppump  mr polly found himself and the bride leading the way towards the western door  mrs larkins passed close to uncle pentstemon sobbing too earnestly to be aware of him such a googoogoogirl she sobbed  didnt think id come did you said uncle pentstemon but she swept past him too busy with the expression of her feelings to observe him  she didnt think id come i lay said uncle pentstemon a little foiled but effecting an auditory lodgment upon johnson  i dont know said johnson uncomfortably  i suppose you were asked how are you getting on  i was arst said uncle pentstemon and brooded for a moment  i goes about seeing wonders he added and then in a sort of enhanced undertone one of er girls gettin married thats what i mean by wonders lords goodness wow  nothing the matter asked johnson  got it in the back for a moment going to be a change of weather i suppose said uncle pentstemon i brought er a nice present too what i got in this passel vallyble old tea caddy that uset be my mothers what i kep my baccy in for years and yearstill the hinge at the back got broke it aint been no use to me particular since so thinks i drat it i may as well give it er as not  mr polly found himself emerging from the western door  outside a crowd of halfadozen adults and about fifty children had collected and hailed the approach of the newly wedded couple with a faint indeterminate cheer all the children were holding something in little bags and his attention was caught by the expression of vindictive concentration upon the face of a small bigeared boy in the foreground he didnt for the moment realise what these things might import then he received a stinging handful of rice in the ear and a great light shone  not yet you young fool he heard mr voules saying behind him and then a second handful spoke against his hat  not yet said mr voules with increasing emphasis and mr polly became aware that he and miriam were the focus of two crescents of small boys each with the light of massacre in his eyes and a grubby fist clutching into a paper bag for rice and that mr voules was warding off probable discharges with a large red hand  the dog cart was in charge of a loafer and the horse and the whip were adorned with white favours and the back seat was confused but not untenable with hampers up we go said mr voules old birds in front and young ones behind an ominous group of illrestrained ricethrowers followed them up as they mounted  get your handkerchief for your face said mr polly to his bride and took the place next the pavement with considerable heroism held on gripped his hat shut his eyes and prepared for the worst off said mr voules and a concentrated fire came stinging mr pollys face  the horse shied and when the bridegroom could look at the world again it was manifest the dog cart had just missed an electric tram by a hairsbreadth and far away outside the church railings the verger and johnson were battling with an active crowd of small boys for the life of the rest of the larkins family mrs punt and her son had escaped across the road the son trailing and stumbling at the end of a remorseless arm but uncle pentstemon encumbered by the teacaddy was the centre of a little circle of his own and appeared to be dratting them all very heartily remoter a policeman approached with an air of tranquil unconsciousness  steady you idiot steady cried mr voules and then over his shoulder i brought that rice i like old customs whoa steady  the dog cart swerved violently and then evoking a shout of groundless alarm from a cyclist took a corner and the rest of the wedding party was hidden from mr pollys eyes   vi  well get the stuff into the house before the old gal comes along said mr voules if youll hold the hoss  how about the key asked mr polly  i got the key coming  and while mr polly held the sweating horse and dodged the foam that dripped from its bit the house absorbed miriam and mr voules altogether mr voules carried in the various hampers he had brought with him and finally closed the door behind him  for some time mr polly remained alone with his charge in the little blind alley outside the larkins house while the neighbours scrutinised him from behind their blinds he reflected that he was a married man that he must look very like a fool that the head of a horse is a silly shape and its eye a bulger he wondered what the horse thought of him and whether it really liked being held and patted on the neck or whether it only submitted out of contempt did it know he was married then he wondered if the clergyman had thought him much of an ass and then whether the individual lurking behind the lace curtains of the front room next door was a man or a woman a door opened over the way and an elderly gentleman in a kind of embroidered fez appeared smoking a pipe with a quiet satisfied expression he regarded mr polly for some time with mild but sustained curiosity finally he called hi  hullo said mr polly  you neednt old that orse said the old gentleman  spirited beast said mr polly andwith some faint analogy to ginger beer in his mindhes up today  e wont turn isself round said the old gentleman anyow and there aint no way through for im to go  verbum sap said mr polly and abandoned the horse and turned to the door it opened to him just as mrs larkins on the arm of johnson followed by annie minnie two friends mrs punt and her son and at a slight distance uncle pentstemon appeared round the corner  theyre coming he said to miriam and put an arm about her and gave her a kiss  she was kissing him back when they were startled violently by the shying of two empty hampers into the passage then mr voules appeared holding a third  here youll ave plenty of time for that presently he said get these hampers away before the old girl comes i got a cold collation here to make her sit up my eye  miriam took the hampers and mr polly under compulsion from mr voules went into the little front room a profuse pie and a large ham had been added to the modest provision of mrs larkins and a number of selectlooking bottles shouldered the bottle of sherry and the bottle of port she had got to grace the feast they certainly went better with the iced wedding cake in the middle mrs voules still impassive stood by the window regarding these things with a faint approval  makes it look a bit thicker eh said mr voules and blew out both his cheeks and smacked his hands together violently several times surprise the old girl no end  he stood back and smiled and bowed with arms extended as the others came clustering at the door  why unclé voules cried annie with a rising note  it was his reward  and then came a great wedging and squeezing and crowding into the little room nearly everyone was hungry and eyes brightened at the sight of the pie and the ham and the convivial array of bottles sit down everyone cried mr voules leaning against anything counts as sitting and makes it easier to shake down the grub  the two friends from miriams place of business came into the room among the first and then wedged themselves so hopelessly against johnson in an attempt to get out again and take off their things upstairs that they abandoned the attempt amid the struggle mr polly saw uncle pentstemon relieve himself of his parcel by giving it to the bride here he said and handed it to her weddin present he explained and added with a confidential chuckle i never thought id ave to give you oneever  who says steak and kidney pie bawled mr voules who says steak and kidney pie you ave a drop of old tommy martha thats what you want to steady you sit down everyone and dont all speak at once who says steak and kidney pie  vocificeratious whispered mr polly convivial vocificerations  bit of am with it shouted mr voules poising a slice of ham on his knife anyone ave a bit of am with it wont that little man of yours mrs puntwont e ave a bit of am  and now ladies and gentlemen said mr voules still standing and dominating the crammed roomful now you got your plates filled and something i can warrant you good in your glasses wot about drinking the ealth of the bride  eat a bit fust said uncle pentstemon speaking with his mouth full amidst murmurs of applause eat a bit fust  so they did and the plates clattered and the glasses chinked  mr polly stood shoulder to shoulder with johnson for a moment  in for it said mr polly cheeringly cheer up o man and peck a bit no reason why you shouldnt eat you know  the punt boy stood on mr pollys boots for a minute struggling violently against the compunction of mrs punts grip  pie said the punt boy pie  you sit ere and ave am my lord said mrs punt prevailing pie you cant ave and you wont  lor bless my heart mrs punt protested mr voules let the boy ave a bit if he wants itwedding and all  you avent ad im sick on your ands uncle voules said mrs punt else you wouldnt want to humour his fancies as you do  i cant help feeling its a mistake o man said johnson in a confidential undertone i cant help feeling youve been rash lets hope for the best  always glad of good wishes o man said mr polly youd better have a drink of something anyhow sit down to it  johnson subsided gloomily and mr polly secured some ham and carried it off and sat himself down on the sewing machine on the floor in the corner to devour it he was hungry and a little cut off from the rest of the company by mrs voules hat and back and he occupied himself for a time with ham and his own thoughts he became aware of a series of jangling concussions on the table he craned his neck and discovered that mr voules was standing up and leaning forward over the table in the manner distinctive of afterdinner speeches tapping upon the table with a black bottle ladies and gentlemen said mr voules raising his glass solemnly in the empty desert of sound he had made and paused for a second or so ladies and gentlementhe bride he searched his mind for some suitable wreath of speech and brightened at last with discovery heres luck to her he said at last  heres luck said johnson hopelessly but resolutely and raised his glass everybody murmured heres luck  luck said mr polly unseen in his corner lifting a forkful of ham  thats all right said mr voules with a sigh of relief at having brought off a difficult operation and now whos for a bit more pie  for a time conversation was fragmentary again but presently mr voules rose from his chair again he had subsided with a contented smile after his first oratorical effort and produced a silence by renewed hammering ladies and gents he said fill up for the second toastthe happy bridegroom he stood for half a minute searching his mind for the apt phrase that came at last in a rush heres hic luck to him said mr voules  luck to him said everyone and mr polly standing up behind mrs voules bowed amiably amidst enthusiasm  he may say what he likes said mrs larkins hes got luck that girls a treasure of treasures and always has been ever since she tried to nurse her own little sister being but three at the time and fell the full flight of stairs from top to bottom no hurt that any outward eye as even seen but always ready and helpful always tidying and busy a treasure i must say and a treasure i will say giving no more than her due  she was silenced altogether by a rapping sound that would not be denied mr voules had been struck by a fresh idea and was standing up and hammering with the bottle again  the third toast ladies and gentlemen he said fill up please the mother of the bride ier uoo ere ladies and gem eres luck to er   vii  the dingy little room was stuffy and crowded to its utmost limit and mr pollys skies were dark with the sense of irreparable acts everybody seemed noisy and greedy and doing foolish things miriam still in that unbecoming hatfor presently they had to start off to the station togethersat just beyond mrs punt and her son doing her share in the hospitalities and ever and again glancing at him with a deliberately encouraging smile once she leant over the back of the chair to him and whispered cheeringly soon be together now next to her sat johnson profoundly silent and then annie talking vigorously to a friend uncle pentstemon was eating voraciously opposite but with a kindling eye for annie mrs larkins sat next to mr voules she was unable to eat a mouthful she declared it would choke her but ever and again mr voules wooed her to swallow a little drop of liquid refreshment  there seemed a lot of rice upon everybody in their hats and hair and the folds of their garments  presently mr voules was hammering the table for the fourth time in the interests of the best man  all feasts come to an end at last and the breakup of things was precipitated by alarming symptoms on the part of master punt he was taken out hastily after a whispered consultation and since he had got into the corner between the fireplace and the cupboard that meant everyone moving to make way for him johnson took the opportunity to say wellso long to anyone who might be listening and disappear mr polly found himself smoking a cigarette and walking up and down outside in the company of uncle pentstemon while mr voules replaced bottles in hampers and prepared for departure and the womenkind of the party crowded upstairs with the bride mr polly felt taciturn but the events of the day had stirred the mind of uncle pentstemon to speech and so he spoke discursively and disconnectedly a little heedless of his listener as wise old men will  they do say said uncle pentstemon one funeral makes many this time its a wedding but its all very much of a muchness said uncle pentstemon  am do get in my teeth nowadays said uncle pentstemon i cant understand it tisnt

laugh it off i laughed er off i did dratted lumpin baggage  for a while he mused malevolently upon annie and routed out a reluctant crumb from some coy sittingout place in his tooth  wimmins a toss up

on the ed with sumpthin pretty quick i dont think i could abide a grizzler said uncle pentstemon id liefer ave a lumpabout like that other gal i would indeed i lay id make er stop laughing after a bit for all er airs and mind where her clumsy great feet went  a mans got to tackle em whatever they be said uncle pentstemon summing up the shrewd observation of an oldworld life time good or bad said uncle pentstemon raising his voice fearlessly a mans got to tackle em   viii  at last it was time for the two young people to catch the train for waterloo en route for fishbourne they had to hurry and as a concluding glory of matrimony they travelled secondclass and were seen off by all the rest of the party except the punts master punt being now beyond any question unwell  off the train moved out of the station  mr polly remained waving his hat and mrs polly her handkerchief until they were hidden under the bridge the dominating figure to the last was mr voules he had followed them along the platform waving the equestrian grey hat and kissing his hand to the bride  they subsided into their seats  got a compartment to ourselves anyhow said mrs polly after a pause  silence for a moment  the rice e must ave bought pounds and pounds  mr polly felt round his collar at the thought  aint you going to kiss me elfrid now were alone together  he roused himself to sit forward hands on knees cocked his hat over one eye and assumed an expression of avidity becoming to the occasion  never he said ever and feigned to be selecting a place to kiss with great discrimination  come here he said and drew her to him  be careful of my at said mrs polly yielding awkwardly    chapter the seventh  the little shop at fishbourne   i  for fifteen years mr polly was a respectable shopkeeper in fishbourne  years they were in which every day was tedious and when they were gone it was as if they had gone in a flash but now mr polly had good looks no more he was as i have described him in the beginning of this story thirtyseven and fattish in a not very healthy way dull and yellowish about the complexion and with discontented wrinklings round his eyes he sat on the stile above fishbourne and cried to the heavens above him oh rooootten beeastly silly hole and he wore a rather shabby black morning coat and vest and his tie was richly splendid being from stock and his golf cap aslant over one eye  fifteen years ago and it might have seemed to you that the queer little flower of mr pollys imagination must be altogether withered and dead and with no living seed left in any part of him but indeed it still lived as an insatiable hunger for bright and delightful experiences for the gracious aspects of things for beauty he still read books when he had a chance books that told of glorious places abroad and glorious times that wrung a rich humour from life and contained the delight of words freshly and expressively grouped but alas there are not many such books and for the newspapers and the cheap fiction that abounded more and more in the world mr polly had little taste there was no epithet in them and there was no one to talk to as he loved to talk and he had to mind his shop  it was a reluctant little shop from the beginning  he had taken it to escape the doom of johnsons choice and because fishbourne had a hold upon his imagination he had disregarded the illbuilt cramped rooms behind it in which he would have to lurk and live the relentless limitations of its dimensions the inconvenience of an underground kitchen that must necessarily be the livingroom in winter the narrow yard behind giving upon the yard of the royal fishbourne hotel the tiresome sitting and waiting for custom the restricted prospects of trade he had visualised himself and miriam first as at breakfast on a clear bright winter morning amidst a tremendous smell of bacon and then as having muffins for tea he had also thought of sitting on the beach on sunday afternoons and of going for a walk in the country behind the town and picking marguerites and poppies but in fact miriam and he were extremely cross at breakfast and it didnt run to muffins at tea and she didnt think it looked well she said to go trapesing about the country on sundays  it was unfortunate that miriam never took to the house from the first she did not like it when she saw it and liked it less as she explored it theres too many stairs she said and the coal being indoors will make a lot of work  didnt think of that said mr polly following her round  itll be a hard house to keep clean said miriam  white paints all very well in its way said miriam but it shows the dirt something fearful better ave ad it nicely grained  theres a kind of place here said mr polly where we might have some flowers in pots  not me said miriam ive ad trouble enough with minnie and er musk  they stayed for a week in a cheap boarding house before they moved in they had bought some furniture in stamton mostly secondhand but with new cheap cutlery and china and linen and they had supplemented this from the fishbourne shops miriam relieved from the hilarious associations of home developed a meagre and serious quality of her own and went about with knitted brows pursuing some ideal of aving everything right mr polly gave himself to the arrangement of the shop with a certain zest and whistled a good deal until miriam appeared and said that it went through her head so soon as he had taken the shop he had filled the window with aggressive posters announcing in no measured terms that he was going to open and now he was getting his stuff put out he was resolved to show fishbourne what window dressing could do he meant to give them boater straws imitation panamas bathing dresses with novelties in stripes light flannel shirts summer ties and readymade flannel trousers for men youths and boys incidentally he watched the small fishmonger over the way and had a glimpse of the china dealer next door and wondered if a friendly nod would be out of place and on the first sunday in this new life he and miriam arrayed themselves with great care he in his weddingfuneral hat and coat and she in her goingaway dress and went processionally to church a more respectable looking couple you could hardly imagine and looked about them  things began to settle down next week into their places a few customers came chiefly for bathing suits and hat guards and on saturday night the cheapest straw hats and ties and mr polly found himself more and more drawn towards the shop door and the social charm of the street he found the china dealer unpacking a crate at the edge of the pavement and remarked that it was a fine day the china dealer gave a reluctant assent and plunged into the crate in a manner that presented no encouragement to a loquacious neighbour  zealacious commerciality whispered mr polly to that unfriendly back view   ii  miriam combined earnestness of spirit with great practical incapacity the house was never clean nor tidy but always being frightfully disarranged for cleaning or tidying up and she cooked because food had to be cooked and with a sound moralists entire disregard of the quality of the consequences the food came from her hands done rather than improved and looking as uncomfortable as savages clothed under duress by a missionary with a stock of outsizes such food is too apt to behave resentfully rebel and work obi she ceased to listen to her husbands talk from the day she married him and ceased to unwrinkle the kink in her brow at his presence giving herself up to mental states that had a quality of secret preoccupation and she developed an idea for which perhaps there was legitimate excuse that he was lazy he seemed to stand about in the shop a great deal to readan indolent habitand presently to seek company for talking he began to attend the bar parlour of the gods providence inn with some frequency and would have done so regularly in the evening if cards which bored him to death had not arrested conversation but the perpetual foolish variation of the permutations and combinations of two and fifty cards taken five at a time and the meagre surprises and excitements that ensue had no charms for mr pollys mind which was at once too vivid in its impressions and too easily fatigued  it was soon manifest the shop paid only in the least exacting sense and miriam did not conceal her opinion that he ought to bestir himself and do things though what he was to do was hard to say you see when you have once sunken your capital in a shop you do not very easily get it out again if customers will not come to you cheerfully and freely the law sets limits upon the compulsion you may exercise you cannot pursue people about the streets of a watering place compelling them either by threats or importunity to buy flannel trousers additional sources of income for a tradesman are not always easy to find wintershed at the bicycle and gramaphone shop to the right played the organ in the church and clamp of the toy shop was pew opener and so forth gambell the greengrocer waited at table and his wife cooked and carter the watchmaker left things to his wife while he went about the world winding clocks but mr polly had none of these arts and wouldnt in spite of miriams quietly persistent protests get any other and on summer evenings he would ride his bicycle about the country and if he discovered a sale where there were books he would as often as not waste half the next day in going again to acquire a job lot of them haphazard and bring them home tied about with a string and hide them from miriam under the counter in the shop that is a heartbreaking thing for any wife with a serious investigatory turn of mind to discover she was always thinking of burning these finds but her natural turn for economy prevailed with her  the books he read during those fifteen years he read everything he got except theology and as he read his little unsuccessful circumstances vanished and the wonder of life returned to him the routine of reluctant getting up opening shop pretending to dust it with zest breakfasting with a shop egg underdone or overdone or a herring raw or charred and coffee made miriams way and full of little particles the return to the shop the morning paper the standing standing at the door saying how do to passersby or getting a bit of gossip or watching unusual visitors all these things vanished as the auditorium of a theatre vanishes when the stage is lit he acquired hundreds of books at last old dusty books books with torn covers and broken covers fat books whose backs were naked string and glue an inimical litter to miriam  there was for example the voyages of la perouse with many careful explicit woodcuts and the frankest revelations of the ways of the eighteenth century sailorman homely adventurous drunken incontinent and delightful until he floated smooth and slow with all sails set and mirrored in the glassy water until his head was full of the thought of shining kindly brownskinned women who smiled at him and wreathed his head with unfamiliar flowers he had too a piece of a book about the lost palaces of yucatan those vast terraces buried in primordial forest of whose makers there is now no human memory with la perouse he linked the island nights entertainments and it never palled upon him that in the dusky stabbing of the island of voices something poured over the stabbers hands like warm tea queer incommunicable joy it is the joy of the vivid phrase that turns the statement of the horridest fact to beauty  and another book which had no beginning for him was the second volume of the travels of the abbés hue and gabet he followed those two sweet souls from their lessons in thibetan under sandura the bearded who called them donkeys to their infinite benefit and stole their store of butter through a hundred misadventures to the very heart of lhassa and it was a thirst in him that was never quenched to find the other volume and whence they came and who in fact they were he read fenimore cooper and tom cringles log side by side with joseph conrad and dreamt of the manyhued humanity of the east and west indies until his heart ached to see those sunsoaked lands before he died conrads prose had a pleasure for him that he was never able to define a peculiar deep coloured effect he found too one day among a pile of soiled sixpenny books at port burdock to which place he sometimes rode on his ageing bicycle bart kennedys a sailor tramp all written in livid jerks and had forever after a kindlier and more understanding eye for every burly rough who slouched through fishbourne high street sterne he read with a wavering appreciation and some perplexity but except for the pickwick papers for some reason that i do not understand he never took at all kindly to dickens yet he liked lever and thackerays catherine and all dumas until he got to the vicomte de bragelonne i am puzzled by his insensibility to dickens and i record it as a good historian should with an admission of my perplexity it is much more understandable that he had no love for scott and i suppose it was because of his ignorance of the proper pronunciation of words that he infinitely preferred any prose to any metrical writing  a book he browsed over with a recurrent pleasure was watertons wanderings in south america he would even amuse himself by inventing descriptions of other birds in the watertonian manner new birds that he invented birds with peculiarities that made him chuckle when they occurred to him he tried to make rusper the ironmonger share this joy with him he read bates too about the amazon but when he discovered that you could not see one bank from the other he lost through some mysterious action of the soul that again i cannot understand at least a tithe of the pleasure he had taken in that river but he read all sorts of things a book of old keltic stories collected by joyce charmed him and mitfords tales of old japan and a number of papercovered volumes tales from blackwood he had acquired at easewood remained a standby he developed a quite considerable acquaintance with the plays of william shakespeare and in his dreams he wore cinque cento or elizabethan clothes and walked about a stormy ruffling taverning teeming world great land of sublimated things thou world of books happy asylum refreshment and refuge from the world of everyday  the essential thing of those fifteen long years of shopkeeping is mr polly well athwart the counter of his rather illlit shop lost in a book or rousing himself with a sigh to attend to business  meanwhile he got little exercise indigestion grew with him until it ruled all his moods he fattened and deteriorated physically moods of distress invaded and darkened his skies little things irritated him more and more and casual laughter ceased in him his hair began to come off until he had a large bald space at the back of his head suddenly one day it came to himforgetful of those books and all he had lived and seen through themthat he had been in his shop for exactly fifteen years that he would soon be forty and that his life during that time had not been worth living that it had been in apathetic and feebly hostile and critical company ugly in detail and mean in scopeand that it had brought him at last to an outlook utterly hopeless and grey   iii  i have already had occasion to mention indeed i have quoted a certain highbrowed gentleman living at highbury wearing a golden pincenez and writing for the most part in that beautiful room the library of the reform club there he wrestles with what he calls social problems in a bloodless but at times i think one must admit an extremely illuminating manner he has a fixed idea that something called a collective intelligence is wanted in the world which means in practice that you and i and everyone have to think about things frightfully hard and pool the results and oblige ourselves to be shamelessly and persistently clear and truthful and support and respect i suppose a perfect horde of professors and writers and artists and illgroomed difficult people instead of using our brains in a moderate sensible manner to play golf and bridge pretending a sense of humour prevents our doing anything else with them and generally taking life in a nice easy gentlemanly way confound him well this domeheaded monster of intellect alleges that mr polly was unhappy entirely through that  a rapidly complicating society he writes which as a whole declines to contemplate its future or face the intricate problems of its organisation is in exactly the position of a man who takes no thought of dietary or regimen who abstains from baths and exercise and gives his appetites free play it accumulates useless and aimless lives as a man accumulates fat and morbid products in his blood it declines in its collective efficiency and vigour and secretes discomfort and misery every phase of its evolution is accompanied by a maximum of avoidable distress and inconvenience and human waste  nothing can better demonstrate the collective dulness of our community the crying need for a strenuous intellectual renewal than the consideration of that vast mass of useless uncomfortable undereducated undertrained and altogether pitiable people we contemplate when we use that inaccurate and misleading term the lower middle class a great proportion of the lower middle class should properly be assigned to the unemployed and the unemployable they are only not that because the possession of some small hoard of money savings during a period of wage earning an insurance policy or suchlike capital prevents a direct appeal to the rates but they are doing little or nothing for the community in return for what they consume they have no understanding of any relation of service to the community they have never been trained nor their imaginations touched to any social purpose a great proportion of small shopkeepers for example are people who have through the inefficiency that comes from inadequate training and sheer aimlessness or improvements in machinery or the drift of trade been thrown out of employment and who set up in needless shops as a method of eking out the savings upon which they count they contrive to make sixty or seventy per cent of their expenditure the rest is drawn from the shrinking capital essentially their lives are failures not the sharp and tragic failure of the labourer who gets out of work and starves but a slow chronic process of consecutive small losses which may end if the individual is exceptionally fortunate in an impoverished death bed before actual bankruptcy or destitution supervenes their chances of ascendant means are less in their shops than in any lottery that was ever planned the secular development of transit and communications has made the organisation of distributing businesses upon large and economical lines inevitable except in the chaotic confusions of newly opened countries the day when a man might earn an independent living by unskilled or practically unskilled retailing has gone for ever yet every year sees the melancholy procession towards petty bankruptcy and imprisonment for debt go on and there is no statesmanship in us to avert it every issue of every trade journal has its four or five columns of abridged bankruptcy proceedings nearly every item in which means the final collapse of another struggling family upon the resources of the community and continually a fresh supply of superfluous artisans and shop assistants coming out of employment with savings or help from relations of widows with a husbands insurance money of the illtrained sons of parsimonious fathers replaces the fallen in the illequipped jerrybuilt shops that everywhere abound  i quote these fragments from a gifted if unpleasant contemporary for what they are worth i feel this has come in here as the broad aspect of this history i come back to mr polly sitting upon his gate and swearing in the east wind and i so returning have a sense of floating across unbridged abysses between the general and the particular there on the one hand is the man of understanding seeing clearlyi suppose he sees clearlythe big process that dooms millions of lives to thwarting and discomfort and unhappy circumstances and giving us no help no hint by which we may get that better collective will and intelligence which would dam the stream of human failure and on the other hand mr polly sitting on his gate untrained unwarned confused distressed angry seeing nothing except that he is as it were nettled in greyness and discomfortwith life dancing all about him mr polly with a capacity for joy and beauty at least as keen and subtle as yours or mine   iv  i have hinted that our mother england had equipped mr polly for the management of his internal concerns no whit better than she had for the direction of his external affairs with a careless generosity she affords her children a variety of foods unparalleled in the worlds history and including many condiments and preserved preparations novel to the human economy and miriam did the cooking mr pollys system like a confused and illgoverned democracy had been brought to a state of perpetual clamour and disorder demanding now evil and unsuitable internal satisfactions such as pickles and vinegar and the crackling on pork and now vindictive external expression war and bloodshed throughout the world so that mr polly had been led into hatred and a series of disagreeable quarrels with his landlord his wholesalers and most of his neighbours  rumbold the china dealer next door seemed hostile from the first for no apparent reason and always unpacked his crates with a full back to his new neighbour and from the first mr polly resented and hated that uncivil breadth of expressionless humanity wanted to prod it kick it satirise it but you cannot satirise a hack if you have no friend to nudge while you do it  at last mr polly could stand it no longer he approached and prodded rumbold  ello said rumbold suddenly erect and turned about  cant we have some other point of view said mr polly im tired of the end elevation  eh said mr rumbold frankly puzzled  of all the vertebracious animals man alone raises his face to the sky o man wellwhy invert it  rumbold shook his head with a helpless expression  dont like so much arreary pensy  rumbold distressed in utter obscurity  in fact im sick of your turning your back on me see  a great light shone on rumbold thats what youre talking about he said  thats it said polly  rumbold scratched his ear with the three strawy jampots he held in his hand way the wind blows i expect he said but whats the fuss  no fuss said mr polly passing remark i dont like it o man thats all  cant help it if the wind blows my stror said mr rumbold still far from clear about it  it isnt ordinary civility said mr polly  got to unpack ow it suits me cant unpack with the stror blowing into ones eyes  neednt unpack like a pig rooting for truffles need you  truffles  neednt unpack like a pig  mr rumbold apprehended something  pig he said impressed you calling me a pig  its the side i seem to get of you  ere said mr rumbold suddenly fierce and shouting and marking his point with gesticulated jampots you go indoors i dont want no row with you and i dont want you to row with me i dont know what youre after but im a peaceable manteetotaller too and a good thing if you was see you go indoors  you mean to sayim asking you civilly to stop unpackingwith your back to me  pig aint civil and you aint sober you go indoors and lemme go on unpacking youyoure excited  dyou mean mr polly was foiled  he perceived an immense solidity about rumbold  get back to your shop and lemme get on with my business said mr rumbold stop calling me pigs see sweep your pavemint  i came here to make a civil request  you came ere to make a row i dont want no truck with you see i dont like the looks of you see and i cant stand ere all day arguing see  pause of mutual inspection  it occurred to mr polly that probably he was to some extent in the wrong  mr rumbold blowing heavily walked past him deposited the jampots in his shop with an immense affectation that there was no mr polly in the world returned turned a scornful back on mr polly and dived to the interior of the crate mr polly stood baffled should he kick this solid mass before him should he administer a resounding kick  no  he plunged his hands deeply into his trowser pockets began to whistle and returned to his own doorstep with an air of profound unconcern there for a time to the tune of men of harlech he contemplated the receding possibility of kicking mr rumbold hard it would be splendidand for the moment satisfying but he decided not to do it for indefinable reasons he could not do it he went indoors and straightened up his dress ties very slowly and thoughtfully presently he went to the window and regarded mr rumbold obliquely mr rumbold was still unpacking  mr polly had no human intercourse thereafter with rumbold for fifteen years he kept up a hate  there was a time when it seemed as if rumbold might go but he had a meeting of his creditors and then went on unpacking as obtusely as ever   v  hinks the saddler two shops further down the street was a different case hinks was the aggressorpractically  hinks was a sporting man in his way with that taste for checks in costume and tight trousers which is under providence so mysteriously and invariably associated with equestrian proclivities at first mr polly took to him as a character became frequent in the gods providence inn under his guidance stood and was stood drinks and concealed a great ignorance of horses until hinks became urgent for him to play billiards or bet  then mr polly took to evading him and hinks ceased to conceal his opinion that mr polly was in reality a softish sort of flat  he did not however discontinue conversation with mr polly he would come along to him whenever he appeared at his door and converse about sport and women and fisticuffs and the pride of life with an air of extreme initiation until mr polly felt himself the faintest underdeveloped intimation of a man that had ever hovered on the verge of nonexistence  so he invented phrases for hinks clothes and took rusper the ironmonger into his confidence upon the weaknesses of hinks he called him the chequered careerist and spoke of his patterned legs as shivery shakys good things of this sort are apt to get round to people  he was standing at his door one day feeling bored when hinks appeared down the street stood still and regarded him with a strange malignant expression for a space  mr polly waved a hand in a rather belated salutation  mr hinks spat on the pavement and appeared to reflect then he came towards mr polly portentously and paused and spoke between his teeth in an earnest confidential tone  you been flapping your mouth about me im told he said  mr polly felt suddenly spiritless not that i know of he answered  not that you know of be blowed you been flapping your mouth  dont see it said mr polly  dont see it be blowed you go flapping your silly mouth about me and ill give you a poke in the eye see  mr hinks regarded the effect of this coldly but firmly and spat again  understand me he enquired  dont recollect began mr polly  dont recollect be blowed you flap your mouth a dam sight too much this place gets more of your mouth than it wants seen this  and mr hinks having displayed a freckled fist of extraordinary size and pugginess in an ostentatiously familiar manner to mr pollys close inspection by sight and smell turned it about this way and that and shaken it gently for a moment or so replaced it carefully in his pocket as if for future use receded slowly and watchfully for a pace and then turned away as if to other matters and ceased to be even in outward seeming a friend   vi  mr pollys intercourse with all his fellow tradesmen was tarnished sooner or later by some such adverse incident until not a friend remained to him and loneliness made even the shop door terrible shops bankrupted all about him and fresh people came and new acquaintances sprang up but sooner or later a discord was inevitable the tension under which these badly fed poorly housed bored and bothered neighbours lived made it inevitable the mere fact that mr polly had to see them every day that there was no getting away from them was in itself sufficient to make them almost unendurable to his frettingly active mind  among other shopkeepers in the high street there was chuffles the grocer a small hairy silently intent polygamist who was given rough music by the youth of the neighbourhood because of a scandal about his wifes sister and who was nevertheless totally uninteresting and tonks the second grocer an old man with an older very enfeebled wife both submerged by piety tonks went bankrupt and was succeeded by a branch of the national provision company with a young manager exactly like a fox except that he barked the toy and sweetstuff shop was kept by an old woman of repellent manners and so was the little fish shop at the end of the street the berlinwool shop having gone bankrupt became a newspaper shop then fell to a haberdasher in consumption and finally to a stationer the three shops at the end of the street wallowed in and out of insolvency in the hands of a bicycle repairer and dealer a gramaphone dealer a tobacconist a sixpennyhalfpenny bazaarkeeper a shoemaker a greengrocer and the exploiter of a cinematograph peepshowbut none of them supplied friendship to mr polly  these adventurers in commerce were all more or less distraught souls driving without intelligible comment before the gale of fate the two milkmen of fishbourne were brothers who had quarrelled about their fathers will and started in opposition to each other one was stone deaf and no use to mr polly and the other was a sporting man with a natural dread of epithet who sided with hinks so it was all about him on every hand it seemed were uncongenial people uninteresting people or people who conceived the deepest distrust and hostility towards him a magic circle of suspicious preoccupied and dehumanised humanity so the poison in his system poisoned the world without  but boomer the wine merchant and tashingford the chemist be it noted were fraught with pride and held themselves to be a cut above mr polly they never quarrelled with him preferring to bear themselves from the outset as though they had already done so  as his internal malady grew upon mr polly and he became more and more a battleground of fermenting foods and warring juices he came to hate the very sight as people say of every one of these neighbours there they were every day and all the days just the same echoing his own stagnation they pained him all round the top and back of his head they made his legs and arms weary and spiritless the air was tasteless by reason of them he lost his human kindliness  in the afternoons he would hover in the shop bored to death with his business and his home and miriam and yet afraid to go out because of his inflamed and magnified dislike and dread of these neighbours he could not bring himself to go out and run the gauntlet of the observant windows and the cold estranged eyes  one of his last friendships was with rusper the ironmonger rusper took over worthingtons shop about three years after mr polly opened he was a tall lean nervous convulsive man with an upturned backthrown oval head who read newspapers and the review of reviews assiduously had belonged to a literary society somewhere once and had some defect of the palate that at first gave his lightest word a charm and interest for mr polly it caused a peculiar clicking sound as though he had something between a giggle and a gasmeter at work in his neck  his literary admirations were not precisely mr pollys literary admirations he thought books were written to enshrine great thoughts and that art was pedagogy in fancy dress he had no sense of phrase or epithet or richness of texture but still he knew there were books he did know there were books and he was full of large windy ideas of the sort he called modern kik thought and seemed needlessly and helplessly concerned about kik the welfare of the race  mr polly would dream about that kik at nights  it seemed to that undesirable mind of his that ruspers head was the most eggshaped head he had ever seen the similarity weighed upon him and when he found an argument growing warm with rusper he would say boil it some more o man boil it harder or six minutes at least allusions rusper could never make head or tail of and got at last to disregard as a part of mr pollys general eccentricity for a long time that little tendency threw no shadow over their intercourse but it contained within it the seeds of an ultimate disruption  often during the days of this friendship mr polly would leave his shop and walk over to mr ruspers establishment and stand in his doorway and enquire well o man hows the mind of the age working and get quite an hour of it and sometimes mr rusper would come into the outfitters shop with heard the kik latest and spend the rest of the morning  then mr rusper married and he married very inconsiderately a woman who was totally uninteresting to mr polly a coolness grew between them from the first intimation of her advent mr polly couldnt help thinking when he saw her that she drew her hair back from her forehead a great deal too tightly and that her elbows were angular his desire not to mention these things in the apt terms that welled up so richly in his mind made him awkward in her presence and that gave her an impression that he was hiding some guilty secret from her she decided he must have a bad influence upon her husband and she made it a point to appear whenever she heard him talking to rusper  one day they became a little heated about the german peril  i lay kik theyll invade us said rusper  not a bit of it williams not the zerxiacious sort  youll see o man  just what i shant do  before kik five years are out  not it  yes  no  yes  oh boil it hard said mr polly  then he looked up and saw mrs rusper standing behind the counter half hidden by a trophy of spades and garden shears and a knifecleaning machine and by her expression he knew instantly that she understood  the conversation paled and presently mr polly withdrew  after that estrangement increased steadily  mr rusper ceased altogether to come over to the outfitters and mr polly called upon the ironmonger only with the completest air of casuality and everything they said to each other led now to flat contradiction and raised voices rusper had been warned in vague and alarming terms that mr polly insulted and made game of him he couldnt discover exactly where and so it appeared to him now that every word of mr pollys might be an insult meriting his resentment meriting it none the less because it was masked and cloaked  soon mr pollys calls upon mr rusper ceased also and then mr rusper pursuing incomprehensible lines of thought became afflicted with a specialised shortsightedness that applied only to mr polly he would look in other directions when mr polly appeared and his large oval face assumed an expression of conscious serenity and deliberate happy unawareness that would have maddened a far less irritable person than mr polly it evoked a strong desire to mock and ape and produced in his throat a cough of singular scornfulness more particularly when mr rusper also assisted with an assumed unconsciousness that was all his own  then one day mr polly had a bicycle accident  his bicycle was now very old and it is one of the concomitants of a bicycles senility that its free wheel should one day obstinately cease to be free it corresponds to that epoch in human decay when an old gentleman loses an incisor tooth it happened just as mr polly was approaching mr ruspers shop and the untoward chance of a motor car trying to pass a waggon on the wrong side gave mr polly no choice but to get on to the pavement and dismount he was always accustomed to take his time and step off his left pedal at its lowest point but the jamming of the free wheel gear made that lowest moment a transitory one and the pedal was lifting his foot for another revolution before he realised what had happened before he could dismount according to his habit the pedal had to make a revolution and before it could make a revolution mr polly found himself among the various sonorous things with which mr rusper adorned the front of his shop zinc dustbins household pails lawn mowers rakes spades and all manner of clattering things before he got among them he had one of those agonising moments of helpless wrath and suspense that seem to last ages in which one seems to perceive everything and think of nothing but words that are better forgotten he sent a column of pails thundering across the doorway and dismounted with one foot in a sanitary dustbin amidst an enormous uproar of falling ironmongery  put all over the place he cried and found mr rusper emerging from his shop with the large tranquillities of his countenance puckered to anger like the frowns in the brow of a reefing sail he gesticulated speechlessly for a moment  kikjer doing he said at last  tin mantraps said mr polly  jer kik doing  dressing all over the pavement as though the blessed town belonged to you ugh  and mr polly in attempting a dignified movement realised his entanglement with the dustbin for the first time with a low embittering expression he kicked his foot about in it for a moment very noisily and finally sent it thundering to the curb on its way it struck a pail or so then mr polly picked up his bicycle and proposed to resume his homeward way but the hand of mr rusper arrested him  put it kik all kik kik back kik  put it kik back yourself  you got kik put it back  get out of the kik way  mr rusper laid one hand on the bicycle handle and the other gripped mr pollys collar urgently whereupon mr polly said leggo and again dyou hear leggo and then drove his elbow with considerable force into the region of mr ruspers midriff whereupon mr rusper with a loud impassioned cry resembling woo kik more than any other combination of letters released the bicycle handle seized mr polly by the cap and hair and bore his head and shoulders downward thereat mr polly emitting such words as everyone knows and nobody prints butted his utmost into the concavity of mr rusper entwined a leg about him and after terrific moments of swaying instability fell headlong beneath him amidst the bicycles and pails there on the pavement these inexpert children of a pacific age untrained in arms and uninured to violence abandoned themselves to amateurish and absurd efforts to hurt and injure one anotherof which the most palpable consequences were dusty backs ruffled hair and torn and twisted collars mr polly by accident got his finger into mr ruspers mouth and strove earnestly for some time to prolong that aperture in the direction of mr ruspers ear before it occurred to mr rusper to bite him and even then he didnt bite very hard while mr rusper concentrated his mind almost entirely on an effort to rub mr pollys face on the pavement and their positions bristled with chances of the deadliest sort they didnt from first to last draw blood  then it seemed to each of them that the other had become endowed with many hands and several voices and great accessions of strength they submitted to fate and ceased to struggle they found themselves torn apart and held up by outwardly scandalised and inwardly delighted neighbours and invited to explain what it was all about  got to kik puttem all back panted mr rusper in the expert grasp of hinks merely asked him to kik puttem all back  mr polly was under restraint of little clamp of the toy shop who was holding his hands in a complex and uncomfortable manner that he afterwards explained to wintershed was a combination of something romantic called jujitsu and something else still more romantic called the police grip  pails explained mr polly in breathless fragments all over the road pails bungs up the street with his pails look at them  deliber kik lib kik liberately rode into my goods kik constantly kik annoying me kik said mr rusper  they were both tremendously earnest and reasonable in their manner they wished everyone to regard them as responsible and intellectual men acting for the love of right and the enduring good of the world they felt they must treat this business as a profound and publicly significant affair they wanted to explain and orate and show the entire necessity of everything they had done mr polly was convinced he had never been so absolutely correct in all his life as when he planted his foot in the sanitary dustbin and mr rusper considered his clutch at mr pollys hair as the one faultless impulse in an otherwise undistinguished career but it was clear in their minds they might easily become ridiculous if they were not careful if for a second they stepped over the edge of the high spirit and pitiless dignity they had hitherto maintained at any cost they perceived they must not become ridiculous  mr chuffles the scandalous grocer joined the throng about the principal combatants mutely as became an outcast and with a sad distressed helpful expression picked up mr pollys bicycle gambells summer errand boy moved by example restored the dustbin and pails to their selfrespect  e oughte ought kik pick them up protested mr rusper  whats it all about said mr hinks for the third time shaking mr rusper gently as e been calling you names  simply ran into his pailsas anyone might said mr polly and out he comes and scrags me  kik assault said mr rusper  he assaulted me said mr polly  jumped kik into my dusbin said mr rusper that assault or isnt it  you better drop it said mr hinks  great pity they cant beave better both of em said mr chuffles glad for once to find himself morally unassailable  anyone see it begin said mr wintershed  i was in the shop said mrs rusper suddenly from the doorstep piercing the little group of men and boys with the sharp horror of an unexpected womans voice if a witness is wanted i suppose ive got a tongue i suppose i got a voice in seeing my own usband injured my husband went out and spoke to mr polly who was jumping off his bicycle all among our pails and things and immediately e butted him in the stomachimmediatelymost savagelybutted him just after his dinner too and him far from strong i could have screamed but rusper caught hold of him right away i will say that for rusper  im going said mr polly suddenly releasing himself from the anglojapanese grip and holding out his hands for his bicycle  teach you kik to leave things alone said mr rusper with an air of one who has given a lesson  the testimony of mrs rusper continued relentlessly in the background  youll hear of me through a summons said mr polly preparing to wheel his bicycle  kik me too said mr rusper  someone handed mr polly a collar this yours  mr polly investigated his neck i suppose it is anyone seen a tie  a small boy produced a grimy strip of spotted blue silk  human life isnt safe with you said mr polly as a parting shot  kik yours isnt said mr rusper  and they got small satisfaction out of the bench which refused altogether to perceive the relentless correctitude of the behaviour of either party and reproved the eagerness of mrs rusperspeaking to her gently firmly but exasperatingly as my good woman and telling her to answer the question answer the question  seems a pity said the chairman when binding them over to keep the peace you cant behave like respectable tradesmen seems a great pity bad example to the young and all that dont do any good to the town dont do any good to yourselves dont do any manner of good to have all the tradesmen in the place scrapping about the pavement of an afternoon think were letting you off very easily this time and hope it will be a warning to you dont expect men of your position to come up before us very regrettable affair eh  he addressed the latter enquiry to his two colleagues  exactly exactly said the colleague to the right  erkik said mr rusper   vii  but the disgust that overshadowed mr pollys being as he sat upon the stile had other and profounder justification than his quarrel with rusper and the indignity of appearing before the county bench he was for the first time in his business career short with his rent for the approaching quarter day and so far as he could trust his own bandling of figures he was sixty or seventy pounds on the wrong side of solvency and that was the outcome of fifteen years of passive endurance of dulness throughout the best years of his life what would miriam say when she learnt this and was invited to face the prospect of exileheaven knows what sort of exilefrom their present home she would grumble and scold and become limply unhelpful he knew and none the less so because he could not help things she would say he ought to have worked harder and a hundred such exasperating pointless things such thoughts as these require no aid from undigested cold pork and cold potatoes and pickles to darken the soul and with these aids his soul was black indeed  may as well have a bit of a walk said mr polly at last after nearly intolerable meditations and sat round and put a leg over the stile  he remained still for some time before he brought over the other leg  kill myself he murmured at last  it was an idea that came back to his mind nowadays with a continually increasing attractivenessmore particularly after meals life he felt had no further happiness to offer him he hated miriam and there was no getting away from her whatever might betide and for the rest there was toil and struggle toil and struggle with a failing heart and dwindling courage to sustain that dreary duologue lifes insured said mr polly place is insured i dont see it does any harm to her or anyone  he stuck his hands in his pockets neednt hurt much he said he began to elaborate a plan  he found it quite interesting elaborating his plan his countenance became less miserable and his pace quickened  there is nothing so good in all the world for melancholia as walking and the exercise of the imagination in planning something presently to be done and soon the wrathful wretchedness had vanished from mr pollys face he would have to do the thing secretly and elaborately because otherwise there might be difficulties about the life insurance he began to scheme how he could circumvent that difficulty  he took a long walk for after all what is the good of hurrying back to shop when you are not only insolvent but very soon to die his dinner and the east wind lost their sinister hold upon his soul and when at last he came back along the fishbourne high street his face was unusually bright and the craving hunger of the dyspeptic was returning so he went into the grocers and bought a ruddily decorated tin of a brightly pink fishlike substance known as deep sea salmon this he was resolved to consume regardless of cost with vinegar and salt and pepper as a relish to his supper  he did and since he and miriam rarely talked and miriam thought honour and his recent behaviour demanded a hostile silence he ate fast and copiously and soon gloomily he ate alone for she refrained to mark her sense of his extravagance then he prowled into the high street for a time thought it an infernal place tried his pipe and found it foul and bitter and retired wearily to bed  he slept for an hour or so and then woke up to the contemplation of miriams hunched back and the riddle of life and this bright attractive idea of ending for ever and ever and ever all the things that were locking him in this bright idea that shone like a baleful star above all the reek and darkness of his misery    chapter the eighth  making an end to things   i  mr polly designed his suicide with considerable care and a quite remarkable altruism his passionate hatred for miriam vanished directly the idea of getting away from her for ever became clear in his mind he found himself full of solicitude then for her welfare he did not want to buy his release at her expense he had not the remotest intention of leaving her unprotected with a painfully dead husband and a bankrupt shop on her hands it seemed to him that he could contrive to secure for her the full benefit of both his life insurance and his fire insurance if he managed things in a tactful manner he felt happier than he had done for years scheming out this undertaking albeit it was perhaps a larger and somberer kind of happiness than had fallen to his lot before it amazed him to think he had endured his monotony of misery and failure for so long  but there were some queer doubts and questions in the dim halflit background of his mind that he had very resolutely to ignore sick of it he had to repeat to himself aloud to keep his determination clear and firm his life was a failure there was nothing more to hope for but unhappiness why shouldnt he  his project was to begin the fire with the stairs that led from the ground floor to the underground kitchen and scullery this he would soak with paraffine and assist with firewood and paper and a brisk fire in the coal cellar underneath he would smash a hole or so in the stairs to ventilate the blaze and have a good pile of boxes and paper and a convenient chair or so in the shop above he would have the paraffine can upset and the shop lamp as if awaiting refilling at a convenient distance in the scullery ready to catch then he would smash the house lamp on the staircase a fall with that in his hand was to be the ostensible cause of the blaze and then he would cut his throat at the top of the kitchen stairs which would then become his funeral pyre he would do all this on sunday evening while miriam was at church and it would appear that he had fallen downstairs with the lamp and been burnt to death there was really no flaw whatever that he could see in the scheme he was quite sure he knew how to cut his throat deep at the side and not to saw at the windpipe and he was reasonably sure it wouldnt hurt him very much and then everything would be at an end  there was no particular hurry to get the thing done of course and meanwhile he occupied his mind with possible variations of the scheme  it needed a particularly dry and dusty east wind a sunday dinner of exceptional virulence a conclusive letter from konk maybrick ghool and gabbitas his principal and most urgent creditors and a conversation with miriam arising out of arrears of rent and leading on to mutual character sketching before mr polly could be brought to the necessary pitch of despair to carry out his plans he went for an embittering walk and came back to find miriam in a bad temper over the tea things with the brewings of threequarters of an hour in the pot and hot buttered muffin gone leathery he sat eating in silence with his resolution made  coming to church said miriam after she had cleared away  rather i got a lot to be grateful for said mr polly  you got what you deserve said miriam  suppose i have said mr polly and went and stared out of the back window at a despondent horse in the hotel yard  he was still standing there when miriam came downstairs dressed for church something in his immobility struck home to her youd better come to church than mope she said  i shant mope he answered  she remained still for a moment her presence irritated him he felt that in another moment he should say something absurd to her make some last appeal for that understanding she had never been able to give oh go to church he said  in another moment the outer door slammed upon her good riddance said mr polly  he turned about ive had my whack he said  he reflected i dont see shell have any cause to holler he said beastly home beastly life  for a space he remained thoughtful here goes he said at last   ii  for twenty minutes mr polly busied himself about the house making his preparations very neatly and methodically  he opened the attic windows in order to make sure of a good draught through the house and drew down the blinds at the back and shut the kitchen door to conceal his arrangements from casual observation at the end he would open the door on the yard and so make a clean clear draught right through the house he hacked at and wedged off the tread of a stair he cleared out the coals from under the staircase and built a neat fire of firewood and paper there he splashed about paraffine and arranged the lamps and can even as he had designed and made a fine inflammable pile of things in the little parlour behind the shop looks pretty arsonical he said as he surveyed it all wouldnt do to have a caller now now for the stairs  plenty of time he assured himself and took the lamp which was to explain the whole affair and went to the head of the staircase between the scullery and the parlour he sat down in the twilight with the unlit lamp beside him and surveyed things he must light the fire in the coal cellar under the stairs open the back door then come up them very quickly and light the paraffine puddles on each step then sit down here again and cut his throat  he drew his razor from his pocket and felt the edge it wouldnt hurt much and in ten minutes he would be indistinguishable ashes in the blaze  and this was the end of life for him  the end and it seemed to him now that life had never begun for him never it was as if his soul had been cramped and his eyes bandaged from the hour of his birth why had he lived such a life why had he submitted to things blundered into things why had he never insisted on the things he thought beautiful and the things he desired never sought them fought for them taken any risk for them died rather than abandon them they were the things that mattered safety did not matter a living did not matter unless there were things to live for  he had been a fool a coward and a fool he had been fooled too for no one had ever warned him to take a firm hold upon life no one had ever told him of the littleness of fear or pain or death but what was the good of going through it now again it was over and done with  the clock in the back parlour pinged the half hour  time said mr polly and stood up  for an instant he battled with an impulse to put it all back hastily guiltily and abandon this desperate plan of suicide for ever  but miriam would smell the paraffine  no way out this time o man said mr polly and he went slowly downstairs matchbox in hand  he paused for five seconds perhaps to listen to noises in the yard of the royal fishbourne hotel before he struck his match it trembled a little in his hand the paper blackened and an edge of blue flame ran outward and spread the fire burnt up readily and in an instant the wood was crackling cheerfully  someone might hear he must hurry  he lit a pool of paraffine on the scullery floor and instantly a nest of snaky wavering blue flame became agog for prey he went up the stairs three steps at a time with one eager blue flicker in pursuit of him he seized the lamp at the top now he said and flung it smashing the chimney broke but the glass receiver stood the shock and rolled to the bottom a potential bomb old rumbold would hear that and wonder what it was hed know soon enough  then mr polly stood hesitating razor in hand and then sat down he was trembling violently but quite unafraid  he drew the blade lightly under one ear lord but it stung like a nettle  then he perceived a little blue thread of flame running up his leg it arrested his attention and for a moment he sat razor in hand staring at it it must be paraffine on his trousers that had caught fire on the stairs of course his legs were wet with paraffine he smacked the flicker with his hand to put it out and felt his leg burn as he did so but his trousers still charred and glowed it seemed to him necessary that he must put this out before he cut his throat he put down the razor beside him to smack with both hands very eagerly and as he did so a thin tall red flame came up through the hole in the stairs he had made and stood still quite still as it seemed and looked at him it was a strangelooking flame a flattish salmon colour redly streaked it was so queer and quiet mannered that the sight of it held mr polly agape  whuff went the can of paraffine below and boiled over with stinking white fire at the outbreak the salmoncoloured flames shivered and ducked and then doubled and vanished and instantly all the staircase was noisily ablaze  mr polly sprang up and backwards as though the uprushing tongues of fire were a pack of eager wolves  good lord he cried like a man who wakes up from a dream  he swore sharply and slapped again at a recrudescent flame upon his leg  what the deuce shall i do im soaked with the confounded stuff  he had nerved himself for throatcutting but this was fire  he wanted to delay things to put them out for a moment while he did his business the idea of arresting all this hurry with water occurred to him  there was no water in the little parlour and none in the shop he hesitated for a moment whether he should not run upstairs to the bedrooms and get a ewer of water to throw on the flames at this rate rumbolds would be ablaze in five minutes things were going all too fast for mr polly he ran towards the staircase door and its hot breath pulled him up sharply then he dashed out through his shop the catch of the front door was sometimes obstinate it was now and instantly he became frantic he rattled and stormed and felt the parlour already ablaze behind him in another moment he was in the high street with the door wide open  the staircase behind him was crackling now like horsewhips and pistol shots  he had a vague sense that he wasnt doing as he had proposed but the chief thing was his sense of that uncontrolled fire within what was he going to do there was the fire brigade station next door but one  the fishbourne high street had never seemed so empty  far off at the corner by the gods providence inn a group of three stiff hobbledehoys in their black best clothes conversed intermittently with taplow the policeman  hi bawled mr polly to them fire fire and struck by a horrible thought the thought of rumbolds deaf motherinlaw upstairs began to bang and kick and rattle with the utmost fury at rumbolds shop door  hi he repeated fire   iii  that was the beginning of the great fishbourne fire which burnt its way sideways into mr ruspers piles of crates and straw and backwards to the petrol and stabling of the royal fishbourne hotel and spread from that basis until it seemed half fishbourne would be ablaze the east wind which had been gathering in strength all that day fanned the flame everything was dry and ready and the little shed beyond rumbolds in which the local fire brigade kept its manual was alight before the fishbourne fire hose could be saved from disaster in marvellously little time a great column of black smoke shot with red streamers rose out of the middle of the high street and all fishbourne was alive with excitement  much of the more respectable elements of fishbourne society was in church or chapel many however had been tempted by the blue sky and the hard freshness of spring to take walks inland and there had been the usual disappearance of loungers and conversationalists from the beach and the back streets when at the hour of six the shooting of bolts and the turning of keys had ended the british ramadan that weekly interlude of drought our law imposes the youth of the place were scattered on the beach or playing in back yards under threat if their clothes were dirtied and the adolescent were disposed in pairs among the more secluded corners to be found upon the outskirts of the place several godless youths seasick but fishing steadily were tossing upon the sea in old tarbolds the infidels boat and the clamps were entertaining cousins from port burdock such few visitors as fishbourne could boast in the spring were at church or on the beach to all these that column of smoke did in a manner address itself look here it said this within limits is your affair what are you going to do  the three hobbledehoys had it been a weekday and they in working clothes might have felt free to act but the stiffness of black was upon them and they simply moved to the corner by ruspers to take a better view of mr polly beating at the door the policeman was a young inexpert constable with far too lively a sense of the public house he put his head inside the private bar to the horror of everyone there but there was no breach of the law thank heaven pollys and rumbolds on fire he said and vanished again a window in the top story over boomers shop opened and boomer captain of the fire brigade appeared staring out with a blank expression still staring he began to fumble with his collar and tie manifestly he had to put on his uniform hinks dog which had been lying on the pavement outside wintersheds woke up and having regarded mr polly suspiciously for some time growled nervously and went round the corner into granville alley mr polly continued to beat and kick at rumbolds door  then the public houses began to vomit forth the less desirable elements of fishbourne society boys and men were moved to run and shout and more windows went up as the stir increased tashingford the chemist appeared at his door in shirt sleeves and an apron with his photographic plate holders in his hand and then like a vision of purpose came mr gambell the greengrocer running out of clayfords alley and buttoning on his jacket as he ran his great brass firemans helmet was on his head hiding it all but the sharp nose the firm mouth the intrepid chin he ran straight to the fire station and tried the door and turned about and met the eye of boomer still at his upper window the key cried mr gambell the key  mr boomer made some inaudible explanation about his trousers and half a minute  seen old rumbold cried mr polly approaching mr gambell  gone over downford for a walk said mr gambell he told me but look ere we avent got the key  lord said mr polly and regarded the china shop with open eyes he knew the old woman must be there alone he went back to the shop front and stood surveying it in infinite perplexity the other activities in the street did not interest him a deaf old lady somewhere upstairs there precious moments passing suddenly he was struck by an idea and vanished from public vision into the open door of the royal fishbourne tap  and now the street was getting crowded and people were laying their hands to this and that  mr rusper had been at home reading a number of tracts upon tariff reform during the quiet of his wifes absence in church and trying to work out the application of the whole question to ironmongery he heard a clattering in the street and for a time disregarded it until a cry of fire drew him to the window he pencilledmarked the tract of chiozza moneys that he was reading side by side with one by mr holt schooling made a hasty note bal of trade say 12000000 and went to look out instantly he opened the window and ceased to believe the fiscal question the most urgent of human affairs  good kik gud said mr rusper  for now the rapidly spreading blaze had forced the partition into mr rumbolds premises swept across his cellar clambered his garden wall by means of his welltarred mushroom shed and assailed the engine house it stayed not to consume but ran as a thing that seeks a quarry pollys shop and upper parts were already a furnace and black smoke was coming out of rumbolds cellar gratings the fire in the engine house showed only as a sudden rush of smoke from the back like something suddenly blown up the fire brigade still much under strength were now hard at work in the front of the latter building they had got the door open all too late they had rescued the fire escape and some buckets and were now lugging out their manual with the hose already a dripping mass of molten flaring stinking rubber boomer was dancing about and swearing and shouting this direct attack upon his apparatus outraged his sense of chivalry the rest of the brigade hovered in a disheartened state about the rescued fire escape and tried to piece boomers comments into some tangible instructions  hi said rusper from the window kik whats up  gambell answered him out of his helmet hose he cried hose gone  i kik got hose cried rusper  he had he had a stock of several thousand feet of garden hose of various qualities and calibres and now he felt was the time to use it in another moment his shop door was open and he was hurling pails garden syringes and rolls of garden hose out upon the pavement kik he cried undo it to the gathering crowd in the roadway  they did presently a hundred ready hands were unrolling and spreading and tangling up and twisting and hopelessly involving mr ruspers stock of hose sustained by an unquenchable assurance that presently it would in some manner contain and convey water and mr rusper on his knees kiking violently became incredibly busy with wire and brass junctions and all sorts of mysteries  fix it to the kik bathroom tap said mr rusper  next door to the fire station was mantell and throbsons the little fishbourne branch of that celebrated firm and mr boomer seeking in a teeming mind for a plan of action had determined to save this building someone telephone to the port burdock and hampsteadonsea fire brigades he cried to the crowd and then to his fellows cut away the woodwork of the fire station and so led the way into the blaze with a whirling hatchet that effected wonders in no time in ventilation  but it was not after all such a bad idea of his mantell and throbsons was separated from the fire station in front by a covered glass passage and at the back the roof of a big outhouse sloped down to the fire station leads the sturdy longshoremen who made up the bulk of the fire brigade assailed the glass roof of the passage with extraordinary gusto and made a smashing of glass that drowned for a time the rising uproar of the flames  a number of willing volunteers started off to the new telephone office in obedience to mr boomers request only to be told with cold official politeness by the young lady at the exchange that all that had been done on her own initiative ten minutes ago she parleyed with these heated enthusiasts for a space and then returned to the window  and indeed the spectacle was well worth looking at the dusk was falling and the flames were showing brilliantly at half a dozen points the royal fishbourne hotel tap which adjoined mr polly to the west was being kept wet by the enthusiastic efforts of a string of volunteers with buckets of water and above at a bathroom window the little german waiter was busy with the garden hose but mr pollys establishment looked more like a house afire than most houses on fire contrive to look from start to finish every window showed eager flickering flames and flames like serpents tongues were licking out of three large holes in the roof which was already beginning to fall in behind larger and abundantly sparkshot gusts of fire rose from the fodder that was now getting alight in the royal fishbourne hotel stables next door to mr polly mr rumbolds house was disgorging black smoke from the gratings that protected its underground windows and smoke and occasional shivers of flame were also coming out of its firstfloor windows the fire station was better alight at the back than in front and its woodwork burnt pretty briskly with peculiar greenish flickerings and a pungent flavour in the street an inaggressively disorderly crowd clambered over the rescued fire escape and resisted the attempts of the three local constables to get it away from the danger of mr pollys tottering façade a cluster of busy forms danced and shouted and advised on the noisy and smashing attempt to cut off mantell and throbsons from the fire station that was still in ineffectual progress further a number of people appeared to be destroying interminable red and grey snakes under the heated direction of mr rusper it was as if the high street had a plague of worms and beyond again the more timid and less active crowded in front of an accumulation of arrested traffic most of the men were in sabbatical black and this and the white and starched quality of the women and children in their best clothes gave a note of ceremony to the whole affair  for a moment the attention of the telephone clerk was held by the activities of mr tashingford the chemist who regardless of everyone else was rushing across the road hurling fire grenades into the fire station and running back for more and then her eyes lifted to the slanting outhouse roof that went up to a ridge behind the parapet of mantell and throbsons an expression of incredulity came into the telephone operators eyes and gave place to hard activity she flung up the window and screamed out two people on the roof up there two people on the roof   iv  her eyes had not deceived her two figures which had emerged from the upper staircase window of mr rumbolds and had got after a perilous paddle in his cistern on to the fire station were now slowly but resolutely clambering up the outhouse roof towards the back of the main premises of messrs mantell and throbsons they clambered slowly and one urged and helped the other slipping and pausing ever and again amidst a constant trickle of fragments of broken tile  one was mr polly with his hair wildly disordered his face covered with black smudges and streaked with perspiration and his trouser legs scorched and blackened the other was an elderly lady quietly but becomingly dressed in black with small white frills at her neck and wrists and a sunday cap of ecru lace enlivened with a black velvet bow her hair was brushed back from her wrinkled brow and plastered down tightly meeting in a small knob behind her wrinkled mouth bore that expression of supreme resolution common with the toothless aged she was shaky not with fear but with the vibrations natural to her years and she spoke with the slow quavering firmness of the very aged  i dont mind scrambling she said with piping inflexibility but i cant jump and i wunt jump  scramble old lady thenscramble said mr polly pulling her arm its one up and two down on these blessed tiles  its not what im used to she said  stick to it said mr polly live and learn and got to the ridge and grasped at her arm to pull her after him  i cant jump mind ye she repeated pressing her lips together and old ladies like me mustnt be hurried  well lets get as high as possible anyhow said mr polly urging her gently upward shinning up a waterspout in your line near as youll get to heaven  i cant jump she said i can do anything but jump  hold on said mr polly while i give you a boost thatswonderful  so long as it isnt jumping  the old lady grasped the parapet above and there was a moment of intense struggle  urup said mr polly hold on gollys wheres she gone to  then an illmended wavering yet very reassuring spring side boot appeared for an instant  thought perhaps there wasnt any roof there he explained scrambling up over the parapet beside her  ive never been out on a roof before said the old lady im all disconnected its very bumpy especially that last bit cant we sit here for a bit and rest im not the girl i useto be  you sit here ten minutes shouted mr polly and youll pop like a roast chestnut dont understand me roast chestnut roast chestnut pop there ought to be a limit to deafness come on round to the front and see if we can find an attic window look at this smoke  nasty said the old lady her eyes following his gesture puckering her face into an expression of great distaste  come on  cant hear a word you say  he pulled her arm come on  she paused for a moment to relieve herself of a series of entirely unexpected chuckles sich goings on she said i never did wheres he going now and came along behind the parapet to the front of the drapery establishment  below the street was now fully alive to their presence and encouraged the appearance of their heads by shouts and cheers a sort of free fight was going on round the fire escape order represented by mr boomer and the very young policeman and disorder by some partially intoxicated volunteers with views of their own about the manipulation of the apparatus two or three lengths of mr ruspers garden hose appeared to have twined themselves round the ladder mr polly watched the struggle with a certain impatience and glanced ever and again over his shoulder at the increasing volume of smoke and steam that was pouring up from the burning fire station he decided to break an attic window and get in and so try and get down through the shop he found himself in a little bedroom and returned to fetch his charge for some time he could not make her understand his purpose  got to come at once he shouted  i haint ad sich a time for years said the old lady  well have to get down through the house  cant do no jumpin said the old lady no  she yielded reluctantly to his grasp  she stared over the parapet runnin and scurrying about like black beetles in a kitchin she said  weve got to hurry  mr rumbold es a very quiet man e likes everything quiet hell be surprised to see me ere whythere e is she fumbled in her garments mysteriously and at last produced a wrinkled pocket handkerchief and began to wave it  oh come on cried mr polly and seized her  he got her into the attic but the staircase he found was full of suffocating smoke and he dared not venture below the next floor he took her into a long dormitory shut the door on those pungent and pervasive fumes and opened the window to discover the fire escape was now against the house and all fishbourne boiling with excitement as an immensely helmeted and active and resolute little figure ascended in another moment the rescuer stared over the windowsill heroic but just a trifle selfconscious and grotesque  lawks a mussy said the old lady wonders and wonders why its mr gambell iding is ed in that thing i never did  can we get her out said mr gambell theres not much time  he might git stuck in it  youll get stuck in it said mr polly come along  not for jumpin i dont said the old lady understanding his gestures rather than his words not a bit of it i baint no good at jumping and i wunt  they urged her gently but firmly towards the window  you lemme do it my own way said the old lady at the sill  i could do it better if ed take it off  oh carm on  its wuss than carters stile she said before they mended it with a cow alooking at you  mr gambell hovered protectingly below mr polly steered her aged limbs from above an anxious crowd below babbled advice and did its best to upset the fire escape within streamers of black smoke were pouring up through the cracks in the floor for some seconds the world waited while the old lady gave herself up to reckless mirth again sich times she said and poor rumbold  slowly they descended and mr polly remained at the post of danger steadying the long ladder until the old lady was in safety below and sheltered by mr rumbold who was in tears and the young policeman from the urgent congratulations of the crowd the crowd was full of an impotent passion to participate those nearest wanted to shake her hand those remoter cheered  the fust fire i was ever in and likely to be my last its a scurryin urryin business but im real glad i havent missed it said the old lady as she was borne rather than led towards the refuge of the temperance hotel  also she was heard to remark e was saying something about ot chestnuts i avent ad no ot chestnuts  then the crowd became aware of mr polly awkwardly negotiating the top rungs of the fire escape ere e comes cried a voice and mr polly descended into the world again out of the conflagration he had lit to be his funeral pyre moist excited and tremendously alive amidst a tempest of applause as he got lower and lower the crowd howled like a pack of dogs at him impatient men unable to wait for him seized and shook his descending boots and so brought him to earth with a run he was rescued with difficulty from an enthusiast who wished to slake at his own expense and to his own accompaniment a thirst altogether heroic he was hauled into the temperance hotel and flung like a sack breathless and helpless into the tearwet embrace of miriam   v  with the dusk and the arrival of some county constabulary and first one and presently two other fire engines from port burdock and hampsteadonsea the local talent of fishbourne found itself forced back into a secondary less responsible and more observant rôle i will not pursue the story of the fire to its ashes nor will i do more than glance at the unfortunate mr rusper a modern laocoon vainly trying to retrieve his scattered hose amidst the tramplings and rushings of the port burdock experts  in a small sittingroom of the fishbourne temperance hotel a little group of fishbourne tradesmen sat and conversed in fragments and anon went to the window and looked out upon the smoking desolation of their homes across the way and anon sat down again they and their families were the guests of old lady bargrave who had displayed the utmost sympathy and interest in their misfortunes she had taken several people into her own house at everdean had engaged the temperance hotel as a temporary refuge and personally superintended the housing of mantell and throbsons homeless assistants the temperance hotel became and remained extremely noisy and congested with people sitting about anywhere conversing in fragments and totally unable to get themselves to bed the manager was an old soldier and following the best traditions of the service saw that everyone had hot cocoa hot cocoa seemed to be about everywhere and it was no doubt very heartening and sustaining to everyone when the manager detected anyone disposed to be drooping or pensive he exhorted that person at once to drink further hot cocoa and maintain a stout heart  the hero of the occasion the centre of interest was mr polly for he had not only caused the fire by upsetting a lighted lamp scorching his trousers and narrowly escaping death as indeed he had now explained in detail about twenty times but he had further thought at once of that amiable but helpless old lady next door had shown the utmost decision in making his way to her over the yard wall of the royal fishbourne hotel and had rescued her with persistence and vigour in spite of the levity natural to her years everyone thought well of him and was anxious to show it more especially by shaking his hand painfully and repeatedly mr rumbold breaking a silence of nearly fifteen years thanked him profusely said he had never understood him properly and declared he ought to have a medal there seemed to be a widely diffused idea that mr polly ought to have a medal hinks thought so he declared moreover and with the utmost emphasis that mr polly had a crowded and richly decorated interioror words to that effect there was something apologetic in this persistence it was as if he regretted past intimations that mr polly was internally defective and hollow he also said that mr polly was a white man albeit as he developed it with a liver of the deepest chromatic satisfactions  mr polly wandered centrally through it all with his face washed and his hair carefully brushed and parted looking modest and more than a little absentminded and wearing a pair of black dress trousers belonging to the manager of the temperance hotela larger man than himself in every way  he drifted upstairs to his fellowtradesmen and stood for a time staring into the littered street with its pools of water and extinguished gas lamps his companions in misfortune resumed a fragmentary disconnected conversation they touched now on one aspect of the disaster and now on another and there were intervals of silence more or less empty cocoa cups were distributed over the table mantelshelf and piano and in the middle of the table was a tin of biscuits into which mr rumbold sitting roundshoulderedly dipped ever and again in an absentminded way and munched like a distant shooting of coals it added to the solemnity of the affair that nearly all of them were in their black sunday clothes little clamp was particularly impressive and dignified in a wide open frock coat a gladstoneshaped paper collar and a large white and blue tie they felt that they were in the presence of a great disaster the sort of disaster that gets into the papers and is even illustrated by blurred photographs of the crumbling ruins in the presence of that sort of disaster all honourable men are lugubrious and sententious  and yet it is impossible to deny a certain element of elation not one of those excellent men but was already realising that a great door had opened as it were in the opaque fabric of destiny that they were to get their money again that had seemed sunken for ever beyond any hope in the deeps of retail trade life was already in their imagination rising like a phoenix from the flames  i suppose therell be a public subscription said mr clamp  not for those whore insured said mr wintershed  i was thinking of them assistants from mantell and throbsons they must have lost nearly everything  theyll be looked after all right said mr rumbold never fear  pause  im insured said mr clamp with unconcealed satisfaction royal salamander  same here said mr wintershed  mines the glasgow sun mr hinks remarked very good company  you insured mr polly  he deserves to be said rumbold  rather said hinks blowed if he dont hard lines it would beif there wasnt something for him  commercial and general answered mr polly over his shoulder still staring out of the window oh im all right  the topic dropped for a time though manifestly it continued to exercise their minds  its cleared me out of a lot of old stock said mr wintershed thats one good thing  the remark was felt to be in rather questionable taste and still more so was his next comment  ruspers a bit sick it didnt reach im  everyone looked uncomfortable and no one was willing to point the reason why rusper should be a bit sick  ruspers been playing a game of his own said hinks wonder what he thought he was up to sittin in the middle of the road with a pair of tweezers he was and about a yard of wiremending somethin wonder he warnt run over by the port burdock engine  presently a little chat sprang up upon the causes of fires and mr polly was moved to tell how it had happened for the one and twentieth time his story had now become as circumstantial and exact as the evidence of a police witness upset the lamp he said id just lighted it i was going upstairs and my foot slipped against where one of the treads was a bit rotten and down i went thing was aflare in a moment  he yawned at the end of the discussion and moved doorward  so long said mr polly  good night said mr rumbold you played a brave mans part if you dont get a medal  he left an eloquent pause  ear ear said mr wintershed and mr clamp goonight o man said mr hinks  goonight all said mr polly   he went slowly upstairs the vague perplexity common to popular heroes pervaded his mind he entered the bedroom and turned up the electric light it was quite a pleasant room one of the best in the temperance hotel with a nice clean flowered wallpaper and a very large lookingglass miriam appeared to be asleep and her shoulders were humped up under the clothes in a shapeless forbidding lump that mr polly had found utterly loathsome for fifteen years he went softly over to the dressingtable and surveyed himself thoughtfully presently he hitched up the trousers miles too big for me he remarked funny not to have a pair of breeches of ones own like being born again naked came i into the world  miriam stirred and rolled over and stared at him  hello she said  hello  come to bed  its three  pause while mr polly disrobed slowly  i been thinking said miriam it isnt going to be so bad after all we shall get your insurance we can easy begin all over again  hm said mr polly  she turned her face away from him and reflected  get a better house said miriam regarding the wallpaper pattern ive always ated them stairs  mr polly removed a boot  choose a better position where theres more doing murmured miriam  not half so bad she whispered  you wanted stirring up she said half asleep  it dawned upon mr polly for the first time that he had forgotten something  he ought to have cut his throat  the fact struck him as remarkable but as now no longer of any particular urgency it seemed a thing far off in the past and he wondered why he had not thought of it before odd thing life is if he had done it he would never have seen this clean and agreeable apartment with the electric light his thoughts wandered into a question of detail where could he have put the razor down somewhere in the little room behind the shop he supposed but he could not think where more precisely anyhow it didnt matter now  he undressed himself calmly got into bed and fell asleep almost immediately    chapter the ninth  the potwell inn   i  but when a man has once broken through the paper walls of everyday circumstance those unsubstantial walls that hold so many of us securely prisoned from the cradle to the grave he has made a discovery if the world does not please you you can change it determine to alter it at any price and you can change it altogether you may change it to something sinister and angry to something appalling but it may be you will change it to something brighter something more agreeable and at the worst something much more interesting there is only one sort of man who is absolutely to blame for his own misery and that is the man who finds life dull and dreary there are no circumstances in the world that determined action cannot alter unless perhaps they are the walls of a prison cell and even those will dissolve and change i am told into the infirmary compartment at any rate for the man who can fast with resolution i give these things as facts and information and with no moral intimations and mr polly lying awake at nights with a renewed indigestion with miriam sleeping sonorously beside him and a general air of inevitableness about his situation saw through it understood there was no inevitable any more and escaped his former despair  he could for example clear out  it became a wonderful and alluring phrase to him clear out  why had he never thought of clearing out before  he was amazed and a little shocked at the unimaginative and superfluous criminality in him that had turned old cramped and stagnant fishbourne into a blaze and new beginnings i wish from the bottom of my heart i could add that he was properly sorry but something constricting and restrained seemed to have been destroyed by that flare fishbourne wasnt the world that was the new the essential fact of which he had lived so lamentably in ignorance fishbourne as he had known it and hated it so that he wanted to kill himself to get out of it wasnt the world  the insurance money he was to receive made everything humane and kindly and practicable he would clear out with justice and humanity he would take exactly twentyone pounds and all the rest he would leave to miriam that seemed to him absolutely fair without him she could do all sorts of thingsall the sorts of things she was constantly urging him to do  and he would go off along the white road that led to garchester and on to crogate and so to tunbridge wells where there was a toad rock he had heard of but never seen it seemed to him this must needs be a marvel and so to other towns and cities he would walk and loiter by the way and sleep in inns at night and get an odd job here and there and talk to strange people perhaps he would get quite a lot of work and prosper and if he did not do so he would lie down in front of a train or wait for a warm night and then fall into some smooth broad river not so bad as sitting down to a dentist not nearly so bad and he would never open a shop any more never  so the possibilities of the future presented themselves to mr polly as he lay awake at nights  it was springtime and in the woods so soon as one got out of reach of the sea wind there would be anémones and primroses   ii  a month later a leisurely and dusty tramp plump equatorially and slightly bald with his hands in his pockets and his lips puckered to a contemplative whistle strolled along the river bank between uppingdon and potwell it was a profusely budding spring day and greens such as god had never permitted in the world before in human memory though indeed they come every year were mirrored vividly in a mirror of equally unprecedented brown for a time the wanderer stopped and stood still and even the thin whistle died away from his lips as he watched a water vole run to and fro upon a little headland across the stream the vole plopped into the water and swam and dived and only when the last ring of its disturbance had vanished did mr polly resume his thoughtful course to nowhere in particular  for the first time in many years he had been leading a healthy human life living constantly in the open air walking every day for eight or nine hours eating sparingly accepting every conversational opportunity not even disdaining the discussion of possible work and beyond mending a hole in his coat that he had made while negotiating barbed wire with a borrowed needle and thread in a lodging house he had done no work at all neither had he worried about business nor about time and seasons and for the first time in his life he had seen the aurora borealis  so far the holiday had cost him very little he had arranged it on a plan that was entirely his own he had started with four fivepound notes and a pound divided into silver and he had gone by train from fishbourne to ashington at ashington he had gone to the postoffice obtained a registered letter and sent his four fivepound notes with a short brotherly note addressed to himself at gilhampton postoffice he sent this letter to gilhampton for no other reason in the world than that he liked the name of gilhampton and the rural suggestion of its containing county which was sussex and having so despatched it he set himself to discover mark down and walk to gilhampton and so recover his resources and having got to gilhampton at last he changed his fivepound note bought four pound postal orders and repeated his manoeuvre with nineteen pounds  after a lapse of fifteen years he rediscovered this interesting world about which so many people go incredibly blind and bored he went along country roads while all the birds were piping and chirruping and cheeping and singing and looked at fresh new things and felt as happy and irresponsible as a boy with an unexpected halfholiday and if ever the thought of miriam returned to him he controlled his mind he came to country inns and sat for unmeasured hours talking of this and that to those sage carters who rest for ever in the taps of country inns while the big sleek brass jingling horses wait patiently outside with their waggons he got a job with some van people who were wandering about the country with swings and a steam roundabout and remained with them for three days until one of their dogs took a violent dislike to him and made his duties unpleasant he talked to tramps and wayside labourers he snoozed under hedges by day and in outhouses and hayricks at night and once but only once he slept in a casual ward he felt as the etiolated grass and daisies must do when you move the garden roller away to a new place  he gathered a quantity of strange and interesting memories  he crossed some misty meadows by moonlight and the mist lay low on the grass so low that it scarcely reached above his waist and houses and clumps of trees stood out like islands in a milky sea so sharply denned was the upper surface of the mistbank he came nearer and nearer to a strange thing that floated like a boat upon this magic lake and behold something moved at the stern and a rope was whisked at the prow and it had changed into a pensive cow drowsyeyed regarding him  he saw a remarkable sunset in a new valley near maidstone a very red and clear sunset a wide redness under a pale cloudless heaven and with the hills all round the edge of the sky a deep purple blue and clear and flat looking exactly as he had seen mountains painted in pictures he seemed transported to some strange country and would have felt no surprise if the old labourer he came upon leaning silently over a gate had addressed him in an unfamiliar tongue  then one night just towards dawn his sleep upon a pile of brushwood was broken by the distant rattle of a racing motor car breaking all the speed regulations and as he could not sleep again he got up and walked into maidstone as the day came he had never been abroad in a town at halfpast two in his life before and the stillness of everything in the bright sunrise impressed him profoundly at one corner was a startling policeman standing in a doorway quite motionless like a waxen image mr polly wished him good morning unanswered and went down to the bridge over the medway and sat on the parapet very still and thoughtful watching the town awaken and wondering what he should do if it didnt if the world of men never woke again  one day he found himself going along a road with a wide space of sprouting bracken and occasional trees on either side and suddenly this road became strangely perplexingly familiar lord he said and turned about and stood it cant be  he was incredulous then left the road and walked along a scarcely perceptible track to the left and came in half a minute to an old lichenous stone wall it seemed exactly the bit of wall he had known so well it might have been but yesterday he was in that place there remained even a little pile of wood it became absurdly the same wood the bracken perhaps was not so high and most of its fronds still uncoiled that was all here he had stood it seemed and there she had sat and looked down upon him where was she now and what had become of her he counted the years back and marvelled that beauty should have called to him with so imperious a voiceand signified nothing  he hoisted himself with some little difficulty to the top of the wall and saw off under the beech trees two schoolgirlssmall insignificant pigtailed creatures with heads of blond and black with their arms twined about each others necks no doubt telling each other the silliest secrets  but that girl with the red hairwas she a countess was she a queen children perhaps had sorrow dared to touch her  had she forgotten altogether  a tramp sat by the roadside thinking and it seemed to the man in the passing motor car he must needs be plotting for another pot of beer but as a matter of fact what the tramp was saying to himself over and over again was a variant upon a wellknown hebrew word  itchabod the tramp was saying in the voice of one who reasons on the side of the inevitable its fair itchabod o man theres no going back to it   iii  it was about two oclock in the afternoon one hot day in high may when mr polly unhurrying and serene came to that broad bend of the river to which the little lawn and garden of the potwell inn run down he stopped at the sight of the place with its deep tiled roof nestling under big treesyou never get a decently big decently shaped tree by the seasideits sign towards the roadway its sunblistered green bench and tables its shapely white windows and its row of upshooting hollyhock plants in the garden a hedge separated it from a buttercupyellow meadow and beyond stood three poplars in a group against the sky three exceptionally tall graceful and harmonious poplars it is hard to say what there was about them that made them so beautiful to mr polly but they seemed to him to touch a pleasant scene to a distinction almost divine he remained admiring them for a long time at last the need for coarser aesthetic satisfactions arose in him  provinder he whispered drawing near to the inn cold sirlion for choice and nutbrown brew and wheaten bread  the nearer he came to the place the more he liked it the windows on the ground floor were long and low and they had pleasing red blinds the green tables outside were agreeably ringed with memories of former drinks and an extensive grape vine spread level branches across the whole front of the place against the wall was a broken oar two boathooks and the stained and faded red cushions of a pleasure boat one went up three steps to the glasspanelled door and peeped into a broad low room with a bar and beer engine behind which were many bright and helpful looking bottles against mirrors and great and little pewter measures and bottles fastened in brass wire upside down with their corks replaced by taps and a white china cask labelled shrub and cigar boxes and boxes of cigarettes and a couple of toby jugs and a beautifully coloured hunting scene framed and glazed showing the most elegant and beautiful people taking pipers cherry brandy and cards such as the law requires about the dilution of spirits and the illegality of bringing children into bars and satirical verses about swearing and asking for credit and three very bright redcheeked wax apples and a roundshaped clock  but these were the mere background to the really pleasant thing in the spectacle which was quite the plumpest woman mr polly had ever seen seated in an armchair in the midst of all these bottles and glasses and glittering things peacefully and tranquilly and without the slightest loss of dignity asleep many people would have called her a fat woman but mr pollys innate sense of epithet told him from the outset that plump was the word she had shapely brows and a straight wellshaped nose kind lines and contentment about her mouth and beneath it the jolly chins clustered like chubby little cherubim about the feet of an assumptioningmadonna her plumpness was firm and pink and wholesome and her hands dimpled at every joint were clasped in front of her she seemed as it were to embrace herself with infinite confidence and kindliness as one who knew herself good in substance good in essence and would show her gratitude to god by that ready acceptance of all that he had given her her head was a little on one side not much but just enough to speak of trustfulness and rob her of the stiff effect of selfreliance and she slept  my sort said mr polly and opened the door very softly divided between the desire to enter and come nearer and an instinctive indisposition to break slumbers so manifestly sweet and satisfying  she awoke with a start and it amazed mr polly to see swift terror flash into her eyes instantly it had gone again  law she said her face softening with relief i thought you were jim  im never jim said mr polly  youve got his sort of hat  ah said mr polly and leant over the bar  it just came into my head you was jim said the plump lady dismissed the topic and stood up i believe i was having forty winks she said if all the truth was told what can i do for you  cold meat said mr polly  there is cold meat the plump woman admitted  and room for it  the plump woman came and leant over the bar and regarded him judicially but kindly theres some cold boiled beef she said and added a bit of crisp lettuce  new mustard said mr polly  and a tankard  a tankard  they understood each other perfectly  looking for work asked the plump woman  in a way said mr polly  they smiled like old friends  whatever the truth may be about love there is certainly such a thing as friendship at first sight they liked each others voices they liked each others way of smiling and speaking  its such beautiful weather this spring said mr polly explaining everything  what sort of work do you want she asked  ive never properly thought that out said mr polly ive been looking roundfor ideas  will you have your beef in the tap or outside thats the tap  mr polly had a glimpse of an oaken settle in the tap will be handier for you he said  hear that said the plump lady  hear what  listen  presently the silence was broken by a distant howl oooooover eh she said  he nodded  thats the ferry and there isnt a ferryman  could i  can you punt  never tried  wellpull the pole out before you reach the end of the punt thats all try  mr polly went out again into the sunshine  at times one can tell so much so briefly here are the facts thenbare he found a punt and a pole got across to the steps on the opposite side picked up an elderly gentleman in an alpaca jacket and a pith helmet cruised with him vaguely for twenty minutes conveyed him tortuously into the midst of a thicket of forgetmenot spangled sedges splashed some waterweed over him hit him twice with the punt pole and finally landed him alarmed but abusive in treacherous soil at the edge of a hay meadow about forty yards down stream where he immediately got into difficulties with a noisy aggressive little white dog which was guardian of a jacket  mr polly returned in a complicated manner to his moorings  he found the plump woman rather flushed and tearful and seated at one of the green tables outside  i been laughing at you she said  what for asked mr polly  i aint ad such a laugh since jim come ome when you it is ed it urt my side  it didnt hurt his headnot particularly  she waved her head did you charge him anything  gratis said mr polly i never thought of it  the plump woman pressed her hands to her sides and laughed silently for a space you ought to have charged him sumpthing she said you better come and have your cold meat before you do any more puntin you and mell get on together  presently she came and stood watching him eat you eat better than you punt she said and then i dessay you could learn to punt  wax to receive and marble to retain said mr polly this beef is a bit of all right mam i could have done differently if i hadnt been punting on an empty stomach theres a lear feeling as the pole goes in  ive never held with fasting said the plump woman  you want a ferryman  i want an odd man about the place  im odd all right whats your wages  not much but you get tips and pickings ive a sort of feeling it would suit you  ive a sort of feeling it would whats the duties fetch and carry ferry garden wash bottles ceteris paribus  thats about it said the fat woman  give me a trial  ive more than half a mind or i wouldnt have said anything about it i suppose youre all right youve got a sort of halfrespectable look about you i suppose you avent done anything  bit of arson said mr polly as if he jested  so long as you havent the habit said the plump woman  my first time mam said mr polly munching his way through an excellent big leaf of lettuce and my last  its all right if you havent been to prison said the plump woman it isnt what a mans happened to do makes im bad we all happen to do things at times its bringing it home to him and spoiling his selfrespect does the mischief you dont look a wrong un ave you been to prison  never  nor a reformatory nor any institution  not me do i look reformed  can you paint and carpenter a bit  well im ripe for it  have a bit of cheese  if i might  and the way she brought the cheese showed mr polly that the business was settled in her mind  he spent the afternoon exploring the premises of the potwell inn and learning the duties that might be expected of him such as stockholm tarring fences digging potatoes swabbing out boats helping people land embarking landing and timekeeping for the hirers of two rowing boats and one canadian canoe baling out the said vessels and concealing their leaks and defects from prospective hirers persuading inexperienced hirers to start down stream rather than up repairing rowlocks and taking inventories of returning boats with a view to supplementary charges cleaning boots sweeping chimneys housepainting cleaning windows sweeping out and sanding the tap and bar cleaning pewter washing glasses turpentining woodwork whitewashing generally plumbing and engineering repairing locks and clocks waiting and tapsters work generally beating carpets and mats cleaning bottles and saving corks taking into the cellar moving tapping and connecting beer casks with their engines blocking and destroying wasps nests doing forestry with several trees drowning superfluous kittens and dogfancying as required assisting in the rearing of ducklings and the care of various poultry beekeeping stabling baiting and grooming horses and asses cleaning and garing motor cars and bicycles inflating tires and repairing punctures recovering the bodies of drowned persons from the river as required and assisting people in trouble in the water firstaid and sympathy improvising and superintending a bathing station for visitors attending inquests and funerals in the interests of the establishment scrubbing floors and all the ordinary duties of a scullion the ferry chasing hens and goats from the adjacent cottages out of the garden making up paths and superintending drainage gardening generally delivering bottled beer and soda water syphons in the neighbourhood running miscellaneous errands removing drunken and offensive persons from the premises by tact or muscle as occasion required keeping in with the local policemen defending the premises in general and the orchard in particular from depredators  can but try it said mr polly towards tea time when theres nothing else on hand i suppose i might do a bit of fishing   iv  mr polly was particularly charmed by the ducklings  they were piping about among the vegetables in the company of their foster mother and as he and the plump woman came down the garden path the little creatures mobbed them and ran over their boots and in between mr pollys legs and did their best to be trodden upon and killed after the manner of ducklings all the world over mr polly had never been near young ducklings before and their extreme blondness and the delicate completeness of their feet and beaks filled him with admiration it is open to question whether there is anything more friendly in the world than a very young duckling it was with the utmost difficulty that he tore himself away to practise punting with the plump woman coaching from the bank punting he found was difficult but not impossible and towards four oclock he succeeded in conveying a second passenger across the sundering flood from the inn to the unknown  as he returned slowly indeed but now one might almost say surely to the peg to which the punt was moored he became aware of a singularly delightful human being awaiting him on the bank she stood with her legs very wide apart her hands behind her back and her head a little on one side watching his gestures with an expression of disdainful interest she had black hair and brown legs and a buff short frock and very intelligent eyes and when he had reached a sufficient proximity she remarked hello  hello said mr polly and saved himself in the nick of time from disaster  silly said the young lady and mr polly lunged nearer  what are you called  polly  liar  why  im polly  then im alfred but i meant to be polly  i was first  all right im going to be the ferryman  i see youll have to punt better  you should have seen me early in the afternoon  i can imagine it ive seen the others  what others mr polly had landed now and was fastening up the punt  what uncle jim has scooted  scooted  he comes and scoots them hell scoot you too i expect  a mysterious shadow seemed to fall athwart the sunshine and pleasantness of the potwell inn  im not a scooter said mr polly  uncle jim is  she whistled a little flatly for a moment and threw small stones at a clump of meadowsweet that sprang from the bank then she remarked  when uncle jim comes back hell cut your insides out praps very likely hell let me see  there was a pause  whos uncle jim mr polly asked in a faded voice  dont you know who uncle jim is hell show you hes a scorcher is uncle jim he only came back just a little time ago and hes scooted three men he dont like strangers about dont uncle jim he can swear hes going to teach me soon as i can whissle properly  teach you to swear cried mr polly horrified  and spit said the little girl proudly he says im the gamest little beast he ever came acrossever  for the first time in his life it seemed to mr polly that he had come across something sheerly dreadful he stared at the pretty thing of flesh and spirit in front of him lightly balanced on its stout little legs and looking at him with eyes that had still to learn the expression of either disgust or fear  i say said mr polly how old are you  nine said the little girl  she turned away and reflected truth compelled her to add one other statement  hes not what i should call handsome not uncle jim she said but hes a scorcher and no mistake gramma dont like him   v  mr polly found the plump woman in the big bricked kitchen lighting a fire for tea he went to the root of the matter at once  i say he asked whos uncle jim  the plump woman blanched and stood still for a moment a stick fell out of the bundle in her hand unheeded  that little granddaughter of mine been saying things she asked faintly  bits of things said mr polly  well i suppose i must tell you sooner or later hes its jim hes the drorback to this place thats what he is the drorback i hoped you mightnt hear so soon very likely hes gone  she dont seem to think so  e asnt been near the place these two weeks and more said the plump woman  but who is he  i suppose i got to tell you said the plump woman  she says he scoots people mr polly remarked after a pause  hes my own sisters son the plump woman watched the crackling fire for a space i suppose i got to tell you she repeated  she softened towards tears i try not to think of it and night and day hes haunting me i try not to think of it ive been for easygoing all my life but im that worried and afraid with death and ruin threatened and evil all about me i dont know what to do my own sisters son and me a widow woman and elpless against his doins  she put down the sticks she held upon the fender and felt for her handkerchief she began to sob and talk quickly  i wouldnt mind nothing else half so much if hed leave that child alone but he goes talking to herif i leave her a moment hes talking to her teaching her words and giving her ideas  thats a bit thick said mr polly  thick cried the plump woman its orrible and what am i to do hes been here three times now six days and a week and a part of a week and i pray to god night and day he may never come again praying back hes come sure as fate he takes my money and he takes my things he wont let no man stay here to protect me or do the boats or work the ferry the ferrys getting a scandal they stand and shout and scream and use language if i complain theyll say im helpless to manage here theyll take away my license out i shall goand its all the living i can getand he knows it and he plays on it and he dont care and here i am id send the child away but i got nowhere to send the child i buys him off when it comes to that and back he comes worse than ever prowling round and doing evil and not a soul to help me not a soul i just hoped there might be a day or so before he comes back again i was just hopingim the sort that hopes  mr polly was reflecting on the flaws and drawbacks that seem to be inseparable from all the more agreeable things in life  biggish sort of man i expect asked mr polly trying to get the situation in all its bearings  but the plump woman did not heed him she was going on with her firemaking and retailing in disconnected fragments the fearfulness of uncle jim  there was always something a bit wrong with him she said but nothing you mightnt have hoped for not till they took him and carried him off and reformed him  he was cruel to the hens and chickings its true and stuck a knife into another boy but then ive seen him that nice to a cat nobody could have been kinder im sure he didnt do no arm to that cat whatever anyone tries to make out of it id never listen to that it was that reformatory ruined him they put him along of a lot of london boys full of ideas of wickedness and because he didnt mind painand he dont i will admit try as i wouldthey made him think himself a hero them boys laughed at the teachers they set over them laughed and mocked at themand i dont suppose they was the best teachers in the world i dont suppose and i dont suppose anyone sensible does suppose that everyone who goes to be a teacher or a chaplin or a warder in a reformatory home goes and changes right away into an angel of grace from heavenand oh lord where was i  what did they send him to the reformatory for  playing truant and stealing he stole right enoughstole the money from an old woman and what was i to do when it came to the trial but say what i knew and him like a viper alooking at memore like a viper than a human boy he leans on the bar and looks at me all right aunt flo he says just that and nothing more time after time ive dreamt of it and now hes come theyve reformed me he says and made me a devil and devil i mean to be to you so out with it he says  what did you give him last time asked mr polly  three golden pounds said the plump woman  that wont last very long he says but there aint no hurry ill be back in a week about if i wasnt one of the hoping sort  she left the sentence unfinished  mr polly reflected what sort of a size is he he asked im not one of your herculaceous sort if you mean that nothing very wonderful bicepitally  youll scoot said the plump woman with conviction rather than bitterness youd better scoot now and ill try and find some money for him to go away again when he comes it aint reasonable to expect you to do anything but scoot but i suppose its the way of a woman in trouble to try and get help from a man and hope and hope im the hoping sort  how longs he been about asked mr polly ignoring his own outlook  three months it is come the seventh since he come in by that very back doorand i hadnt set eyes on him for seven long years he stood in the door watchin me and suddenly he let off a yelplike a dog and there he was grinning at the fright hed given me good old aunty flo he says aint you deelighted to see me he says now im reformed  the plump lady went to the sink and filled the kettle  i never did like im she said standing at the sink and seeing him there with his teeth all black and broken praps i didnt give him much of a welcome at first not what would have been kind to him lord i said its jim  its jim he said like a bad shillinlike a damned bad shilling jim and trouble you all of you wanted me reformed and now you got me reformed im a reformatory reformed character warranted all right and turned out as such aint you going to ask me in aunty dear  come in i said i wont have it said i wasnt ready to be kind to you  he comes in and shuts the door down he sits in that chair i come to torment you he says you old sumpthing and begins at me no human being could ever have been called such things before it made me cry out and now he says just to show i aint afraid of urting you he says and ups and twists my wrist  mr polly gasped  i could stand even his vilence said the plump woman if it wasnt for the child  mr polly went to the kitchen window and surveyed his namesake who was away up the garden path with her hands behind her back and whisps of black hair in disorder about her little face thinking thinking profoundly about ducklings  you two oughtnt to be left he said  the plump woman stared at his back with hard hope in her eyes  i dont see that its my affair said mr polly  the plump woman resumed her business with the kettle  id like to have a look at him before i go said mr polly thinking aloud and added somehow not my business of course  lord he cried with a start at a noise in the bar whos that  only a customer said the plump woman   vi  mr polly made no rash promises and thought a great deal  it seems a good sort of crib he said and added for a chap whos looking for trouble  but he stayed on and did various things out of the list i have already given and worked the ferry and it was four days before he saw anything of uncle jim and so resistent is the human mind to things not yet experienced that he could easily have believed in that time that there was no such person in the world as uncle jim the plump woman after her one outbreak of confidence ignored the subject and little polly seemed to have exhausted her impressions in her first communication and engaged her mind now with a simple directness in the study and subjugation of the new human being heaven had sent into her world the first unfavourable impression of his punting was soon effaced he could nickname ducklings very amusingly create boats out of wooden splinters and stalk and fly from imaginary tigers in the orchard with a convincing earnestness that was surely beyond the power of any other human being she conceded at last that he should be called mr polly in honour of her miss polly even as he desired  uncle jim turned up in the twilight  uncle jim appeared with none of the disruptive violence mr polly had dreaded he came quite softly mr polly was going down the lane behind the church that led to the potwell inn after posting a letter to the limejuice people at the postoffice he was walking slowly after his habit and thinking discursively with a sudden tightening of the muscles he became aware of a figure walking noiselessly beside him his first impression was of a face singularly broad above and with a wide empty grin as its chief feature below of a slouching body and dragging feet  arf a mo said the figure as if in response to his start and speaking in a hoarse whisper arf a mo mister you the noo bloke at the potwell inn  mr polly felt evasive spose i am he replied hoarsely and quickened his pace  arf a mo said uncle jim taking his arm we aint doing a sanguinary marathon it aint a decorated cinder track i want a word with you mister see  mr polly wriggled his arm free and stopped what is it he asked and faced the terror  i jest want a decorated word wiv you seejust a friendly word or two just to clear up any blooming errors thats all i want no need to be so richly decorated proud if you are the noo bloke at potwell inn not a bit of it see  uncle jim was certainly not a handsome person he was short shorter than mr polly with long arms and lean big hands a thin and wiry neck stuck out of his grey flannel shirt and supported a big head that had something of the snake in the convergent lines of its broad knotty brow meanly proportioned face and pointed chin his almost toothless mouth seemed a cavern in the twilight some accident had left him with one small and active and one large and expressionless reddish eye and wisps of straight hair strayed from under the blue cricket cap he wore pulled down obliquely over the latter he spat between his teeth and wiped his mouth untidily with the soft side of his fist  you got to blurry well shift he said see  shift said mr polly how  cos the potwell inns my beat see  mr polly had never felt less witty hows it your beat he asked  uncle jim thrust his face forward and shook his open hand bent like a claw under mr pollys nose not your blooming business he said  you got to shift  spose i dont said mr polly  you got to shift  the tone of uncle jims voice became urgent and confidential  you dont know who youre up against he said its a kindness im doing to warn you see im just one of those blokes who dont stick at things see i dont stick at nuffin  mr pollys manner became detached and confidentialas though the matter and the speaker interested him greatly but didnt concern him overmuch what do you think youll do he asked  if you dont clear out  yes  gaw said uncle jim youd better ere  he gripped mr pollys wrist with a grip of steel and in an instant mr polly understood the relative quality of their muscles he breathed an uninspiring breath into mr pollys face  what wont i do he said once i start in on you  he paused and the night about them seemed to be listening ill make a mess of you he said in his hoarse whisper ill do youinjuries ill urt you ill kick you ugly see ill urt you in orrible waysorrible ugly ways  he scrutinised mr pollys face  youll cry he said to see yourself see cry you will  you got no right began mr polly  right his note was fierce aint the old woman me aunt  he spoke still closer ill make a gory mess of you ill cut bits orf you  he receded a little i got no quarrel with you he said  its too late to go tonight said mr polly  ill be round tomorrerbout eleven see and if i finds you  he produced a bloodcurdling oath  hm said mr polly trying to keep things light well consider your suggestions  you better said uncle jim and suddenly noiselessly was going  his whispering voice sank until mr polly could hear only the dim fragments of sentences orrible things to youorrible things kick yer ugly cut yerliver out spread it all about i will outing doos see i dont care a dead rat one way or the uvver  and with a curious twisting gesture of the arm uncle jim receded until his face was a still dim thing that watched and the black shadows of the hedge seemed to have swallowed up his body altogether   vii  next morning about halfpast ten mr polly found himself seated under a clump of fir trees by the roadside and about three miles and a half from the potwell inn he was by no means sure whether he was taking a walk to clear his mind or leaving that threatmarred paradise for good and all his reason pointed a lean unhesitating finger along the latter course  for after all the thing was not his quarrel  that agreeable plump woman agreeable motherly comfortable as she might be wasnt his affair that child with the mop of black hair who combined so magically the charm of mouse and butterfly and flitting bird who was daintier than a flower and softer than a peach was no concern of his good heavens what were they to him nothing  uncle jim of course had a claim a sort of claim  if it came to duty and chucking up this attractive indolent observant humorous tramping life there were those who had a right to him a legitimate right a prior claim on his protection and chivalry  why not listen to the call of duty and go back to miriam now  he had had a very agreeable holiday  and while mr polly sat thinking these things as well as he could he knew that if only he dared to look up the heavens had opened and the clear judgment on his case was written across the sky  he knewhe knew now as much as a man can know of life he knew he had to fight or perish  life had never been so clear to him before it had always been a confused entertaining spectacle he had responded to this impulse and that seeking agreeable and entertaining things evading difficult and painful things such is the way of those who grow up to a life that has neither danger nor honour in its texture he had been muddled and wrapped about and entangled like a creature born in the jungle who has never seen sea or sky now he had come out of it suddenly into a great exposed place it was as if god and heaven waited over him and all the earth was expectation  not my business said mr polly speaking aloud where the devil do i come in  and again with something between a whine and a snarl in his voice not my blasted business  his mind seemed to have divided itself into several compartments each with its own particular discussion busily in progress and quite regardless of the others one was busy with the detailed interpretation of the phrase kick you ugly theres a sort of french wrestling in which you use and guard against feet watch the mans eye and as his foot comes up grip and over he goesat your mercy if you use the advantage right but how do you use the advantage rightly  when he thought of uncle jim the inside feeling of his body faded away rapidly to a blank discomfort  old cadger she hadnt no business to drag me into her quarrels ought to go to the police and ask for help dragging me into a quarrel that dont concern me  wish id never set eyes on the rotten inn  the reality of the case arched over him like the vault of the sky as plain as the sweet blue heavens above and the wide spread of hill and valley about him man comes into life to seek and find his sufficient beauty to serve it to win and increase it to fight for it to face anything and dare anything for it counting death as nothing so long as the dying eyes still turn to it and fear and dulness and indolence and appetite which indeed are no more than fears three crippled brothers who make ambushes and creep by night are against him to delay him to hold him off to hamper and beguile and kill him in that quest he had but to lift his eyes to see all that as much a part of his world as the driving clouds and the bending grass but he kept himself downcast a grumbling inglorious dirty fattish little tramp full of dreads and quivering excuses  why the hell was i ever born he said with the truth almost winning him  what do you do when a dirty man who smells gets you down and under in the dirt and dust with a knee below your diaphragm and a large hairy hand squeezing your windpipe tighter and tighter in a quarrel that isnt properly speaking yours  if i had a chance against him protested mr polly  its no good you see said mr polly  he stood up as though his decision was made and was for an instant struck still by doubt  there lay the road before him going this way to the east and that to the west  westward one hour away now was the potwell inn already things might be happening there  eastward was the wise mans course a road dipping between hedges to a hop garden and a wood and presently no doubt reaching an inn a picturesque church perhaps a village and fresh company the wise mans course mr polly saw himself going along it and tried to see himself going along it with all the selfapplause a wise man feels but somehow it wouldnt come like that the wise man fell short of happiness for all his wisdom the wise man had a paunch and round shoulders and red ears and excuses it was a pleasant road and why the wise man should not go along it merry and singing full of summer happiness was a miracle to mr pollys mind but confound it the fact remained the figure went slinkingslinking was the only word for itand would not go otherwise than slinking he turned his eyes westward as if for an explanation and if the figure was no longer ignoble the prospect was appalling  one kick in the stummick would settle a chap like me said mr polly  oh god cried mr polly and lifted his eyes to heaven and said for the last time in that struggle it isnt my affair  and so saying he turned his face towards the potwell inn  he went back neither halting nor hastening in his pace after this last decision but with a mind feverishly busy  if i get killed i get killed and if he gets killed i get hung dont seem just somehow  dont suppose i shall frighten him off   viii  the private war between mr polly and uncle jim for the possession of the potwell inn fell naturally into three chief campaigns there was first of all the great campaign which ended in the triumphant eviction of uncle jim from the inn premises there came next after a brief interval the futile invasions of the premises by uncle jim that culminated in the battle of the dead eel and after some months of involuntary truce there was the last supreme conflict of the night surprise each of these campaigns merits a section to itself  mr polly reentered the inn discreetly he found the plump woman seated in her bar her eyes astare her face white and wet with tears o god she was saying over and over again o god the air was full of a spirituous reek and on the sanded boards in front of the bar were the fragments of a broken bottle and an overturned glass  she turned her despair at the sound of his entry and despair gave place to astonishment  you come back she said  rather said mr polly  heshes mad drunk and looking for her  where is she  locked upstairs  havent you sent to the police  no one to send  ill see to it said mr polly out this way  she nodded  he went to the crinkly paned window and peered out uncle jim was coming down the garden path towards the house his hands in his pockets and singing hoarsely mr polly remembered afterwards with pride and amazement that he felt neither faint nor rigid he glanced round him seized a bottle of beer by the neck as an improvised club and went out by the garden door uncle jim stopped amazed his brain did not instantly rise to the new posture of things you he cried and stopped for a moment youscoot  your job said mr polly and advanced some paces  uncle jim stood swaying with wrathful astonishment and then darted forward with clutching hands mr polly felt that if his antagonist closed he was lost and smote with all his force at the ugly head before him smash went the bottle and uncle jim staggered halfstunned by the blow and blinded with beer  the lapses and leaps of the human mind are for ever mysterious mr polly had never expected that bottle to break in the instant he felt disarmed and helpless before him was uncle jim infuriated and evidently still coming on and for defence was nothing but the neck of a bottle  for a time our mr polly has figured heroic now comes the fall again he sounded abject terror he dropped that ineffectual scrap of glass and turned and fled round the corner of the house  bolls came the thick voice of the enemy behind him as one who accepts a challenge and bleeding but indomitable uncle jim entered the house  bolls he said surveying the bar fightin with bolls ill show im fightin with bolls  uncle jim had learnt all about fighting with bottles in the reformatory home regardless of his terrorstricken aunt he ranged among the bottled beer and succeeded after one or two failures in preparing two bottles to his satisfaction by knocking off the bottoms and gripping them daggerwise by the necks so prepared he went forth again to destroy mr polly  mr polly freed from the sense of urgent pursuit had halted beyond the raspberry canes and rallied his courage the sense of uncle jim victorious in the house restored his manhood he went round by the outhouses to the riverside seeking a weapon and found an old paddle boat hook with this he smote uncle jim as he emerged by the door of the tap uncle jim blaspheming dreadfully and with dire stabbing intimations in either hand came through the splintering paddle like a circus rider through a paper hoop and once more mr polly dropped his weapon and fled  a careless observer watching him sprint round and round the inn in front of the lumbering and reproachful pursuit of uncle jim might have formed an altogether erroneous estimate of the issue of the campaign certain compensating qualities of the very greatest military value were appearing in mr polly even as he ran if uncle jim had strength and brute courage and the rich toughening experience a reformatory home affords mr polly was nevertheless sober more mobile and with a mind now stimulated to an almost incredible nimbleness so that he not only gained on uncle jim but thought what use he might make of this advantage the word strategious flamed red across the tumult of his mind as he came round the house for the third time he darted suddenly into the yard swung the door to behind himself and bolted it seized the zinc pigs pail that stood by the entrance to the kitchen and had it neatly and resonantly over uncle jims head as he came belatedly in round the outhouse on the other side one of the splintered bottles jabbed mr pollys earat the time it seemed of no importanceand then uncle jim was down and writhing dangerously and noisily upon the yard tiles with his head still in the pig pail and his bottles gone to splinters and mr polly was fastening the kitchen door against him  cant go on like this for ever said mr polly whooping for breath and selecting a weapon from among the brooms that stood behind the kitchen door  uncle jim was losing his head he was up and kicking the door and bellowing unamiable proposals and invitations so that a strategist emerging silently by the tap door could locate him without difficulty steal upon him unawares and  but before that felling blow could be delivered uncle jims ear had caught a footfall and he turned mr polly quailed and lowered his brooma fatal hesitation  now i got you cried uncle jim dancing forward in a disconcerting zigzag  he rushed to close and mr polly stopped him neatly as it were a miracle with the head of the broom across his chest uncle jim seized the broom with both hands leago he said and tugged mr polly shook his head tugged and showed pale compressed lips both tugged then uncle jim tried to get round the end of the broom mr polly circled away they began to circle about one another both tugging hard both intensely watchful of the slightest initiative on the part of the other mr polly wished brooms were longer twelve or thirteen feet for example uncle jim was clearly for shortness in brooms he wasted breath in saying what was to happen shortly sanguinary oriental soulblenching things when the broom no longer separated them mr polly thought he had never seen an uglier person suddenly uncle jim flashed into violent activity but alcohol slows movement and mr polly was equal to him then uncle jim tried jerks and for a terrible instant seemed to have the broom out of mr pollys hands but mr polly recovered it with the clutch of a drowning man then uncle jim drove suddenly at mr pollys midriff but again mr polly was ready and swept him round in a circle then suddenly a wild hope filled mr polly he saw the river was very near the post to which the punt was tied not three yards away with a wild yell he sent the broom home into his antagonists ribs  woosh he cried as the resistance gave  oh gaw said uncle jim going backward helplessly and mr polly thrust hard and abandoned the broom to the enemys despairing clutch  splash uncle jim was in the water and mr polly had leapt like a cat aboard the ferry punt and grasped the pole  up came uncle jim spluttering and dripping you unprofitable matter and printing it would lead to a censorship of novels you know i got a weak chess  the pole took him in the throat and drove him backward and downwards  lea go cried uncle jim staggering and with real terror in his once awful eyes  splash down he fell backwards into a frothing mass of water with mr polly jabbing at him under water he turned round and came up again as if in flight towards the middle of the river directly his head reappeared mr polly had him between the shoulders and under again bubbling thickly a hand clutched and disappeared  it was stupendous mr polly had discovered the heel of achilles uncle jim had no stomach for cold water the broom floated away pitching gently on the swell mr polly infuriated with victory thrust uncle jim under again and drove the punt round on its chain in such a manner that when uncle jim came up for the fourth timeand now he was nearly out of his depth too buoyed up to walk and apparently nearly helplessmr polly fortunately for them both could not reach him uncle jim made the clumsy gestures of those who struggle insecurely in the water keep out said mr polly uncle jim with a great effort got a footing emerged until his armpits were out of water until his waistcoat buttons showed one by one till scarcely two remained and made for the camp sheeting  keep out cried mr polly and leapt off the punt and followed the movements of his victim along the shore  i tell you i got a weak chess said uncle jim moistly this aint fair fightin  keep out said mr polly  this aint fair fightin said uncle jim almost weeping and all his terrors had gone  keep out said mr polly with an accurately poised pole  i tell you i got to land you fool said uncle jim with a sort of despairing wrathfulness and began moving downstream  you keep out said mr polly in parallel movement dont you ever land on this place again  slowly argumentatively and reluctantly uncle jim waded downstream he tried threats he tried persuasion he even tried a belated note of pathos mr polly remained inexorable if in secret a little perplexed as to the outcome of the situation this colds getting to my marrer said uncle jim  you want cooling you keep out in it said mr polly  they came round the bend into sight of nicholsons ait where the backwater runs down to the potwell mill and there after much parley and several feints uncle jim made a desperate effort and struggled into clutch of the overhanging osiers on the island and so got out of the water with the millstream between them he emerged dripping and muddy and vindictive by gaw he said ill skin you for this  you keep off or ill do worse to you said mr polly  the spirit was out of uncle jim for the time and he turned away to struggle through the osiers towards the mill leaving a shining trail of water among the greengrey stems  mr polly returned slowly and thoughtfully to the inn and suddenly his mind began to bubble with phrases the plump woman stood at the top of the steps that led up to the inn door to greet him  law she cried as he drew near asnt e killed you  do i look like it said mr polly  but wheres jim  gone off  e was mad drunk and dangerous  i put him in the river said mr polly that toned down his alcolaceous frenzy i gave him a bit of a doing altogether  haint he urt you  not a bit of it  then whats all that blood beside your ear  mr polly felt quite a cut funny how one overlooks things heated moments he must have done that when he jabbed about with those bottles hullo kiddy you venturing downstairs again  aint he killed you asked the little girl  well  i wish id seen more of the fighting  didnt you  all i saw was you running round the house and uncle jim after you  there was a little pause i was leading him on said mr polly  someones shouting at the ferry she said  right o but you wont see any more of uncle jim for a bit weve been having a conversazione about that  i believe it is uncle jim said the little girl  then he can wait said mr polly shortly  he turned round and listened for the words that drifted across from the little figure on the opposite bank so far as he could judge uncle jim was making an appointment for the morrow he replied with a defiant movement of the punt pole the little figure was convulsed for a moment and then went on its way upstreamfiercely  so it was the first campaign ended in an insecure victory   ix  the next day was wednesday and a slack day for the potwell inn it was a hot close day full of the murmuring of bees one or two people crossed by the ferry an elaborately equipped fisherman stopped for cold meat and dry ginger ale in the bar parlour some haymakers came and drank beer for an hour and afterwards sent jars and jugs by a boy to be replenished that was all mr polly had risen early and was busy about the place meditating upon the probable tactics of uncle jim he was no longer strung up to the desperate pitch of the first encounter but he was grave and anxious uncle jim had shrunken as all antagonists that are boldly faced shrink after the first battle to the negotiable the vulnerable formidable he was no doubt but not invincible he had under providence been defeated once and he might be defeated altogether  mr polly went about the place considering the militant possibilities of pacific things pokers copper sticks garden implements kitchen knives garden nets barbed wire oars clothes lines blankets pewter pots stockings and broken bottles he prepared a club with a stocking and a bottle inside upon the best east end model he swung it round his head once broke an outhouse window with a flying fragment of glass and ruined the stocking beyond all darning he developed a subtle scheme with the cellar flap as a sort of pitfall but he rejected it finally because a it might entrap the plump woman and b he had no use whatever for uncle jim in the cellar he determined to wire the garden that evening burglar fashion against the possibilities of a night attack  towards two oclock in the afternoon three young men arrived in a capacious boat from the direction of lammam and asked permission to camp in the paddock it was given all the more readily by mr polly because he perceived in their proximity a possible check upon the selfexpression of uncle jim but he did not foresee and no one could have foreseen that uncle jim stealing unawares upon the potwell inn in the late afternoon armed with a large roughhewn stake should have mistaken the bending form of one of those camperswho was pulling a few onions by permission in the gardenfor mr pollys and crept upon it swiftly and silently and smitten its wide invitation unforgettably and unforgiveably it was an error impossible to explain the resounding whack went up to heaven the cry of amazement and mr polly emerged from the inn armed with the fryingpan he was cleaning to take this reckless assailant in the rear uncle jim realising his error fled blaspheming into the arms of the other two campers who were returning from the village with butchers meat and groceries they caught him they smacked his face with steak and punched him with a bursting parcel of lump sugar they held him though he bit them and their idea of punishment was to duck him they were hilarious strong young stockbrokers clerks territorials and seasoned boating men they ducked him as though it was romping and all that mr polly had to do was to pick up lumps of sugar for them and wipe them on his sleeve and put them on a plate and explain that uncle jim was a notorious bad character and not quite right in his head  got a regular obsession that the missis is his aunt said mr polly expanding it perfect noosance he is  but he caught a glance of uncle jims eye as he receded before the campers urgency that boded ill for him and in the night he had a disagreeable idea that perhaps his luck might not hold for the third occasion  that came soon enough so soon indeed as the campers had gone  thursday was the early closing day at lammam and next to sunday the busiest part of the week at the potwell inn sometimes as many as six boats all at once would be moored against the ferry punt and hiring rowboats people could either have a complete tea a complete tea with jam cake and eggs a kettle of boiling water and find the rest or refreshments á la carte as they chose they sat about but usually the boiling waterers had a delicacy about using the tables and grouped themselves humbly on the ground the complete teaers with jam and eggs got the best tablecloth on the table nearest the steps that led up to the glasspanelled door the groups about the lawn were very satisfying to mr pollys sense of amenity to the right were the complete teaers with everything heart could desire then a small group of three young men in remarkable green and violet and paleblue shirts and two girls in mauve and yellow blouses with common teas and gooseberry jam at the green clothless table then on the grass down by the pollard willow a small family of hot waterers with a hamper a little troubled by wasps in their jam from the nest in the tree and all in mourning but happy otherwise and on the lawn to the right a ginger beer lot of prentices without their collars and very jocular and happy the young people in the rainbow shirts and blouses formed the centre of interest they were under the leadership of a goldspectacled senior with a fluting voice and an air of mystery he ordered everything and showed a peculiar knowledge of the qualities of the potwell jams preferring gooseberry with much insistence mr polly watched him christened him the benifluous influence glanced at the prentices and went inside and down into the cellar in order to replenish the stock of stone ginger beer which the plump woman had allowed to run low during the preoccupations of the campaign it was in the cellar that he first became aware of the return of uncle jim he became aware of him as a voice a voice not only hoarse but thick as voices thicken under the influence of alcohol  wheres that muddyfaced mongrel cried uncle jim let im come out to me wheres that blighted whisp with the punt polei got a word to say to im come out of it you potbellied chunk of dirtiness you come out and ave your ugly face wiped i got a thing for you ear me  es iding thats what es doing said the voice of uncle jim dropping for a moment to sorrow and then with a great increment of wrathfulness come out of my nest you blinking cuckoo you or ill cut your silly insides out come out of ityou pockmarked rat stealing another mans ome away from im come out and look me in the face you squinting son of a skunk  mr polly took the ginger beer and went thoughtfully upstairs to the bar  es back said the plump woman as he appeared i knew ed come back  i heard him said mr polly and looked about just gimme the old poker handle thats under the beer engine  the door opened softly and mr polly turned quickly but it was only the pointed nose and intelligent face of the young man with the gilt spectacles and discreet manner he coughed and the spectacles fixed mr polly  i say he said with quiet earnestness theres a chap out here seems to want someone  why dont he come in said mr polly  he seems to want you out there  whats he want  i think said the spectacled young man after a thoughtful moment he appears to have brought you a present of fish  isnt he shouting  he is a little boisterous  hed better come in  the manner of the spectacled young man intensified i wish youd come out and persuade him to go away he said his languageisnt quite the thingladies  it never was said the plump woman her voice charged with sorrow  mr polly moved towards the door and stood with his hand on the handle the goldspectacled face disappeared  now my man came his voice from outside be careful what youre saying  oo in all the world and hereafter are you to call me me man cried uncle jim in the voice of one astonished and pained beyond endurance and added scornfully you goldeyed geezer you  tut tut said the gentleman in gilt glasses restrain yourself  mr polly emerged poker in hand just in time to see what followed uncle jim in his shirtsleeves and a state of ferocious decolletage was holding somethingyesa dead eel by means of a piece of newspaper about its tail holding it down and back and a little sideways in such a way as to smite with it upward and hard it struck the spectacled gentleman under the jaw with a peculiar dead thud and a cry of horror came from the two seated parties at the sight one of the girls shrieked piercingly horace and everyone sprang up the sense of helping numbers came to mr pollys aid  drop it he cried and came down the steps waving his poker and thrusting the spectacled gentleman before him as once heroes were wont to wield the oxhide shield  uncle jim gave ground suddenly and trod upon the foot of a young man in a blue shirt who immediately thrust at him violently with both hands  lea go howled uncle jim thats the chap im looking for and pressing the head of the spectacled gentleman aside smote hard at mr polly  but at the sight of this indignity inflicted upon the spectacled gentleman a womans heart was stirred and a pink parasol drove hard and true at uncle jims wiry neck and at the same moment the young man in the blue shirt sought to collar him and lost his grip again  suffragettes gasped uncle jim with the ferule at his throat everywhere and aimed a second more successful blow at mr polly  wup said mr polly  but now the jam and egg party was joining in the fray a stout yet still fairly ablebodied gentleman in white and black checks enquired whats the fellow up to aint there no police here and it was evident that once more public opinion was rallying to the support of mr polly  oh come on then all the lot of you cried uncle jim and backing dexterously whirled the eel round in a destructive circle the pink sunshade was torn from the hand that gripped it and whirled athwart the complete but unadorned tea things on the green table  collar him someone get hold of his collar cried the goldspectacled gentleman coming out of the scrimmage retreating up the steps to the inn door as if to rally his forces  stand clear you blessed mantel ornaments cried uncle jim stand clear and retired backing staving off attack by means of the whirling eel  mr polly undeterred by a sense of grave damage done to his nose pressed the attack in front the two young men in violet and blue skirmished on uncle jims flanks the man in white and black checks sought still further outflanking possibilities and two of the apprentice boys ran for oars the goldspectacled gentleman as if inspired came down the wooden steps again seized the tablecloth of the jam and egg party lugged it from under the crockery with inadequate precautions against breakage and advanced with compressed lips curious lateral crouching movements swift flashings of his glasses and a general suggestion of bullfighting in his pose and gestures uncle jim was kept busy and unable to plan his retreat with any strategic soundness he was moreover manifestly a little nervous about the river in his rear he gave ground in a curve and so came right across the rapidly abandoned camp of the family in mourning crunching a teacup under his heel oversetting the teapot and finally tripping backwards over the hamper the eel flew out at a tangent from his hand and became a mere looping relic on the sward  hold him cried the gentleman in spectacles collar him and moving forward with extraordinary promptitude wrapped the best tablecloth about uncle jims arms and head mr polly grasped his purpose instantly the man in checks was scarcely slower and in another moment uncle jim was no more than a bundle of smothered blasphemy and a pair of wildly active legs  duck him panted mr polly holding on to the earthquake bes thingduck him  the bundle was convulsed by paroxysms of anger and protest one boot got the hamper and sent it ten yards  go in the house for a clothes line someone said the gentleman in gold spectacles hell get out of this in a moment  one of the apprentices ran  bird nets in the garden shouted mr polly in the garden  the apprentice was divided in his purpose and then suddenly uncle jim collapsed and became a limp dead seeming thing under their hands his arms were drawn inward his legs bent up under his person and so he lay  fainted said the man in checks relaxing his grip  a fit perhaps said the man in spectacles  keep hold said mr polly too late  for suddenly uncle jims arms and legs flew out like springs released mr polly was tumbled backwards and fell over the broken teapot and into the arms of the father in mourning something struck his headdazzingly in another second uncle jim was on his feet and the tablecloth enshrouded the head of the man in checks uncle jim manifestly considered he had done all that honour required of him and against overwhelming numbers and the possibility of reiterated duckings flight is no disgrace  uncle jim fled  mr polly sat up after an interval of an indeterminate length among the ruins of an idyllic afternoon quite a lot of things seemed scattered and broken but it was difficult to grasp it all at once he stared between the legs of people he became aware of a voice speaking slowly and complainingly  someone ought to pay for those tea things said the father in mourning we didnt bring them ere to be danced on not by no manner of means   x  there followed an anxious peace for three days and then a rough man in a blue jersey in the intervals of trying to choke himself with bread and cheese and pickled onions broke out abruptly into information  jims lagged again missus he said  what said the landlady our jim  your jim said the man and after an absolutely necessary pause for swallowing added stealin a atchet  he did not speak for some moments and then he replied to mr pollys enquiries yes a atchet down lammam waynight before last  whatd e steal a atchet for asked the plump woman  e said e wanted a atchet  i wonder what he wanted a hatchet for said mr polly thoughtfully  i dessay e ad a use for it said the gentleman in the blue jersey and he took a mouthful that amounted to conversational suicide there was a prolonged pause in the little bar and mr polly did some rapid thinking  he went to the window and whistled i shall stick it he whispered at last atchets or no atchets  he turned to the man with the blue jersey when he thought him clear for speech again how much did you say theyd given him he asked  three munce said the man in the blue jersey and refilled anxiously as if alarmed at the momentary clearness of his voice   xi  those three months passed all too quickly months of sunshine and warmth of varied novel exertion in the open air of congenial experiences of interest and wholesome food and successful digestion months that browned mr polly and hardened him and saw the beginnings of his beard months marred only by one anxiety an anxiety mr polly did his utmost to suppress the day of reckoning was never mentioned it is true by either the plump woman or himself but the name of uncle jim was written in letters of glaring silence across their intercourse as the term of that respite drew to an end his anxiety increased until at last it even trenched upon his wellearned sleep he had some idea of buying a revolver at last he compromised upon a small and very foul and dirty rook rifle which he purchased in lammam under a pretext of bird scaring and loaded carefully and concealed under his bed from the plump womans eye  september passed away october came  and at last came that night in october whose happenings it is so difficult for a sympathetic historian to drag out of their proper nocturnal indistinctness into the clear hard light of positive statement a novelist should present characters not vivisect them publicly  the best the kindliest if not the justest course is surely to leave untold such things as mr polly would manifestly have preferred untold  mr polly had declared that when the cyclist discovered him he was seeking a weapon that should make a conclusive end to uncle jim that declaration is placed before the reader without comment  the gun was certainly in possession of uncle jim at that time and no human being but mr polly knows how he got hold of it  the cyclist was a literary man named warspite who suffered from insomnia he had risen and come out of his house near lammam just before the dawn and he discovered mr polly partially concealed in the ditch by the potwell churchyard wall it is an ordinary dry ditch full of nettles and overgrown with elder and dogrose and in no way suggestive of an arsenal it is the last place in which you would look for a gun and he says that when he dismounted to see why mr polly was allowing only the latter part of his person to show and that it would seem by inadvertency mr polly merely raised his head and advised him to look out and added hes let fly at me twice already he came out under persuasion and with gestures of extreme caution he was wearing a white cotton nightgown of the type that has now been so extensively superseded by pyjama sleeping suits and his legs and feet were bare and much scratched and torn and very muddy  mr warspite takes that exceptionally lively interest in his fellowcreatures which constitutes so much of the distinctive and complex charm of your novelist all the world over and he at once involved himself generously in the case the two men returned at mr pollys initiative across the churchyard to the potwell inn and came upon the burst and damaged rook rifle near the new monument to sir samuel harpon at the corner by the yew  that must have been his third go said mr polly it sounded a bit funny  the sight inspirited him greatly and he explained further that he had fled to the churchyard on account of the cover afforded by tombstones from the flight of small shot he expressed anxiety for the fate of the landlady of the potwell inn and her grandchild and led the way with enhanced alacrity along the lane to that establishment  they found the doors of the house standing open the bar in some disorderseveral bottles of whisky were afterwards found to be missingand blake the village policeman rapping patiently at the open door he entered with them the glass in the bar had suffered severely and one of the mirrors was starred from a blow from a pewter pot the till had been forced and ransacked and so had the bureau in the minute room behind the bar an upper window was opened and the voice of the landlady became audible making enquiries they went out and parleyed with her she had locked herself upstairs with the little girl she said and refused to descend until she was assured that neither uncle jim nor mr pollys gun were anywhere on the premises mr blake and mr warspite proceeded to satisfy themselves with regard to the former condition and mr polly went to his room in search of garments more suited to the brightening dawn he returned immediately with a request that mr blake and mr warspite would just come and look they found the apartment in a state of extraordinary confusion the bedclothes in a ball in the corner the drawers all open and ransacked the chair broken the lock of the door forced and broken one door panel slightly scorched and perforated by shot and the window wide open none of mr pollys clothes were to be seen but some garments which had apparently once formed part of a stokers workaday outfit two brownish yellow halves of a shirt and an unsound pair of boots were scattered on the floor a faint smell of gunpowder still hung in the air and two or three books mr polly had recently acquired had been shied with some violence under the bed mr warspite looked at mr blake and then both men looked at mr polly thats his boots said mr polly  blake turned his eye to the window some of these tiles ave just got broken he observed  i got out of the window and slid down the scullery tiles mr polly answered omitting much they both felt from his explanation  well we better find im and ave a word with im said blake thats about my business now   xii  but uncle jim had gone altogether  he did not return for some days that perhaps was not very wonderful but the days lengthened to weeks and the weeks to months and still uncle jim did not recur a year passed and the anxiety of him became less acute a second healing year followed the first one afternoon about thirty months after the night surprise the plump woman spoke of him  i wonder whats become of jim she said  i wonder sometimes said mr polly    chapter the tenth  miriam revisited   i  one summer afternoon about five years after his first coming to the potwell inn mr polly found himself sitting under the pollard willow fishing for dace it was a plumper browner and healthier mr polly altogether than the miserable bankrupt with whose dyspeptic portrait our novel opened he was fat but with a fatness more generally diffused and the lower part of his face was touched to gravity by a small square beard also he was balder  it was the first time he had found leisure to fish though from the very outset of his potwell career he had promised himself abundant indulgence in the pleasures of fishing fishing as the golden page of english literature testifies is a meditative and retrospective pursuit and the varied page of memory disregarded so long for sake of the teeming duties i have already enumerated began to unfold itself to mr pollys consideration a speculation about uncle jim died for want of material and gave place to a reckoning of the years and months that had passed since his coming to potwell and that to a philosophical review of his life he began to think about miriam remotely and impersonally he remembered many things that had been neglected by his conscience during the busier times as for example that he had committed arson and deserted a wife for the first time he looked these long neglected facts in the face  it is disagreeable to think one has committed arson because it is an action that leads to jail otherwise i do not think there was a grain of regret for that in mr pollys composition but deserting miriam was in a different category deserting miriam was mean  this is a history and not a glorification of mr polly and i tell of things as they were with him apart from the disagreeable twinge arising from the thought of what might happen if he was found out he had not the slightest remorse about that fire arson after all is an artificial crime some crimes are crimes in themselves would be crimes without any law the cruelties mockery the breaches of faith that astonish and wound but the burning of things is in itself neither good nor bad a large number of houses deserve to be burnt most modern furniture an overwhelming majority of pictures and booksone might go on for some time with the list if our community was collectively anything more than a feeble idiot it would burn most of london and chicago for example and build sane and beautiful cities in the place of these pestilential heaps of rotten private property i have failed in presenting mr polly altogether if i have not made you see that he was in many respects an artless child of nature far more untrained undisciplined and spontaneous than an ordinary savage and he was really glad for all that little drawback of fear that he had the courage to set fire to his house and fly and come to the potwell inn  but he was not glad he had left miriam he had seen miriam cry once or twice in his life and it had always reduced him to abject commiseration he now imagined her crying he perceived in a perplexed way that he had made himself responsible for her life he forgot how she had spoilt his own he had hitherto rested in the faith that she had over a hundred pounds of insurance money but now with his eye meditatively upon his float he realised a hundred pounds does not last for ever his conviction of her incompetence was unflinching she was bound to have fooled it away somehow by this time and then  he saw her humping her shoulders and sniffing in a manner he had always regarded as detestable at close quarters but which now became harrowingly pitiful  damn said mr polly and down went his float and he flicked up a victim to destruction and took it off the hook  he compared his own comfort and health with miriams imagined distress  ought to have done something for herself said mr polly rebaiting his hook she was always talking of doing things why couldnt she  he watched the float oscillating gently towards quiescence  silly to begin thinking about her he said damn silly  but once he had begun thinking about her he had to go on  oh blow cried mr polly presently and pulled up his hook to find another fish had just snatched at it in the last instant his handling must have made the poor thing feel itself unwelcome  he gathered his things together and turned towards the house  all the potwell inn betrayed his influence now for here indeed he had found his place in the world it looked brighter so bright indeed as to be almost skittish with the white and green paint he had lavished upon it even the garden palings were striped white and green and so were the boats for mr polly was one of those who find a positive sensuous pleasure in the laying on of paint left and right were two large boards which had done much to enhance the inns popularity with the lighterminded variety of pleasureseekers both marked innovations one bore in large letters the single word museum the other was as plain and laconic with omlets the spelling of the latter word was mr pollys own but when he had seen a whole boatload of men intent on lammam for lunch stop openmouthed and stare and grin and come in and ask in a marked sarcastic manner for omlets he perceived that his inaccuracy had done more for the place than his utmost cunning could have contrived in a year or so the inn was known both up and down the river by its new name of omlets and mr polly after some secret irritation smiled and was content and the fat womans omelettes were things to remember  you will note i have changed her epithet time works upon us all  she stood upon the steps as he came towards the house and smiled at him richly  caught many she asked  got an idea said mr polly would it put you out very much if i went off for a day or two for a bit of a holiday there wont be much doing now until thursday   ii  feeling recklessly secure behind his beard mr polly surveyed the fishbourne high street once again the north side was much as he had known it except that rusper had vanished a row of new shops replaced the destruction of the great fire mantell and throbsons had risen again upon a more flamboyant pattern and the new fire station was in the swissteutonic style and with much red paint next door in the place of rumbolds was a branch of the colonial tea company and then a salmon and gluckstein tobacco shop and then a little shop that displayed sweets and professed a tea room upstairs he considered this as a possible place in which to prosecute enquiries about his lost wife wavering a little between it and the gods providence inn down the street then his eye caught a name over the window polly he read  larkins well imastonished  a momentary faintness came upon him he walked past and down the street returned and surveyed the shop again  he saw a middleaged rather untidy woman standing behind the counter who for an instant he thought might be miriam terribly changed and then recognised as his sisterinlaw annie filled out and no longer hilarious she stared at him without a sign of recognition as he entered the shop  can i have tea said mr polly  well said annie you can but our tea rooms upstairs my sisters been cleaning it outand its a bit upset  it would be said mr polly softly  i beg your pardon said annie  i said i didnt mind up here  i daresay therell be a table said annie and followed him up to a room whose conscientious disorder was intensely reminiscent of miriam  nothing like turning everything upside down when youre cleaning said mr polly cheerfully  its my sisters way said annie impartially shes gone out for a bit of air but i daresay shell be back soon to finish its a nice light room when its tidy can i put you a table over there  let me said mr polly and assisted he sat down by the open window and drummed on the table and meditated on his next step while annie vanished to get his tea after all things didnt seem so bad with miriam he tried over several gambits in imagination  unusual name he said as annie laid a cloth before him annie looked interrogation  polly polly  larkins real i suppose  pollys my sisters name she married a mr polly  widow i presume said mr polly  yes this five yearscome october  lord said mr polly in unfeigned surprise  found drowned he was there was a lot of talk in the place  never heard of it said mr polly im a strangerrather  in the medway near maidstone he must have been in the water for days wouldnt have known him my sister wouldnt if it hadnt been for the name sewn in his clothes all whitey and eat away he was  bless my heart must have been rather a shock for her  it was a shock said annie and added darkly but sometimes a shocks better than a long agony  no doubt said mr polly  he gazed with a rapt expression at the preparations before him so im drowned something was saying inside him life insured he asked  we started the tea rooms with it said annie  why if things were like this had remorse and anxiety for miriam been implanted in his soul no shadow of an answer appeared  marriage is a lottery said mr polly  she found it so said annie would you like some jam  id like an egg said mr polly ill have two ive got a sort of feeling as though i wanted keeping up wasnt particularly good sort this mr polly  he was a wearing husband said annie ive often pitied my sister he was one of that sort  dissolute suggested mr polly faintly  no said annie judiciously not exactly dissolute feebles more the word weak e was weak as water ow long do you like your eggs boiled  four minutes exactly said mr polly  one gets talking said annie  one does said mrpolly and she left him to his thoughts  what perplexed him was his recent remorse and tenderness for miriam now he was back in her atmosphere all that had vanished and the old feeling of helpless antagonism returned he surveyed the piled furniture the economically managed carpet the unpleasing pictures on the wall why had he felt remorse why had he entertained this illusion of a helpless woman crying aloud in the pitiless darkness for him he peered into the unfathomable mysteries of the heart and ducked back to a smaller issue was he feeble  the eggs came up nothing in annies manner invited a resumption of the discussion  business brisk he ventured to ask  annie reflected it is she said and it isnt its like that  ah said mr polly and squared himself to his egg was there an inquest on that chap  what chap  what was his namepolly  of course  youre sure it was him  what you mean  annie looked at him hard and suddenly his soul was black with terror  who else could it have beenin the very cloes e wore  of course said mr polly and began his egg he was so agitated that he only realised its condition when he was half way through it and annie safely downstairs  lord he said reaching out hastily for the pepper one of miriams management i havent tasted such an egg for five years wonder where she gets them picks them out i suppose  he abandoned it for its fellow  except for a slight mustiness the second egg was very palatable indeed he was getting on to the bottom of it as miriam came in he looked up nice afternoon he said at her stare and perceived she knew him at once by the gesture and the voice she went white and shut the door behind her she looked as though she was going to faint mr polly sprang up quickly and handed her a chair my god she whispered and crumpled up rather than sat down  its you she said  no said mr polly very earnestly it isnt it just looks like me thats all  i knew that man wasnt youall along i tried to think it was i tried to think perhaps the water had altered your wrists and feet and the colour of your hair  ah  id always feared youd come back  mr polly sat down by his egg i havent come back he said very earnestly dont you think it  ow well pay back the insurance now i dont know she was weeping she produced a handkerchief and covered her face  look here miriam said mr polly i havent come back and im not coming back imim a visitant from another world you shut up about me and ill shut up about myself i came back because i thought you might be hard up or in trouble or some silly thing like that now i see you againim satisfied im satisfied completely see im going to absquatulate see hey presto right away  he turned to his tea for a moment finished his cup noisily stood up  dont you think youre going to see me again he said for you aint  he moved to the door  that was a tasty egg he said hovered for a second and vanished  annie was in the shop  the missus has had a bit of a shock he remarked got some sort of fancy about a ghost cant make it out quite so long  and he had gone   iii  mr polly sat beside the fat woman at one of the little green tables at the back of the potwell inn and struggled with the mystery of life it was one of those evenings serenely luminous amply and atmospherically still when the river bend was at its best a swan floated against the dark green masses of the further bank the stream flowed broad and shining to its destiny with scarce a rippleexcept where the reeds came out from the headlandthe three poplars rose clear and harmonious against a sky of green and yellow and it was as if it was all securely within a great warm friendly globe of crystal sky it was as safe and enclosed and fearless as a child that has still to be born it was an evening full of the quality of tranquil unqualified assurance mr pollys mind was filled with the persuasion that indeed all things whatsoever must needs be satisfying and complete it was incredible that life has ever done more than seemed to jar that there could be any shadow in life save such velvet softnesses as made the setting for that silent swan or any murmur but the ripple of the water as it swirled round the chained and gently swaying punt and the mind of mr polly exalted and made tender by this atmosphere sought gently but sought to draw together the varied memories that came drifting half submerged across the circle of his mind  he spoke in words that seemed like a bent and broken stick thrust suddenly into water destroying the mirror of the shapes they sought jims not coming back again ever he said he got drowned five years ago  where asked the fat woman surprised  miles from here in the medway away in kent  lor said the fat woman  its right enough said mr polly  how dyou know  i went to my home  where  dont matter i went and found out hed been in the water some days hed got my clothes and theyd said it was me  they  it dont matter im not going back to them  the fat woman regarded him silently for some time her expression of scrutiny gave way to a quiet satisfaction then her brown eyes went to the river  poor jim she said e adnt much tactever  she added mildly i cant ardly say im sorry  nor me said mr polly and got a step nearer the thought in him but it dont seem much good his having been alive does it  e wasnt much good the fat woman admitted ever  i suppose there were things that were good to him mr polly speculated they werent our things  his hold slipped again i often wonder about life he said weakly  he tried again one seems to start in life he said expecting something and it doesnt happen and it doesnt matter one starts with ideas that things are good and things are badand it hasnt much relation to what is good and what is bad ive always been the skeptaceous sort and its always seemed rot to me to pretend we know good from evil its just what ive never done no adams apple stuck in my throat maam i dont own to it  he reflected  i set fire to a houseonce  the fat woman started  i dont feel sorry for it i dont believe it was a bad thing to doany more than burning a toy like i did once when i was a baby i nearly killed myself with a razor who hasntanyhow gone as far as thinking of it most of my time ive been half dreaming i married like a dream almost ive never really planned my life or set out to live i happened things happened to me its so with everyone jim couldnt help himself i shot at him and tried to kill him i dropped the gun and he got it he very nearly had me i wasnt a second too soonducking awkwardthat night was mmm but i dont blame himcome to that only i dont see what its all up to  like children playing about in a nursery hurt themselves at times  theres something that doesnt mind us he resumed presently it isnt what we try to get that we get it isnt the good we think we do is good what makes us happy isnt our trying what makes others happy isnt our trying theres a sort of character people like and stand up for and a sort they wont you got to work it out and take the consequences miriam was always trying  who was miriam asked the fat woman  no one you know but she used to go about with her brows knit trying not to do whatever she wanted to doif ever she did want to do anything  he lost himself  you cant help being fat said the fat woman after a pause trying to get up to his thoughts  you cant said mr polly  it helps and it hinders  like my upside down way of talking  the magistrates wouldnt ave kept on the license to me if i adnt been fat  then what have we done said mr polly to get an evening like this lord look at it he sent his arm round the great curve of the sky  if i was a nigger or an italian i should come out here and sing i whistle sometimes but bless you its singing ive got in my mind sometimes i think i live for sunsets  i dont see that it does you any good always looking at sunsets like you do said the fat woman  nor me but i do sunsets and things i was made to like  they dont elp you said the fat woman thoughtfully  who cares said mr polly  a deeper strain had come to the fat woman you got to die some day she said  some things i cant believe said mr polly suddenly and one is your being a skeleton he pointed his hand towards the neighbours hedge look at emagainst the yellowand theyre just stingin nettles nasty weedsif you count things by their uses and no help in the life hereafter but just look at the look of them  it isnt only looks said the fat woman  whenever theres signs of a good sunset and im not too busy said mr polly ill come and sit out here  the fat woman looked at him with eyes in which contentment struggled with some obscure reluctant protest and at last turned them slowly to the black nettle pagodas against the golden sky  i wish we could she said  i will  the fat womans voice sank nearly to the inaudible  not always she said  mr polly was some time before he replied come here always when im a ghost he replied  spoil the place for others said the fat woman abandoning her moral solicitudes for a more congenial point of view  not my sort of ghost wouldnt said mr polly emerging from another long pause id be a sort of diaphalous feelingjust mellowish and warmish like  they said no more but sat on in the warm twilight until at last they could scarcely distinguish each others faces they were not so much thinking as lost in a smooth still quiet of the mind a bat flitted by  time we was going in o party said mr polly standing up supper to get its as you say we cant sit here for ever  the end
