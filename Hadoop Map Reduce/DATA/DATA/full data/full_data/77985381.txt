mythology  may 5 1840  we have undertaken to discourse here for a little on great men their manner of appearance in our worlds business how they have shaped themselves in the worlds history what ideas men formed of them what work they didon heroes namely and on their reception and performance what i call heroworship and the heroic in human affairs too evidently this is a large topic deserving quite other treatment than we can expect to give it at present a large topic indeed an illimitable one wide as universal history itself for as i take it universal history the history of what man has accomplished in this world is at bottom the history of the great men who have worked here they were the leaders of men these great ones the modellers patterns and in a wide sense creators of whatsoever the general mass of men contrived to do or to attain all things that we see standing accomplished in the world are properly the outer material result the practical realization and embodiment of thoughts that dwelt in the great men sent into the world the soul of the whole worlds history it may justly be considered were the history of these too clearly it is a topic we shall do no justice to in this place  one comfort is that great men taken up in any way are profitable company we cannot look however imperfectly upon a great man without gaining something by him he is the living lightfountain which it is good and pleasant to be near the light which enlightens which has enlightened the darkness of the world and this not as a kindled lamp only but rather as a natural luminary shining by the gift of heaven a flowing lightfountain as i say of native original insight of manhood and heroic noblenessin whose radiance all souls feel that it is well with them on any terms whatsoever you will not grudge to wander in such neighborhood for a while these six classes of heroes chosen out of widely distant countries and epochs and in mere external figure differing altogether ought if we look faithfully at them to illustrate several things for us could we see them well we should get some glimpses into the very marrow of the worlds history how happy could i but in any measure in such times as these make manifest to you the meanings of heroism the divine relation for i may well call it such which in all times unites a great man to other men and thus as it were not exhaust my subject but so much as break ground on it at all events i must make the attempt   it is well said in every sense that a mans religion is the chief fact with regard to him a mans or a nation of mens by religion i do not mean here the churchcreed which he professes the articles of faith which he will sign and in words or otherwise assert not this wholly in many cases not this at all we see men of all kinds of professed creeds attain to almost all degrees of worth or worthlessness under each or any of them this is not what i call religion this profession and assertion which is often only a profession and assertion from the outworks of the man from the mere argumentative region of him if even so deep as that but the thing a man does practically believe and this is often enough without asserting it even to himself much less to others the thing a man does practically lay to heart and know for certain concerning his vital relations to this mysterious universe and his duty and destiny there that is in all cases the primary thing for him and creatively determines all the rest that is his religion or it may be his mere scepticism and noreligion the manner it is in which he feels himself to be spiritually related to the unseen world or noworld and i say if you tell me what that is you tell me to a very great extent what the man is what the kind of things he will do is of a man or of a nation we inquire therefore first of all what religion they had was it heathenismplurality of gods mere sensuous representation of this mystery of life and for chief recognized element therein physical force was it christianism faith in an invisible not as real only but as the only reality time through every meanest moment of it resting on eternity pagan empire of force displaced by a nobler supremacy that of holiness was it scepticism uncertainty and inquiry whether there was an unseen world any mystery of life except a mad onedoubt as to all this or perhaps unbelief and flat denial answering of this question is giving us the soul of the history of the man or nation the thoughts they had were the parents of the actions they did their feelings were parents of their thoughts it was the unseen and spiritual in them that determined the outward and actualtheir religion as i say was the great fact about them in these discourses limited as we are it will be good to direct our survey chiefly to that religious phasis of the matter that once known well all is known we have chosen as the first hero in our series odin the central figure of scandinavian paganism an emblem to us of a most extensive province of things let us look for a little at the hero as divinity the oldest primary form of heroism  surely it seems a very strangelooking thing this paganism almost inconceivable to us in these days a bewildering inextricable jungle of delusions confusions falsehoods and absurdities covering the whole field of life a thing that fills us with astonishment almost if it were possible with incredulityfor truly it is not easy to understand that sane men could ever calmly with their eyes open believe and live by such a set of doctrines that men should have worshipped their poor fellowman as a god and not him only but stocks and stones and all manner of animate and inanimate objects and fashioned for themselves such a distracted chaos of hallucinations by way of theory of the universe all this looks like an incredible fable nevertheless it is a clear fact that they did it such hideous inextricable jungle of misworships misbeliefs men made as we are did actually hold by and live at home in this is strange yes we may pause in sorrow and silence over the depths of darkness that are in man if we rejoice in the heights of purer vision he has attained to such things were and are in man in all men in us too  some speculators have a short way of accounting for the pagan religion mere quackery priestcraft and dupery say they no sane man ever did believe itmerely contrived to persuade other men not worthy of the name of sane to believe it it will be often our duty to protest against this sort of hypothesis about mens doings and history and i here on the very threshold protest against it in reference to paganism and to all other isms by which man has ever for a length of time striven to walk in this world they have all had a truth in them or men would not have taken them up quackery and dupery do abound in religions above all in the more advanced decaying stages of religions they have fearfully abounded but quackery was never the originating influence in such things it was not the health and life of such things but their disease the sure precursor of their being about to die let us never forget this it seems to me a most mournful hypothesis that of quackery giving birth to any faith even in savage men quackery gives birth to nothing gives death to all things we shall not see into the true heart of anything if we look merely at the quackeries of it if we do not reject the quackeries altogether as mere diseases corruptions with which our and all mens sole duty is to have done with them to sweep them out of our thoughts as out of our practice man everywhere is the born enemy of lies i find grand lamaism itself to have a kind of truth in it read the candid clearsighted rather sceptical mr turners account of his embassy to that country and see they have their belief these poor thibet people that providence sends down always an incarnation of himself into every generation at bottom some belief in a kind of pope at bottom still better belief that there is a greatest man that he is discoverable that once discovered we ought to treat him with an obedience which knows no bounds this is the truth of grand lamaism the discoverability is the only error here the thibet priests have methods of their own of discovering what man is greatest fit to be supreme over them bad methods but are they so much worse than our methodsof understanding him to be always the eldestborn of a certain genealogy alas it is a difficult thing to find good methods forwe shall begin to have a chance of understanding paganism when we first admit that to its followers it was at one time earnestly true let us consider it very certain that men did believe in paganism men with open eyes sound senses men made altogether like ourselves that we had we been there should have believed in it ask now what paganism could have been  another theory somewhat more respectable attributes such things to allegory it was a play of poetic minds say these theorists a shadowing forth in allegorical fable in personification and visual form of what such poetic minds had known and felt of this universe which agrees add they with a primary law of human nature still everywhere observably at work though in less important things that what a man feels intensely he struggles to speak out of him to see represented before him in visual shape and as if with a kind of life and historical reality in it now doubtless there is such a law and it is one of the deepest in human nature neither need we doubt that it did operate fundamentally in this business the hypothesis which ascribes paganism wholly or mostly to this agency i call a little more respectable but i cannot yet call it the true hypothesis think would we believe and take with us as our lifeguidance an allegory a poetic sport not sport but earnest is what we should require it is a most earnest thing to be alive in this world to die is not sport for a man mans life never was a sport to him it was a stern reality altogether a serious matter to be alive  i find therefore that though these allegory theorists are on the way towards truth in this matter they have not reached it either pagan religion is indeed an allegory a symbol of what men felt and knew about the universe and all religions are symbols of that altering always as that alters but it seems to me a radical perversion and even inversion of the business to put that forward as the origin and moving cause when it was rather the result and termination to get beautiful allegories a perfect poetic symbol was not the want of men but to know what they were to believe about this universe what course they were to steer in it what in this mysterious life of theirs they had to hope and to fear to do and to forbear doing the pilgrims progress is an allegory and a beautiful just and serious one but consider whether bunyans allegory could have preceded the faith it symbolizes the faith had to be already there standing believed by everybodyof which the allegory could then become a shadow and with all its seriousness we may say a sportful shadow a mere play of the fancy in comparison with that awful fact and scientific certainty which it poetically strives to emblem the allegory is the product of the certainty not the producer of it not in bunyans nor in any other case for paganism therefore we have still to inquire whence came that scientific certainty the parent of such a bewildered heap of allegories errors and confusions how was it what was it  surely it were a foolish attempt to pretend explaining in this place or in any place such a phenomenon as that fardistant distracted cloudy imbroglio of paganismmore like a cloudfield than a distant continent of firm land and facts it is no longer a reality yet it was one we ought to understand that this seeming cloudfield was once a reality that not poetic allegory least of all that dupery and deception was the origin of it men i say never did believe idle songs never risked their souls life on allegories men in all times especially in early earnest times have had an instinct for detecting quacks for detesting quacks let us try if leaving out both the quack theory and the allegory one and listening with affectionate attention to that faroff confused rumor of the pagan ages we cannot ascertain so much as this at least that there was a kind of fact at the heart of them that they too were not mendacious and distracted but in their own poor way true and sane   you remember that fancy of platos of a man who had grown to maturity in some dark distance and was brought on a sudden into the upper air to see the sun rise what would his wonder be his rapt astonishment at the sight we daily witness with indifference with the free open sense of a child yet with the ripe faculty of a man his whole heart would be kindled by that sight he would discern it well to be godlike his soul would fall down in worship before it now just such a childlike greatness was in the primitive nations the first pagan thinker among rude men the first man that began to think was precisely this childman of platos simple open as a child yet with the depth and strength of a man nature had as yet no name to him he had not yet united under a name the infinite variety of sights sounds shapes and motions which we now collectively name universe nature or the likeand so with a name dismiss it from us to the wild deephearted man all was yet new not veiled under names or formulas it stood naked flashing in on him there beautiful awful unspeakable nature was to this man what to the thinker and prophet it forever is preternatural this green flowery rockbuilt earth the trees the mountains rivers manysounding seasthat great deep sea of azure that swims overhead the winds sweeping through it the black cloud fashioning itself together now pouring out fire now hail and rain what is it ay what at bottom we do not yet know we can never know at all it is not by our superior insight that we escape the difficulty it is by our superior levity our inattention our want of insight it is by not thinking that we cease to wonder at it hardened round us encasing wholly every notion we form is a wrappage of traditions hearsays mere words we call that fire of the black thundercloud electricity and lecture learnedly about it and grind the like of it out of glass and silk but what is it what made it whence comes it whither goes it science has done much for us but it is a poor science that would hide from us the great deep sacred infinitude of nescience whither we can never penetrate on which all science swims as a mere superficial film this world after all our science and sciences is still a miracle wonderful inscrutable magical and more to whosoever will think of it  that great mystery of time were there no other the illimitable silent neverresting thing called time rolling rushing on swift silent like an allembracing oceantide on which we and all the universe swim like exhalations like apparitions which are and then are not this is forever very literally a miracle a thing to strike us dumbfor we have no word to speak about it this universe ah mewhat could the wild man know of it what can we yet know that it is a force and thousandfold complexity of forces a force which is not we that is all it is not we it is altogether different from us force force everywhere force we ourselves a mysterious force in the centre of that there is not a leaf rotting on the highway but has force in it how else could it rot nay surely to the atheistic thinker if such a one were possible it must be a miracle too this huge illimitable whirlwind of force which envelops us here neverresting whirlwind high as immensity old as eternity what is it gods creation the religious people answer it is the almighty gods atheistic science babbles poorly of it with scientific nomenclatures experiments and what not as if it were a poor dead thing to be bottled up in leyden jars and sold over counters but the natural sense of man in all times if he will honestly apply his sense proclaims it to be a living thingah an unspeakable godlike thing towards which the best attitude for us after never so much science is awe devout prostration and humility of soul worship if not in words then in silence  but now i remark farther what in such a time as ours it requires a prophet or poet to teach us namely the strippingoff of those poor undevout wrappages nomenclatures and scientific hearsaysthis the ancient earnest soul as yet unencumbered with these things did for itself the world which is now divine only to the gifted was then divine to whosoever would turn his eye upon it he stood bare before it face to face all was godlike or godjean paul still finds it so the giant jean paul who has power to escape out of hearsays but there then were no hearsays canopus shining down over the desert with its blue diamond brightness that wild blue spiritlike brightness far brighter than we ever witness here would pierce into the heart of the wild ishmaelitish man whom it was guiding through the solitary waste there to his wild heart with all feelings in it with no speech for any feeling it might seem a little eye that canopus glancing out on him from the great deep eternity revealing the inner splendor to him cannot we understand how these men worshipped canopus became what we call sabeans worshipping the stars such is to me the secret of all forms of paganism worship is transcendent wonder wonder for which there is now no limit or measure that is worship to these primeval men all things and everything they saw exist beside them were an emblem of the godlike of some god  and look what perennial fibre of truth was in that to us also through every star through every blade of grass is not a god made visible if we will open our minds and eyes we do not worship in that way now but is it not reckoned still a merit proof of what we call a poetic nature that we recognize how every object has a divine beauty in it how every object still verily is a window through which we may look into infinitude itself he that can discern the loveliness of things we call him poet painter man of genius gifted lovable these poor sabeans did even what he doesin their own fashion that they did it in what fashion soever was a merit better than what the entirely stupid man did what the horse and camel didnamely nothing  but now if all things whatsoever that we look upon are emblems to us of the highest god i add that more so than any of them is man such an emblem you have heard of st chrysostoms celebrated saying in reference to the shekinah or ark of testimony visible revelation of god among the hebrews the true shekinah is man yes it is even so this is no vain phrase it is veritably so the essence of our being the mystery in us that calls itself iah what words have we for such thingsis a breath of heaven the highest being reveals himself in man this body these faculties this life of ours is it not all as a vesture for that unnamed there is but one temple in the universe says the devout novalis and that is the body of man nothing is holier shall that high form bending before men is a reverence done to this revelation in the flesh we touch heaven when we lay our hand on a human body this sounds much like a mere flourish of rhetoric but it is not so if well meditated it will turn out to be a scientific fact the expression in such words as can be had of the actual truth of the thing we are the miracle of miraclesthe great inscrutable mystery of god we cannot understand it we know not how to speak of it but we may feel and know if we like that it is verily so  well these truths were once more readily felt than now the young generations of the world who had in them the freshness of young children and yet the depth of earnest men who did not think that they had finished off all things in heaven and earth by merely giving them scientific names but had to gaze direct at them there with awe and wonder they felt better what of divinity is in man and nature they without being mad could worship nature and man more than anything else in nature worship that is as i said above admire without limit this in the full use of their faculties with all sincerity of heart they could do i consider heroworship to be the grand modifying element in that ancient system of thought what i called the perplexed jungle of paganism sprang we may say out of many roots every admiration adoration of a star or natural object was a root or fibre of a root but heroworship is the deepest root of all the taproot from which in a great degree all the rest were nourished and grown  and now if worship even of a star had some meaning in it how much more might that of a hero worship of a hero is transcendent admiration of a great man i say great men are still admirable i say there is at bottom nothing else admirable no nobler feeling than this of admiration for one higher than himself dwells in the breast of man it is to this hour and at all hours the vivifying influence in mans life religion i find stand upon it not paganism only but far higher and truer religionsall religion hitherto known heroworship heartfelt prostrate admiration submission burning boundless for a noblest godlike form of manis not that the germ of christianity itself the greatest of all heroes is onewhom we do not name here let sacred silence meditate that sacred matter you will find it the ultimate perfection of a principle extant throughout mans whole history on earth  or coming into lower less unspeakable provinces is not all loyalty akin to religious faith also faith is loyalty to some inspired teacher some spiritual hero and what therefore is loyalty proper the lifebreath of all society but an effluence of heroworship submissive admiration for the truly great society is founded on heroworship all dignities of rank on which human association rests are what we may call a heroarchy government of heroesor a hierarchy for it is sacred enough withal the duke means dux leader king is konning kanning man that knows or cans society everywhere is some representation not insupportably inaccurate of a graduated worship of heroesreverence and obedience done to men really great and wise not insupportably inaccurate i say they are all as banknotes these social dignitaries all representing goldand several of them alas always are forged notes we can do with some forged false notes with a good many even but not with all or the most of them forged no there have to come revolutions then cries of democracy liberty and equality and i know not whatthe notes being all false and no gold to be had for them people take to crying in their despair that there is no gold that there never was any gold heroworship is nevertheless as it was always and everywhere and cannot cease till man himself ceases  i am well aware that in these days heroworship the thing i call heroworship professes to have gone out and finally ceased this for reasons which it will be worth while some time to inquire into is an age that as it were denies the existence of great men denies the desirableness of great men show our critics a great man a luther for example they begin to what they call account for him not to worship him but take the dimensions of himand bring him out to be a little kind of man he was the creature of the time they say the time called him forth the time did everything he nothingbut what we the little critic could have done too this seems to me but melancholy work the time call forth alas we have known times call loudly enough for their great man but not find him when they called he was not there providence had not sent him the time calling its loudest had to go down to confusion and wreck because he would not come when called  for if we will think of it no time need have gone to ruin could it have found a man great enough a man wise and good enough wisdom to discern truly what the time wanted valor to lead it on the right road thither these are the salvation of any time but i liken common languid times with their unbelief distress perplexity with their languid doubting characters and embarrassed circumstances impotently crumbling down into ever worse distress towards final ruinall this i liken to dry dead fuel waiting for the lightning out of heaven that shall kindle it the great man with his free force direct out of gods own hand is the lightning his word is the wise healing word which all can believe in all blazes round him now when he has once struck on it into fire like his own the dry mouldering sticks are thought to have called him forth they did want him greatly but as to calling him forth those are critics of small vision i think who cry see is it not the sticks that made the fire no sadder proof can be given by a man of his own littleness than disbelief in great men there is no sadder symptom of a generation than such general blindness to the spiritual lightning with faith only in the heap of barren dead fuel it is the last consummation of unbelief in all epochs of the worlds history we shall find the great man to have been the indispensable savior of his epochthe lightning without which the fuel never would have burnt the history of the world i said already was the biography of great men  such small critics do what they can to promote unbelief and universal spiritual paralysis but happily they cannot always completely succeed in all times it is possible for a man to arise great enough to feel that they and their doctrines are chimeras and cobwebs and what is notable in no time whatever can they entirely eradicate out of living mens hearts a certain altogether peculiar reverence for great men genuine admiration loyalty adoration however dim and perverted it may be heroworship endures forever while man endures boswell venerates his johnson right truly even in the eighteenth century the unbelieving french believe in their voltaire and burst out round him into very curious heroworship in that last act of his life when they stifle him under roses it has always seemed to me extremely curious this of voltaire truly if christianity be the highest instance of heroworship then we may find here in voltaireism one of the lowest he whose life was that of a kind of antichrist does again on this side exhibit a curious contrast no people ever were so little prone to admire at all as those french of voltaire persiflage was the character of their whole mind adoration had nowhere a place in it yet see the old man of ferney comes up to paris an old tottering infirm man of eightyfour years they feel that he too is a kind of hero that he has spent his life in opposing error and injustice delivering calases unmasking hypocrites in high placesin short that he too though in a strange way has fought like a valiant man they feel withal that if persiflage be the great thing there never was such a persifleur he is the realized ideal of every one of them the thing they are all wanting to be of all frenchmen the most french he is properly their godsuch god as they are fit for accordingly all persons from the queen antoinette to the douanier at the porte st denis do they not worship him people of quality disguise themselves as tavernwaiters the maitre de poste with a broad oath orders his postilion va bon train thou art driving m de voltaire at paris his carriage is the nucleus of a comet whose train fills whole streets the ladies pluck a hair or two from his fur to keep it as a sacred relic there was nothing highest beautifulest noblest in all france that did not feel this man to be higher beautifuler nobler  yes from norse odin to english samuel johnson from the divine founder of christianity to the withered pontiff of encyclopedism in all times and places the hero has been worshipped it will ever be so we all love great men love venerate and bow down submissive before great men nay can we honestly bow down to anything else ah does not every true man feel that he is himself made higher by doing reverence to what is really above him no nobler or more blessed feeling dwells in mans heart and to me it is very cheering to consider that no sceptical logic or general triviality insincerity and aridity of any time and its influences can destroy this noble inborn loyalty and worship that is in man in times of unbelief which soon have to become times of revolution much downrushing sorrowful decay and ruin is visible to everybody for myself in these days i seem to see in this indestructibility of heroworship the everlasting adamant lower than which the confused wreck of revolutionary things cannot fall the confused wreck of things crumbling and even crashing and tumbling all round us in these revolutionary ages will get down so far no farther it is an eternal cornerstone from which they can begin to build themselves up again that man in some sense or other worships heroes that we all of us reverence and must ever reverence great men this is to me the living rock amid all rushingsdown whatsoeverthe one fixed point in modern revolutionary history otherwise as if bottomless and shoreless   so much of truth only under an ancient obsolete vesture but the spirit of it still true do i find in the paganism of old nations nature is still divine the revelation of the workings of god the hero is still worshipable this under poor cramped incipient forms is what all pagan religions have struggled as they could to set forth i think scandinavian paganism to us here is more interesting than any other it is for one thing the latest it continued in these regions of europe till the eleventh century eight hundred years ago the norwegians were still worshippers of odin it is interesting also as the creed of our fathers the men whose blood still runs in our veins whom doubtless we still resemble in so many ways strange they did believe that while we believe so differently let us look a little at this poor norse creed for many reasons we have tolerable means to do it for there is another point of interest in these scandinavian mythologies that they have been preserved so well  in that strange island icelandburst up the geologists say by fire from the bottom of the sea a wild land of barrenness and lava swallowed many months of every year in black tempests yet with a wild gleaming beauty in summertime towering up there stern and grim in the north ocean with its snow jokuls roaring geysers sulphurpools and horrid volcanic chasms like the waste chaotic battlefield of frost and firewhere of all places we least looked for literature or written memorials the record of these things was written down on the seabord of this wild land is a rim of grassy country where cattle can subsist and men by means of them and of what the sea yields and it seems they were poetic men these men who had deep thoughts in them and uttered musically their thoughts much would be lost had iceland not been burst up from the sea not been discovered by the northmen the old norse poets were many of them natives of iceland  saemund one of the early christian priests there who perhaps had a lingering fondness for paganism collected certain of their old pagan songs just about becoming obsolete thenpoems or chants of a mythic prophetic mostly all of a religious character that is what norse critics call the elder or poetic edda edda a word of uncertain etymology is thought to signify ancestress snorro sturleson an iceland gentleman an extremely notable personage educated by this saemunds grandson took in hand next near a century afterwards to put together among several other books he wrote a kind of prose synopsis of the whole mythology elucidated by new fragments of traditionary verse a work constructed really with great ingenuity native talent what one might call unconscious art altogether a perspicuous clear work pleasant reading still this is the younger or prose edda by these and the numerous other sagas mostly icelandic with the commentaries icelandic or not which go on zealously in the north to this day it is possible to gain some direct insight even yet and see that old norse system of belief as it were face to face let us forget that it is erroneous religion let us look at it as old thought and try if we cannot sympathize with it somewhat  the primary characteristic of this old northland mythology i find to be impersonation of the visible workings of nature earnest simple recognition of the workings of physical nature as a thing wholly miraculous stupendous and divine what we now lecture of as science they wondered at and fell down in awe before as religion the dark hostile powers of nature they figure to themselves as jotuns giants huge shaggy beings of a demonic character frost fire seatempest these are jotuns the friendly powers again as summerheat the sun are gods the empire of this universe is divided between these two they dwell apart in perennial internecine feud the gods dwell above in asgard the garden of the asen or divinities jotunheim a distant dark chaotic land is the home of the jotuns  curious all this and not idle or inane if we will look at the foundation of it the power of fire or flame for instance which we designate by some trivial chemical name thereby hiding from ourselves the essential character of wonder that dwells in it as in all things is with these old northmen loke a most swift subtle demon of the brood of the jotuns the savages of the ladrones islands too say some spanish voyagers thought fire which they never had seen before was a devil or god that bit you sharply when you touched it and that lived upon dry wood from us too no chemistry if it had not stupidity to help it would hide that flame is a wonder what is flamefrost the old norse seer discerns to be a monstrous hoary jotun the giant thrym hrym or rime the old word now nearly obsolete here but still used in scotland to signify hoarfrost rime was not then as now a dead chemical thing but a living jotun or devil the monstrous jotun rime drove home his horses at night sat combing their maneswhich horses were hailclouds or fleet frostwinds his cowsno not his but a kinsmans the giant hymirs cows are icebergs this hymir looks at the rocks with his devileye and they split in the glance of it  thunder was not then mere electricity vitreous or resinous it was the god donner thunder or thorgod also of beneficent summerheat the thunder was his wrath the gathering of the black clouds is the drawing down of thors angry brows the firebolt bursting out of heaven is the allrending hammer flung from the hand of thor he urges his loud chariot over the mountaintopsthat is the peal wrathful he blows in his red beardthat is the rustling stormblast before the thunder begins balder again the white god the beautiful the just and benignant whom the early christian missionaries found to resemble christ is the sun beautifullest of visible things wondrous too and divine still after all our astronomies and almanacs but perhaps the notablest god we hear tell of is one of whom grimm the german etymologist finds trace the god wunsch or wish the god wish who could give us all that we wished is not this the sincerest and yet rudest voice of the spirit of man the rudest ideal that man ever formed which still shows itself in the latest forms of our spiritual culture higher considerations have to teach us that the god wish is not the true god  of the other gods or jotuns i will mention only for etymologys sake that seatempest is the jotun aegir a very dangerous jotunand now to this day on our river trent as i learn the nottingham bargemen when the river is in a certain flooded state a kind of backwater or eddying swirl it has very dangerous to them call it eager they cry out have a care there is the eager coming curious that word surviving like the peak of a submerged world the oldest nottingham bargemen had believed in the god aegir indeed our english blood too in good part is danish norse or rather at bottom danish and norse and saxon have no distinction except a superficial oneas of heathen and christian or the like but all over our island we are mingled largely with danes properfrom the incessant invasions there were and this of course in a greater proportion along the east coast and greatest of all as i find in the north country from the humber upwards all over scotland the speech of the common people is still in a singular degree icelandic its germanism has still a peculiar norse tinge they too are normans northmenif that be any great beauty  of the chief god odin we shall speak by and by mark at present so much what the essence of scandinavian and indeed of all paganism is a recognition of the forces of nature as godlike stupendous personal agenciesas gods and demons not inconceivable to us it is the infant thought of man opening itself with awe and wonder on this everstupendous universe to me there is in the norse system something very genuine very great and manlike a broad simplicity rusticity so very different from the light gracefulness of the old greek paganism distinguishes this scandinavian system it is thought the genuine thought of deep rude earnest minds fairly opened to the things about them a facetoface and hearttoheart inspection of the thingsthe first characteristic of all good thought in all times not graceful lightness halfsport as in the greek paganism a certain homely truthfulness and rustic strength a great rude sincerity discloses itself here it is strange after our beautiful apollo statues and clear smiling mythuses to come down upon the norse gods brewing ale

began to speaki find no similitude so true as this of a tree beautiful altogether beautiful and great the machine of the universealas do but think of that in contrast   well it is strange enough this old norse view of nature different enough from what we believe of nature whence it specially came one would not like to be compelled to say very minutely one thing we may say it came from the thoughts of norse menfrom the thought above all of the first norse man who had an original power of thinking the first norse man of genius as we should call him innumerable men had passed by across this universe with a dumb vague wonder such as the very animals may feel or with a painful fruitlessly inquiring wonder such as men only feeltill the great thinker came the original man the seer whose shaped spoken thought awakes the slumbering capability of all into thought it is ever the way with the thinker the spiritual hero what he says all men were not far from saying were longing to say the thoughts of all start up as from painful enchanted sleep round his thought answering to it yes even so joyful to men as the dawning of day from nightis it not indeed the awakening for them from nobeing into being from death into life we still honor such a man call him poet genius and so forth but to these wild men he was a very magician a worker of miraculous unexpected blessing for them a prophet a godthought once awakened does not again slumber unfolds itself into a system of thought grows in man after man generation after generationtill its full stature is reached and such system of thought can grow no farther but must give place to another  for the norse people the man now named odin and chief norse god we fancy was such a man a teacher and captain of soul and of body a hero of worth immeasurable admiration for whom transcending the known bounds became adoration has he not the power of articulate thinking and many other powers as yet miraculous so with boundless gratitude would the rude norse heart feel has he not solved for them the sphinxenigma of this universe given assurance to them of their own destiny there by him they know now what they have to do here what to look for hereafter existence has become articulate melodious by him he first has made life alivewe may call this odin the origin of norse mythology odin or whatever name the first norse thinker bore while he was a man among men his view of the universe once promulgated a like view starts into being in all minds grows keeps ever growing while it continues credible there in all minds it lay written but invisibly as in sympathetic ink at his word it starts into visibility in all nay in every epoch of the world the great event parent of all others is it not the arrival of a thinker in the world  one other thing we must not forget it will explain a little the confusion of these norse eddas they are not one coherent system of thought but properly the summation of several successive systems all this of the old norse belief which is flung out for us in one level of distance in the edda like a picture painted on the same canvas does not at all stand so in the reality it stands rather at all manner of distances and depths of successive generations since the belief first began all scandinavian thinkers since the first of them contributed to that scandinavian system of thought in evernew elaboration and addition it is the combined work of them all what history it had how it changed from shape to shape by one thinkers contribution after another till it got to the full final shape we see it under in the edda no man will now ever know its councils of trebizond councils of trent athanasiuses dantes luthers are sunk without echo in the dark night only that it had such a history we can all know wheresover a thinker appeared there in the thing he thought of was a contribution accession a change or revolution made alas the grandest revolution of all the one made by the man odin himself is not this too sunk for us like the rest of odin what history strange rather to reflect that he had a history that this odin in his wild norse vesture with his wild beard and eyes his rude norse speech and ways was a man like us with our sorrows joys with our limbs featuresintrinsically all one as we and did such a work but the work much of it has perished the worker all to the name wednesday men will say tomorrow odins day of odin there exists no history no document of it no guess about it worth repeating  snorro indeed in the quietest manner almost in a brief business style writes down in his heimskringla how odin was a heroic prince in the blacksea region with twelve peers and a great people straitened for room how he led these asen asiatics of his out of asia settled them in the north parts of europe by warlike conquest invented letters poetry and so forthand came by and by to be worshipped as chief god by these scandinavians his twelve peers made into twelve sons of his own gods like himself snorro has no doubt of this saxo grammaticus a very curious northman of that same century is still more unhesitating scruples not to find out a historical fact in every individual mythus and writes it down as a terrestrial event in denmark or elsewhere torfaeus learned and cautious some centuries later assigns by calculation a date for it odin he says came into europe about the year 70 before christ of all which as grounded on mere uncertainties found to be untenable now i need say nothing far very far beyond the year 70 odins date adventures whole terrestrial history figure and environment are sunk from us forever into unknown thousands of years  nay grimm the german antiquary goes so far as to deny that any man odin ever existed he proves it by etymology the word wuotan which is the original form of odin a word spread as name of their chief divinity over all the teutonic nations everywhere this word which connects itself according to grimm with the latin vadere with the english wade and such likemeans primarily movement source of movement power and is the fit name of the highest god not of any man the word signifies divinity he says among the old saxon german and all teutonic nations the adjectives formed from it all signify divine supreme or something pertaining to the chief god like enough we must bow to grimm in matters etymological let us consider it fixed that wuotan means wading force of movement and now still what hinders it from being the name of a heroic man and mover as well as of a god as for the adjectives and words formed from itdid not the spaniards in their universal admiration for lope get into the habit of saying a lope flower a lope dama if the flower or woman were of surpassing beauty had this lasted lope would have grown in spain to be an adjective signifying godlike also indeed adam smith in his essay on language surmises that all adjectives whatsoever were formed precisely in that way some very green thing chiefly notable for its greenness got the appellative name green and then the next thing remarkable for that quality a tree for instance was named the green treeas we still say the steam coach fourhorse coach or the like all primary adjectives according to smith were formed in this way were at first substantives and things we cannot annihilate a man for etymologies like that surely there was a first teacher and captain surely there must have been an odin palpable to the sense at one time no adjective but a real hero of flesh and blood the voice of all tradition history or echo of history agrees with all that thought will teach one about it to assure us of this  how the man odin came to be considered a god the chief godthat surely is a question which nobody would wish to dogmatize upon i have said his people knew no limits to their admiration of him they had as yet no scale to measure admiration by fancy your own generous heartslove of some greatest man expanding till it transcended all bounds till it filled and overflowed the whole field of your thought or what if this man odinsince a great deep soul with the afflatus and mysterious tide of vision and impulse rushing on him he knows not whence is ever an enigma a kind of terror and wonder to himselfshould have felt that perhaps he was divine that he was some effluence of the wuotan movement supreme power and divinity of whom to his rapt vision all nature was the awful flameimage that some effluence of wuotan dwelt here in him he was not necessarily false he was but mistaken speaking the truest he knew a great soul any sincere soul knows not what he isalternates between the highest height and the lowest depth can of all things the least measurehimself what others take him for and what he guesses that he may be these two items strangely act on one another help to determine one another with all men reverently admiring him with his own wild soul full of noble ardors and affections of whirlwind chaotic darkness and glorious new light a divine universe bursting all into godlike beauty round him and no man to whom the like ever had befallen what could he think himself to be wuotan all men answered wuotan  and then consider what mere time will do in such cases how if a man was great while living he becomes tenfold greater when dead what an enormous cameraobscura magnifier is tradition how a thing grows in the human memory in the human imagination when love worship and all that lies in the human heart is there to encourage it and in the darkness in the entire ignorance without date or document no book no arundelmarble only here and there some dumb monumental cairn why in thirty or forty years were there no books any great man would grow mythic the contemporaries who had seen him being once all dead and in three hundred years and in three thousand years to attempt theorizing on such matters would profit little they are matters which refuse to be theoremed and diagramed which logic ought to know that she cannot speak of enough for us to discern far in the uttermost distance some gleam as of a small real light shining in the centre of that enormous cameraobscure image to discern that the centre of it all was not a madness and nothing but a sanity and something  this light kindled in the great dark vortex of the norse mind dark but living waiting only for light this is to me the centre of the whole how such light will then shine out and with wondrous thousandfold expansion spread itself in forms and colors depends not on it so much as on the national mind recipient of it the colors and forms of your light will be those of the cutglass it has to shine throughcurious to think how for every man any the truest fact is modelled by the nature of the man i said the earnest man speaking to his brother men must always have stated what seemed to him a fact a real appearance of nature but the way in which such appearance or fact shaped itselfwhat sort of fact it became for himwas and is modified by his own laws of thinking deep subtle but universal everoperating laws the world of nature for every man is the fantasy of himself this world is the multiplex image of his own dream who knows to what unnamable subtleties of spiritual law all these pagan fables owe their shape the number twelve divisiblest of all which could be halved quartered parted into three into six the most remarkable numberthis was enough to determine the signs of the zodiac the number of odins sons and innumerable other twelves any vague rumor of number had a tendency to settle itself into twelve so with regard to every other matter and quite unconsciously toowith no notion of building up allegories  but the fresh clear glance of those first ages would be prompt in discerning the secret relations of things and wholly open to obey these schiller finds in the cestus of venus an everlasting aesthetic truth as to the nature of all beauty curiousbut he is careful not to insinuate that the old greek mythists had any notion of lecturing about the philosophy of criticismon the whole we must leave those boundless regions cannot we conceive that odin was a reality error indeed error enough but sheer falsehood idle fables allegory aforethoughtwe will not believe that our fathers believed in these   odins runes are a significant feature of him runes and the miracles of magic he worked by them make a great feature in tradition runes are the scandinavian alphabet suppose odin to have been the inventor of letters as well as magic among that people it is the greatest invention man has ever made this of marking down the unseen thought that is in him by written characters it is a kind of second speech almost as miraculous as the first you remember the astonishment and incredulity of atahualpa the peruvian king how he made the spanish soldier who was guarding him scratch dios on his thumbnail that he might try the next soldier with it to ascertain whether such a miracle was possible if odin brought letters among his people he might work magic enough  writing by runes has some air of being original among the norsemen not a phoenician alphabet but a native scandinavian one snorro tells us farther that odin invented poetry the music of human speech as well as that miraculous runic marking of it transport yourselves into the early childhood of nations the first beautiful morninglight of our europe when all yet lay in fresh young radiance as of a great sunrise and our europe was first beginning to think to be wonder hope infinite radiance of hope and wonder as of a young childs thoughts in the hearts of these strong men strong sons of nature and here was not only a wild captain and fighter discerning with his wild flashing eyes what to do with his wild lionheart daring and doing it but a poet too all that we mean by a poet prophet great devout thinker and inventoras the truly great man ever is a hero is a hero at all points in the soul and thought of him first of all this odin in his rude semiarticulate way had a word to speak a great heart laid open to take in this great universe and mans life here and utter a great word about it a hero as i say in his own rude manner a wise gifted noblehearted man and now if we still admire such a man beyond all others what must these wild norse souls first awakened into thinking have made of him to them as yet without names for it he was noble and noblest hero prophet god wuotan the greatest of all thought is thought however it speak or spell itself intrinsically i conjecture this odin must have been of the same sort of stuff as the greatest kind of men a great thought in the wild deep heart of him the rough words he articulated are they not the rudimental roots of those english words we still use he worked so in that obscure element but he was as a light kindled in it a light of intellect rude nobleness of heart the only kind of lights we have yet a hero as i say and he had to shine there and make his obscure element a little lighteras is still the task of us all  we will fancy him to be the type norseman the finest teuton whom that race had yet produced the rude norse heart burst up into boundless admiration round him into adoration he is as a root of so many great things the fruit of him is found growing from deep thousands of years over the whole field of teutonic life our own wednesday as i said is it not still odins day wednesbury wansborough wanstead wandsworth odin grew into england too these are still leaves from that root he was the chief god to all the teutonic peoples their pattern norsemanin such way did they admire their pattern norseman that was the fortune he had in the world  thus if the man odin himself have vanished utterly there is this huge shadow of him which still projects itself over the whole history of his people for this odin once admitted to be god we can understand well that the whole scandinavian scheme of nature or dim noscheme whatever it might before have been would now begin to develop itself altogether differently and grow thenceforth in a new manner what this odin saw into and taught with his runes and his rhymes the whole teutonic people laid to heart and carried forward his way of thought became their way of thoughtsuch under new conditions is the history of every great thinker still in gigantic confused lineaments like some enormous cameraobscure shadow thrown upwards from the dead deeps of the past and covering the whole northern heaven is not that scandinavian mythology in some sort the portraiture of this man odin the gigantic image of his natural face legible or not legible there expanded and confused in that manner ah thought i say is always thought no great man lives in vain the history of the world is but the biography of great men  to me there is something very touching in this primeval figure of heroism in such artless helpless but hearty entire reception of a hero by his fellowmen never so helpless in shape it is the noblest of feelings and a feeling in some shape or other perennial as man himself if i could show in any measure what i feel deeply for a long time now that it is the vital element of manhood the soul of mans history here in our worldit would be the chief use of this discoursing at present we do not now call our great men gods nor admire without limit ah no with limit enough but if we have no great men or do not admire at allthat were a still worse case  this poor scandinavian heroworship that whole norse way of looking at the universe and adjusting oneself there has an indestructible merit for us a rude childlike way of recognizing the divineness of nature the divineness of man most rude yet heartfelt robust giantlike betokening what a giant of a man this child would yet grow toit was a truth and is none is it not as the halfdumb stifled voice of the longburied generations of our own fathers calling out of the depths of ages to us in whose veins their blood still runs this then this is what we made of the world this is all the image and notion we could form to ourselves of this great mystery of a life and universe despise it not you are raised high above it to large free scope of vision but you too are not yet at the top no your notion too so much enlarged is but a partial imperfect one that matter is a thing no man will ever in time or out of time comprehend after thousands of years of evernew expansion man will find himself but struggling to comprehend again a part of it the thing is larger shall man not to be comprehended by him an infinite thing   the essence of the scandinavian as indeed of all pagan mythologies we found to be recognition of the divineness of nature sincere communion of man with the mysterious invisible powers visibly seen at work in the world round him this i should say is more sincerely done in the scandinavian than in any mythology i know sincerity is the great characteristic of it superior sincerity far superior consoles us for the total want of old grecian grace sincerity i think is better than grace i feel that these old northmen wore looking into nature with open eye and soul most earnest honest childlike and yet manlike with a greathearted simplicity and depth and freshness in a true loving admiring unfearing way a right valiant true old race of men such recognition of nature one finds to be the chief element of paganism recognition of man and his moral duty though this too is not wanting comes to be the chief element only in purer forms of religion here indeed is a great distinction and epoch in human beliefs a great landmark in the religious development of mankind man first puts himself in relation with nature and her powers wonders and worships over those not till a later epoch does he discern that all power is moral that the grand point is the distinction for him of good and evil of thou shalt and thou shalt not  with regard to all these fabulous delineations in the edda i will remark moreover as indeed was already hinted that most probably they must have been of much newer date most probably even from the first were comparatively idle for the old norsemen and as it were a kind of poetic sport allegory and poetic delineation as i said above cannot be religious faith the faith itself must first be there then allegory enough will gather round it as the fit body round its soul the norse faith i can well suppose like other faiths was most active while it lay mainly in the silent state and had not yet much to say about itself still less to sing  among those shadowy edda matters amid all that fantastic congeries of assertions and traditions in their musical mythologies the main practical belief a man could have was probably not much more than this of the valkyrs and the hall of odin of an inflexible destiny and that the one thing needful for a man was to be brave the valkyrs are choosers of the slain a destiny inexorable which it is useless trying to bend or soften has appointed who is to be slain this was a fundamental point for the norse believeras indeed it is for all earnest men everywhere for a mahomet a luther for a napoleon too it lies at the basis this for every such man it is the woof out of which his whole system of thought is woven the valkyrs and then that these choosers lead the brave to a heavenly hall of odin only the base and slavish being thrust elsewhither into the realms of hela the deathgoddess i take this to have been the soul of the whole norse belief they understood in their heart that it was indispensable to be brave that odin would have no favor for them but despise and thrust them out if they were not brave consider too whether there is not something in this it is an everlasting duty valid in our day as in that the duty of being brave valor is still value the first duty for a man is still that of subduing fear we must get rid of fear we cannot act at all till then a mans acts are slavish not true but specious his very thoughts are false he thinks too as a slave and coward till he have got fear under his feet odins creed if we disentangle the real kernel of it is true to this hour a man shall and must be valiant he must march forward and quit himself like a mantrusting imperturbably in the appointment and choice of the upper powers and on the whole not fear at all now and always the completeness of his victory over fear will determine how much of a man he is  it is doubtless very savage that kind of valor of the old northmen snorro tells us they thought it a shame and misery not to die in battle and if natural death seemed to be coming on they would cut wounds in their flesh that odin might receive them as warriors slain old kings about to die had their body laid into a ship the ship sent forth with sails set and slow fire burning it that once out at sea it might blaze up in flame and in such manner bury worthily the old hero at once in the sky and in the ocean wild bloody valor yet valor of its kind better i say than none in the old seakings too what an indomitable rugged energy silent with closed lips as i fancy them unconscious that they were specially brave defying the wild ocean with its monsters and all men and thingsprogenitors of our own blakes and nelsons no homer sang these norse seakings but agamemnons was a small audacity and of small fruit in the world to some of themto hrolfs of normandy for instance hrolf or rollo duke of normandy the wild seaking has a share in governing england at this hour  nor was it altogether nothing even that wild searoving and battling through so many generations it needed to be ascertained which was the strongest kind of men who were to be ruler over whom among the northland sovereigns too i find some who got the title woodcutter forestfelling kings much lies in that i suppose at bottom many of them were forestfellers as well as fighters though the skalds talk mainly of the lattermisleading certain critics not a little for no nation of men could ever live by fighting alone there could not produce enough come out of that i suppose the right good fighter was oftenest also the right good forestfellerthe right good improver discerner doer and worker in every kind for true valor different enough from ferocity is the basis of all a more legitimate kind of valor that showing itself against the untamed forests and dark brute powers of nature to conquer nature for us in the same direction have not we their descendants since carried it far may such valor last forever with us  that the man odin speaking with a heros voice and heart as with an impressiveness out of heaven told his people the infinite importance of valor how man thereby became a god and that his people feeling a response to it in their own hearts believed this message of his and thought it a message out of heaven and him a divinity for telling it them this seems to me the primary seedgrain of the norse religion from which all manner of mythologies symbolic practices speculations allegories songs and sagas would naturally grow growhow strangely i called it a small light shining and shaping in the huge vortex of norse darkness yet the darkness itself was alive consider that it was the eager inarticulate uninstructed mind of the whole norse people longing only to become articulate to go on articulating ever farther the living doctrine grows growslike a banyantree the first seed is the essential thing any branch strikes itself down into the earth becomes a new root and so in endless complexity we have a whole wood a whole jungle one seed the parent of it all was not the whole norse religion accordingly in some sense what we called the enormous shadow of this mans likeness critics trace some affinity in some norse mythuses of the creation and such like with those of the hindoos the cow adumbla licking the rime from the rocks has a kind of hindoo look a hindoo cow transported into frosty countries probably enough indeed we may say undoubtedly these things will have a kindred with the remotest lands with the earliest times thought does not die but only is changed the first man that began to think in this planet of ours he was the beginner of all and then the second man and the third mannay every true thinker to this hour is a kind of odin teaches men his way of thought spreads a shadow of his own likeness over sections of the history of the world   of the distinctive poetic character or merit of this norse mythology i have not room to speak nor does it concern us much some wild prophecies we have as the voluspa in the elder edda of a rapt earnest sibylline sort but they were comparatively an idle adjunct of the matter men who as it were but toyed with the matter these later skalds and it is their songs chiefly that survive in later centuries i suppose they would go on singing poetically symbolizing as our modern painters paint when it was no longer from the innermost heart or not from the heart at all this is everywhere to be well kept in mind  grays fragments of norse lore at any rate will give one no notion of itany more than pope will of homer it is no squarebuilt gloomy palace of black ashlar marble shrouded in awe and horror as gray gives it us no rough as the north rocks as the iceland deserts it is with a heartiness homeliness even a tint of good humor and robust mirth in the middle of these fearful things the strong old norse heart did not go upon theatrical sublimities they had not time to tremble i like much their robust simplicity their veracity directness of conception thor draws down his brows in a veritable norse rage grasps his hammer till the knuckles grow white beautiful traits of pity too an honest pity balder the white god dies the beautiful benignant he is the sungod they try all nature for a remedy but he is dead frigga his mother sends hermoder to seek or see him nine days and

gentle has to remain there his wife had volunteered to go with him to die with him they shall forever remain there he sends his ring to odin nanna his wife sends her thimble to frigga as a remembranceah me  for indeed valor is the fountain of pity tooof truth and all that is great and good in man the robust homely vigor of the norse heart attaches one much in these delineations is it not a trait of right honest strength says uhland who has written a fine essay on thor that the old norse heart finds its friend in the thundergod that it is not frightened away by his thunder but finds that summerheat the beautiful noble summer must and will have thunder withal the norse heart loves this thor and his hammerbolt sports with him thor is summerheat the god of peaceable industry as well as thunder he is the peasants friend his true henchman and attendant is thialfi manual labor thor himself engages in all manner of rough manual work scorns no business for its plebeianism is ever and anon travelling to the country of the jotuns harrying those chaotic frostmonsters subduing them at least straitening and damaging them there is a great broad humor in some of these things  thor as we saw above goes to jotunland to seek hymirs caldron that the gods may brew beer hymir the huge giant enters his gray beard all full of hoarfrost splits pillars with the very glance of his eye thor after much rough tumult snatches the pot claps it on his head the handles of it reach down to his heels the norse skald has a kind of loving sport with thor this is the hymir whose cattle the critics have discovered are icebergs huge untutored brobdignag geniusneeding only to be tamed down into shakspeares dantes goethes it is all gone now that old norse workthor the thundergod changed into jack the giantkiller but the mind that made it is here yet how strangely things grow and die and do not die there are twigs of that great worldtree of norse belief still curiously traceable this poor jack of the nursery with his miraculous shoes of swiftness coat of darkness sword of sharpness he is one hynde etin and still more decisively red etin of ireland in the scottish ballads these are both derived from norseland etin is evidently a jotun nay shakspeares hamlet is a twig too of this same worldtree there seems no doubt of that hamlet amleth i find is really a mythic personage and his tragedy of the poisoned father poisoned asleep by drops in his ear and the rest is a norse mythus old saxo as his wont was made it a danish history shakspeare out of saxo made it what we see that is a twig of the worldtree that has grown i thinkby nature or accident that one has grown  in fact these old norse songs have a truth in them an inward perennial truth and greatnessas indeed all must have that can very long preserve itself by tradition alone it is a greatness not of mere body and gigantic bulk but a rude greatness of soul there is a sublime uncomplaining melancholy traceable in these old hearts a great free glance into the very deeps of thought they seem to have seen these brave old northmen what meditation has taught all men in all ages that this world is after all but a showa phenomenon or appearance no real thing all deep souls see into thatthe hindoo mythologist the german philosopherthe shakspeare the earnest thinker wherever he may be       we are such stuff as dreams are made of  one of thors expeditions to utgard the outer garden central seat of jotunland is remarkable in this respect thialfi was with him and loke after various adventures they entered upon giantland wandered over plains wild uncultivated places among stones and trees at nightfall they noticed a house and as the door which indeed formed one whole side of the house was open they entered it was a simple habitation one large hall altogether empty they stayed there suddenly in the dead of the night loud noises alarmed them thor grasped his hammer stood in the door prepared for fight his companions within ran hither and thither in their terror seeking some outlet in that rude hall they found a little closet at last and took refuge there neither had thor any battle for lo in the morning it turned out that the noise had been only the snoring of a certain enormous but peaceable giant the giant skrymir who lay peaceably sleeping near by and this that they took for a house was merely his glove thrown aside there the door was the glovewrist the little closet they had fled into was the thumb such a glovei remark too that it had not fingers as ours have but only a thumb and the rest undivided a most ancient rustic glove  skrymir now carried their portmanteau all day thor however had his own suspicions did not like the ways of skrymir determined at night to put an end to him as he slept raising his hammer he struck down into the giants face a right thunderbolt blow of force to rend rocks the giant merely awoke rubbed his cheek and said did a leaf fall again thor struck so soon as skrymir again slept a better blow than before but the giant only murmured was that a grain of sand thors third stroke was with both his hands the knuckles white i suppose and seemed to dint deep into skrymirs visage but he merely checked his snore and remarked there must be sparrows roosting in this tree i think what is that they have droptat the gate of utgard a place so high that you had to strain your neck bending back to see the top of it skrymir went his ways thor and his companions were admitted invited to take share in the games going on to thor for his part they handed a drinkinghorn it was a common feat they told him to drink this dry at one draught long and fiercely three times over thor drank but made hardly any impression he was a weak child they told him could he lift that cat he saw there small as the feat seemed thor with his whole godlike strength could not he bent up the creatures back could not raise its feet off the ground could at the utmost raise one foot why you are no man said the utgard people there is an old woman that will wrestle you thor heartily ashamed seized this haggard old woman but could not throw her  and now on their quitting utgard the chief jotun escorting them politely a little way said to thor you are beaten thenyet be not so much ashamed there was deception of appearance in it that horn you tried to drink was the sea you did make it ebb but who could drink that the bottomless the cat you would have liftedwhy that is the midgardsnake the great worldserpent which tail in mouth girds and keeps up the whole created world had you torn that up the world must have rushed to ruin as for the old woman she was time old age duration with her what can wrestle no man nor no god with her gods or men she prevails over all and then those three strokes you strucklook at these three valleys your three strokes made these thor looked at his attendant jotun it was skrymirit was say norse critics the old chaotic rocky earth in person and that glovehouse was some earthcavern but skrymir had vanished utgard with its skyhigh gates when thor grasped his hammer to smite them had gone to air only the giants voice was heard mocking better come no more to jotunheim  this is of the allegoric period as we see and half play not of the prophetic and entirely devout but as a mythus is there not real antique norse gold in it more true metal rough from the mimerstithy than in many a famed greek mythus shaped far better a great broad brobdignag grin of true humor is in this skrymir mirth resting on earnestness and sadness as the rainbow on black tempest only a right valiant heart is capable of that it is the grim humor of our own ben jonson rare old ben runs in the blood of us i fancy for one catches tones of it under a still other shape out of the american backwoods  that is also a very striking conception that of the ragnarok consummation or twilight of the gods it is in the voluspa song seemingly a very old prophetic idea the gods and jotuns the divine powers and the chaotic brute ones after long contest and partial victory by the former meet at last in universal worldembracing wrestle and duel worldserpent against thor strength against strength mutually extinctive and ruin twilight sinking into darkness swallows the created universe the old universe with its gods is sunk but it is not final death there is to be a new heaven and a new earth a higher supreme god and justice to reign among men curious this law of mutation which also is a law written in mans inmost thought had been deciphered by these old earnest thinkers in their rude style and how though all dies and even gods die yet all death is but a phoenix firedeath and newbirth into the greater and the better it is the fundamental law of being for a creature made of time living in this place of hope all earnest men have seen into it may still see into it  and now connected with this let us glance at the last mythus of the appearance of thor and end there i fancy it to be the latest in date of all these fables a sorrowing protest against the advance of christianityset forth reproachfully by some conservative pagan king olaf has been harshly blamed for his overzeal in introducing christianity surely i should have blamed him far more for an underzeal in that he paid dear enough for it he died by the revolt of his pagan people in battle in the year 1033 at stickelstad near that drontheim where the chief cathedral of the north has now stood for many centuries dedicated gratefully to his memory as saint olaf the mythus about thor is to this effect king olaf the christian reform king is sailing with fit escort along the shore of norway from haven to haven dispensing justice or doing other royal work on leaving a certain haven it is found that a stranger of grave eyes and aspect red beard of stately robust figure has stept in the courtiers address him his answers surprise by their pertinency and depth at length he is brought to the king the strangers conversation here is not less remarkable as they sail along the beautiful shore but after some time he addresses king olaf thus yes king olaf it is all beautiful with the sun shining on it there green fruitful a right fair home for you and many a sore day had thor many a wild fight with the rock jotuns before he could make it so and now you seem minded to put away thor king olaf have a care said the stranger drawing down his browsand when they looked again he was nowhere to be foundthis is the last appearance of thor on the stage of this world  do we not see well enough how the fable might arise without unveracity on the part of any one it is the way most gods have come to appear among men thus if in pindars time neptune was seen once at the nemean games what was this neptune too but a stranger of noble grave aspectfit to be seen there is something pathetic tragic for me in this last voice of paganism thor is vanished the whole norse world has vanished and will not return ever again in like fashion to that pass away the highest things all things that have been in this world all things that are or will be in it have to vanish we have our sad farewell to give them  that norse religion a rude but earnest sternly impressive consecration of valor so we may define it sufficed for these old valiant northmen consecration of valor is not a bad thing we will take it for good so far as it goes neither is there no use in knowing something about this old paganism of our fathers unconsciously and combined with higher things it is in us yet that old faith withal to know it consciously brings us into closer and clearer relation with the pastwith our own possessions in the past for the whole past as i keep repeating is the possession of the present the past had always something true and is a precious possession in a different time in a different place it is always some other side of our common human nature that has been developing itself the actual true is the sum of all these not any one of them by itself constitutes what of human nature is hitherto developed better to know them all than misknow them to which of these three religions do you specially adhere inquires meister of his teacher to all the three answers the other to all the three for they by their union first constitute the true religion      lecture ii the hero as prophet mahomet islam  may 8 1840  from the first rude times of paganism among the scandinavians in the north we advance to a very different epoch of religion among a very different people mahometanism among the arabs a great change what a change and progress is indicated here in the universal condition and thoughts of men  the hero is not now regarded as a god among his fellowmen but as one godinspired as a prophet it is the second phasis of heroworship the first or oldest we may say has passed away without return in the history of the world there will not again be any man never so great whom his fellowmen will take for a god nay we might rationally ask did any set of human beings ever really think the man they saw there standing beside them a god the maker of this world perhaps not it was usually some man they remembered or had seen but neither can this any more be the great man is not recognized henceforth as a god any more  it was a rude gross error that of counting the great man a god yet let us say that it is at all times difficult to know what he is or how to account of him and receive him the most significant feature in the history of an epoch is the manner it has of welcoming a great man ever to the true instincts of men there is something godlike in him whether they shall take him to be a god to be a prophet or what they shall take him to be that is ever a grand question by their way of answering that we shall see as through a little window into the very heart of these mens spiritual condition for at bottom the great man as he comes from the hand of nature is ever the same kind of thing odin luther johnson burns i hope to make it appear that these are all originally of one stuff that only by the worlds reception of them and the shapes they assume are they so immeasurably diverse the worship of odin astonishes usto fall prostrate before the great man into deliquium of love and wonder over him and feel in their hearts that he was a denizen of the skies a god this was imperfect enough but to welcome for example a burns as we did was that what we can call perfect the most precious gift that heaven can give to the earth a man of genius as we call it the soul of a man actually sent down from the skies with a godsmessage to usthis we waste away as an idle artificial firework sent to amuse us a little and sink it into ashes wreck and ineffectuality such reception of a great man i do not call very perfect either looking into the heart of the thing one may perhaps call that of burns a still uglier phenomenon betokening still sadder imperfections in mankinds ways than the scandinavian method itself to fall into mere unreasoning deliquium of love and admiration was not good but such unreasoning nay irrational supercilious nolove at all is perhaps still worseit is a thing forever changing this of heroworship different in each age difficult to do well in any age indeed the heart of the whole business of the age one may say is to do it well  we have chosen mahomet not as the most eminent prophet but as the one we are freest to speak of he is by no means the truest of prophets but i do esteem him a true one farther as there is no danger of our becoming any of us mahometans i mean to say all the good of him i justly can it is the way to get at his secret let us try to understand what he meant with the world what the world meant and means with him will then be a more answerable question our current hypothesis about mahomet that he was a scheming impostor a falsehood incarnate that his religion is a mere mass of quackery and fatuity begins really to be now untenable to any one the lies which wellmeaning zeal has heaped round this man are disgraceful to ourselves only when pococke inquired of grotius where the proof was of that story of the pigeon trained to pick peas from mahomets ear and pass for an angel dictating to him grotius answered that there was no proof it is really time to dismiss all that the word this man spoke has been the lifeguidance now of a hundred and eighty millions of men these twelve hundred years these hundred and eighty millions were made by god as well as we a greater number of gods creatures believe in mahomets word at this hour than in any other word whatever are we to suppose that it was a miserable piece of spiritual legerdemain this which so many creatures of the almighty have lived by and died by i for my part cannot form any such supposition i will believe most things sooner than that one would be entirely at a loss what to think of this world at all if quackery so grew and were sanctioned here  alas such theories are very lamentable if we would attain to knowledge of anything in gods true creation let us disbelieve them wholly they are the product of an age of scepticism they indicate the saddest spiritual paralysis and mere deathlife of the souls of men more godless theory i think was never promulgated in this earth a false man found a religion why a false man cannot build a brick house if he do not know and follow truly the properties of mortar burnt clay and what else be works in it is no house that he makes but a rubbishheap it will not stand for twelve centuries to lodge a hundred and eighty millions it will fall straightway a man must conform himself to natures laws be verily in communion with nature and the truth of things or nature will answer him no not at all speciosities are speciousah mea cagliostro many cagliostros prominent worldleaders do prosper by their quackery for a day it is like a forged banknote they get it passed out of their worthless hands others not they have to smart for it nature bursts up in fireflames french revolutions and such like proclaiming with terrible veracity that forged notes are forged  but of a great man especially of him i will venture to assert that it is incredible he should have been other than true it seems to me the primary foundation of him and of all that can lie in him this no mirabeau napoleon burns cromwell no man adequate to do anything but is first of all in right earnest about it what i call a sincere man i should say sincerity a deep great genuine sincerity is the first characteristic of all men in any way heroic not the sincerity that calls itself sincere ah no that is a very poor matter indeeda shallow braggart conscious sincerity oftenest selfconceit mainly the great mans sincerity is of the kind he cannot speak of is not conscious of nay i suppose he is conscious rather of insincerity for what man can walk accurately by the law of truth for one day no the great man does not boast himself sincere far from that perhaps does not ask himself if he is so i would say rather his sincerity does not depend on himself he cannot help being sincere the great fact of existence is great to him fly as he will he cannot get out of the awful presence of this reality his mind is so made he is great by that first of all fearful and wonderful real as life real as death is this universe to him though all men should forget its truth and walk in a vain show he cannot at all moments the flameimage glares in upon him undeniable there therei wish you to take this as my primary definition of a great man a little man may have this it is competent to all men that god has made but a great man cannot be without it  such a man is what we call an original man he comes to us at firsthand a messenger he sent from the infinite unknown with tidings to us we may call him poet prophet godin one way or other we all feel that the words he utters are as no other mans words direct from the inner fact of thingshe lives and has to live in daily communion with that hearsays cannot hide it from him he is blind homeless miserable following hearsays it glares in upon him really his utterances are they not a kind of revelationwhat we must call such for want of some other name it is from the heart of the world that he comes he is portion of the primal reality of things god has made many revelations but this man too has not god made him the latest and newest of all the inspiration of the almighty giveth him understanding we must listen before all to him   this mahomet then we will in no wise consider as an inanity and theatricality a poor conscious ambitious schemer we cannot conceive him so the rude message he delivered was a real one withal an earnest confused voice from the unknown deep the mans words were not false nor his workings here below no inanity and simulacrum a fiery mass of life cast up from the great bosom of nature herself to kindle the world the worlds maker had ordered it so neither can the faults imperfections insincerities even of mahomet if such were never so well proved against him shake this primary fact about him  on the whole we make too much of faults the details of the business hide the real centre of it faults the greatest of faults i should say is to be conscious of none readers of the bible above all one would think might know better who is called there the man according to gods own heart david the hebrew king had fallen into sins enough blackest crimes there was no want of sins and thereupon the unbelievers sneer and ask is this your man according to gods heart the sneer i must say seems to me but a shallow one what are faults what are the outward details of a life if the inner secret of it the remorse temptations true oftenbaffled neverended struggle of it be forgotten it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps of all acts is not for a man repentance the most divine the deadliest sin i say were that same supercilious consciousness of no sinthat is death the heart so conscious is divorced from sincerity humility and fact is dead it is pure as dead dry sand is pure davids life and history as written for us in those psalms of his i consider to be the truest emblem ever given of a mans moral progress and warfare here below all earnest souls will ever discern in it the faithful struggle of an earnest human soul towards what is good and best struggle often baffled sore baffled down as into entire wreck yet a struggle never ended ever with tears repentance true unconquerable purpose begun anew poor human nature is not a mans walking in truth always that a succession of falls man can do no other in this wild element of a life he has to struggle onwards now fallen deepabased and ever with tears repentance with bleeding heart he has to rise again struggle again still onwards that his struggle be a faithful unconquerable one that is the question of questions we will put up with many sad details if the soul of it were true details by themselves will never teach us what it is i believe we misestimate mahomets faults even as faults but the secret of him will never be got by dwelling there we will leave all this behind us and assuring ourselves that he did mean some true thing ask candidly what it was or might be   these arabs mahomet was born among are certainly a notable people their country itself is notable the fit habitation for such a race savage inaccessible rockmountains great grim deserts alternating with beautiful strips of verdure wherever water is there is greenness beauty odoriferous balmshrubs datetrees frankincensetrees consider that wide waste horizon of sand empty silent like a sandsea dividing habitable place from habitable you are all alone there left alone with the universe by day a fierce sun blazing down on it with intolerable radiance by night the great deep heaven with its stars such a country is fit for a swifthanded deephearted race of men there is something most agile active and yet most meditative enthusiastic in the arab character the persians are called the french of the east we will call the arabs oriental italians a gifted noble people a people of wild strong feelings and of iron restraint over these the characteristic of noblemindedness of genius the wild bedouin welcomes the stranger to his tent as one having right to all that is there were it his worst enemy he will slay his foal to treat him will serve him with sacred hospitality for three days will set him fairly on his wayand then by another law as sacred kill him if he can in words too as in action they are not a loquacious people taciturn rather but eloquent gifted when they do speak an earnest truthful kind of men they are as we know of jewish kindred but with that deadly terrible earnestness of the jews they seem to combine something graceful brilliant which is not jewish they had poetic contests among them before the time of mahomet sale says at ocadh in the south of arabia there were yearly fairs and there when the merchandising was done poets sang for prizesthe wild people gathered to hear that  one jewish quality these arabs manifest the outcome of many or of all high qualities what we may call religiosity from of old they had been zealous worshippers according to their light they worshipped the stars as sabeans worshipped many natural objectsrecognized them as symbols immediate manifestations of the maker of nature it was wrong and yet not wholly wrong all gods works are still in a sense symbols of god do we not as i urged still account it a merit to recognize a certain inexhaustible significance poetic beauty as we name it in all natural objects whatsoever a man is a poet and honored for doing that and speaking or singing ita kind of diluted worship they had many prophets these arabs teachers each to his tribe each according to the light he had but indeed have we not from of old the noblest of proofs still palpable to every one of us of what devoutness and noblemindedness had dwelt in these rustic thoughtful peoples biblical critics seem agreed that our own book of job was written in that region of the world i call that apart from all theories about it one of the grandest things ever written with pen one feels indeed as if it were not hebrew such a noble universality different from noble patriotism or sectarianism reigns in it a noble book all mens book it is our first oldest statement of the neverending problemmans destiny and gods ways with him here in this earth and all in such free flowing outlines grand in its sincerity in its simplicity in its epic melody and repose of reconcilement there is the seeing eye the mildly understanding heart so true every way true eyesight and vision for all things material things no less than spiritual the horsehast thou clothed his neck with thunderhe laughs at the shaking of the spear such living likenesses were never since drawn sublime sorrow sublime reconciliation oldest choral melody as of the heart of mankindso soft and great as the summer midnight as the world with its seas and stars there is nothing written i think in the bible or out of it of equal literary merit  to the idolatrous arabs one of the most ancient universal objects of worship was that black stone still kept in the building called caabah at mecca diodorus siculus mentions this caabah in a way not to be mistaken as the oldest most honored temple in his time that is some halfcentury before our era silvestre de sacy says there is some likelihood that the black stone is an aerolite in that case some man might see it fall out of heaven it stands now beside the well zemzem the caabah is built over both a well is in all places a beautiful affecting object gushing out like life from the hard earthstill more so in those hot dry countries where it is the first condition of being the well zemzem has its name from the bubbling sound of the waters zemzem they think it is the well which hagar found with her little ishmael in the wilderness the aerolite and it have been sacred now and had a caabah over them for thousands of years a curious object that caabah there it stands at this hour in the black clothcovering the sultan sends it yearly twentyseven cubits high with circuit with double circuit of pillars with festoonrows of lamps and quaint ornaments the lamps will be lighted again this nightto glitter again under the stars an authentic fragment of the oldest past it is the keblah of all moslem from delhi all onwards to morocco the eyes of innumerable praying men are turned towards it five times this day and all days one of the notablest centres in the habitation of men  it had been from the sacredness attached to this caabah stone and hagars well from the pilgrimings of all tribes of arabs thither that mecca took its rise as a town a great town once though much decayed now it has no natural advantage for a town stands in a sandy hollow amid bare barren hills at a distance from the sea its provisions its very bread have to be imported but so many pilgrims needed lodgings and then all places of pilgrimage do from the first become places of trade the first day pilgrims meet merchants have also met where men see themselves assembled for one object they find that they can accomplish other objects which depend on meeting together mecca became the fair of all arabia and thereby indeed the chief staple and warehouse of whatever commerce there was between the indian and the western countries syria egypt even italy it had at one time a population of 100000 buyers forwarders of those eastern and western products importers for their own behoof of provisions and corn the government was a kind of irregular aristocratic republic not without a touch of theocracy ten men of a chief tribe chosen in some rough way were governors of mecca and keepers of the caabah the koreish were the chief tribe in mahomets time his own family was of that tribe the rest of the nation fractioned and cut asunder by deserts lived under similar rude patriarchal governments by one or several herdsmen carriers traders generally robbers too being oftenest at war one with another or with all held together by no open bond if it were not this meeting at the caabah where all forms of arab idolatry assembled in common adorationheld mainly by the inward indissoluble bond of a common blood and language in this way had the arabs lived for long ages unnoticed by the world a people of great qualities unconsciously waiting for the day when they should become notable to all the world their idolatries appear to have been in a tottering state much was getting into confusion and fermentation among them obscure tidings of the most important event ever transacted in this world the life and death of the divine man in judea at once the symptom and cause of immeasurable change to all people in the world had in the course of centuries reached into arabia too and could not but of itself have produced fermentation there   it was among this arab people so circumstanced in the year 570 of our era that the man mahomet was born he was of the family of hashem of the koreish tribe as we said though poor connected with the chief persons of his country almost at his birth he lost his father at the age of six years his mother too a woman noted for her beauty her worth and sense he fell to the charge of his grandfather an old man a hundred years old a good old man mahomets father abdallah had been his youngest favorite son he saw in mahomet with his old lifeworn eyes a century old the lost abdallah come back again all that was left of abdallah he loved the little orphan boy greatly used to say they must take care of that beautiful little boy nothing in their kindred was more precious than he at his death while the boy was still but two years old he left him in charge to abu thaleb the eldest of the uncles as to him that now was head of the house by this uncle a just and rational man as everything betokens mahomet was brought up in the best arab way  mahomet as he grew up accompanied his uncle on trading journeys and such like in his eighteenth year one finds him a fighter following his uncle in war but perhaps the most significant of all his journeys is one we find noted as of some years earlier date a journey to the fairs of syria the young man here first came in contact with a quite foreign worldwith one foreign element of endless moment to him the christian religion i know not what to make of that sergius the nestorian monk whom abu thaleb and he are said to have lodged with or how much any monk could have taught one still so young probably enough it is greatly exaggerated this of the nestorian monk mahomet was only fourteen had no language but his own much in syria must have been a strange unintelligible whirlpool to him but the eyes of the lad were open glimpses of many things would doubtless be taken in and lie very enigmatic as yet which were to ripen in a strange way into views into beliefs and insights one day these journeys to syria were probably the beginning of much to mahomet  one other circumstance we must not forget that he had no schoollearning of the thing we call schoollearning none at all the art of writing was but just introduced into arabia it seems to be the true opinion that mahomet never could write life in the desert with its experiences was all his education what of this infinite universe he from his dim place with his own eyes and thoughts could take in so much and no more of it was he to know curious if we will reflect on it this of having no books except by what he could see for himself or hear of by uncertain rumor of speech in the obscure arabian desert he could know nothing the wisdom that had been before him or at a distance from him in the world was in a manner as good as not there for him of the great brother souls flamebeacons through so many lands and times no one directly communicates with this great soul he is alone there deep down in the bosom of the wilderness has to grow up soalone with nature and his own thoughts  but from an early age he had been remarked as a thoughtful man his companions named him al amin the faithful a man of truth and fidelity true in what he did in what he spake and thought they noted that he always meant something a man rather taciturn in speech silent when there was nothing to be said but pertinent wise sincere when he did speak always throwing light on the matter this is the only sort of speech worth speaking through life we find him to have been regarded as an altogether solid brotherly genuine man a serious sincere character yet amiable cordial companionable jocose evena good laugh in him withal there are men whose laugh is as untrue as anything about them who cannot laugh one hears of mahomets beauty his fine sagacious honest face brown florid complexion beaming black eyesi somehow like too that vein on the brow which swelled up black when he was in anger like the horseshoe vein in scotts redgauntlet it was a kind of feature in the hashem family this black swelling vein in the brow mahomet had it prominent as would appear a spontaneous passionate yet just truemeaning man full of wild faculty fire and light of wild worth all uncultured working out his lifetask in the depths of the desert there  how he was placed with kadijah a rich widow as her steward and travelled in her business again to the fairs of syria how he managed all as one can well understand with fidelity adroitness how her gratitude her regard for him grew the story of their marriage is altogether a graceful intelligible one as told us by the arab authors he was twentyfive she forty though still beautiful he seems to have lived in a most affectionate peaceable wholesome way with this wedded benefactress loving her truly and her alone it goes greatly against the impostor theory the fact that he lived in this entirely unexceptionable entirely quiet and commonplace way till the heat of his years was done he was forty before he talked of any mission from heaven all his irregularities real and supposed date from after his fiftieth year when the good kadijah died all his ambition seemingly had been hitherto to live an honest life his fame the mere good opinion of neighbors that knew him had been sufficient hitherto not till he was already getting old the prurient heat of his life all burnt out and peace growing to be the chief thing this world could give him did he start on the career of ambition and belying all his past character and existence set up as a wretched empty charlatan to acquire what he could now no longer enjoy for my share i have no faith whatever in that  ah no this deephearted son of the wilderness with his beaming black eyes and open social deep soul had other thoughts in him than ambition a silent great soul he was one of those who cannot but be in earnest whom nature herself has appointed to be sincere while others walk in formulas and hearsays contented enough to dwell there this man could not screen himself in formulas he was alone with his own soul and the reality of things the great mystery of existence as i said glared in upon him with its terrors with its splendors no hearsays could hide that unspeakable fact here am i such sincerity as we named it has in very truth something of divine the word of such a man is a voice direct from natures own heart men do and must listen to that as to nothing elseall else is wind in comparison from of old a thousand thoughts in his pilgrimings and wanderings had been in this man what am i what is this unfathomable thing i live in which men name universe what is life what is death what am i to believe what am i to do the grim rocks of mount hara of mount sinai the stern sandy solitudes answered not the great heaven rolling silent overhead with its blueglancing stars answered not there was no answer the mans own soul and what of gods inspiration dwelt there had to answer  it is the thing which all men have to ask themselves which we too have to ask and answer this wild man felt it to be of infinite moment all other things of no moment whatever in comparison the jargon of argumentative greek sects vague traditions of jews the stupid routine of arab idolatry there was no answer in these a hero as i repeat has this first distinction which indeed we may call first and last the alpha and omega of his whole heroism that he looks through the shows of things into things use and wont respectable hearsay respectable formula all these are good or are not good there is something behind and beyond all these which all these must correspond with be the image of or they areidolatries bits of black wood pretending to be god to the earnest soul a mockery and abomination idolatries never so gilded waited on by heads of the koreish will do nothing for this man though all men walk by them what good is it the great reality stands glaring there upon him he there has to answer it or perish miserably now even now or else through all eternity never answer it thou must find an answerambition what could all arabia do for this man with the crown of greek heraclius of persian chosroes and all crowns in the earthwhat could they all do for him it was not of the earth he wanted to hear tell it was of the heaven above and of the hell beneath all crowns and sovereignties whatsoever where would they in a few brief years be to be sheik of mecca or arabia and have a bit of gilt wood put into your handwill that be ones salvation i decidedly think not we will leave it altogether this impostor hypothesis as not credible not very tolerable even worthy chiefly of dismissal by us  mahomet had been wont to retire yearly during the month ramadhan into solitude and silence as indeed was the arab custom a praiseworthy custom which such a man above all would find natural and useful communing with his own heart in the silence of the mountains himself silent open to the small still voices it was a right natural custom mahomet was in his fortieth year when having withdrawn to a cavern in mount hara near mecca during this ramadhan to pass the month in prayer and meditation on those great questions he one day told his wife kadijah who with his household was with him or near him this year that by the unspeakable special favor of heaven he had now found it all out was in doubt and darkness no longer but saw it all that all these idols and formulas were nothing miserable bits of wood that there was one god in and over all and we must leave all idols and look to him that god is great and that there is nothing else great he is the reality wooden idols are not real he is real he made us at first sustains us yet we and all things are but the shadow of him a transitory garment veiling the eternal splendor allah akbar god is greatand then also islam that we must submit to god that our whole strength lies in resigned submission to him whatsoever he do to us for this world and for the other the thing he sends to us were it death and worse than death shall be good shall be best we resign ourselves to godif this be islam says goethe do we not all live in islam yes all of us that have any moral life we all live so it has ever been held the highest wisdom for a man not merely to submit to necessitynecessity will make him submitbut to know and believe well that the stern thing which necessity had ordered was the wisest the best the thing wanted there to cease his frantic pretension of scanning this great godsworld in his small fraction of a brain to know that it had verily though deep beyond his soundings a just law that the soul of it was goodthat his part in it was to conform to the law of the whole and in devout silence follow that not questioning it obeying it as unquestionable  i say this is yet the only true morality known a man is right and invincible virtuous and on the road towards sure conquest precisely while he joins himself to the great deep law of the world in spite of all superficial laws temporary appearances profitandloss calculations he is victorious while he cooperates with that great central law not victorious otherwiseand surely his first chance of cooperating with it or getting into the course of it is to know with his whole soul that it is that it is good and alone good this is the soul of islam it is properly the soul of christianityfor islam is definable as a confused form of christianity had christianity not been neither had it been christianity also commands us before all to be resigned to god we are to take no counsel with flesh and blood give ear to no vain cavils vain sorrows and wishes to know that we know nothing that the worst and cruelest to our eyes is not what it seems that we have to receive whatsoever befalls us as sent from god above and say it is good and wise god is great though he slay me yet will i trust in him islam means in its way denial of self annihilation of self this is yet the highest wisdom that heaven has revealed to our earth  such light had come as it could to illuminate the darkness of this wild arab soul a confused dazzling splendor as of life and heaven in the great darkness which threatened to be death he called it revelation and the angel gabrielwho of us yet can know what to call it it is the inspiration of the almighty that giveth us understanding to know to get into the truth of anything is ever a mystic actof which the best logics can but babble on the surface is not belief the true godannouncing miracle says novalisthat mahomets whole soul set in flame with this grand truth vouchsafed him should feel as if it were important and the only important thing was very natural that providence had unspeakably honored him by revealing it saving him from death and darkness that he therefore was bound to make known the same to all creatures this is what was meant by mahomet is the prophet of god this too is not without its true meaning  the good kadijah we can fancy listened to him with wonder with doubt at length she answered yes it was true this that he said one can fancy too the boundless gratitude of mahomet and how of all the kindnesses she had done him this of believing the earnest struggling word he now spoke was the greatest it is certain says novalis my conviction gains infinitely the moment another soul will believe in it it is a boundless favorhe never forgot this good kadijah long afterwards ayesha his young favorite wife a woman who indeed distinguished herself among the moslem by all manner of qualities through her whole long life this young brilliant ayesha was one day questioning him now am not i better than kadijah she was a widow old and had lost her looks you love me better than you did herno by allah answered mahomet no by allah she believed in me when none else would believe in the whole world i had but one friend and she was thatseid his slave also believed in him these with his young cousin ali abu thalebs son were his first converts  he spoke of his doctrine to this man and that but the most treated it with ridicule with indifference in three years i think he had gained but thirteen followers his progress was slow enough his encouragement to go on was altogether the usual encouragement that such a man in such a case meets after some three years of small success he invited forty of his chief kindred to an entertainment and there stood up and told them what his pretension was that he had this thing to promulgate abroad to all men that it was the highest thing the one thing which of them would second him in that amid the doubt and silence of all young ali as yet a lad of sixteen impatient of the silence started up and exclaimed in passionate fierce language that he would the assembly among whom was abu thaleb alis father could not be unfriendly to mahomet yet the sight there of one unlettered elderly man with a lad of sixteen deciding on such an enterprise against all mankind appeared ridiculous to them the assembly broke up in laughter nevertheless it proved not a laughable thing it was a very serious thing as for this young ali one cannot but like him a nobleminded creature as he shows himself now and always afterwards full of affection of fiery daring something chivalrous in him brave as a lion yet with a grace a truth and affection worthy of christian knighthood he died by assassination in the mosque at bagdad a death occasioned by his own generous fairness confidence in the fairness of others he said if the wound proved not unto death they must pardon the assassin but if it did then they must slay him straightway that so they two in the same hour might appear before god and see which side of that quarrel was the just one  mahomet naturally gave offence to the koreish keepers of the caabah superintendents of the idols one or two men of influence had joined him the thing spread slowly but it was spreading naturally he gave offence to everybody who is this that pretends to be wiser than we all that rebukes us all as mere fools and worshippers of wood abu thaleb the good uncle spoke with him could he not be silent about all that believe it all for himself and not trouble others anger the chief men endanger himself and them all talking of it mahomet answered if the sun stood on his right hand and the moon on his left ordering him to hold his peace he could not obey no there was something in this truth he had got which was of nature herself equal in rank to sun or moon or whatsoever thing nature had made it would speak itself there so long as the almighty allowed it in spite of sun and moon and all koreish and all men and things it must do that and could do no other mahomet answered so and they say burst into tears burst into tears he felt that abu thaleb was good to him that the task he had got was no soft but a stern and great one  he went on speaking to who would listen to him publishing his doctrine among the pilgrims as they came to mecca gaining adherents in this place and that continual contradiction hatred open or secret danger attended him his powerful relations protected mahomet himself but by and by on his own advice all his adherents had to quit mecca and seek refuge in abyssinia over the sea the koreish grew ever angrier laid plots and swore oaths among them to put mahomet to death with their own hands abu thaleb was dead the good kadijah was dead mahomet is not solicitous of sympathy from us but his outlook at this time was one of the dismalest he had to hide in caverns escape in disguise fly hither and thither homeless in continual peril of his life more than once it seemed all over with him more than once it turned on a straw some riders horse taking fright or the like whether mahomet and his doctrine had not ended there and not been heard of at all but it was not to end so  in the thirteenth year of his mission finding his enemies all banded against him forty sworn men one out of every tribe waiting to take his life and no continuance possible at mecca for him any longer mahomet fled to the place then called yathreb where he had gained some adherents the place they now call medina or medinat al nabi the city of the prophet from that circumstance it lay some two hundred miles off through rocks and deserts not without great difficulty in such mood as we may fancy he escaped thither and found welcome the whole east dates its era from this flight hegira as they name it the year 1 of this hegira is 622 of our era the fiftythird of mahomets life he was now becoming an old man his friends sinking round him one by one his path desolate encompassed with danger unless he could find hope in his own heart the outward face of things was but hopeless for him it is so with all men in the like case hitherto mahomet had professed to publish his religion by the way of preaching and persuasion alone but now driven foully out of his native country since unjust men had not only given no ear to his earnest heavensmessage the deep cry of his heart but would not even let him live if he kept speaking itthe wild son of the desert resolved to defend himself like a man and arab if the koreish will have it so they shall have it tidings felt to be of infinite moment to them and all men they would not listen to these would trample them down by sheer violence steel and murder well let steel try it then ten years more this mahomet had all of fighting of breathless impetuous toil and struggle with what result we know  much has been said of mahomets propagating his religion by the sword it is no doubt far nobler what we have to boast of the christian religion that it propagated itself peaceably in the way of preaching and conviction yet withal if we take this for an argument of the truth or falsehood of a religion there is a radical mistake in it the sword indeed but where will you get your sword every new opinion at its starting is precisely in a minority of one in one mans head alone there it dwells as yet one man alone of the whole world believes it there is one man against all men that he take a sword and try to propagate with that will do little for him you must first get your sword on the whole a thing will propagate itself as it can we do not find of the christian religion either that it always disdained the sword when once it had got one charlemagnes conversion of the saxons was not by preaching i care little about the sword i will allow a thing to struggle for itself in this world with any sword or tongue or implement it has or can lay hold of we will let it preach and pamphleteer and fight and to the uttermost bestir itself and do beak and claws whatsoever is in it very sure that it will in the longrun conquer nothing which does not deserve to be conquered what is better than itself it cannot put away but only what is worse in this great duel nature herself is umpire and can do no wrong the thing which is deepestrooted in nature what we call truest that thing and not the other will be found growing at last  here however in reference to much that there is in mahomet and his success we are to remember what an umpire nature is what a greatness composure of depth and tolerance there is in her you take wheat to cast into the earths bosom your wheat may be mixed with chaff chopped straw barnsweepings dust and all imaginable rubbish no matter you cast it into the kind just earth she grows the wheatthe whole rubbish she silently absorbs shrouds it in says nothing of the rubbish the yellow wheat is growing there the good earth is silent about all the resthas silently turned all the rest to some benefit too and makes no complaint about it so everywhere in nature she is true and not a lie and yet so great and just and motherly in her truth she requires of a thing only that it be genuine of heart she will protect it if so will not if not so there is a soul of truth in all the things she ever gave harbor to alas is not this the history of all highest truth that comes or ever came into the world the body of them all is imperfection an element of light in darkness to us they have to come embodied in mere logic in some merely scientific theorem of the universe which cannot be complete which cannot but be found one day incomplete erroneous and so die and disappear the body of all truth dies and yet in all i say there is a soul which never dies which in new and evernobler embodiment lives immortal as man himself it is the way with nature the genuine essence of truth never dies that it be genuine a voice from the great deep of nature there is the point at natures judgmentseat what we call pure or impure is not with her the final question not how much chaff is in you but whether you have any wheat pure i might say to many a man yes you are pure pure enough but you are chaffinsincere hypothesis hearsay formality you never were in contact with the great heart of the universe at all you are properly neither pure nor impure you are nothing nature has no business with you  mahomets creed we called a kind of christianity and really if we look at the wild rapt earnestness with which it was believed and laid to heart i should say a better kind than that of those miserable syrian sects with their vain janglings about homoiousion and homoousion the head full of worthless noise the heart empty and dead the truth of it is embedded in portentous error and falsehood but the truth of it makes it be believed not the falsehood it succeeded by its truth a bastard kind of christianity but a living kind with a heartlife in it not dead chopping barren logic merely out of all that rubbish of arab idolatries argumentative theologies traditions subtleties rumors and hypotheses of greeks and jews with their idle wiredrawings this wild man of the desert with his wild sincere heart earnest as death and life with his great flashing natural eyesight had seen into the kernel of the matter idolatry is nothing these wooden idols of yours ye rub them with oil and wax and the flies stick on themthese are wood i tell you they can do nothing for you they are an impotent blasphemous presence a horror and abomination if ye knew them god alone is god alone has power he made us he can kill us and keep us alive allah akbar god is great understand that his will is the best for you that howsoever sore to flesh and blood you will find it the wisest best you are bound to take it so in this world and in the next you have no other thing that you can do  and now if the wild idolatrous men did believe this and with their fiery hearts lay hold of it to do it in what form soever it came to them i say it was well worthy of being believed in one form or the other i say it is still the one thing worthy of being believed by all men man does hereby become the highpriest of this temple of a world he is in harmony with the decrees of the author of this world cooperating with them not vainly withstanding them i know to this day no better definition of duty than that same all that is right includes itself in this of cooperating with the real tendency of the world you succeed by this the worlds tendency will succeed you are good and in the right course there homoiousion homoousion vain logical jangle then or before or at any time may jangle itself out and go whither and how it likes this is the thing it all struggles to mean if it would mean anything if it do not succeed in meaning this it means nothing not that abstractions logical propositions be correctly worded or incorrectly but that living concrete sons of adam do lay this to heart that is the important point islam devoured all these vain jangling sects and i think had right to do so it was a reality direct from the great heart of nature once more arab idolatries syrian formulas whatsoever was not equally real had to go up in flamemere dead fuel in various senses for this which was fire   it was during these wild warfarings and strugglings especially after the flight to mecca that mahomet dictated at intervals his sacred book which they name koran or reading thing to be read this is the work he and his disciples made so much of asking all the world is not that a miracle the mahometans regard their koran with a reverence which few christians pay even to their bible it is admitted every where as the standard of all law and all practice the thing to be gone upon in speculation and life the message sent direct out of heaven which this earth has to conform to and walk by the thing to be read their judges decide by it all moslem are bound to study it seek in it for the light of their life they have mosques where it is all read daily thirty relays of priests take it up in succession get through the whole each day there for twelve hundred years has the voice of this book at all moments kept sounding through the ears and the hearts of so many men we hear of mahometan doctors that had read it seventy thousand times  very curious if one sought for discrepancies of national taste here surely were the most eminent instance of that we also can read the koran our translation of it by sale is known to be a very fair one i must say it is as toilsome reading as i ever undertook a wearisome confused jumble crude incondite endless iterations longwindedness entanglement most crude inconditeinsupportable stupidity in short nothing but a sense of duty could carry any european through the koran we read in it as we might in the statepaper office unreadable masses of lumber that perhaps we may get some glimpses of a remarkable man it is true we have it under disadvantages the arabs see more method in it than we mahomets followers found the koran lying all in fractions as it had been written down at first promulgation much of it they say on shoulderblades of mutton flung pellmell into a chest and they published it without any discoverable order as to time or otherwisemerely trying as would seem and this not very strictly to put the longest chapters first the real beginning of it in that way lies almost at the end for the earliest portions were the shortest read in its historical sequence it perhaps would not be so bad much of it too they say is rhythmic a kind of wild chanting song in the original this may be a great point much perhaps has been lost in the translation here yet with every allowance one feels it difficult to see how any mortal ever could consider this koran as a book written in heaven too good for the earth as a wellwritten book or indeed as a book at all and not a bewildered rhapsody written so far as writing goes as badly as almost any book ever was so much for national discrepancies and the standard of taste  yet i should say it was not unintelligible how the arabs might so love it when once you get this confused coil of a koran fairly off your hands and have it behind you at a distance the essential type of it begins to disclose itself and in this there is a merit quite other than the literary one if a book come from the heart it will contrive to reach other hearts all art and authorcraft are of small amount to that one would say the primary character of the koran is this of its genuineness of its being a bonafide book prideaux i know and others have represented it as a mere bundle of juggleries chapter after chapter got up to excuse and varnish the authors successive sins forward his ambitions and quackeries but really it is time to dismiss all that i do not assert mahomets continual sincerity who is continually sincere but i confess i can make nothing of the critic in these times who would accuse him of deceit prepense of conscious deceit generally or perhaps at allstill more of living in a mere element of conscious deceit and writing this koran as a forger and juggler would have done every candid eye i think will read the koran far otherwise than so it is the confused ferment of a great rude human soul rude untutored that cannot even read but fervent earnest struggling vehemently to utter itself in words with a kind of breathless intensity he strives to utter himself the thoughts crowd on him pellmell for very multitude of things to say he can get nothing said the meaning that is in him shapes itself into no form of composition is stated in no sequence method or coherencethey are not shaped at all these thoughts of his flung out unshaped as they struggle and tumble there in their chaotic inarticulate state we said stupid yet natural stupidity is by no means the character of mahomets book it is natural uncultivation rather the man has not studied speaking in the haste and pressure of continual fighting has not time to mature himself into fit speech the panting breathless haste and vehemence of a man struggling in the thick of battle for life and salvation this is the mood he is in a headlong haste for very magnitude of meaning he cannot get himself articulated into words the successive utterances of a soul in that mood colored by the various vicissitudes of threeandtwenty years now well uttered now worse this is the koran  for we are to consider mahomet through these threeandtwenty years as the centre of a world wholly in conflict battles with the koreish and heathen quarrels among his own people backslidings of his own wild heart all this kept him in a perpetual whirl his soul knowing rest no more in wakeful nights as one may fancy the wild soul of the man tossing amid these vortices would hail any light of a decision for them as a veritable light from heaven any makingup of his mind so blessed indispensable for him there would seem the inspiration of a gabriel forger and juggler no no this great fiery heart seething simmering like a great furnace of thoughts was not a jugglers his life was a fact to him this gods universe an awful fact and reality he has faults enough the man was an uncultured semibarbarous son of nature much of the bedouin still clinging to him we must take him for that but for a wretched simulacrum a hungry impostor without eyes or heart practicing for a mess of pottage such blasphemous swindlery forgery of celestial documents continual hightreason against his maker and self we will not and cannot take him  sincerity in all senses seems to me the merit of the koran what had rendered it precious to the wild arab men it is after all the first and last merit in a book gives rise to merits of all kindsnay at bottom it alone can give rise to merit of any kind curiously through these incondite masses of tradition vituperation complaint ejaculation in the koran a vein of true direct insight of what we might almost call poetry is found straggling the body of the book is made up of mere tradition and as it were vehement enthusiastic extempore preaching he returns forever to the old stories of the prophets as they went current in the arab memory how prophet after prophet the prophet abraham the prophet hud the prophet moses christian and other real and fabulous prophets had come to this tribe and to that warning men of their sin and been received by them even as he mahomet waswhich is a great solace to him these things he repeats ten perhaps twenty times again and ever again with wearisome iteration has never done repeating them a brave samuel johnson in his forlorn garret might con over the biographies of authors in that way this is the great staple of the koran but curiously through all this comes ever and anon some glance as of the real thinker and seer he has actually an eye for the world this mahomet with a certain directness and rugged vigor he brings home still to our heart the thing his own heart has been opened to i make but little of his praises of allah which many praise they are borrowed i suppose mainly from the hebrew at least they are far surpassed there but the eye that flashes direct into the heart of things and sees the truth of them this is to me a highly interesting object great natures own gift which she bestows on all but which only one in the thousand does not cast sorrowfully away it is what i call sincerity of vision the test of a sincere heart  mahomet can work no miracles he often answers impatiently i can work no miracles i i am a public preacher appointed to preach this doctrine to all creatures yet the world as we can see had really from of old been all one great miracle to him look over the world says he is it not wonderful the work of allah wholly a sign to you if your eyes were open this earth god made it for you appointed paths in it you can live in it go to and fro on itthe clouds in the dry country of arabia to mahomet they are very wonderful great clouds he says born in the deep bosom of the upper immensity where do they come from they hang there the great black monsters pour down their raindeluges to revive a dead earth and grass springs and tall leafy palmtrees with their dateclusters hanging round is not that a sign your cattle tooallah made them serviceable dumb creatures they change the grass into milk you have your clothing from them very strange creatures they come ranking home at eveningtime and adds he and are a credit to you ships alsohe talks often about ships huge moving mountains they spread out their cloth wings go bounding through the water there heavens wind driving them anon they lie motionless god has withdrawn the wind they lie dead and cannot stir miracles cries he what miracle would you have are not you yourselves there god made you shaped you out of a little clay ye were small once a few years ago ye were not at all ye have beauty strength thoughts ye have compassion on one another old age comes on you and gray hairs your strength fades into feebleness ye sink down and again are not ye have compassion on one another this struck me much allah might have made you having no compassion on one anotherhow had it been then this is a great direct thought a glance at firsthand into the very fact of things rude vestiges of poetic genius of whatsoever is best and truest are visible in this man a strong untutored intellect eyesight heart a strong wild manmight have shaped himself into poet king priest any kind of hero  to his eyes it is forever clear that this world wholly is miraculous he sees what as we said once before all great thinkers the rude scandinavians themselves in one way or other have contrived to see that this so solidlooking material world is at bottom in very deed nothing is a visual and factual manifestation of gods power and presencea shadow hung out by him on the bosom of the void infinite nothing more the mountains he says these great rockmountains they shall dissipate themselves like clouds melt into the blue as clouds do and not be he figures the earth in the arab fashion sale tells us as an immense plain or flat plate of ground the mountains are set on that to steady it at the last day they shall disappear like clouds the whole earth shall go spinning whirl itself off into wreck and as dust and vapor vanish in the inane allah withdraws his hand from it and it ceases to be the universal empire of allah presence everywhere of an unspeakable power a splendor and a terror not to be named as the true force essence and reality in all things whatsoever was continually clear to this man what a modern talks of by the name forces of nature laws of nature and does not figure as a divine thing not even as one thing at all but as a set of things undivine enoughsalable curious good for propelling steamships with our sciences and cyclopaedias we are apt to forget the divineness in those laboratories of ours we ought not to forget it that once well forgotten i know not what else were worth remembering most sciences i think were then a very dead thing withered contentious emptya thistle in late autumn the best science without this is but as the dead timber it is not the growing tree and forestwhich gives evernew timber among other things man cannot know either unless he can worship in some way his knowledge is a pedantry and dead thistle otherwise  much has been said and written about the sensuality of mahomets religion more than was just the indulgences criminal to us which he permitted were not of his appointment he found them practiced unquestioned from immemorial time in arabia what he did was to curtail them restrict them not on one but on many sides his religion is not an easy one with rigorous fasts lavations strict complex formulas prayers five times a day and abstinence from wine it did not succeed by being an easy religion as if indeed any religion or cause holding of religion could succeed by that it is a calumny on men to say that they are roused to heroic action by ease hope of pleasure recompensesugarplums of any kind in this world or the next in the meanest mortal there lies something nobler the poor swearing soldier hired to be shot has his honor of a soldier different from drillregulations and the shilling a day it is not to taste sweet things but to do noble and true things and vindicate himself under gods heaven as a godmade man that the poorest son of adam dimly longs show him the way of doing that the dullest daydrudge kindles into a hero they wrong man greatly who say he is to be seduced by ease difficulty abnegation martyrdom death are the allurements that act on the heart of man kindle the inner genial life of him you have a flame that burns up all lower considerations not happiness but something higher one sees this even in the frivolous classes with their point of honor and the like not by flattering our appetites no by awakening the heroic that slumbers in every heart can any religion gain followers  mahomet himself after all that can be said about him was not a sensual man we shall err widely if we consider this man as a common voluptuary intent mainly on base enjoymentsnay on enjoyments of any kind his household was of the frugalest his common diet barleybread and water sometimes for months there was not a fire once lighted on his hearth they record with just pride that he would mend his own shoes patch his own cloak a poor hardtoiling illprovided man careless of what vulgar men toil for not a bad man i should say something better in him than hunger of any sortor these wild arab men fighting and jostling threeandtwenty years at his hand in close contact with him always would not have reverenced him so they were wild men bursting ever and anon into quarrel into all kinds of fierce sincerity without right worth and manhood no man could have commanded them they called him prophet you say why he stood there face to face with them bare not enshrined in any mystery visibly clouting his own cloak cobbling his own shoes fighting counselling ordering in the midst of them they must have seen what kind of a man he was let him be called what you like no emperor with his tiaras was obeyed as this man in a cloak of his own clouting during threeandtwenty years of rough actual trial i find something of a veritable hero necessary for that of itself  his last words are a prayer broken ejaculations of a heart struggling up in trembling hope towards its maker we cannot say that his religion made him worse it made him better good not bad generous things are recorded of him when he lost his daughter the thing he answers is in his own dialect every way sincere and yet equivalent to that of christians the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord he answered in like manner of seid his emancipated wellbeloved slave the second of the believers seid had fallen in the war of tabuc the first of mahomets fightings with the greeks mahomet said it was well seid had done his masters work seid had now gone to his master it was all well with seid yet seids daughter found him weeping over the bodythe old grayhaired man melting in tears what do i see said sheyou see a friend weeping over his friendhe went out for the last time into the mosque two days before his death asked if he had injured any man let his own back bear the stripes if he owed any man a voice answered yes me three drachms borrowed on such an occasion mahomet ordered them to be paid better be in shame now said he than at the day of judgmentyou remember kadijah and the no by allah traits of that kind show us the genuine man the brother of us all brought visible through twelve centuriesthe veritable son of our common mother  withal i like mahomet for his total freedom from cant he is a rough selfhelping son of the wilderness does not pretend to be what he is not there is no ostentatious pride in him but neither does he go much upon humility he is there as he can be in cloak and shoes of his own clouting speaks plainly to all manner of persian kings greek emperors what it is they are bound to do knows well enough about himself the respect due unto thee in a lifeanddeath war with bedouins cruel things could not fail but neither are acts of mercy of noble natural pity and generosity wanting mahomet makes no apology for the one no boast of the other they were each the free dictate of his heart each called for there and then not a mealymouthed man a candid ferocity if the case call for it is in him he does not mince matters the war of tabuc is a thing he often speaks of his men refused many of them to march on that occasion pleaded the heat of the weather the harvest and so forth he can never forget that your harvest it lasts for a day what will become of your harvest through all eternity hot weather yes it was hot but hell will be hotter sometimes a rough sarcasm turns up he says to the unbelievers ye shall have the just measure of your deeds at that great day they will be weighed out to you ye shall not have short weighteverywhere he fixes the matter in his eye he sees it his heart now and then is as if struck dumb by the greatness of it assuredly he says that word in the koran is written down sometimes as a sentence by itself assuredly  no dilettantism in this mahomet it is a business of reprobation and salvation with him of time and eternity he is in deadly earnest about it dilettantism hypothesis speculation a kind of amateursearch for truth toying and coquetting with truth this is the sorest sin the root of all other imaginable sins it consists in the heart and soul of the man never having been open to truthliving in a vain show such a man not only utters and produces falsehoods but is himself a falsehood the rational moral principle spark of the divinity is sunk deep in him in quiet paralysis of lifedeath the very falsehoods of mahomet are truer than the truths of such a man he is the insincere man smoothpolished respectable in some times and places inoffensive says nothing harsh to anybody most cleanlyjust as carbonic acid is which is death and poison  we will not praise mahomets moral precepts as always of the superfinest sort yet it can be said that there is always a tendency to good in them that they are the true dictates of a heart aiming towards what is just and true the sublime forgiveness of christianity turning of the other cheek when the one has been smitten is not here you are to revenge yourself but it is to be in measure not overmuch or beyond justice on the other hand islam like any great faith and insight into the essence of man is a perfect equalizer of men the soul of one believer outweighs all earthly kingships all men according to islam too are equal mahomet insists not on the propriety of giving alms but on the necessity of it he marks down by law how much you are to give and it is at your peril if you neglect the tenth part of a mans annual income whatever that may be is the property of the poor of those that are afflicted and need help good all this the natural voice of humanity of pity and equity dwelling in the heart of this wild son of nature speaks so  mahomets paradise is sensual his hell sensual true in the one and the other there is enough that shocks all spiritual feeling in us but we are to recollect that the arabs already had it so that mahomet in whatever he changed of it softened and diminished all this the worst sensualities too are the work of doctors followers of his not his work in the koran there is really very little said about the joys of paradise they are intimated rather than insisted on nor is it forgotten that the highest joys even there shall be spiritual the pure presence of the highest this shall infinitely transcend all other joys he says your salutation shall be peace salam have peacethe thing that all rational souls long for and seek vainly here below as the one blessing ye shall sit on seats facing one another all grudges shall be taken away out of your hearts all grudges ye shall love one another freely for each of you in the eyes of his brothers there will be heaven enough  in reference to this of the sensual paradise and mahomets sensuality the sorest chapter of all for us there were many things to be said which it is not convenient to enter upon here two remarks only i shall make and therewith leave it to your candor the first is furnished me by goethe it is a casual hint of his which seems well worth taking note of in one of his delineations in meisters travels it is the hero comes upon a society of men with very strange ways one of which was this we require says the master that each of our people shall restrict himself in one direction shall go right against his desire in one matter and make himself do the thing he does not wish should we allow him the greater latitude on all other sides there seems to me a great justness in this enjoying things which are pleasant that is not the evil it is the reducing of our moral self to slavery by them that is let a man assert withal that he is king over his habitudes that he could and would shake them off on cause shown this is an excellent law the month ramadhan for the moslem much in mahomets religion much in his own life bears in that direction if not by forethought or clear purpose of moral improvement on his part then by a certain healthy manful instinct which is as good  but there is another thing to be said about the mahometan heaven and hell this namely that however gross and material they may be they are an emblem of an everlasting truth not always so well remembered elsewhere that gross sensual paradise of his that horrible flaming hell the great enormous day of judgment he perpetually insists on what is all this but a rude shadow in the rude bedouin imagination of that grand spiritual fact and beginning of facts which it is ill for us too if we do not all know and feel the infinite nature of duty that mans actions here are of infinite moment to him and never die or end at all that man with his little life reaches upwards high as heaven downwards low as hell and in his threescore years of time holds an eternity fearfully and wonderfully hidden all this had burnt itself as in flamecharacters into the wild arab soul as in flame and lightning it stands written there awful unspeakable ever present to him with bursting earnestness with a fierce savage sincerity halfarticulating not able to articulate he strives to speak it bodies it forth in that heaven and that hell bodied forth in what way you will it is the first of all truths it is venerable under all embodiments what is the chief end of man here below mahomet has answered this question in a way that might put some of us to shame he does not like a bentham a paley take right and wrong and calculate the profit and loss ultimate pleasure of the one and of the other and summing all up by addition and subtraction into a net result ask you whether on the whole the right does not preponderate considerably no it is not better to do the one than the other the one is to the other as life is to deathas heaven is to hell the one must in nowise be done the other in nowise left undone you shall not measure them they are incommensurable the one is death eternal to a man the other is life eternal benthamee utility virtue by profit and loss reducing this godsworld to a dead brute steamengine the infinite celestial soul of man to a kind of haybalance for weighing hay and thistles on pleasures and pains onif you ask me which gives mahomet or they the beggarlier and falser view of man and his destinies in this universe i will answer it is not mahomet  on the whole we will repeat that this religion of mahomets is a kind of christianity has a genuine element of what is spiritually highest looking through it not to be hidden by all its imperfections the scandinavian god wish the god of all rude menthis has been enlarged into a heaven by mahomet but a heaven symbolical of sacred duty and to be earned by faith and welldoing by valiant action and a divine patience which is still more valiant it is scandinavian paganism and a truly celestial element superadded to that call it not false look not at the falsehood of it look at the truth of it for these twelve centuries it has been the religion and lifeguidance of the fifth part of the whole kindred of mankind above all things it has been a religion heartily believed these arabs believe their religion and try to live by it no christians since the early ages or only perhaps the english puritans in modern times have ever stood by their faith as the moslem do by theirsbelieving it wholly fronting time with it and eternity with it this night the watchman on the streets of cairo when he cries who goes will hear from

world vacant or almost vacant of scientific forms if men in their loving wonder are to fancy their fellowman either a god or one speaking with the voice of a god divinity and prophet are past we are now to see our hero in the less ambitious but also less questionable character of poet a character which does not pass the poet is a heroic figure belonging to all ages whom all ages possess when once he is produced whom the newest age as the oldest may produceand will produce always when nature pleases let nature send a herosoul in no age is it other than possible that he may be shaped into a poet  hero prophet poetmany different names in different times and places do we give to great men according to varieties we note in them according to the sphere in which they have displayed themselves we might give many more names on this same principle i will remark again however as a fact not unimportant to be understood that the different sphere constitutes the grand origin of such distinction that the hero can be poet prophet king priest or what you will according to the kind of world he finds himself born into i confess i have no notion of a truly great man that could not be all sorts of men the poet who could merely sit on a chair and compose stanzas would never make a stanza worth much he could not sing the heroic warrior unless he himself were at least a heroic warrior too i fancy there is in him the politician the thinker legislator philosopherin one or the other degree he could have been he is all these so too i cannot understand how a mirabeau with that great glowing heart with the fire that was in it with the bursting tears that were in it could not have written verses tragedies poems and touched all hearts in that way had his course of life and education led him thitherward the grand fundamental character is that of great man that the man be great napoleon has words in him which are like austerlitz battles louis fourteenths marshals are a kind of poetical men withal the things turenne says are full of sagacity and geniality like sayings of samuel johnson the great heart the clear deepseeing eye there it lies no man whatever in what province soever can prosper at all without these petrarch and boccaccio did diplomatic messages it seems quite well one can easily believe it they had done things a little harder than these burns a gifted songwriter might have made a still better mirabeau shakspeareone knows not what he could not have made in the supreme degree  true there are aptitudes of nature too nature does not make all great men more than all other men in the selfsame mould varieties of aptitude doubtless but infinitely more of circumstance and far oftenest it is the latter only that are looked to but it is as with common men in the learning of trades you take any man as yet a vague capability of a man who could be any kind of craftsman and make him into a smith a carpenter a mason he is then and thenceforth that and nothing else and if as addison complains you sometimes see a streetporter staggering under his load on spindleshanks and near at hand a tailor with the frame of a samson handling a bit of cloth and small whitechapel needleit cannot be considered that aptitude of nature alone has been consulted here eitherthe great man also to what shall he be bound apprentice given your hero is he to become conqueror king philosopher poet it is an inexplicably complex controversialcalculation between the world and him he will read the world and its laws the world with its laws will be there to be read what the world on this matter shall permit and bid is as we said the most important fact about the world   poet and prophet differ greatly in our loose modern notions of them in some old languages again the titles are synonymous vates means both prophet and poet and indeed at all times prophet and poet well understood have much kindred of meaning fundamentally indeed they are still the same in this most important respect especially that they have penetrated both of them into the sacred mystery of the universe what goethe calls the open secret which is the great secret asks onethe open secretopen to all seen by almost none that divine mystery which lies everywhere in all beings the divine idea of the world that which lies at the bottom of appearance as fichte styles it of which all appearance from the starry sky to the grass of the field but especially the appearance of man and his work is but the vesture the embodiment that renders it visible this divine mystery is in all times and in all places veritably is in most times and places it is greatly overlooked and the universe definable always in one or the other dialect as the realized thought of god is considered a trivial inert commonplace matteras if says the satirist it were a dead thing which some upholsterer had put together it could do no good at present to speak much about this but it is a pity for every one of us if we do not know it live ever in the knowledge of it really a most mournful pitya failure to live at all if we live otherwise  but now i say whoever may forget this divine mystery the vates whether prophet or poet has penetrated into it is a man sent hither to make it more impressively known to us that always is his message he is to reveal that to usthat sacred mystery which he more than others lives ever present with while others forget it he knows iti might say he has been driven to know it without consent asked of him he finds himself living in it bound to live in it once more here is no hearsay but a direct insight and belief this man too could not help being a sincere man whosoever may live in the shows of things it is for him a necessity of nature to live in the very fact of things a man once more in earnest with the universe though all others were but toying with it he is a vates first of all in virtue of being sincere so far poet and prophet participators in the open secret are one  with respect to their distinction again the vates prophet we might say has seized that sacred mystery rather on the moral side as good and evil duty and prohibition the vates poet on what the germans call the aesthetic side as beautiful and the like the one we may call a revealer of what we are to do the other of what we are to love but indeed these two provinces run into one another and cannot be disjoined the prophet too has his eye on what we are to love how else shall he know what it is we are to do the highest voice ever heard on this earth said withal consider the lilies of the field they toil not neither do they spin yet solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these a glance that into the deepest deep of beauty the lilies of the fielddressed finer than earthly princes springing up there in the humble furrowfield a beautiful eye looking out on you from the great inner sea of beauty how could the rude earth make these if her essence rugged as she looks and is were not inwardly beauty in this point of view too a saying of goethes which has staggered several may have meaning the beautiful he intimates is higher than the good the beautiful includes in it the good the true beautiful which however i have said somewhere differs from the false as heaven does from vauxhall so much for the distinction and identity of poet and prophet  in ancient and also in modern periods we find a few poets who are accounted perfect whom it were a kind of treason to find fault with this is noteworthy this is right yet in strictness it is only an illusion at bottom clearly enough there is no perfect poet a vein of poetry exists in the hearts of all men no man is made altogether of poetry we are all poets when we read a poem well the imagination that shudders at the hell of dante is not that the same faculty weaker in degree as dantes own no one but shakspeare can embody out of saxo grammaticus the story of hamlet as shakspeare did but every one models some kind of story out of it every one embodies it better or worse we need not spend time in defining where there is no specific difference as between round and square all definition must be more or less arbitrary a man that has so much more of the poetic element developed in him as to have become noticeable will be called poet by his neighbors worldpoets too those whom we are to take for perfect poets are settled by critics in the same way one who rises so far above the general level of poets will to such and such critics seem a universal poet as he ought to do and yet it is and must be an arbitrary distinction all poets all men have some touches of the universal no man is wholly made of that most poets are very soon forgotten but not the noblest shakspeare or homer of them can be remembered forevera day comes when he too is not  nevertheless you will say there must be a difference between true poetry and true speech not poetical what is the difference on this point many things have been written especially by late german critics some of which are not very intelligible at first they say for example that the poet has an infinitude in him communicates an unendlichkeit a certain character of infinitude to whatsoever he delineates this though not very precise yet on so vague a matter is worth remembering if well meditated some meaning will gradually be found in it for my own part i find considerable meaning in the old vulgar distinction of poetry being metrical having music in it being a song truly if pressed to give a definition one might say this as soon as anything else if your delineation be authentically musical musical not in word only but in heart and substance in all the thoughts and utterances of it in the whole conception of it then it will be poetical if not notmusical how much lies in that a musical thought is one spoken by a mind that has penetrated into the inmost heart of the thing detected the inmost mystery of it namely the melody that lies hidden in it the inward harmony of coherence which is its soul whereby it exists and has a right to be here in this world all inmost things we may say are melodious naturally utter themselves in song the meaning of song goes deep who is there that in logical words can express the effect music has on us a kind of inarticulate unfathomable speech which leads us to the edge of the infinite and lets us for moments gaze into that  nay all speech even the commonest speech has something of song in it not a parish in the world but has its parishaccentthe rhythm or tune to which the people there sing what they have to say accent is a kind of chanting all men have accent of their ownthough they only notice that of others observe too how all passionate language does of itself become musicalwith a finer music than the mere accent the speech of a man even in zealous anger becomes a chant a song all deep things are song it seems somehow the very central essence of us song as if all the rest were but wrappages and hulls the primal element of us of us and of all things the greeks fabled of sphereharmonies it was the feeling they had of the inner structure of nature that the soul of all her voices and utterances was perfect music poetry therefore we will call musical thought the poet is he who thinks in that manner at bottom it turns still on power of intellect it is a mans sincerity and depth of vision that makes him a poet see deep enough and you see musically the heart of nature being everywhere music if you can only reach it  the vates poet with his melodious apocalypse of nature seems to hold a poor rank among us in comparison with the vates prophet his function and our esteem of him for his function alike slight the hero taken as divinity the hero taken as prophet then next the hero taken only as poet does it not look as if our estimate of the great man epoch after epoch were continually diminishing we take him first for a god then for one godinspired and now in the next stage of it his most miraculous word gains from us only the recognition that he is a poet beautiful versemaker man of genius or such likeit looks so but i persuade myself that intrinsically it is not so if we consider well it will perhaps appear that in man still there is the same altogether peculiar admiration for the heroic gift by what name soever called that there at any time was  i should say if we do not now reckon a great man literally divine it is that our notions of god of the supreme unattainable fountain of splendor wisdom and heroism are ever rising higher not altogether that our reverence for these qualities as manifested in our like is getting lower this is worth taking thought of sceptical dilettantism the curse of these ages a curse which will not last forever does indeed in this the highest province of human things as in all provinces make sad work and our reverence for great men all crippled blinded paralytic as it is comes out in poor plight hardly recognizable men worship the shows of great men the most disbelieve that there is any reality of great men to worship the dreariest fatalest faith believing which one would literally despair of human things nevertheless look for example at napoleon a corsican lieutenant of artillery that is the show of him yet is he not obeyed worshipped after his sort as all the tiaraed and diademed of the world put together could not be high duchesses and ostlers of inns gather round the scottish rustic burnsa strange feeling dwelling in each that they never heard a man like this that on the whole this is the man in the secret heart of these people it still dimly reveals itself though there is no accredited way of uttering it at present that this rustic with his black brows and flashing suneyes and strange words moving laughter and tears is of a dignity far beyond all others incommensurable with all others do not we feel it so but now were dilettantism scepticism triviality and all that sorrowful brood cast out of usas by gods blessing they shall one day be were faith in the shows of things entirely swept out replaced by clear faith in the things so that a man acted on the impulse of that only and counted the other nonextant what a new livelier feeling towards this burns were it  nay here in these ages such as they are have we not two mere poets if not deified yet we may say beatified shakspeare and dante are saints of poetry really if we will think of it canonized so that it is impiety to meddle with them the unguided instinct of the world working across all these perverse impediments has arrived at such result dante and shakspeare are a peculiar two they dwell apart in a kind of royal solitude none equal none second to them in the general feeling of the world a certain transcendentalism a glory as of complete perfection invests these two they are canonized though no pope or cardinals took hand in doing it such in spite of every perverting influence in the most unheroic times is still our indestructible reverence for heroismwe will look a little at these two the poet dante and the poet shakspeare what little it is permitted us to say here of the hero as poet will most fitly arrange itself in that fashion   many volumes have been written by way of commentary on dante and his book yet on the whole with no great result his biography is as it were irrecoverably lost for us an unimportant wandering sorrowstricken man not much note was taken of him while he lived and the most of that has vanished in the long space that now intervenes it is five centuries since he ceased writing and living here after all commentaries the book itself is mainly what we know of him the bookand one might add that portrait commonly attributed to giotto which looking on it you cannot help inclining to think genuine whoever did it to me it is a most touching face perhaps of all faces that i know the most so lonely there painted as on vacancy with the simple laurel wound round it the deathless sorrow and pain the known victory which is also deathlesssignificant of the whole history of dante i think it is the mournfulest face that ever was painted from reality an altogether tragic heartaffecting face there is in it as foundation of it the softness tenderness gentle affection as of a child but all this is as if congealed into sharp contradiction into abnegation isolation proud hopeless pain a soft ethereal soul looking out so stern implacable grimtrenchant as from imprisonment of thickribbed ice withal it is a silent pain too a silent scornful one the lip is curled in a kind of godlike disdain of the thing that is eating out his heartas if it were withal a mean insignificant thing as if he whom it had power to torture and strangle were greater than it the face of one wholly in protest and lifelong unsurrendering battle against the world affection all converted into indignation an implacable indignation slow equable silent like that of a god the eye too it looks out as in a kind of surprise a kind of inquiry why the world was of such a sort this is dante so he looks this voice of ten silent centuries and sings us his mystic unfathomable song  the little that we know of dantes life corresponds well enough with this portrait and this book he was born at florence in the upper class of society in the year 1265 his education was the best then going much schooldivinity aristotelean logic some latin classicsno inconsiderable insight into certain provinces of things and dante with his earnest intelligent nature we need not doubt learned better than most all that was learnable he has a clear cultivated understanding and of great subtlety this best fruit of education he had contrived to realize from these scholastics he knows accurately and well what lies close to him but in such a time without printed books or free intercourse he could not know well what was distant the small clear light most luminous for what is near breaks itself into singular chiaroscuro striking on what is far off this was dantes learning from the schools in life he had gone through the usual destinies been twice out campaigning as a soldier for the florentine state been on embassy had in his thirtyfifth year by natural gradation of talent and service become one of the chief magistrates of florence he had met in boyhood a certain beatrice portinari a beautiful little girl of his own age and rank and grown up thenceforth in partial sight of her in some distant intercourse with her all readers know his graceful affecting account of this and then of their being parted of her being wedded to another and of her death soon after she makes a great figure in dantes poem seems to have made a great figure in his life of all beings it might seem as if she held apart from him far apart at last in the dim eternity were the only one he had ever with his whole strength of affection loved she died dante himself was wedded but it seems not happily far from happily i fancy the rigorous earnest man with his keen excitabilities was not altogether easy to make happy  we will not complain of dantes miseries had all gone right with him as he wished it he might have been prior podesta or whatsoever they call it of florence well accepted among neighborsand the world had wanted one of the most notable words ever spoken or sung florence would have had another prosperous lord mayor and the ten dumb centuries continued voiceless and the ten other listening centuries for there will be ten of them and more had no divina commedia to hear we will complain of nothing a nobler destiny was appointed for this dante and he struggling like a man led towards death and crucifixion could not help fulfilling it give him the choice of his happiness he knew not more than we do what was really happy what was really miserable  in dantes priorship the guelfghibelline bianchineri or some other confused disturbances rose to such a height that dante whose party had seemed the stronger was with his friends cast unexpectedly forth into banishment doomed thenceforth to a life of woe and wandering his property was all confiscated and more he had the fiercest feeling that it was entirely unjust nefarious in the sight of god and man he tried what was in him to get reinstated tried even by warlike surprisal with arms in his hand but it would not do bad only had become worse there is a record i believe still extant in the florence archives dooming this dante wheresoever caught to be burnt alive burnt alive so it stands they say a very curious civic document another curious document some considerable number of years later is a letter of dantes to the florentine magistrates written in answer to a milder proposal of theirs that he should return on condition of apologizing and paying a fine he answers with fixed stern pride if i cannot return without calling myself guilty i will never return nunquam revertar  for dante there was now no home in this world he wandered from patron to patron from place to place proving in his own bitter words how hard is the path come e duro calle the wretched are not cheerful company dante poor and banished with his proud earnest nature with his moody humors was not a man to conciliate men petrarch reports of him that being at can della scalas court and blamed one day for his gloom and taciturnity he answered in no courtierlike way della scala stood among his courtiers with mimes and buffoons nebulones ac histriones making him heartily merry when turning to dante he said is it not strange now that this poor fool should make himself so entertaining while you a wise man sit there day after day and have nothing to amuse us with at all dante answered bitterly no not strange your highness is to recollect the proverb like to likegiven the amuser the amusee must also be given such a man with his proud silent ways with his sarcasms and sorrows was not made to succeed at court by degrees it came to be evident to him that he had no longer any restingplace or hope of benefit in this earth the earthly world had cast him forth to wander wander no living heart to love him now for his sore miseries there was no solace here  the deeper naturally would the eternal world impress itself on him that awful reality over which after all this timeworld with its florences and banishments only flutters as an unreal shadow florence thou shalt never see but hell and purgatory and heaven thou shalt surely see what is florence can della scala and the world and life altogether eternity thither of a truth not elsewhither art thou and all things bound the great soul of dante homeless on earth made its home more and more in that awful other world naturally his thoughts brooded on that as on the one fact important for him bodied or bodiless it is the one fact important for all menbut to dante in that age it was bodied in fixed certainty of scientific shape he no more doubted of that malebolge pool that it all lay there with its gloomy circles with its alti guai and that he himself should see it than we doubt that we should see constantinople if we went thither dantes heart long filled with this brooding over it in speechless thought and awe bursts forth at length into mystic unfathomable song and this his divine comedy the most remarkable of all modern books is the result  it must have been a great solacement to dante and was as we can see a proud thought for him at times that he here in exile could do this work that no florence nor no man or men could hinder him from doing it or even much help him in doing it he knew too partly that it was great the greatest a man could do if thou follow thy star se tu segui tua stellaso could the hero in his forsakenness in his extreme need still say to himself follow thou thy star thou shalt not fail of a glorious haven the labor of writing we find and indeed could know otherwise was great and painful for him he says this book which has made me lean for many years ah yes it was won all of it with pain and sore toilnot in sport but in grim earnest his book as indeed most good books are has been written in many senses with his hearts blood it is his whole history this book he died after finishing it not yet very old at the age of fiftysixbrokenhearted rather as is said he lies buried in his deathcity ravenna hic claudor dantes patriis extorris ab oris the florentines begged back his body in a century after the ravenna people would not give it here am i dante laid shut out from my native shores  i said dantes poem was a song it is tieck who calls it a mystic unfathomable song and such is literally the character of it coleridge remarks very pertinently somewhere that wherever you find a sentence musically worded of true rhythm and melody in the words there is something deep and good in the meaning too for body and soul word and idea go strangely together here as everywhere song we said before it was the heroic of speech all old poems homers and the rest are authentically songs i would say in strictness that all right poems are that whatsoever is not sung is properly no poem but a piece of prose cramped into jingling linesto the great injury of the grammar to the great grief of the reader for most part what we wants to get at is the thought the man had if he had any why should he twist it into jingle if he could speak it out plainly it is only when the heart of him is rapt into true passion of melody and the very tones of him according to coleridges remark become musical by the greatness depth and music of his thoughts that we can give him right to rhyme and sing that we call him a poet and listen to him as the heroic of speakerswhose speech is song pretenders to this are many and to an earnest reader i doubt it is for most part a very melancholy not to say an insupportable business that of reading rhyme rhyme that had no inward necessity to be rhymedit ought to have told us plainly without any jingle what it was aiming at i would advise all men who can speak their thought not to sing it to understand that in a serious time among serious men there is no vocation in them for singing it precisely as we love the true song and are charmed by it as by something divine so shall we hate the false song and account it a mere wooden noise a thing hollow superfluous altogether an insincere and offensive thing  i give dante my highest praise when i say of his divine comedy that it is in all senses genuinely a song in the very sound of it there is a canto fermo it proceeds as by a chant the language his simple terza rima doubtless helped him in this one reads along naturally with a sort of lilt but i add that it could not be otherwise for the essence and material of the work are themselves rhythmic its depth and rapt passion and sincerity makes it musicalgo deep enough there is music everywhere a true inward symmetry what one calls an architectural harmony reigns in it proportionates it all architectural which also partakes of the character of music the three kingdoms inferno purgatorio paradiso look out on one another like compartments of a great edifice a great supernatural worldcathedral piled up there stern solemn awful dantes world of souls it is at bottom the sincerest of all poems sincerity here too we find to be the measure of worth it came deep out of the authors heart of hearts and it goes deep and through long generations into ours the people of verona when they saw him on the streets used to say eccovi l uom ch e stato all inferno see there is the man that was in hell ah yes he had been in hellin hell enough in long severe sorrow and struggle as the like of him is pretty sure to have been commedias that come out divine are not accomplished otherwise thought true labor of any kind highest virtue itself is it not the daughter of pain born as out of the black whirlwindtrue effort in fact as of a captive struggling to free himself that is thought in all ways we are to become perfect through sufferingbut as i say no work known to me is so elaborated as this of dantes it has all been as if molten in the hottest furnace of his soul it had made him lean for many years not the general whole only every compartment of it is worked out with intense earnestness into truth into clear visuality each answers to the other each fits in its place like a marble stone accurately hewn and polished it is the soul of dante and in this the soul of the middle ages rendered forever rhythmically visible there no light task a right intense one but a task which is done  perhaps one would say intensity with the much that depends on it is the prevailing character of dantes genius dante does not come before us as a large catholic mind rather as a narrow and even sectarian mind it is partly the fruit of his age and position but partly too of his own nature his greatness has in all senses concentred itself into fiery emphasis and depth he is worldgreat not because he is worldwide but because he is worlddeep through all objects he pierces as it were down into the heart of being i know nothing so intense as dante consider for example to begin with the outermost development of his intensity consider how he paints he has a great power of vision seizes the very type of a thing presents that and nothing more you remember that first view he gets of the hall of dite red pinnacle redhot cone of iron glowing through the dim immensity of gloomso vivid so distinct visible at once and forever it is as an emblem of the whole genius of dante there is a brevity an abrupt precision in him tacitus is not briefer more condensed and then in dante it seems a natural condensation spontaneous to the man one smiting word and then there is silence nothing more said his silence is more eloquent than words it is strange with what a sharp decisive grace he snatches the true likeness of a matter cuts into the matter as with a pen of fire plutus the blustering giant collapses at virgils rebuke it is as the sails sink the mast being suddenly broken or that poor brunetto latini with the cotto aspetto face baked parched brown and lean and the fiery snow that falls on them there a fiery snow without wind slow deliberate neverending or the lids of those tombs square sarcophaguses in that silent dimburning hall each with its soul in torment the lids laid open there they are to be shut at the day of judgment through eternity and how farinata rises and how cavalcante fallsat hearing of his son and the past tense fue the very movements in dante have something brief swift decisive almost military it is of the inmost essence of his genius this sort of painting the fiery swift italian nature of the man so silent passionate with its quick abrupt movements its silent pale rages speaks itself in these things  for though this of painting is one of the outermost developments of a man it comes like all else from the essential faculty of him it is physiognomical of the whole man find a man whose words paint you a likeness you have found a man worth something mark his manner of doing it as very characteristic of him in the first place he could not have discerned the object at all or seen the vital type of it unless he had what we may call sympathized with ithad sympathy in him to bestow on objects he must have been sincere about it too sincere and sympathetic a man without worth cannot give you the likeness of any object he dwells in vague outwardness fallacy and trivial hearsay about all objects and indeed may we not say that intellect altogether expresses itself in this power of discerning what an object is whatsoever of faculty a mans mind may have will come out here is it even of business a matter to be done the gifted man is he who sees the essential point and leaves all the rest aside as surplusage it is his faculty too the man of businesss faculty that he discern the true likeness not the false superficial one of the thing he has got to work in and how much of morality is in the kind of insight we get of anything the eye seeing in all things what it brought with it the faculty of seeing to the mean eye all things are trivial as certainly as to the jaundiced they are yellow raphael the painters tell us is the best of all portraitpainters withal no most gifted eye can exhaust the significance of any object in the commonest human face there lies more than raphael will take away with him  dantes painting is not graphic only brief true and of a vividness as of fire in dark night taken on the wider scale it is every way noble and the outcome of a great soul francesca and her lover what qualities in that a thing woven as out of rainbows on a ground of eternal black a small flutevoice of infinite wail speaks there into our very heart of hearts a touch of womanhood in it too della bella persona che mi fu tolta and how even in the pit of woe it is a solace that he will never part from her saddest tragedy in these alti guai and the racking winds in that aer bruno whirl them away again to wail foreverstrange to think dante was the friend of this poor francescas father francesca herself may have sat upon the poets knee as a bright innocent little child infinite pity yet also infinite rigor of law it is so nature is made it is so dante discerned that she was made what a paltry notion is that of his divine comedys being a poor splenetic impotent terrestrial libel putting those into hell whom he could not be avenged upon on earth i suppose if ever pity tender as a mothers was in the heart of any man it was in dantes but a man who does not know rigor cannot pity either his very pity will be cowardly egoisticsentimentality or little better i know not in the world an affection equal to that of dante it is a tenderness a trembling longing pitying love like the wail of aeolian harps soft soft like a childs young heartand then that stern soresaddened heart these longings of his towards his beatrice their meeting together in the paradiso his gazing in her pure transfigured eyes her that had been purified by death so long separated from him so farone likens it to the song of angels it is among the purest utterances of affection perhaps the very purest that ever came out of a human soul  for the intense dante is intense in all things he has got into the essence of all his intellectual insight as painter on occasion too as reasoner is but the result of all other sorts of intensity morally great above all we must call him it is the beginning of all his scorn his grief are as transcendent as his loveas indeed what are they but the inverse or converse of his love a dio spiacenti ed a nemici sui hateful to god and to the enemies of god lofty scorn unappeasable silent reprobation and aversion non ragionam di lor we will not speak of them look only and pass or think of this they have not the hope to die non han speranza di morte one day it had risen sternly benign on the scathed heart of dante that he wretched neverresting worn as he was would full surely die that destiny itself could not doom him not to die such words are in this man for rigor earnestness and depth he is not to be paralleled in the modern world to seek his parallel we must go into the hebrew bible and live with the antique prophets there  i do not agree with much modern criticism in greatly preferring the inferno to the two other parts of the divine commedia such preference belongs i imagine to our general byronism of taste and is like to be a transient feeling the purgatorio and paradiso especially the former one would almost say is even more excellent than it it is a noble thing that purgatorio mountain of purification an emblem of the noblest conception of that age if sin is so fatal and hell is and must be so rigorous awful yet in repentance too is man purified repentance is the grand christian act it is beautiful how dante works it out the tremolar dell onde that trembling of the oceanwaves under the first pure gleam of morning dawning afar on the wandering two is as the type of an altered mood hope has now dawned neverdying hope if in company still with heavy sorrow the obscure sojourn of demons and reprobate is underfoot a soft breathing of penitence mounts higher and higher to the throne of mercy itself pray for me the denizens of that mount of pain all say to him tell my giovanna to pray for me my daughter giovanna i think her mother loves me no more they toil painfully up by that winding steep bent down like corbels of a building some of themcrushed together so for the sin of pride yet nevertheless in years in ages and aeons they shall have reached the top which is heavens gate and by mercy shall have been admitted in the joy too of all when one has prevailed the whole mountain shakes with joy and a psalm of praise rises when one soul has perfected repentance and got its sin and misery left behind i call all this a noble embodiment of a true noble thought  but indeed the three compartments mutually support one another are indispensable to one another the paradiso a kind of inarticulate music to me is the redeeming side of the inferno the inferno without it were untrue all three make up the true unseen world as figured in the christianity of the middle ages a thing forever memorable forever true in the essence of it to all men it was perhaps delineated in no human soul with such depth of veracity as in this of dantes a man sent to sing it to keep it long memorable very notable with what brief simplicity he passes out of the everyday reality into the invisible one and in the second or third stanza we find ourselves in the world of spirits and dwell there as among things palpable indubitable to dante they were so the real world as it is called and its facts was but the threshold to an infinitely higher fact of a world at bottom the one was as preternatural as the other has not each man a soul he will not only be a spirit but is one to the earnest dante it is all one visible fact he believes it sees it is the poet of it in virtue of that sincerity i say again is the saving merit now as always  dantes hell purgatory paradise are a symbol withal an emblematic representation of his belief about this universesome critic in a future age like those scandinavian ones the other day who has ceased altogether to think as dante did may find this too all an allegory perhaps an idle allegory it is a sublime embodiment or sublimest of the soul of christianity it expresses as in huge worldwide architectural emblems how the christian dante felt good and evil to be the two polar elements of this creation on which it all turns that these two differ not by preferability of one to the other but by incompatibility absolute and infinite that the one is excellent and high as light and heaven the other hideous black as gehenna and the pit of hell everlasting justice yet with penitence with everlasting pityall christianism as dante and the middle ages had it is emblemed here emblemed and yet as i urged the other day with what entire truth of purpose how unconscious of any embleming hell purgatory paradise these things were not fashioned as emblems was there in our modern european mind any thought at all of their being emblems were they not indubitable awful facts the whole heart of man taking them for practically true all nature everywhere confirming them so is it always in these things men do not believe an allegory the future critic whatever his new thought may be who considers this of dante to have been all got up as an allegory will commit one sore mistakepaganism we recognized as a veracious expression of the earnest awestruck feeling of man towards the universe veracious true once and still not without worth for us but mark here the difference of paganism and christianism one great difference paganism emblemed chiefly the operations of nature the destinies efforts combinations vicissitudes of things and men in this world christianism emblemed the law of human duty the moral law of man one was for the sensuous nature a rude helpless utterance of the first thought of menthe chief recognized virtue courage superiority to fear the other was not for the sensuous nature but for the moral what a progress is here if in that one respect only  and so in this dante as we said had ten silent centuries in a very strange way found a voice the divina commedia is of dantes writing yet in truth it belongs to ten christian centuries only the finishing of it is dantes so always the craftsman there the smith with that metal of his with these tools with these cunning methodshow little of all he does is properly his work all past inventive men work there with himas indeed with all of us in all things dante is the spokesman of the middle ages the thought they lived by stands here in everlasting music these sublime ideas of his terrible and beautiful are the fruit of the christian meditation of all the good men who had gone before him precious they but also is not he precious much had not he spoken would have been dumb not dead yet living voiceless  on the whole is it not an utterance this mystic song at once of one of the greatest human souls and of the highest thing that europe had hitherto realized for itself christianism as dante sings it is another than paganism in the rude norse mind another than bastard christianism halfarticulately spoken in the arab desert seven hundred years beforethe noblest idea made real hitherto among men is sung and emblemed forth abidingly by one of the noblest men in the one sense and in the other are we not right glad to possess it as i calculate it may last yet for long thousands of years for the thing that is uttered from the inmost parts of a mans soul differs altogether from what is uttered by the outer part the outer is of the day under the empire of mode the outer passes away in swift endless changes the inmost is the same yesterday today and forever true souls in all generations of the world who look on this dante will find a brotherhood in him the deep sincerity of his thoughts his woes and hopes will speak likewise to their sincerity they will feel that this dante too was a brother napoleon in saint helena is charmed with the genial veracity of old homer the oldest hebrew prophet under a vesture the most diverse from ours does yet because he speaks from the heart of man speak to all mens hearts it is the one sole secret of continuing long memorable dante for depth of sincerity is like an antique prophet too his words like theirs come from his very heart one need not wonder if it were predicted that his poem might be the most enduring thing our europe has yet made for nothing so endures as a truly spoken word all cathedrals pontificalities brass and stone and outer arrangement never so lasting are brief in comparison to an unfathomable heartsong like this one feels as if it might survive still of importance to men when these had all sunk into new irrecognizable combinations and had ceased individually to be europe has made much great cities great empires encyclopaedias creeds bodies of opinion and practice but it has made little of the class of dantes thought homer yet is veritably present face to face with every open soul of us and greece where is it desolate for thousands of years away vanished a bewildered heap of stones and rubbish the life and existence of it all gone like a dream like the dust of king agamemnon greece was greece except in the words it spoke is not  the uses of this dante we will not say much about his uses a human soul who has once got into that primal element of song and sung forth fitly somewhat therefrom has worked in the depths of our existence feeding through long times the liferoots of all excellent human things whatsoeverin a way that utilities will not succeed well in calculating we will not estimate the sun by the quantity of gaslight it saves us dante shall be invaluable or of no value one remark i may make the contrast in this respect between the heropoet and the heroprophet in a hundred years mahomet as we saw had his arabians at grenada and at delhi dantes italians seem to be yet very much where they were shall we say then dantes effect on the world was small in comparison not so his arena is far more restricted but also it is far nobler clearerperhaps not less but more important mahomet speaks to great masses of men in the coarse dialect adapted to such a dialect filled with inconsistencies crudities follies on the great masses alone can he act and there with good and with evil strangely blended dante speaks to the noble the pure and great in all times and places neither does he grow obsolete as the other does dante burns as a pure star fixed there in the firmament at which the great and the high of all ages kindle themselves he is the possession of all the chosen of the world for uncounted time dante one calculates may long survive mahomet in this way the balance may be made straight again  but at any rate it is not by what is called their effect on the world by what we can judge of their effect there that a man and his work are measured effect influence utility let a man do his work the fruit of it is the care of another than he it will grow its own fruit and whether embodied in caliph thrones and arabian conquests so that it fills all morning and evening newspapers and all histories which are a kind of distilled newspapers or not embodied so at allwhat matters that that is not the real fruit of it the arabian caliph in so far only as he did something was something if the great cause of man and mans work in gods earth got no furtherance from the arabian caliph then no matter how many scimetars he drew how many gold piasters pocketed and what uproar and blaring he made in this worldhe was but a loudsounding inanity and futility at bottom he was not at all let us honor the great empire of silence once more the boundless treasury which we do not jingle in our pockets or count up and present before men it is perhaps of all things the usefulest for each of us to do in these loud times   as dante the italian man was sent into our world to embody musically the religion of the middle ages the religion of our modern europe its inner life so shakspeare we may say embodies for us the outer life of our europe as developed then its chivalries courtesies humors ambitions what practical way of thinking acting looking at the world men then had as in homer we may still construe old greece so in shakspeare and dante after thousands of years what our modern europe was in faith and in practice will still be legible dante has given us the faith or soul shakspeare in a not less noble way has given us the practice or body this latter also we were to have a man was sent for it the man shakspeare just when that chivalry way of life had reached its last finish and was on the point of breaking down into slow or swift dissolution as we now see it everywhere this other sovereign poet with his seeing eye with his perennial singing voice was sent to take note of it to give longenduring record of it two fit men dante deep fierce as the central fire of the world shakspeare wide placid farseeing as the sun the upper light of the world italy produced the one worldvoice we english had the honor of producing the other  curious enough how as it were by mere accident this man came to us i think always so great quiet complete and selfsufficing is this shakspeare had the warwickshire squire not prosecuted him for deerstealing we had perhaps never heard of him as a poet the woods and skies the rustic life of man in stratford there had been enough for this man but indeed that strange outbudding of our whole english existence which we call the elizabethan era did not it too come as of its own accord the tree igdrasil buds and withers by its own lawstoo deep for our scanning yet it does bud and wither and every bough and leaf of it is there by fixed eternal laws not a sir thomas lucy but comes at the hour fit for him curious i say and not sufficiently considered how everything does cooperate with all not a leaf rotting on the highway but is indissoluble portion of solar and stellar systems no thought word or act of man but has sprung withal out of all men and works sooner or later recognizably or irrecognizable on all men it is all a tree circulation of sap and influences mutual communication of every minutest leaf with the lowest talon of a root with every other greatest and minutest portion of the whole the tree igdrasil that has its roots down in the kingdoms of hela and death and whose boughs overspread the highest heaven  in some sense it may be said that this glorious elizabethan era with its shakspeare as the outcome and flowerage of all which had preceded it is itself attributable to the catholicism of the middle ages the christian faith which was the theme of dantes song had produced this practical life which shakspeare was to sing for religion then as it now and always is was the soul of practice the primary vital fact in mens life and remark here as rather curious that middleage catholicism was abolished so far as acts of parliament could abolish it before shakspeare the noblest product of it made his appearance he did make his appearance nevertheless nature at her own time with catholicism or what else might be necessary sent him forth taking small thought of acts of parliament king henrys queen elizabeths go their way and nature too goes hers acts of parliament on the whole are small notwithstanding the noise they make what act of parliament debate at st stephens on the hustings or elsewhere was it that brought this shakspeare into being no dining at freemasons tavern opening subscriptionlists selling of shares and infinite other jangling and true or false endeavoring this elizabethan era and all its nobleness and blessedness came without proclamation preparation of ours priceless shakspeare was the free gift of nature given altogether silentlyreceived altogether silently as if it had been a thing of little account and yet very literally it is a priceless thing one should look at that side of matters too  of this shakspeare of ours perhaps the opinion one sometimes hears a little idolatrously expressed is in fact the right one i think the best judgment not of this country only but of europe at large is slowly pointing to the conclusion that shakspeare is the chief of all poets hitherto the greatest intellect who in our recorded world has left record of himself in the way of literature on the whole i know not such a power of vision such a faculty of thought if we take all the characters of it in any other man such a calmness of depth placid joyous strength all things imaged in that great soul of his so true and clear as in a tranquil unfathomable sea it has been said that in the constructing of shakspeares dramas there is apart from all other faculties as they are called an understanding manifested equal to that in bacons novum organum that is true and it is not a truth that strikes every one it would become more apparent if we tried any of us for himself how out of shakspeares dramatic materials we could fashion such a result the built house seems all so fitevery way as it should be as if it came there by its own law and the nature of thingswe forget the rude disorderly quarry it was shaped from the very perfection of the house as if nature herself had made it hides the builders merit perfect more perfect than any other man we may call shakspeare in this he discerns knows as by instinct what condition he works under what his materials are what his own force and its relation to them is it is not a transitory glance of insight that will suffice it is deliberate illumination of the whole matter it is a calmly seeing eye a great intellect in short how a man of some wide thing that he has witnessed will construct a narrative what kind of picture and delineation he will give of itis the best measure you could get of what intellect is in the man which circumstance is vital and shall stand prominent which unessential fit to be suppressed where is the true beginning the true sequence and ending to find out this you task the whole force of insight that is in the man he must understand the thing according to the depth of his understanding will the fitness of his answer be you will try him so does like join itself to like does the spirit of method stir in that confusion so that its embroilment becomes order can the man say fiat lux let there be light and out of chaos make a world precisely as there is light in himself will he accomplish this  or indeed we may say again it is in what i called portraitpainting delineating of men and things especially of men that shakspeare is great all the greatness of the man comes out decisively here it is unexampled i think that calm creative perspicacity of shakspeare the thing he looks at reveals not this or that face of it but its inmost heart and generic secret it dissolves itself as in light before him so that he discerns the perfect structure of it creative we said poetic creation what is this too but seeing the thing sufficiently the word that will describe the thing follows of itself from such clear intense sight of the thing and is not shakspeares morality his valor candor tolerance truthfulness his whole victorious strength and greatness which can triumph over such obstructions visible there too great as the world no twisted poor convexconcave mirror reflecting all objects with its own convexities and concavities a perfectly level mirrorthat is to say withal if we will understand it a man justly related to all things and men a good man it is truly a lordly spectacle how this great soul takes in all kinds of men and objects a falstaff an othello a juliet a coriolanus sets them all forth to us in their round completeness loving just the equal brother of all novum organum and all the intellect you will find in bacon is of a quite secondary order earthy material poor in comparison with this among modern men one finds in strictness almost nothing of the same rank goethe alone since the days of shakspeare reminds me of it of him too you say that he saw the object you may say what he himself says of shakspeare his characters are like watches with dialplates of transparent crystal they show you the hour like others and the inward mechanism also is all visible  the seeing eye it is this that discloses the inner harmony of things what nature meant what musical idea nature has wrapped up in these often rough embodiments something she did mean to the seeing eye that something were discernible are they base miserable things you can laugh over them you can weep over them you can in some way or other genially relate yourself to themyou can at lowest hold your peace about them turn away your own and others face from them till the hour come for practically exterminating and extinguishing them at bottom it is the poets first gift as it is all mens that he have intellect enough he will be a poet if he have a poet in word or failing that perhaps still better a poet in act whether he write at all and if so whether in prose or in verse will depend on accidents who knows on what extremely trivial accidentsperhaps on his having had a singingmaster on his being taught to sing in his boyhood but the faculty which enables him to discern the inner heart of things and the harmony that dwells there for whatsoever exists has a harmony in the heart of it or it would not hold together and exist is not the result of habits or accidents but the gift of nature herself the primary outfit for a heroic man in what sort soever to the poet as to every other we say first of all see if you cannot do that it is of no use to keep stringing rhymes together jingling sensibilities against each other and name yourself a poet there is no hope for you if you can there is in prose or verse in action or speculation all manner of hope the crabbed old schoolmaster used to ask when they brought him a new pupil but are ye sure hes not a dunce why really one might ask the same thing in regard to every man proposed for whatsoever function and consider it as the one inquiry needful are ye sure hes not a dunce there is in this world no other entirely fatal person  for in fact i say the degree of vision that dwells in a man is a correct measure of the man if called to define shakspeares faculty i should say superiority of intellect and think i had included all under that what indeed are faculties we talk of faculties as if they were distinct things separable as if a man had intellect imagination fancy c as he has hands feet and arms that is a capital error then again we hear of a mans intellectual nature and of his moral nature as if these again were divisible and existed apart necessities of language do perhaps prescribe such forms of utterance we must speak i am aware in that way if we are to speak at all but words ought not to harden into things for us it seems to me our apprehension of this matter is for most part radically falsified thereby we ought to know withal and to keep forever in mind that these divisions are at bottom but names that mans spiritual nature the vital force which dwells in him is essentially one and indivisible that what we call imagination fancy understanding and so forth are but different figures of the same power of insight all indissolubly connected with each other physiognomically related that if we knew one of them we might know all of them morality itself what we call the moral quality of a man what is this but another side of the one vital force whereby he is and works all that a man does is physiognomical of him you may see how a man would fight by the way in which he sings his courage or want of courage is visible in the word he utters in the opinion he has formed no less than in the stroke he strikes he is one and preaches the same self abroad in all these ways  without hands a man might have feet and could still walk but consider itwithout morality intellect were impossible for him a thoroughly immoral man could not know anything at all to know a thing what we can call knowing a man must first love the thing sympathize with it that is be virtuously related to it if he have not the justice to put down his own selfishness at every turn the courage to stand by the dangeroustrue at every turn how shall he know his virtues all of them will lie recorded in his knowledge nature with her truth remains to the bad to the selfish and the pusillanimous forever a sealed book what such can know of nature is mean superficial small for the uses of the day merelybut does not the very fox know something of nature exactly so it knows where the geese lodge the human reynard very frequent everywhere in the world what more does he know but this and the like of this nay it should be considered too that if the fox had not a certain vulpine morality he could not even know where the geese were or get at the geese if he spent his time in splenetic atrabiliar reflections on his own misery his ill usage by nature fortune and other foxes and so forth and had not courage promptitude practicality and other suitable vulpine gifts and graces he would catch no geese we may say of the fox too that his morality and insight are of the same dimensions different faces of the same internal unity of vulpine lifethese things are worth stating for the contrary of them acts with manifold very baleful perversion in this time what limitations modifications they require your own candor will supply  if i say therefore that shakspeare is the greatest of intellects i have said all concerning him but there is more in shakspeares intellect than we have yet seen it is what i call an unconscious intellect there is more virtue in it than he himself is aware of novalis beautifully remarks of him that those dramas of his are products of nature too deep as nature herself i find a great truth in this saying shakspeares art is not artifice the noblest worth of it is not there by plan or precontrivance it grows up from the deeps of nature through this noble sincere soul who is a voice of nature the latest generations of men will find new meanings in shakspeare new elucidations of their own human being new harmonies with the infinite structure of the universe concurrences with later ideas affinities with the higher powers and senses of man this well deserves meditating it is natures highest reward to a true simple great soul that he get thus to be a part of herself such a mans works whatsoever he with utmost conscious exertion and forethought shall accomplish grow up withal unconsciously from the unknown deeps in himas the oaktree grows from the earths bosom as the mountains and waters shape themselves with a symmetry grounded on natures own laws conformable to all truth whatsoever how much in shakspeare lies hid his sorrows his silent struggles known to himself much that was not known at all not speakable at all like roots like sap and forces working underground speech is great but silence is greater  withal the joyful tranquillity of this man is notable i will not blame dante for his misery it is as battle without victory but true battlethe first indispensable thing yet i call shakspeare greater than dante in that he fought truly and did conquer doubt it not he had his own sorrows those sonnets of his will even testify expressly in what deep waters he had waded and swum struggling for his lifeas what man like him ever failed to have to do it seems to me a heedless notion our common one that he sat like a bird on the bough and sang forth free and offhand never knowing the troubles of other men not so with no man is it so how could a man travel forward from rustic deerpoaching to such tragedywriting and not fall in with sorrows by the way or still better how could a man delineate a hamlet a coriolanus a macbeth so many suffering heroic hearts if his own heroic heart had never sufferedand now in contrast with all this observe his mirthfulness his genuine overflowing love of laughter you would say in no point does he exaggerate but only in laughter fiery objurgations words that pierce and burn are to be found in shakspeare yet he is always in measure here never what johnson would remark as a specially good hater but his laughter seems to pour from him in floods he heaps all manner of ridiculous nicknames on the butt he is bantering tumbles and tosses him in all sorts of horseplay you would say with his whole heart laughs and then if not always the finest it is always a genial laughter not at mere weakness at misery or poverty never no man who can laugh what we call laughing will laugh at these things it is some poor character only desiring to laugh and have the credit of wit that does so laughter means sympathy good laughter is not the crackling of thorns under the pot even at stupidity and pretension this shakspeare does not laugh otherwise than genially dogberry and verges tickle our very hearts and we dismiss them covered with explosions of laughter but we like the poor fellows only the better for our laughing and hope they will get on well there and continue presidents of the citywatch such laughter like sunshine on the deep sea is very beautiful to me   we have no room to speak of shakspeares individual works though perhaps there is much still waiting to be said on that head had we for instance all his plays reviewed as hamlet in wilhelm meister is a thing which might one day be done august wilhelm schlegel has a remark on his historical plays henry fifth and the others which is worth remembering he calls them a kind of national epic marlborough you recollect said he knew no english history but what he had learned from shakspeare there are really if we look to it few as memorable histories the great salient points are admirably seized all rounds itself off into a kind of rhythmic coherence it is as schlegel says epicas indeed all delineation by a great thinker will be there are right beautiful things in those pieces which indeed together form one beautiful thing that battle of agincourt strikes me as one of the most perfect things in its sort we anywhere have of shakspeares the description of the two hosts the wornout jaded english the dread hour big with destiny when the battle shall begin and then that deathless valor ye good yeomen whose limbs were made in england there is a noble patriotism in itfar other than the indifference you sometimes hear ascribed to shakspeare a true english heart breathes calm and strong through the whole business not boisterous protrusive all the better for that there is a sound in it like the ring of steel this man too had a right stroke in him had it come to that  but i will say of shakspeares works generally that we have no full impress of him there even as full as we have of many men his works are so many windows through which we see a glimpse of the world that was in him all his works seem comparatively speaking cursory imperfect written under cramping circumstances giving only here and there a note of the full utterance of the man passages there are that come upon you like splendor out of heaven bursts of radiance illuminating the very heart of the thing you say that is true spoken once and forever wheresoever and whensoever there is an open human soul that will be recognized as true such bursts however make us feel that the surrounding matter is not radiant that it is in part temporary conventional alas shakspeare had to write for the globe playhouse his great soul had to crush itself as it could into that and no other mould it was with him then as it is with us all no man works save under conditions the sculptor cannot set his own free thought before us but his thought as he could translate it into the stone that was given with the tools that were given disjecta membra are all that we find of any poet or of any man   whoever looks intelligently at this shakspeare may recognize that he too was a prophet in his way of an insight analogous to the prophetic though he took it up in another strain nature seemed to this man also divine unspeakable deep as tophet high as heaven we are such stuff as dreams are made of that scroll in westminster abbey which few read with understanding is of the depth of any seer but the man sang did not preach except musically we called dante the melodious priest of middleage catholicism may we not call shakspeare the still more melodious priest of a true catholicism the universal church of the future and of all times no narrow superstition harsh asceticism intolerance fanatical fierceness or perversion a revelation so far as it goes that such a thousandfold hidden beauty and divineness dwells in all nature which let all men worship as they can we may say without offence that there rises a kind of universal psalm out of this shakspeare too not unfit to make itself heard among the still more sacred psalms not in disharmony with these if we understood them but in harmonyi cannot call this shakspeare a sceptic as some do his indifference to the creeds and theological quarrels of his time misleading them no neither unpatriotic though he says little about his patriotism nor sceptic though he says little about his faith such indifference was the fruit of his greatness withal his whole heart was in his own grand sphere of worship we may call it such these other controversies vitally important to other men were not vital to him  but call it worship call it what you will is it not a right glorious thing and set of things this that shakspeare has brought us for myself i feel that there is actually a kind of sacredness in the fact of such a man being sent into this earth is he not an eye to us all a blessed heavensent bringer of lightand at bottom was it not perhaps far better that this shakspeare every way an unconscious man was conscious of no heavenly message he did not feel like mahomet because he saw into those internal splendors that he specially was the prophet of god and was he not greater than mahomet in that greater and also if we compute strictly as we did in dantes case more successful it was intrinsically an error that notion of mahomets of his supreme prophethood and has come down to us inextricably involved in error to this day dragging along with it such a coil of fables impurities intolerances as makes it a questionable step for me here and now to say as i have done that mahomet was a true speaker at all and not rather an ambitious charlatan perversity and simulacrum no speaker but a babbler even in arabia as i compute mahomet will have exhausted himself and become obsolete while this shakspeare this dante may still be youngwhile this shakspeare may still pretend to be a priest of mankind of arabia as of other places for unlimited periods to come  compared with any speaker or singer one knows even with aeschylus or homer why should he not for veracity and universality last like them he is sincere as they reaches deep down like them to the universal and perennial but as for mahomet i think it had been better for him not to be so conscious alas poor mahomet all that he was conscious of was a mere error a futility and trivialityas indeed such ever is the truly great in him too was the unconscious that he was a wild arab lion of the desert and did speak out with that great thundervoice of his not by words which he thought to be great but by actions by feelings by a history which were great his koran has become a stupid piece of prolix absurdity we do not believe like him that god wrote that the great man here too as always is a force of nature whatsoever is truly great in him springs up from the inarticulate deeps   well this is our poor warwickshire peasant who rose to be manager of a playhouse so that he could live without begging whom the earl of southampton cast some kind glances on whom sir thomas lucy many thanks to him was for sending to the treadmill we did not account him a god like odin while he dwelt with uson which point there were much to be said but i will say rather or repeat in spite of the sad state heroworship now lies in consider what this shakspeare has actually become among us which englishman we ever made in this land of ours which million of englishmen would we not give up rather than the stratford peasant there is no regiment of highest dignitaries that we would sell him for he is the grandest thing we have yet done for our honor among foreign nations as an ornament to our english household what item is there that we would not surrender rather than him consider now if they asked us will you give up your indian empire or your shakspeare you english never have had any indian empire or never have had any shakspeare really it were a grave question official persons would answer doubtless in official language but we for our part too should not we be forced to answer indian empire or no indian empire we cannot do without shakspeare indian empire will go at any rate some day but this shakspeare does not go he lasts forever with us we cannot give up our shakspeare  nay apart from spiritualities and considering him merely as a real marketable tangibly useful possession england before long this island of ours will hold but a small fraction of the english in america in new holland east and west to the very antipodes there will be a saxondom covering great spaces of the globe and now what is it that can keep all these together into virtually one nation so that they do not fall out and fight but live at peace in brotherlike intercourse helping one another this is justly regarded as the greatest practical problem the thing all manner of sovereignties and governments are here to accomplish what is it that will accomplish this acts of parliament administrative primeministers cannot america is parted from us so far as parliament could part it call it not fantastic for there is much reality in it here i say is an english king whom no time or chance parliament or combination of parliaments can dethrone this king shakspeare does not he shine in crowned sovereignty over us all as the noblest gentlest yet strongest of rallyingsigns indestructible really more valuable in that point of view than any other means or appliance whatsoever we can fancy him as radiant aloft over all the nations of englishmen a thousand years hence from paramatta from new york wheresoever under what sort of parishconstable soever english men and women are they will say to one another yes this shakspeare is ours we produced him we speak and think by him we are of one blood and kind with him the most commonsense politician too if he pleases may think of that  yes truly it is a great thing for a nation that it get an articulate voice that it produce a man who will speak forth melodiously what the heart of it means italy for example poor italy lies dismembered scattered asunder not appearing in any protocol or treaty as a unity at all yet the noble italy is actually one italy produced its dante italy can speak the czar of all the russias he is strong with so many bayonets cossacks and cannons and does a great feat in keeping such a tract of earth politically together but he cannot yet speak something great in him but it is a dumb greatness he has had no voice of genius to be heard of all men and times he must learn to speak he is a great dumb monster hitherto his cannons and cossacks will all have rusted into nonentity while that dantes voice is still audible the nation that has a dante is bound together as no dumb russia can bewe must here end what we had to say of the heropoet     lecture iv the hero as priest luther reformation knox puritanism  may 15 1840  our present discourse is to be of the great man as priest we have repeatedly endeavored to explain that all sorts of heroes are intrinsically of the same material that given a great soul open to the divine significance of life then there is given a man fit to speak of this to sing of this to fight and work for this in a great victorious enduring manner there is given a herothe outward shape of whom will depend on the time and the environment he finds himself in the priest too as i understand it is a kind of prophet in him too there is required to be a light of inspiration as we must name it he presides over the worship of the people is the uniter of them with the unseen holy he is the spiritual captain of the people as the prophet is their spiritual king with many captains he guides them heavenward by wise guidance through this earth and its work the ideal of him is that he too be what we can call a voice from the unseen heaven interpreting even as the prophet did and in a more familiar manner unfolding the same to men the unseen heaventhe open secret of the universewhich so few have an eye for he is the prophet shorn of his more awful splendor burning with mild equable radiance as the enlightener of daily life this i say is the ideal of a priest so in old times so in these and in all times one knows very well that in reducing ideals to practice great latitude of tolerance is needful very great but a priest who is not this at all who does not any longer aim or try to be this is a characterof whom we had rather not speak in this place  luther and knox were by express vocation priests and did faithfully perform that function in its common sense yet it will suit us better here to consider them chiefly in their historical character rather as reformers than priests there have been other priests perhaps equally notable in calmer times for doing faithfully the office of a leader of worship bringing down by faithful heroism in that kind a light from heaven into the daily life of their people leading them forward as under gods guidance in the way wherein they were to go but when this same way was a rough one of battle confusion and danger the spiritual captain who led through that becomes especially to us who live under the fruit of his leading more notable than any other he is the warfaring and battling priest who led his people not to quiet faithful labor as in smooth times but to faithful valorous conflict in times all violent dismembered a more perilous service and a more memorable one be it higher or not these two men we will account our best priests inasmuch as they were our best reformers nay i may ask is not every true reformer by the nature of him a priest first of all he appeals to heavens invisible justice against earths visible force knows that it the invisible is strong and alone strong he is a believer in the divine truth of things a seer seeing through the shows of things a worshipper in one way or the other of the divine truth of things a priest that is if he be not first a priest he will never be good for much as a reformer  thus then as we have seen great men in various situations building up religions heroic forms of human existence in this world theories of life worthy to be sung by a dante practices of life by a shakspearewe are now to see the reverse process which also is necessary which also may be carried on in the heroic manner curious how this should be necessary yet necessary it is the mild shining of the poets light has to give place to the fierce lightning of the reformer unfortunately the reformer too is a personage that cannot fail in history the poet indeed with his mildness what is he but the product and ultimate adjustment of reform or prophecy with its fierceness no wild saint dominics and thebaid eremites there had been no melodious dante rough practical endeavor scandinavian and other from odin to walter raleigh from ulfila to cranmer enabled shakspeare to speak nay the finished poet i remark sometimes is a symptom that his epoch itself has reached perfection and is finished that before long there will be a new epoch new reformers needed  doubtless it were finer could we go along always in the way of music be tamed and taught by our poets as the rude creatures were by their orpheus of old or failing this rhythmic musical way how good were it could we get so much as into the equable way i mean if peaceable priests reforming from day to day would always suffice us but it is not so even this latter has not yet been realized alas the battling reformer too is from time to time a needful and inevitable phenomenon obstructions are never wanting the very things that were once indispensable furtherances become obstructions and need to be shaken off and left behind usa business often of enormous difficulty it is notable enough surely how a theorem or spiritual representation so we may call it which once took in the whole universe and was completely satisfactory in all parts of it to the highly discursive acute intellect of dante one of the greatest in the worldhad in the course of another century become dubitable to common intellects become deniable and is now to every one of us flatly incredible obsolete as odins theorem to dante human existence and gods ways with men were all well represented by those malebolges purgatorios to luther not well how was this why could not dantes catholicism continue but luthers protestantism must needs follow alas nothing will continue  i do not make much of progress of the species as handled in these times of ours nor do i think you would care to hear much about it the talk on that subject is too often of the most extravagant confused sort yet i may say the fact itself seems certain enough nay we can trace out the inevitable necessity of it in the nature of things every man as i have stated somewhere is not only a learner but a doer he learns with the mind given him what has been but with the same mind he discovers farther he invents and devises somewhat of his own absolutely without originality there is no man no man whatever believes or can believe exactly what his grandfather believed he enlarges somewhat by fresh discovery his view of the universe and consequently his theorem of the universewhich is an infinite universe and can never be embraced wholly or finally by any view or theorem in any conceivable enlargement he enlarges somewhat i say finds somewhat that was credible to his grandfather incredible to him false to him inconsistent with some new thing he has discovered or observed it is the history of every man and in the history of mankind we see it summed up into great historical amountsrevolutions new epochs dantes mountain of purgatory does not stand in the ocean of the other hemisphere when columbus has once sailed thither men find no such thing extant in the other hemisphere it is not there it must cease to be believed to be there so with all beliefs whatsoever in this worldall systems of belief and systems of practice that spring from these  if we add now the melancholy fact that when belief waxes uncertain practice too becomes unsound and errors injustices and miseries everywhere more and more prevail we shall see material enough for revolution at all turns a man who will do faithfully needs to believe firmly if he have to ask at every turn the worlds suffrage if he cannot dispense with the worlds suffrage and make his own suffrage serve he is a poor eyeservant the work committed to him will be misdone every such man is a daily contributor to the inevitable downfall whatsoever work he does dishonestly with an eye to the outward look of it is a new offence parent of new misery to somebody or other offences accumulate till they become insupportable and are then violently burst through cleared off as by explosion dantes sublime catholicism incredible now in theory and defaced still worse by faithless doubting and dishonest practice has to be torn asunder by a luther shakspeares noble feudalism as beautiful as it once looked and was has to end in a french revolution the accumulation of offences is as we say too literally exploded blasted asunder volcanically and there are long troublous periods before matters come to a settlement again  surely it were mournful enough to look only at this face of the matter and find in all human opinions and arrangements merely the fact that they were uncertain temporary subject to the law of death at bottom it is not so all death here too we find is but of the body not of the essence or soul all destruction by violent revolution or howsoever it be is but new creation on a wider scale odinism was valor christianism was humility a nobler kind of valor no thought that ever dwelt honestly as true in the heart of man but was an honest insight into gods truth on mans part and has an essential truth in it which endures through all changes an everlasting possession for us all and on the other hand what a melancholy notion is that which has to represent all men in all countries and times except our own as having spent their life in blind condemnable error mere lost pagans scandinavians mahometans only that we might have the true ultimate knowledge all generations of men were lost and wrong only that this present little section of a generation might be saved and right they all marched forward there all generations since the beginning of the world like the russian soldiers into the ditch of schweidnitz fort only to fill up the ditch with their dead bodies that we might march over and take the place it is an incredible hypothesis  such incredible hypothesis we have seen maintained with fierce emphasis and this or the other poor individual man with his sect of individual men marching as over the dead bodies of all men towards sure victory but when he too with his hypothesis and ultimate infallible credo sank into the ditch and became a dead body what was to be saidwithal it is an important fact in the nature of man that he tends to reckon his own insight as final and goes upon it as such he will always do it i suppose in one or the other way but it must be in some wider wiser way than this are not all true men that live or that ever lived soldiers of the same army enlisted under heavens captaincy to do battle against the same enemy the empire of darkness and wrong why should we misknow one another fight not against the enemy but against ourselves from mere difference of uniform all uniforms shall be good so they hold in them true valiant men all fashions of arms the arab turban and swift scimetar thors strong hammer smiting down jotuns shall be welcome luthers battlevoice dantes marchmelody all genuine things are with us not against us we are all under one captain soldiers of the same hostlet us now look a little at this luthers fighting what kind of battle it was and how he comported himself in it luther too was of our spiritual heroes a prophet to his country and time   as introductory to the whole a remark about idolatry will perhaps be in place here one of mahomets characteristics which indeed belongs to all prophets is unlimited implacable zeal against idolatry it is the grand theme of prophets idolatry the worshipping of dead idols as the divinity is a thing they cannot away with but have to denounce continually and brand with inexpiable reprobation it is the chief of all the sins they see done under the sun this is worth noting we will not enter here into the theological question about idolatry idol is eidolon a thing seen a symbol it is not god but a symbol of god and perhaps one may question whether any the most benighted mortal ever took it for more than a symbol i fancy he did not think that the poor image his own hands had made was god but that god was emblemed by it that god was in it some way or other and now in this sense one may ask is not all worship whatsoever a worship by symbols by eidola or things seen whether seen rendered visible as an image or picture to the bodily eye or visible only to the inward eye to the imagination to the intellect this makes a superficial but no substantial difference it is still a thing seen significant of godhead an idol the most rigorous puritan has his confession of faith and intellectual representation of divine things and worships thereby thereby is worship first made possible for him all creeds liturgies religious forms conceptions that fitly invest religious feelings are in this sense eidola things seen all worship whatsoever must proceed by symbols by idolswe may say all idolatry is comparative and the worst idolatry is only more idolatrous  where then lies the evil of it some fatal evil must lie in it or earnest prophetic men would not on all hands so reprobate it why is idolatry so hateful to prophets it seems to me as if in the worship of those poor wooden symbols the thing that had chiefly provoked the prophet and filled his inmost soul with indignation and aversion was not exactly what suggested itself to his own thought and came out of him in words to others as the thing the rudest heathen that worshipped canopus or the caabah blackstone he as we saw was superior to the horse that worshipped nothing at all nay there was a kind of lasting merit in that poor act of his analogous to what is still meritorious in poets recognition of a certain endless divine beauty and significance in stars and all natural objects whatsoever why should the prophet so mercilessly condemn him the poorest mortal worshipping his fetish while his heart is full of it may be an object of pity of contempt and avoidance if you will but cannot surely be an object of hatred let his heart be honestly full of it the whole space of his dark narrow mind illuminated thereby in one word let him entirely believe in his fetishit will then be i should say if not well with him yet as well as it can readily be made to be and you will leave him alone unmolested there  but here enters the fatal circumstance of idolatry that in the era of the prophets no mans mind is any longer honestly filled with his idol or symbol before the prophet can arise who seeing through it knows it to be mere wood many men must have begun dimly to doubt that it was little more condemnable idolatry is insincere idolatry doubt has eaten out the heart of it a human soul is seen clinging spasmodically to an ark of the covenant which it half feels now to have become a phantasm this is one of the balefulest sights souls are no longer filled with their fetish but only pretend to be filled and would fain make themselves feel that they are filled you do not believe said coleridge you only believe that you believe it is the final scene in all kinds of worship and symbolism the sure symptom that death is now nigh it is equivalent to what we call formulism and worship of formulas in these days of ours no more immoral act can be done by a human creature for it is the beginning of all immorality or rather it is the impossibility henceforth of any morality whatsoever the innermost moral soul is paralyzed thereby cast into fatal magnetic sleep men are no longer sincere men i do not wonder that the earnest man denounces this brands it prosecutes it with inextinguishable aversion he and it all good and it are at deathfeud blamable idolatry is cant and even what one may call sincerecant sincerecant that is worth thinking of every sort of worship ends with this phasis  i find luther to have been a breaker of idols no less than any other prophet the wooden gods of the koreish made of timber and beeswax were not more hateful to mahomet than tetzels pardons of sin made of sheepskin and ink were to luther it is the property of every hero in every time in every place and situation that he come back to reality that he stand upon things and not shows of things according as he loves and venerates articulately or with deep speechless thought the awful realities of things so will the hollow shows of things however regular decorous accredited by koreishes or conclaves be intolerable and detestable to him protestantism too is the work of a prophet the prophetwork of that sixteenth century the first stroke of honest demolition to an ancient thing grown false and idolatrous preparatory afar off to a new thing which shall be true and authentically divine  at first view it might seem as if protestantism were entirely destructive to this that we call heroworship and represent as the basis of all possible good religious or social for mankind one often hears it said that protestantism introduced a new era radically different from any the world had ever seen before the era of private judgment as they call it by this revolt against the pope every man became his own pope and learnt among other things that he must never trust any pope or spiritual herocaptain any more whereby is not spiritual union all hierarchy and subordination among men henceforth an impossibility so we hear it saidnow i need not deny that protestantism was a revolt against spiritual sovereignties popes and much else nay i will grant that english puritanism revolt against earthly sovereignties was the second act of it that the enormous french revolution itself was the third act whereby all sovereignties earthly and spiritual were as might seem abolished or made sure of abolition protestantism is the grand root from which our whole subsequent european history branches out for the spiritual will always body itself forth in the temporal history of men the spiritual is the beginning of the temporal and now sure enough the cry is everywhere for liberty and equality independence and so forth instead of kings ballotboxes and electoral suffrages it seems made out that any herosovereign or loyal obedience of men to a man in things temporal or things spiritual has passed away forever from the world i should despair of the world altogether if so one of my deepest convictions is that it is not so without sovereigns true sovereigns temporal and spiritual i see nothing possible but an anarchy the hatefulest of things but i find protestantism whatever anarchic democracy it have produced to be the beginning of new genuine sovereignty and order i find it to be a revolt against false sovereigns the painful but indispensable first preparative for true sovereigns getting place among us this is worth explaining a little  let us remark therefore in the first place that this of private judgment is at bottom not a new thing in the world but only new at that epoch of the world there is nothing generically new or peculiar in the reformation it was a return to truth and reality in opposition to falsehood and semblance as all kinds of improvement and genuine teaching are and have been liberty of private judgment if we will consider it must at all times have existed in the world dante had not put out his eyes or tied shackles on himself he was at home in that catholicism of his a freeseeing soul in itif many a poor hogstraten tetzel and dr eck had now become slaves in it liberty of judgment no iron chain or outward force of any kind could ever compel the soul of a man to believe or to disbelieve it is his own indefeasible light that judgment of his he will reign and believe there by the grace of god alone the sorriest sophistical bellarmine preaching sightless faith and passive obedience must first by some kind of conviction have abdicated his right to be convinced his private judgment indicated that as the advisablest step he could take the right of private judgment will subsist in full force wherever true men subsist a true man believes with his whole judgment with all the illumination and discernment that is in him and has always so believed a false man only struggling to believe that he believes will naturally manage it in some other way protestantism said to this latter woe and to the former well done at bottom it was no new saying it was a return to all old sayings that ever had been said be genuine be sincere that was once more the meaning of it mahomet believed with his whole mind odin with his whole mindhe and all true followers of odinism they by their private judgment had judged so  and now i venture to assert that the exercise of private judgment faithfully gone about does by no means necessarily end in selfish independence isolation but rather ends necessarily in the opposite of that it is not honest inquiry that makes anarchy but it is error insincerity halfbelief and untruth that make it a man protesting against error is on the way towards uniting himself with all men that believe in truth there is no communion possible among men who believe only in hearsays the heart of each is lying dead has no power of sympathy even with thingsor he would believe them and not hearsays no sympathy even with things how much less with his fellowmen he cannot unite with men he is an anarchic man only in a world of sincere men is unity possibleand there in the longrun it is as good as certain  for observe one thing a thing too often left out of view or rather altogether lost sight of in this controversy that it is not necessary a man should himself have discovered the truth he is to believe in and never so sincerely to believe in a great man we said was always sincere as the first condition of him but a man need not be great in order to be sincere that is not the necessity of nature and all time but only of certain corrupt unfortunate epochs of time a man can believe and make his own in the most genuine way what he has received from anotherand with boundless gratitude to that other the merit of originality is not novelty it is sincerity the believing man is the original man whatsoever he believes he believes it for himself not for another every son of adam can become a sincere man an original man in this sense no mortal is doomed to be an insincere man whole ages what we call ages of faith are original all men in them or the most of men in them sincere these are the great and fruitful ages every worker in all spheres is a worker not on semblance but on substance every work issues in a result the general sum of such work is great for all of it as genuine tends towards one goal all of it is additive none of it subtractive there is true union true kingship loyalty all true and blessed things so far as the poor earth can produce blessedness for men  heroworship ah me that a man be selfsubsistent original true or what we call it is surely the farthest in the world from indisposing him to reverence and believe other mens truth it only disposes necessitates and invincibly compels him to disbelieve other mens dead formulas hearsays and untruths a man embraces truth with his eyes open and because his eyes are open does he need to shut them before he can love his teacher of truth he alone can love with a right gratitude and genuine loyalty of soul the heroteacher who has delivered him out of darkness into light is not such a one a true hero and serpentqueller worthy of all reverence the black monster falsehood our one enemy in this world lies prostrate by his valor it was he that conquered the world for ussee accordingly was not luther himself reverenced as a true pope or spiritual father being verily such napoleon from amid boundless revolt of sansculottism became a king heroworship never dies nor can die loyalty and sovereignty are everlasting in the worldand there is this in them that they are grounded not on garnitures and semblances but on realities and sincerities not by shutting your eyes your private judgment no but by opening them and by having something to see luthers message was deposition and abolition to all false popes and potentates but life and strength though afar off to new genuine ones  all this of liberty and equality electoral suffrages independence and so forth we will take therefore to be a temporary phenomenon by no means a final one though likely to last a long time with sad enough embroilments for us all we must welcome it as the penalty of sins that are past the pledge of inestimable benefits that are coming in all ways it behooved men to quit simulacra and return to fact cost what it might that did behoove to be done with spurious popes and believers having no private judgmentquacks pretending to command over dupeswhat can you do misery and mischief only you cannot make an association out of insincere men you cannot build an edifice except by plummet and levelat rightangles to one another in all this wild revolutionary work from protestantism downwards i see the blessedest result preparing itself not abolition of heroworship but rather what i would call a whole world of heroes if hero mean sincere man why may not every one of us be a hero a world all sincere a believing world the like has been the like will again becannot help being that were the right sort of worshippers for heroes never could the truly better be so reverenced as where all were true and goodbut we must hasten to luther and his life   luthers birthplace was eisleben in saxony he came into the world there on the 10th of november 1483 it was an accident that gave this honor to eisleben his parents poor minelaborers in a village of that region named mohra had gone to the eisleben winterfair in the tumult of this scene the frau luther was taken with travail found refuge in some poor house there and the boy she bore was named martin luther strange enough to reflect upon it this poor frau luther she had gone with her husband to make her small merchandisings perhaps to sell the lock of yarn she had been spinning to buy the small winternecessaries for her narrow hut or household in the whole world that day there was not a more entirely unimportantlooking pair of people than this miner and his wife and yet what were all emperors popes and potentates in comparison there was born here once more a mighty man whose light was to flame as the beacon over long centuries and epochs of the world the whole world and its history was waiting for this man it is strange it is great it leads us back to another birthhour in a still meaner environment eighteen hundred years agoof which it is fit that we say nothing that we think only in silence for what words are there the age of miracles past the age of miracles is forever here  i find it altogether suitable to luthers function in this earth and doubtless wisely ordered to that end by the providence presiding over him and us and all things that he was born poor and brought up poor one of the poorest of men he had to beg as the schoolchildren in those times did singing for alms and bread from door to door hardship rigorous necessity was the poor boys companion no man nor no thing would put on a false face to flatter martin luther among things not among the shows of things had he to grow a boy of rude figure yet with weak health with his large greedy soul full of all faculty and sensibility he suffered greatly but it was his task to get acquainted with realities and keep acquainted with them at whatever cost his task was to bring the whole world back to reality for it had dwelt too long with semblance a youth nursed up in wintry whirlwinds in desolate darkness and difficulty that he may step forth at last from his stormy scandinavia strong as a true man as a god a christian odina right thor once more with his thunderhammer to smite asunder ugly enough jotuns and giantmonsters  perhaps the turning incident of his life we may fancy was that death of his friend alexis by lightning at the gate of erfurt luther had struggled up through boyhood better and worse displaying in spite of all hindrances the largest intellect eager to learn his father judging doubtless that he might promote himself in the world set him upon the study of law this was the path to rise luther with little will in it either way had consented he was now nineteen years of age alexis and he had been to see the old luther people at mansfeldt were got back again near erfurt when a thunderstorm came on the bolt struck alexis he fell dead at luthers feet what is this life of oursgone in a moment burnt up like a scroll into the blank eternity what are all earthly preferments chancellorships kingships they lie shrunk togetherthere the earth has opened on them in a moment they are not and eternity is luther struck to the heart determined to devote himself to god and gods service alone in spite of all dissuasions from his father and others he became a monk in the augustine convent at erfurt  this was probably the first lightpoint in the history of luther his purer will now first decisively uttering itself but for the present it was still as one lightpoint in an element all of darkness he says he was a pious monk ich bin ein frommer monch gewesen faithfully painfully struggling to work out the truth of this high act of his but it was to little purpose his misery had not lessened had rather as it were increased into infinitude the drudgeries he had to do as novice in his convent all sorts of slavework were not his grievance the deep earnest soul of the man had fallen into all manner of black scruples dubitations he believed himself likely to die soon and far worse than die one hears with a new interest for poor luther that at this time he lived in terror of the unspeakable misery fancied that he was doomed to eternal reprobation was it not the humble sincere nature of the man what was he that he should be raised to heaven he that had known only misery and mean slavery the news was too blessed to be credible it could not become clear to him how by fasts vigils formalities and masswork a mans soul could be saved he fell into the blackest wretchedness had to wander staggering as on the verge of bottomless despair  it must have been a most blessed discovery that of an old latin bible which he found in the erfurt library about this time he had never seen the book before it taught him another lesson than that of fasts and vigils a brother monk too of pious experience was helpful luther learned now that a man was saved not by singing masses but by the infinite grace of god a more credible hypothesis he gradually got himself founded as on the rock no wonder he should venerate the bible which had brought this blessed help to him he prized it as the word of the highest must be prized by such a man he determined to hold by that as through life and to death he firmly did  this then is his deliverance from darkness his final triumph over darkness what we call his conversion for himself the most important of all epochs that he should now grow daily in peace and clearness that unfolding now the great talents and virtues implanted in him he should rise to importance in his convent in his country and be found more and more useful in all honest business of life is a natural result he was sent on missions by his augustine order as a man of talent and fidelity fit to do their business well the elector of saxony friedrich named the wise a truly wise and just prince had cast his eye on him as a valuable person made him professor in his new university of wittenberg preacher too at wittenberg in both which capacities as in all duties he did this luther in the peaceable sphere of common life was gaining more and more esteem with all good men  it was in his twentyseventh year that he first saw rome being sent thither as i said on mission from his convent pope julius the second and what was going on at rome must have filled the mind of luther with amazement he had come as to the sacred city throne of gods highpriest on earth and he found itwhat we know many thoughts it must have given the man many which we have no record of which perhaps he did not himself know how to utter this rome this scene of false priests clothed not in the beauty of holiness but in far other vesture is false but what is it to luther a mean man he how shall he reform a world that was far from his thoughts a humble solitary man why should he at all meddle with the world it was the task of quite higher men than he his business was to guide his own footsteps wisely through the world let him do his own obscure duty in it well the rest horrible and dismal as it looks is in gods hand not in his  it is curious to reflect what might have been the issue had roman popery happened to pass this luther by to go on in its great wasteful orbit and not come athwart his little path and force him to assault it conceivable enough that in this case he might have held his peace about the abuses of rome left providence and god on high to deal with them a modest quiet man not prompt he to attack irreverently persons in authority his clear task as i say was to do his own duty to walk wisely in this world of confused wickedness and save his own soul alive but the roman highpriesthood did come athwart him afar off at wittenberg he luther could not get lived in honesty for it he remonstrated resisted came to extremity was struck at struck again and so it came to wager of battle between them this is worth attending to in luthers history perhaps no man of so humble peaceable a disposition ever filled the world with contention we cannot but see that he would have loved privacy quiet diligence in the shade that it was against his will he ever became a notoriety notoriety what would that do for him the goal of his march through this world was the infinite heaven an indubitable goal for him in a few years he should either have attained that or lost it forever we will say nothing at all i think of that sorrowfulest of theories of its being some mean shopkeeper grudge of the augustine monk against the dominican that first kindled the wrath of luther and produced the protestant reformation we will say to the people who maintain it if indeed any such exist now get first into the sphere of thought by which it is so much as possible to judge of luther or of any man like luther otherwise than distractedly we may then begin arguing with you  the monk tetzel sent out carelessly in the way of trade by leo tenthwho merely wanted to raise a little money and for the rest seems to have been a pagan rather than a christian so far as he was anythingarrived at wittenberg and drove his scandalous trade there luthers flock bought indulgences in the confessional of his church people pleaded to him that they had already got their sins pardoned luther if he would not be found wanting at his own post a false sluggard and coward at the very centre of the little space of ground that was his own and no other mans had to step forth against indulgences and declare aloud that they were a futility and sorrowful mockery that no mans sins could be pardoned by them it was the beginning of the whole reformation we know how it went forward from this first public challenge of tetzel on the last day of october 1517 through remonstrance and argumentspreading ever wider rising ever higher till it became unquenchable and enveloped all the world luthers hearts desire was to have this grief and other griefs amended his thought was still far other than that of introducing separation in the church or revolting against the pope father of christendomthe elegant pagan pope cared little about this monk and his doctrines wished however to have done with the noise of him in a space of some three years having tried various softer methods he thought good to end it by fire he dooms the monks writings to be burnt by the hangman and his body to be sent bound to romeprobably for a similar purpose it was the way they had ended with huss with jerome the century before a short argument fire poor huss he came to that constance council with all imaginable promises and safeconducts an earnest not rebellious kind of man they laid him instantly in a stone dungeon three feet wide six feet high seven feet long burnt the true voice of him out of this world choked it in smoke and fire that was not well done  i for one pardon luther for now altogether revolting against the pope the elegant pagan by this firedecree of his had kindled into noble just wrath the bravest heart then living in this world the bravest if also one of the humblest peaceablest it was now kindled these words of mine words of truth and soberness aiming faithfully as human inability would allow to promote gods truth on earth and save mens souls you gods vicegerent on earth answer them by the hangman and fire you will burn me and them for answer to the godsmessage they strove to bring you you are not gods vicegerent you are anothers than his i think i take your bull as an emparchmented lie and burn it you will do what you see good next this is what i doit was on the 10th of december 1520 three years after the beginning of the business that luther with a great concourse of people took this indignant step of burning the popes firedecree at the elstergate of wittenberg wittenberg looked on with shoutings the whole world was looking on the pope should not have provoked that shout it was the shout of the awakening of nations the quiet german heart modest patient of much had at length got more than it could bear formulism pagan popeism and other falsehood and corrupt semblance had ruled long enough and here once more was a man found who durst tell all men that godsworld stood not on semblances but on realities that life was a truth and not a lie  at bottom as was said above we are to consider luther as a prophet idolbreaker a bringerback of men to reality it is the function of great men and teachers mahomet said these idols of yours are wood you put wax and oil on them the flies stick on them they are not god i tell you they are black wood luther said to the pope this thing of yours that you call a pardon of sins it is a bit of ragpaper with ink it is nothing else it and so much like it is nothing else god alone can pardon sins popeship spiritual fatherhood of gods church is that a vain semblance of cloth and parchment it is an awful fact gods church is not a semblance heaven and hell are not semblances i stand on this since you drive me to it standing on this i a poor german monk am stronger than you all i stand solitary friendless but on gods truth you with your tiaras triplehats with your treasuries and armories thunders spiritual and temporal stand on the devils lie and are not so strong  the diet of worms luthers appearance there on the 17th of april 1521 may be considered as the greatest scene in modern european history the point indeed from which the whole subsequent history of civilization takes its rise after multiplied negotiations disputations it had come to this the young emperor charles fifth with all the princes of germany papal nuncios dignitaries spiritual and temporal are assembled there luther is to appear and answer for himself whether he will recant or not the worlds pomp and power sits there on this hand on that stands up for gods truth one man the poor miner hans luthers son friends had reminded him of huss advised him not to go he would not be advised a large company of friends rode out to meet him with still more earnest warnings he answered were there as many devils in worms as there are rooftiles i would on the people on the morrow as he went to the hall of the diet crowded the windows and housetops some of them calling out to him in solemn words not to recant whosoever denieth me before men they cried to himas in a kind of solemn petition and adjuration was it not in reality our petition too the petition of the whole world lying in dark bondage of soul paralyzed under a black spectral nightmare and triplehatted chimera calling itself father in god and what not free us it rests with thee desert us not  luther did not desert us his speech of two hours distinguished itself by its respectful wise and honest tone submissive to whatsoever could lawfully claim submission not submissive to any more than that his writings he said were partly his own partly derived from the word of god as to what was his own human infirmity entered into it unguarded anger blindness many things doubtless which it were a blessing for him could he abolish altogether but as to what stood on sound truth and the word of god he could not recant it how could he confute me he concluded by proofs of scripture or else by plain just arguments i cannot recant otherwise for it is neither safe nor prudent to do aught against conscience here stand i i can do no other god assist meit is as we say the greatest moment in the modern history of men english puritanism england and its parliaments americas and vast work these two centuries french revolution europe and its work everywhere at present the germ of it all lay there had luther in that moment done other it had all been otherwise the european world was asking him am i to sink ever lower into falsehood stagnant putrescence loathsome accursed death or with whatever paroxysm to cast the falsehoods out of me and be cured and live   great wars contentions and disunion followed out of this reformation which last down to our day and are yet far from ended great talk and crimination has been made about these they are lamentable undeniable but after all what has luther or his cause to do with them it seems strange reasoning to charge the reformation with all this when hercules turned the purifying river into king augeass stables i have no doubt the confusion that resulted was considerable all around but i think it was not herculess blame it was some others blame the reformation might bring what results it liked when it came but the reformation simply could not help coming to all popes and popes advocates expostulating lamenting and accusing the answer of the world is once for all your popehood has become untrue no matter how good it was how good you say it is we cannot believe it the light of our whole mind given us to walk by from heaven above finds it henceforth a thing unbelievable we will not believe it we will not try to believe itwe dare not the thing is untrue we were traitors against the giver of all truth if we durst pretend to think it true away with it let whatsoever likes come in the place of it with it we can have no farther tradeluther and his protestantism is not responsible for wars the false simulacra that forced him to protest they are responsible luther did what every man that god has made has not only the right but lies under the sacred duty to do answered a falsehood when it questioned him dost thou believe menoat what cost soever without counting of costs this thing behooved to be done union organization spiritual and material a far nobler than any popedom or feudalism in their truest days i never doubt is coming for the world sure to come but on fact alone not on semblance and simulacrum will it be able either to come or to stand when come with union grounded on falsehood and ordering us to speak and act lies we will not have anything to do peace a brutal lethargy is peaceable the noisome grave is peaceable we hope for a living peace not a dead one  and yet in prizing justly the indispensable blessings of the new let us not be unjust to the old the old was true if it no longer is in dantes days it needed no sophistry selfblinding or other dishonesty to get itself reckoned true it was good then nay there is in the soul of it a deathless good the cry of no popery is foolish enough in these days the speculation that popery is on the increase building new chapels and so forth may pass for one of the idlest ever started very curious to count up a few popish chapels listen to a few protestant logicchoppingsto much dulldroning drowsy inanity that still calls itself protestant and say see protestantism is dead popeism is more alive than it will be alive after itdrowsy inanities not a few that call themselves protestant are dead but protestantism has not died yet that i hear of protestantism if we will look has in these days produced its goethe its napoleon german literature and the french revolution rather considerable signs of life nay at bottom what else is alive but protestantism the life of most else that one meets is a galvanic one merelynot a pleasant not a lasting sort of life  popery can build new chapels welcome to do so to all lengths popery cannot come back any more than paganism canwhich also still lingers in some countries but indeed it is with these things as with the ebbing of the sea you look at the waves oscillating hither thither on the beach for minutes you cannot tell how it is going look in half an hour where it islook in half a century where your popehood is alas would there were no greater danger to our europe than the poor old popes revival thor may as soon try to reviveand withal this oscillation has a meaning the poor old popehood will not die away entirely as thor has done for some time yet nor ought it we may say the old never dies till this happen till all the soul of good that was in it have got itself transfused into the practical new while a good work remains capable of being done by the romish form or what is inclusive of all while a pious life remains capable of being led by it just so long if we consider will this or the other human soul adopt it go about as a living witness of it so long it will obtrude itself on the eye of us who reject it till we in our practice too have appropriated whatsoever of truth was in it then but also not till then it will have no charm more for any man it lasts here for a purpose let it last as long as it can   of luther i will add now in reference to all these wars and bloodshed the noticeable fact that none of them began so long as he continued living the controversy did not get to fighting so long as he was there to me it is proof of his greatness in all senses this fact how seldom do we find a man that has stirred up some vast commotion who does not himself perish swept away in it such is the usual course of revolutionists luther continued in a good degree sovereign of this greatest revolution all protestants of what rank or function soever looking much to him for guidance and he held it peaceable continued firm at the centre of it a man to do this must have a kingly faculty he must have the gift to discern at all turns where the true heart of the matter lies and to plant himself courageously on that as a strong true man that other true men may rally round him there he will not continue leader of men otherwise luthers clear deep force of judgment his force of all sorts of silence of tolerance and moderation among others are very notable in these circumstances  tolerance i say a very genuine kind of tolerance he distinguishes what is essential and what is not the unessential may go very much as it will a complaint comes to him that such and such a reformed preacher will not preach without a cassock well answers luther what harm will a cassock do the man let him have a cassock to preach in let him have three cassocks if he find benefit in them his conduct in the matter of karlstadts wild imagebreaking of the anabaptists of the peasants war shows a noble strength very different from spasmodic violence with sure prompt insight he discriminates what is what a strong just man he speaks forth what is the wise course and all men follow him in that luthers written works give similar testimony of him the dialect of these speculations is now grown obsolete for us but one still reads them with a singular attraction and indeed the mere grammatical diction is still legible enough luthers merit in literary history is of the greatest his dialect became the language of all writing they are not well written these fourandtwenty quartos of his written hastily with quite other than literary objects but in no books have i found a more robust genuine i will say noble faculty of a man than in these a rugged honesty homeliness simplicity a rugged sterling sense and strength he dashes out illumination from him his smiting idiomatic phrases seem to cleave into the very secret of the matter good humor too nay tender affection nobleness and depth this man could have been a poet too he had to work an epic poem not write one i call him a great thinker as indeed his greatness of heart already betokens that  richter says of luthers words his words are halfbattles they may be called so the essential quality of him was that he could fight and conquer that he was a right piece of human valor no more valiant man no mortal heart to be called braver that one has record of ever lived in that teutonic kindred whose character is valor his defiance of the devils in worms was not a mere boast as the like might be if now spoken it was a faith of luthers that there were devils spiritual denizens of the pit continually besetting men many times in his writings this turns up and a most small sneer has been grounded on it by some in the room of the wartburg where he sat translating the bible they still show you a black spot on the wall the strange memorial of one of these conflicts luther sat translating one of the psalms he was worn down with long labor with sickness abstinence from food there rose before him some hideous indefinable image which he took for the evil one to forbid his work luther started up with fienddefiance flung his inkstand at the spectre and it disappeared the spot still remains there a curious monument of several things any apothecarys apprentice can now tell us what we are to think of this apparition in a scientific sense but the mans heart that dare rise defiant face to face against hell itself can give no higher proof of fearlessness the thing he will quail before exists not on this earth or under itfearless enough the devil is aware writes he on one occasion that this does not proceed out of fear in me i have seen and defied innumerable devils duke george of leipzig a great enemy of his duke george is not equal to one devilfar short of a devil if i had business at leipzig i would ride into leipzig though it rained duke georges for nine days running what a reservoir of dukes to ride into  at the same time they err greatly who imagine that this mans courage was ferocity mere coarse disobedient obstinacy and savagery as many do far from that there may be an absence of fear which arises from the absence of thought or affection from the presence of hatred and stupid fury we do not value the courage of the tiger highly with luther it was far otherwise no accusation could be more unjust than this of mere ferocious violence brought against him a most gentle heart withal full of pity and love as indeed the truly valiant heart ever is the tiger before a stronger foeflies the tiger is not what we call valiant only fierce and cruel i know few things more touching than those soft breathings of affection soft as a childs or a mothers in this great wild heart of luther so honest unadulterated with any cant homely rude in their utterance pure as water welling from the rock what in fact was all that downpressed mood of despair and reprobation which we saw in his youth but the outcome of preeminent thoughtful gentleness affections too keen and fine it is the course such men as the poor poet cowper fall into luther to a slight observer might have seemed a timid weak man modesty affectionate shrinking tenderness the chief distinction of him it is a noble valor which is roused in a heart like this once stirred up into defiance all kindled into a heavenly blaze  in luthers tabletalk a posthumous book of anecdotes and sayings collected by his friends the most interesting now of all the books proceeding from him we have many beautiful unconscious displays of the man and what sort of nature he had his behavior at the deathbed of his little daughter so still so great and loving is among the most affecting things he is resigned that his little magdalene should die yet longs inexpressibly that she might livefollows in awestruck thought the flight of her little soul through those unknown realms awestruck most heartfelt we can see and sincerefor after all dogmatic creeds and articles he feels what nothing it is that we know or can know his little magdalene shall be with god as god wills for luther too that is all islam is all  once he looks out from his solitary patmos the castle of coburg in the middle of the night the great vault of immensity long flights of clouds sailing through itdumb gaunt hugewho supports all that none ever saw the pillars of it yet it is supported god supports it we must know that god is great that god is good and trust where we cannot seereturning home from leipzig once he is struck by the beauty of the harvestfields how it stands that golden yellow corn on its fair taper stem its golden head bent all rich and waving therethe meek earth at gods kind bidding has produced it once again the bread of manin the garden at wittenberg one evening at sunset a little bird has perched for the night that little bird says luther above it are the stars and deep heaven of worlds yet it has folded its little wings gone trustfully to rest there as in its home the maker of it has given it too a homeneither are mirthful turns wanting there is a great free human heart in this man the common speech of him has a rugged nobleness idiomatic expressive genuine gleams here and there with beautiful poetic tints one feels him to be a great brother man his love of music indeed is not this as it were the summary of all these affections in him many a wild unutterability he spoke forth from him in the tones of his flute the devils fled from his flute he says deathdefiance on the one hand and such love of music on the other i could call these the two opposite poles of a great soul between these two all great things had room  luthers face is to me expressive of him in kranachs best portraits i find the true luther a rude plebeian face with its huge craglike brows and bones the emblem of rugged energy at first almost a repulsive face yet in the eyes especially there is a wild silent sorrow an unnamable melancholy the element of all gentle and fine affections giving to the rest the true stamp of nobleness laughter was in this luther as we said but tears also were there tears also were appointed him tears and hard toil the basis of his life was sadness earnestness in his latter days after all triumphs and victories he expresses himself heartily weary of living he considers that god alone can and will regulate the course things are taking and that perhaps the day of judgment is not far as for him he longs for one thing that god would release him from his labor and let him depart and be at rest they understand little of the man who cite this in discredit of himi will call this luther a true great man great in intellect in courage affection and integrity one of our most lovable and precious men great not as a hewn obelisk but as an alpine mountainso simple honest spontaneous not setting up to be great at all there for quite another purpose than being great ah yes unsubduable granite piercing far and wide into the heavens yet in the clefts of it fountains green beautiful valleys with flowers a right spiritual hero and prophet once more a true son of nature and fact for whom these centuries and many that are to come yet will be thankful to heaven   the most interesting phasis which the reformation anywhere assumes especially for us english is that of puritanism in luthers own country protestantism soon dwindled into a rather barren affair not a religion or faith but rather now a theological jangling of argument the proper seat of it not the heart the essence of it sceptical contention which indeed has jangled more and more down to voltaireism itselfthrough gustavusadolphus contentions onwards to frenchrevolution ones but in our island there arose a puritanism which even got itself established as a presbyterianism and national church among the scotch which came forth as a real business of the heart and has produced in the world very notable fruit in some senses one may say it is the only phasis of protestantism that ever got to the rank of being a faith a true heartcommunication with heaven and of exhibiting itself in history as such we must spare a few words for knox himself a brave and remarkable man but still more important as chief priest and founder which one may consider him to be of the faith that became scotlands new englands oliver cromwells history will have something to say about this for some time to come  we may censure puritanism as we please and no one of us i suppose but would find it a very rough defective thing but we and all men may understand that it was a genuine thing for nature has adopted it and it has grown and grows i say sometimes that all goes by wagerofbattle in this world that strength well understood is the measure of all worth give a thing time if it can succeed it is a right thing look now at american saxondom and at that little fact of the sailing of the mayflower two hundred years ago from delft haven in holland were we of open sense as the greeks were we had found a poem here one of natures own poems such as she writes in broad facts over great continents for it was properly the beginning of america there were straggling settlers in america before some material as of a body was there but the soul of it was first this these poor men driven out of their own country not able well to live in holland determine on settling in the new world black untamed forests are there and wild savage creatures but not so cruel as starchamber hangmen they thought the earth would yield them food if they tilled honestly the everlasting heaven would stretch there too overhead they should be left in peace to prepare for eternity by living well in this world of time worshipping in what they thought the true not the idolatrous way they clubbed their small means together hired a ship the little ship mayflower and made ready to set sail  in neals history of the puritans neal london 1755 i 490 is an account of the ceremony of their departure solemnity we might call it rather for it was a real act of worship their minister went down with them to the beach and their brethren whom they were to leave behind all joined in solemn prayer that god would have pity on his poor children and go with them into that waste wilderness for he also had made that he was there also as well as herehah these men i think had a work the weak thing weaker than a child becomes strong one day if it be a true thing puritanism was only despicable laughable then but nobody can manage to laugh at it now puritanism has got weapons and sinews it has firearms warnavies it has cunning in its ten fingers strength in its right arm it can steer ships fell forests remove mountainsit is one of the strongest things under this sun at present  in the history of scotland too i can find properly but one epoch we may say it contains nothing of worldinterest at all but this reformation by knox a poor barren country full of continual broils dissensions massacrings a people in the last state of rudeness and destitution little better perhaps than ireland at this day hungry fierce barons not so much as able to form any arrangement with each other how to divide what they fleeced from these poor drudges but obliged as the colombian republics are at this day to make of every alteration a revolution no way of changing a ministry but by hanging the old ministers on gibbets this is a historical spectacle of no very singular significance bravery enough i doubt not fierce fighting in abundance but not braver or fiercer than that of their old scandinavian seaking ancestors whose exploits we have not found worth dwelling on it is a country as yet without a soul nothing developed in it but what is rude external semianimal and now at the reformation the internal life is kindled as it were under the ribs of this outward material death a cause the noblest of causes kindles itself like a beacon set on high high as heaven yet attainable from earthwhereby the meanest man becomes not a citizen only but a member of christs visible church a veritable hero if he prove a true man  well this is what i mean by a whole nation of heroes a believing nation there needs not a great soul to make a hero there needs a godcreated soul which will be true to its origin that will be a great soul the like has been seen we find the like will be again seen under wider forms than the presbyterian there can be no lasting good done till thenimpossible say some possible has it not been in this world as a practiced fact did heroworship fail in knoxs case or are we made of other clay now did the westminster confession of faith add some new property to the soul of man god made the soul of man he did not doom any soul of man to live as a hypothesis and hearsay in a world filled with such and with the fatal work and fruit of such  but to return this that knox did for his nation i say we may really call a resurrection as from death it was not a smooth business but it was welcome surely and cheap at that price had it been far rougher on the whole cheap at any priceas life is the people began to live they needed first of all to do that at what cost and costs soever scotch literature and thought scotch industry james watt david hume walter scott robert burns i find knox and the reformation acting in the hearts core of every one of these persons and phenomena i find that without the reformation they would not have been or what of scotland the puritanism of scotland became that of england of new england a tumult in the high church of edinburgh spread into a universal battle and struggle over all these realmsthere came out after fifty years struggling what we all call the glorious revolution a habeas corpus act free parliaments and much elsealas is it not too true what we said that many men in the van do always like russian soldiers march into the ditch of schweidnitz and fill it up with their dead bodies that the rear may pass over them dryshod and gain the honor how many earnest rugged cromwells knoxes poor peasant covenanters wrestling battling for very life in rough miry places have to struggle and suffer and fall greatly censured bemiredbefore a beautiful revolution of eightyeight can step over them in official pumps and silkstockings with universal threetimesthree  it seems to me hard measure that this scottish man now after three hundred years should have to plead like a culprit before the world intrinsically for having been in such way as it was then possible to be the bravest of all scotchmen had he been a poor halfandhalf he could have crouched into the corner like so many others scotland had not been delivered and knox had been without blame he is the one scotchman to whom of all others his country and the world owe a debt he has to plead that scotland would forgive him for having been worth to it any million unblamable scotchmen that need no forgiveness he bared his breast to the battle had to row in french galleys wander forlorn in exile in clouds and storms was censured shot at through his windows had a right sore fighting life if this world were his place of recompense he had made but a bad venture of it i cannot apologize for knox to him it is very indifferent these two hundred and fifty years or more what men say of him but we having got above all those details of his battle and living now in clearness on the fruits of his victory we for our own sake ought to look through the rumors and controversies enveloping the man into the man himself  for one thing i will remark that this post of prophet to his nation was not of his seeking knox had lived forty years quietly obscure before he became conspicuous he was the son of poor parents had got a college education become a priest adopted the reformation and seemed well content to guide his own steps by the light of it nowise unduly intruding it on others he had lived as tutor in gentlemens families preaching when any body of persons wished to hear his doctrine resolute he to walk by the truth and speak the truth when called to do it not ambitious of more not fancying himself capable of more in this entirely obscure way he had reached the age of forty was with the small body of reformers who were standing siege in st andrews castlewhen one day in their chapel the preacher after finishing his exhortation to these fighters in the forlorn hope said suddenly that there ought to be other speakers that all men who had a priests heart and gift in them ought now to speakwhich gifts and heart one of their own number john knox the name of him had had he not said the preacher appealing to all the audience what then is his duty the people answered affirmatively it was a criminal forsaking of his post if such a man held the word that was in him silent poor knox was obliged to stand up he attempted to reply he could say no wordburst into a flood of tears and ran out it is worth remembering that scene he was in grievous trouble for some days he felt what a small faculty was his for this great work he felt what a baptism he was called to be baptized withal he burst into tears  our primary characteristic of a hero that he is sincere applies emphatically to knox it is not denied anywhere that this whatever might be his other qualities or faults is among the truest of men with a singular instinct he holds to the truth and fact the truth alone is there for him the rest a mere shadow and deceptive nonentity however feeble forlorn the reality may seem on that and that only can he take his stand in the galleys of the river loire whither knox and the others after their castle of st andrews was taken had been sent as galleyslavessome officer or priest one day presented them an image of the virgin mother requiring that they the blasphemous heretics should do it reverence mother mother of god said knox when the turn came to him this is no mother of god this is a pented bredda piece of wood i tell you with paint on it she is fitter for swimming i think than for being worshipped added knox and flung the thing into the river it was not very cheap jesting there but come of it what might this thing to knox was and must continue nothing other than the real truth it was a pented bredd worship it he would not  he told his fellowprisoners in this darkest time to be of courage the cause they had was the true one and must and would prosper the whole world could not put it down reality is of gods making it is alone strong how many pented bredds pretending to be real are fitter to swim than to be worshippedthis knox cannot live but by fact he clings to reality as the shipwrecked sailor to the cliff he is an instance to us how a man by sincerity itself becomes heroic it is the grand gift he has we find in knox a good honest intellectual talent no transcendent onea narrow inconsiderable man as compared with luther but in heartfelt instinctive adherence to truth in sincerity as we say he has no superior nay one might ask what equal he has the heart of him is of the true prophet cast he lies there said the earl of morton at his grave who never feared the face of man he resembles more than any of the moderns an oldhebrew prophet the same inflexibility intolerance rigid narrowlooking adherence to gods truth stern rebuke in the name of god to all that forsake truth an oldhebrew prophet in the guise of an edinburgh minister of the sixteenth century we are to take him for that not require him to be other  knoxs conduct to queen mary the harsh visits he used to make in her own palace to reprove her there have been much commented upon such cruelty such coarseness fills us with indignation on reading the actual narrative of the business what knox said and what knox meant i must say ones tragic feeling is rather disappointed they are not so coarse these speeches they seem to me about as fine as the circumstances would permit knox was not there to do the courtier he came on another errand whoever reading these colloquies of his with the queen thinks they are vulgar insolences of a plebeian priest to a delicate high lady mistakes the purport and essence of them altogether it was unfortunately not possible to be polite with the queen of scotland unless one proved untrue to the nation and cause of scotland a man who did not wish to see the land of his birth made a huntingfield for intriguing ambitious guises and the cause of god trampled underfoot of falsehoods formulas and the devils cause had no method of making himself agreeable better that women weep said morton than that bearded men be forced to weep knox was the constitutional oppositionparty in scotland the nobles of the country called by their station to take that post were not found in it knox had to go or no one the hapless queenbut the still more hapless country if she were made happy mary herself was not without sharpness enough among her other qualities who are you said she once that presume to school the nobles and sovereign of this realmmadam a subject born within the same answered he reasonably answered if the subject have truth to speak it is not the subjects footing that will fail him here  we blame knox for his intolerance well surely it is good that each of us be as tolerant as possible yet at bottom after all the talk there is and has been about it what is tolerance tolerance has to tolerate the unessential and to see well what that is tolerance has to be noble measured just in its very wrath when it can tolerate no longer but on the whole we are not altogether here to tolerate we are here to resist to control and vanquish withal we do not tolerate falsehoods thieveries iniquities when they fasten on us we say to them thou art false thou art not tolerable we are here to extinguish falsehoods and put an end to them in some wise way i will not quarrel so much with the way the doing of the thing is our great concern in this sense knox was full surely intolerant  a man sent to row in french galleys and such like for teaching the truth in his own land cannot always be in the mildest humor i am not prepared to say that knox had a soft temper nor do i know that he had what we call an ill temper an ill nature he decidedly had not kind honest affections dwelt in the muchenduring hardworn everbattling man that he could rebuke queens and had such weight among those proud turbulent nobles proud enough whatever else they were and could maintain to the end a kind of virtual presidency and sovereignty in that wild realm he who was only a subject born within the same this of itself will prove to us that he was found close at hand to be no mean acrid man but at heart a healthful strong sagacious man such alone can bear rule in that kind they blame him for pulling down cathedrals and so forth as if he were a seditious rioting demagogue precisely the reverse is seen to be the fact in regard to cathedrals and the rest of it if we examine knox wanted no pulling down of stone edifices he wanted leprosy and darkness to be thrown out of the lives of men tumult was not his element it was the tragic feature of his life that he was forced to dwell so much in that every such man is the born enemy of disorder hates to be in it but what then smooth falsehood is not order it is the general sumtotal of disorder order is trutheach thing standing on the basis that belongs to it order and falsehood cannot subsist together  withal unexpectedly enough this knox has a vein of drollery in him which i like much in combination with his other qualities he has a true eye for the ridiculous his history with its rough earnestness is curiously enlivened with this when the two prelates entering glasgow cathedral quarrel about precedence march rapidly up take to hustling one another twitching one anothers rochets and at last flourishing their crosiers like quarterstaves it is a great sight for him every way not mockery scorn bitterness alone though there is enough of that too but a true loving illuminating laugh mounts up over the earnest visage not a loud laugh you would say a laugh in the eyes most of all an honesthearted brotherly man brother to the high brother also to the low sincere in his sympathy with both he had his pipe of bourdeaux too we find in that old edinburgh house of his a cheery social man with faces that loved him they go far wrong who think this knox was a gloomy spasmodic shrieking fanatic not at all he is one of the solidest of men practical cautioushopeful patient a most shrewd observing quietly discerning man in fact he has very much the type of character we assign to the scotch at present a certain sardonic taciturnity is in him insight enough and a stouter heart than he himself knows of he has the power of holding his peace over many things which do not vitally concern himthey what are they but the thing which does vitally concern him that thing he will speak of and in a tone the whole world shall be made to hear all the more emphatic for his long silence  this prophet of the scotch is to me no hateful manhe had a sore fight of an existence wrestling with popes and principalities in defeat contention lifelong struggle rowing as a galleyslave wandering as an exile a sore fight but he won it have you hope they asked him in his last moment when he could no longer speak he lifted his finger pointed upwards with his finger and so died honor to him his works have not died the letter of his work dies as of all mens but the spirit of it never  one word more as to the letter of knoxs work the unforgivable offence in him is that he wished to set up priests over the head of kings in other words he strove to make the government of scotland a theocracy this indeed is properly the sum of his offences the essential sin for which what pardon can there be it is most true he did at bottom consciously or unconsciously mean a theocracy or government of god he did mean that kings and prime ministers and all manner of persons in public or private diplomatizing or whatever else they might be doing should walk according to the gospel of christ and understand that this was their law supreme over all laws he hoped once to see such a thing realized and the petition thy kingdom come no longer an empty word he was sore grieved when he saw greedy worldly barons clutch hold of the churchs property when he expostulated that it was not secular property that it was spiritual property and should be turned to true churchly uses education schools worshipand the regent murray had to answer with a shrug of the shoulders it is a devout imagination this was knoxs scheme of right and truth this he zealously endeavored after to realize it if we think his scheme of truth was too narrow was not true we may rejoice that he could not realize it that it remained after two centuries of effort unrealizable and is a devout imagination still but how shall we blame him for struggling to realize it theocracy government of god is precisely the thing to be struggled for all prophets zealous priests are there for that purpose hildebrand wished a theocracy cromwell wished it fought for it mahomet attained it nay is it not what all zealous men whether called priests prophets or whatsoever else called do essentially wish and must wish that right and truth or gods law reign supreme among men this is the heavenly ideal well named in knoxs time and namable in all times a revealed will of god towards which the reformer will insist that all be more and more approximated all true reformers as i said are by the nature of them priests and strive for a theocracy  how far such ideals can ever be introduced into practice and at what point our impatience with their nonintroduction ought to begin is always a question i think we may say safely let them introduce themselves as far as they can contrive to do it if they are the true faith of men all men ought to be more or less impatient always where they are not found introduced there will never be wanting regent murrays enough to shrug their shoulders and say a devout imagination we will praise the heropriest rather who does what is in him to bring them in and wears out in toil calumny contradiction a noble life to make a gods kingdom of this earth the earth will not become too godlike     lecture v the hero as man of letters johnson rousseau burns  may 19 1840  herogods prophets poets priests are forms of heroism that belong to the old ages make their appearance in the remotest times some of them have ceased to be possible long since and cannot any more show themselves in this world the hero as man of letters again of which class we are to speak today is altogether a product of these new ages and so long as the wondrous art of writing or of readywriting which we call printing subsists he may be expected to continue as one of the main forms of heroism for all future ages he is in various respects a very singular phenomenon  he is new i say he has hardly lasted above a century in the world yet never till about a hundred years ago was there seen any figure of a great soul living apart in that anomalous manner endeavoring to speak forth the inspiration that was in him by printed books and find place and subsistence by what the world would please to give him for doing that much had been sold and bought and left to make its own bargain in the marketplace but the inspired wisdom of a heroic soul never till then in that naked manner he with his copyrights and copywrongs in his squalid garret in his rusty coat ruling for this is what he does from his grave after death whole nations and generations who would or would not give him bread while livingis a rather curious spectacle few shapes of heroism can be more unexpected  alas the hero from of old has had to cramp himself into strange shapes the world knows not well at any time what to do with him so foreign is his aspect in the world it seemed absurd to us that men in their rude admiration should take some wise great odin for a god and worship him as such some wise great mahomet for one godinspired and religiously follow his law for twelve centuries but that a wise great johnson a burns a rousseau should be taken for some idle nondescript extant in the world to amuse idleness and have a few coins and applauses thrown him that he might live thereby this perhaps as before hinted will one day seem a still absurder phasis of thingsmeanwhile since it is the spiritual always that determines the material this same manofletters hero must be regarded as our most important modern person he such as he may be is the soul of all what he teaches the whole world will do and make the worlds manner of dealing with him is the most significant feature of the worlds general position looking well at his life we may get a glance as deep as is readily possible for us into the life of those singular centuries which have produced him in which we ourselves live and work  there are genuine men of letters and not genuine as in every kind there is a genuine and a spurious if hero be taken to mean genuine then i say the hero as man of letters will be found discharging a function for us which is ever honorable ever the highest and was once well known to be the highest he is uttering forth in such way as he has the inspired soul of him all that a man in any case can do i say inspired for what we call originality sincerity genius the heroic quality we have no good name for signifies that the hero is he who lives in the inward sphere of things in the true divine and eternal which exists always unseen to most under the temporary trivial his being is in that he declares that abroad by act or speech as it may be in declaring himself abroad his life as we said before is a piece of the everlasting heart of nature herself all mens life isbut the weak many know not the fact and are untrue to it in most times the strong few are strong heroic perennial because it cannot be hidden from them the man of letters like every hero is there to proclaim this in such sort as he can intrinsically it is the same function which the old generations named a man prophet priest divinity for doing which all manner of heroes by speech or by act are sent into the world to do  fichte the german philosopher delivered some forty years ago at erlangen a highly remarkable course of lectures on this subject ueber das wesen des gelehrten on the nature of the literary man fichte in conformity with the transcendental philosophy of which he was a distinguished teacher declares first that all things which we see or work with in this earth especially we ourselves and all persons are as a kind of vesture or sensuous appearance that under all there lies as the essence of them what he calls the divine idea of the world this is the reality which lies at the bottom of all appearance to the mass of men no such divine idea is recognizable in the world they live merely says fichte among the superficialities practicalities and shows of the world not dreaming that there is anything divine under them but the man of letters is sent hither specially that he may discern for himself and make manifest to us this same divine idea in every new generation it will manifest itself in a new dialect and he is there for the purpose of doing that such is fichtes phraseology with which we need not quarrel it is his way of naming what i here by other words am striving imperfectly to name what there is at present no name for the unspeakable divine significance full of splendor of wonder and terror that lies in the being of every man of every thingthe presence of the god who made every man and thing mahomet taught this in his dialect odin in his it is the thing which all thinking hearts in one dialect or another are here to teach  fichte calls the man of letters therefore a prophet or as he prefers to phrase it a priest continually unfolding the godlike to men men of letters are a perpetual priesthood from age to age teaching all men that a god is still present in their life that all appearance whatsoever we see in the world is but as a vesture for the divine idea of the world for that which lies at the bottom of appearance in the true literary man there is thus ever acknowledged or not by the world a sacredness he is the light of the world the worlds priestguiding it like a sacred pillar of fire in its dark pilgrimage through the waste of time fichte discriminates with sharp zeal the true literary man what we here call the hero as man of letters from multitudes of false unheroic whoever lives not wholly in this divine idea or living partially in it struggles not as for the one good to live wholly in ithe is let him live where else he like in what pomps and prosperities he like no literary man he is says fichte a bungler stumper or at best if he belong to the prosaic provinces he may be a hodman fichte even calls him elsewhere a nonentity and has in short no mercy for him no wish that he should continue happy among us this is fichtes notion of the man of letters it means in its own form precisely what we here mean  in this point of view i consider that for the last hundred years by far the notablest of all literary men is fichtes countryman goethe to that man too in a strange way there was given what we may call a life in the divine idea of the world vision of the inward divine mystery and strangely out of his books the world rises imaged once more as godlike the workmanship and temple of a god illuminated all not in fierce impure firesplendor as of mahomet but in mild celestial radiancereally a prophecy in these most unprophetic times to my mind by far the greatest though one of the quietest among all the great things that have come to pass in them our chosen specimen of the hero as literary man would be this goethe and it were a very pleasant plan for me here to discourse of his heroism for i consider him to be a true hero heroic in what he said and did and perhaps still more in what he did not say and did not do to me a noble spectacle a great heroic ancient man speaking and keeping silence as an ancient hero in the guise of a most modern highbred highcultivated man of letters we have had no such spectacle no man capable of affording such for the last hundred and fifty years  but at present such is the general state of knowledge about goethe it were worse than useless to attempt speaking of him in this case speak as i might goethe to the great majority of you would remain problematic vague no impression but a false one could be realized him we must leave to future times johnson burns rousseau three great figures from a prior time from a far inferior state of circumstances will suit us better here three men of the eighteenth century the conditions of their life far more resemble what those of ours still are in england than what goethes in germany were alas these men did not conquer like him they fought bravely and fell they were not heroic bringers of the light but heroic seekers of it they lived under galling conditions struggling as under mountains of impediment and could not unfold themselves into clearness or victorious interpretation of that divine idea it is rather the tombs of three literary heroes that i have to show you there are the monumental heaps under which three spiritual giants lie buried very mournful but also great and full of interest for us we will linger by them for a while   complaint is often made in these times of what we call the disorganized condition of society how ill many forces of society fulfil their work how many powerful are seen working in a wasteful chaotic altogether unarranged manner it is too just a complaint as we all know but perhaps if we look at this of books and the writers of books we shall find here as it were the summary of all other disorganizationsa sort of heart from which and to which all other confusion circulates in the world considering what book writers do in the world and what the world does with book writers i should say it is the most anomalous thing the world at present has to showwe should get into a sea far beyond sounding did we attempt to give account of this but we must glance at it for the sake of our subject the worst element in the life of these three literary heroes was that they found their business and position such a chaos on the beaten road there is tolerable travelling but it is sore work and many have to perish fashioning a path through the impassable  our pious fathers feeling well what importance lay in the speaking of man to men founded churches made endowments regulations everywhere in the civilized world there is a pulpit environed with all manner of complex dignified appurtenances and furtherances that therefrom a man with the tongue may to best advantage address his fellowmen they felt that this was the most important thing that without this there was no good thing it is a right pious work that of theirs beautiful to behold but now with the art of writing with the art of printing a total change has come over that business the writer of a book is not he a preacher preaching not to this parish or that on this day or that but to all men in all times and places surely it is of the last importance that he do his work right whoever do it wrongthat the eye report not falsely for then all the other members are astray well how he may do his work whether he do it right or wrong or do it at all is a point which no man in the world has taken the pains to think of to a certain shopkeeper trying to get some money for his books if lucky he is of some importance to no other man of any whence he came whither he is bound by what ways he arrived by what he might be furthered on his course no one asks he is an accident in society he wanders like a wild ishmaelite in a world of which he is as the spiritual light either the guidance or the misguidance  certainly the art of writing is the most miraculous of all things man has devised odins runes were the first form of the work of a hero books written words are still miraculous runes the latest form in books lies the soul of the whole past time the articulate audible voice of the past when the body and material substance of it has altogether vanished like a dream mighty fleets and armies harbors and arsenals vast cities highdomed manyenginedthey are precious great but what do they become agamemnon the many agamemnons pericleses and their greece all is gone now to some ruined fragments dumb mournful wrecks and blocks but the books of greece there greece to every thinker still very literally lives can be called up again into life no magic rune is stranger than a book all that mankind has done thought gained or been it is lying as in magic preservation in the pages of books they are the chosen possession of men  do not books still accomplish miracles as runes were fabled to do they persuade men not the wretchedest circulatinglibrary novel which foolish girls thumb and con in remote villages but will help to regulate the actual practical weddings and households of those foolish girls so celia felt so clifford acted the foolish theorem of life stamped into those young brains comes out as a solid practice one day consider whether any rune in the wildest imagination of mythologist ever did such wonders as on the actual firm earth some books have done what built st pauls cathedral look at the heart of the matter it was that divine hebrew bookthe word partly of the man moses an outlaw tending his midianitish herds four thousand years ago in the wildernesses of sinai it is the strangest of things yet nothing is truer with the art of writing of which printing is a simple an inevitable and comparatively insignificant corollary the true reign of miracles for mankind commenced it related with a wondrous new contiguity and perpetual closeness the past and distant with the present in time and place all times and all places with this our actual here and now all things were altered for men all modes of important work of men teaching preaching governing and all else  to look at teaching for instance universities are a notable respectable product of the modern ages their existence too is modified to the very basis of it by the existence of books universities arose while there were yet no books procurable while a man for a single book had to give an estate of land that in those circumstances when a man had some knowledge to communicate he should do it by gathering the learners round him face to face was a necessity for him if you wanted to know what abelard knew you must go and listen to abelard thousands as many as thirty thousand went to hear abelard and that metaphysical theology of his and now for any other teacher who had also something of his own to teach there was a great convenience opened so many thousands eager to learn were already assembled yonder of all places the best place for him was that for any third teacher it was better still and grew ever the better the more teachers there came it only needed now that the king took notice of this new phenomenon combined or agglomerated the various schools into one school gave it edifices privileges encouragements and named it universitas or school of all sciences the university of paris in its essential characters was there the model of all subsequent universities which down even to these days for six centuries now have gone on to found themselves such i conceive was the origin of universities  it is clear however that with this simple circumstance facility of getting books the whole conditions of the business from top to bottom were changed once invent printing you metamorphosed all universities or superseded them the teacher needed not now to gather men personally round him that he might speak to them what he knew print it in a book and all learners far and wide for a trifle had it each at his own fireside much more effectually to learn itdoubtless there is still peculiar virtue in speech even writers of books may still in some circumstances find it convenient to speak alsowitness our present meeting here there is one would say and must ever remain while man has a tongue a distinct province for speech as well as for writing and printing in regard to all things this must remain to universities among others but the limits of the two have nowhere yet been pointed out ascertained much less put in practice the university which would completely take in that great new fact of the existence of printed books and stand on a clear footing for the nineteenth century as the paris one did for the thirteenth has not yet come into existence if we think of it all that a university or final highest school can do for us is still but what the first school began doingteach us to read we learn to read in various languages in various sciences we learn the alphabet and letters of all manner of books but the place where we are to get knowledge even theoretic knowledge is the books themselves it depends on what we read after all manner of professors have done their best for us the true university of these days is a collection of books  but to the church itself as i hinted already all is changed in its preaching in its working by the introduction of books the church is the working recognized union of our priests or prophets of those who by wise teaching guide the souls of men while there was no writing even while there was no easywriting or printing the preaching of the voice was the natural sole method of performing this but now with bookshe that can write a true book to persuade england is not he the bishop and archbishop the primate of england and of all england i many a time say the writers of newspapers pamphlets poems books these are the real working effective church of a modern country nay not only our preaching but even our worship is not it too accomplished by means of printed books the noble sentiment which a gifted soul has clothed for us in melodious words which brings melody into our heartsis not this essentially if we will understand it of the nature of worship there are many in all countries who in this confused time have no other method of worship he who in any way shows us better than we knew before that a lily of the fields is beautiful does he not show it us as an effluence of the fountain of all beauty as the handwriting made visible there of the great maker of the universe he has sung for us made us sing with him a little verse of a sacred psalm essentially so how much more he who sings who says or in any way brings home to our heart the noble doings feelings darings and endurances of a brother man he has verily touched our hearts as with a live coal from the altar perhaps there is no worship more authentic  literature so far as it is literature is an apocalypse of nature a revealing of the open secret it may well enough be named in fichtes style a continuous revelation of the godlike in the terrestrial and common the godlike does ever in very truth endure there is brought out now in this dialect now in that with various degrees of clearness all true gifted singers and speakers are consciously or unconsciously doing so the dark stormful indignation of a byron so wayward and perverse may have touches of it nay the withered mockery of a french sceptichis mockery of the false a love and worship of the true how much more the sphereharmony of a shakspeare of a goethe the cathedral music of a milton they are something too those humble genuine larknotes of a burnsskylark starting from the humble furrow far overhead into the blue depths and singing to us so genuinely there for all true singing is of the nature of worship as indeed all true working may be said to bewhereof such singing is but the record and fit melodious representation to us fragments of a real church liturgy and body of homilies strangely disguised from the common eye are to be found weltering in that huge frothocean of printed speech we loosely call literature books are our church too  or turning now to the government of men witenagemote old parliament was a great thing the affairs of the nation were there deliberated and decided what we were to do as a nation but does not though the name parliament subsists the parliamentary debate go on now everywhere and at all times in a far more comprehensive way out of parliament altogether burke said there were three estates in parliament but in the reporters gallery yonder there sat a fourth estate more important far than they all it is not a figure of speech or a witty saying it is a literal factvery momentous to us in these times literature is our parliament too printing which comes necessarily out of writing i say often is equivalent to democracy invent writing democracy is inevitable writing brings printing brings universal everyday extempore printing as we see at present whoever can speak speaking now to the whole nation becomes a power a branch of government with inalienable weight in lawmaking in all acts of authority it matters not what rank he has what revenues or garnitures the requisite thing is that he have a tongue which others will listen to this and nothing more is requisite the nation is governed by all that has tongue in the nation democracy is virtually there add only that whatsoever power exists will have itself by and by organized working secretly under bandages obscurations obstructions it will never rest till it get to work free unencumbered visible to all democracy virtually extant will insist on becoming palpably extant  on all sides are we not driven to the conclusion that of the things which man can do or make here below by far the most momentous wonderful and worthy are the things we call books those poor bits of ragpaper with black ink on themfrom the daily newspaper to the sacred hebrew book what have they not done what are they not doingfor indeed whatever be the outward form of the thing bits of paper as we say and black ink is it not verily at bottom the highest act of mans faculty that produces a book it is the thought of man the true thaumaturgic virtue by which man works all things whatsoever all that he does and brings to pass is the vesture of a thought this london city with all its houses palaces steamengines cathedrals and huge immeasurable traffic and tumult what is it but a thought but millions of thoughts made into onea huge immeasurable spirit of a thought embodied in brick in iron smoke dust palaces parliaments hackney coaches katherine docks and the rest of it not a brick was made but some man had to think of the making of that brickthe thing we called bits of paper with traces of black ink is the purest embodiment a thought of man can have no wonder it is in all ways the activest and noblest  all this of the importance and supreme importance of the man of letters in modern society and how the press is to such a degree superseding the pulpit the senate the senatus academicus and much else has been admitted for a good while and recognized often enough in late times with a sort of sentimental triumph and wonderment it seems to me the sentimental by and by will have to give place to the practical if men of letters are so incalculably influential actually performing such work for us from age to age and even from day to day then i think we may conclude that men of letters will not always wander like unrecognized unregulated ishmaelites among us whatsoever thing as i said above has virtual unnoticed power will cast off its wrappages bandages and step forth one day with palpably articulated universally visible power that one man wear the clothes and take the wages of a function which is done by quite another there can be no profit in this this is not right it is wrong and yet alas the making of it rightwhat a business for long times to come sure enough this that we call organization of the literary guild is still a great way off encumbered with all manner of complexities if you asked me what were the best possible organization for the men of letters in modern society the arrangement of furtherance and regulation grounded the most accurately on the actual facts of their position and of the worlds positioni should beg to say that the problem far exceeded my faculty it is not one mans faculty it is that of many successive men turned earnestly upon it that will bring out even an approximate solution what the best arrangement were none of us could say but if you ask which is the worst i answer this which we now have that chaos should sit umpire in it this is the worst to the best or any good one there is yet a long way  one remark i must not omit that royal or parliamentary grants of money are by no means the chief thing wanted to give our men of letters stipends endowments and all furtherance of cash will do little towards the business on the whole one is weary of hearing about the omnipotence of money i will say rather that for a genuine man it is no evil to be poor that there ought to be literary men poorto show whether they are genuine or not mendicant orders bodies of good men doomed to beg were instituted in the christian church a most natural and even necessary development of the spirit of christianity it was itself founded on poverty on sorrow contradiction crucifixion every species of worldly distress and degradation we may say that he who has not known those things and learned from them the priceless lessons they have to teach has missed a good opportunity of schooling to beg and go barefoot in coarse woollen cloak with a rope round your loins and be despised of all the world was no beautiful businessnor an honorable one in any eye till the nobleness of those who did so had made it honored of some  begging is not in our course at the present time but for the rest of it who will say that a johnson is not perhaps the better for being poor it is needful for him at all rates to know that outward profit that success of any kind is not the goal he has to aim at pride vanity illconditioned egoism of all sorts are bred in his heart as in every heart need above all to be cast out of his heartto be with whatever pangs torn out of it cast forth from it as a thing worthless byron born rich and noble made out even less than burns poor and plebeian who knows but in that same best possible organization as yet far off poverty may still enter as an important element what if our men of letters men setting up to be spiritual heroes were still then as they now are a kind of involuntary monastic order bound still to this same ugly povertytill they had tried what was in it too till they had learned to make it too do for them money in truth can do much but it cannot do all we must know the province of it and confine it there and even spurn it back when it wishes to get farther  besides were the moneyfurtherances the proper season for them the fit assigner of them all settledhow is the burns to be recognized that merits these he must pass through the ordeal and prove himself this ordeal this wild welter of a chaos which is called literary life this too is a kind of ordeal there is clear truth in the idea that a struggle from the lower classes of society towards the upper regions and rewards of society must ever continue strong men are born there who ought to stand elsewhere than there the manifold inextricably complex universal struggle of these constitutes and must constitute what is called the progress of society for men of letters as for all other sorts of men how to regulate that struggle there is the whole question to leave it as it is at the mercy of blind chance a whirl of distracted atoms one cancelling the other one of the thousand arriving saved nine hundred and ninetynine lost by the way your royal johnson languishing inactive in garrets or harnessed to the yoke of printer cave your burns dying brokenhearted as a gauger your rousseau driven into mad exasperation kindling french revolutions by his paradoxes this as we said is clearly enough the worst regulation the best alas is far from us  and yet there can be no doubt but it is coming advancing on us as yet hidden in the bosom of centuries this is a prophecy one can risk for so soon as men get to discern the importance of a thing they do infallibly set about arranging it facilitating forwarding it and rest not till in some approximate degree they have accomplished that i say of all priesthoods aristocracies governing classes at present extant in the world there is no class comparable for importance to that priesthood of the writers of books this is a fact which he who runs may readand draw inferences from literature will take care of itself answered mr pitt when applied to for some help for burns yes adds mr southey it will take care of itself and of you too if you do not look to it  the result to individual men of letters is not the momentous one they are but individuals an infinitesimal fraction of the great body they can struggle on and live or else die as they have been wont but it deeply concerns the whole society whether it will set its light on high places to walk thereby or trample it under foot and scatter it in all ways of wild waste not without conflagration as heretofore light is the one thing wanted for the world put wisdom in the head of the world the world will fight its battle victoriously and be the best world man can make it i called this anomaly of a disorganic literary class the heart of all other anomalies at once product and parent some good arrangement for that would be as the punctum saliens of a new vitality and just arrangement for all already in some european countries in france in prussia one traces some beginnings of an arrangement for the literary class indicating the gradual possibility of such i believe that it is possible that it will have to be possible  by far the most interesting fact i hear about the chinese is one on which we cannot arrive at clearness but which excites endless curiosity even in the dim state this namely that they do attempt to make their men of letters their governors it would be rash to say one understood how this was done or with what degree of success it was done all such things must be very unsuccessful yet a small degree of success is precious the very attempt how precious there does seem to be all over china a more or less active search everywhere to discover the men of talent that grow up in the young generation schools there are for every one a foolish sort of training yet still a sort the youths who distinguish themselves in the lower school are promoted into favorable stations in the higher that they may still more distinguish themselvesforward and forward it appears to be out of these that the official persons and incipient governors are taken these are they whom they try first whether they can govern or not and surely with the best hope for they are the men that have already shown intellect try them they have not governed or administered as yet perhaps they cannot but there is no doubt they have some understandingwithout which no man can neither is understanding a tool as we are too apt to figure it is a hand which can handle any tool try these men they are of all others the best worth tryingsurely there is no kind of government constitution revolution social apparatus or arrangement that i know of in this world so promising to ones scientific curiosity as this the man of intellect at the top of affairs this is the aim of all constitutions and revolutions if they have any aim for the man of true intellect as i assert and believe always is the noblehearted man withal the true just humane and valiant man get him for governor all is got fail to get him though you had constitutions plentiful as blackberries and a parliament in every village there is nothing yet got  these things look strange truly and are not such as we commonly speculate upon but we are fallen into strange times these things will require to be speculated upon to be rendered practicable to be in some way put in practice these and many others on all hands of us there is the announcement audible enough that the old empire of routine has ended that to say a thing has long been is no reason for its continuing to be the things which have been are fallen into decay are fallen into incompetence large masses of mankind in every society of our europe are no longer capable of living at all by the things which have been when millions of men can no longer by their utmost exertion gain food for themselves and the third man for thirtysix weeks each year is short of thirdrate potatoes the things which have been must decidedly prepare to alter themselvesi will now quit this of the organization of men of letters   alas the evil that pressed heaviest on those literary heroes of ours was not the want of organization for men of letters but a far deeper one out of which indeed this and so many other evils for the literary man and for all men had as from their fountain taken rise that our hero as man of letters had to travel without highway companionless through an inorganic chaosand to leave his own life and faculty lying there as a partial contribution towards pushing some highway through it this had not his faculty itself been so perverted and paralyzed he might have put up with might have considered to be but the common lot of heroes his fatal misery was the spiritual paralysis so we may name it of the age in which his life lay whereby his life too do what he might was half paralyzed the eighteenth was a sceptical century in which little word there is a whole pandoras box of miseries scepticism means not intellectual doubt alone but moral doubt all sorts of infidelity insincerity spiritual paralysis perhaps in few centuries that one could specify since the world began was a life of heroism more difficult for a man that was not an age of faithan age of heroes the very possibility of heroism had been as it were formally abnegated in the minds of all heroism was gone forever triviality formulism and commonplace were come forever the age of miracles had been or perhaps had not been but it was not any longer an effete world wherein wonder greatness godhood could not now dwellin one word a godless world  how mean dwarfish are their ways of thinking in this timecompared not with the christian shakspeares and miltons but with the old pagan skalds with any species of believing men the living tree igdrasil with the melodious prophetic waving of its worldwide boughs deeprooted as hela has died out into the clanking of a worldmachine tree and machine contrast these two things i for my share declare the world to be no machine i say that it does not go by wheelandpinion motives selfinterests checks balances that there is something far other in it than the clank of spinningjennies and parliamentary majorities and on the whole that it is not a machine at allthe old norse heathen had a truer motion of godsworld than these poor machinesceptics the old heathen norse were sincere men but for these poor sceptics there was no sincerity no truth halftruth and hearsay was called truth truth for most men meant plausibility to be measured by the number of votes you could get they had lost any notion that sincerity was possible or of what sincerity was how many plausibilities asking with unaffected surprise and the air of offended virtue what am not i sincere spiritual paralysis i say nothing left but a mechanical life was the characteristic of that century for the common man unless happily he stood below his century and belonged to another prior one it was impossible to be a believer a hero he lay buried unconscious under these baleful influences to the strongest man only with infinite struggle and confusion was it possible to work himself half loose and lead as it were in an enchanted most tragical way a spiritual deathinlife and be a halfhero  scepticism is the name we give to all this as the chief symptom as the chief origin of all this concerning which so much were to be said it would take many discourses not a small fraction of one discourse to state what one feels about that eighteenth century and its ways as indeed this and the like of this which we now call scepticism is precisely the black malady and lifefoe against which all teaching and discoursing since mans life began has directed itself the battle of belief against unbelief is the neverending battle neither is it in the way of crimination that one would wish to speak scepticism for that century we must consider as the decay of old ways of believing the preparation afar off for new better and wider waysan inevitable thing we will not blame men for it we will lament their hard fate we will understand that destruction of old forms is not destruction of everlasting substances that scepticism as sorrowful and hateful as we see it is not an end but a beginning  the other day speaking without prior purpose that way of benthams theory of man and mans life i chanced to call it a more beggarly one than mahomets i am bound to say now when it is once uttered that such is my deliberate opinion not that one would mean offence against the man jeremy bentham or those who respect and believe him bentham himself and even the creed of bentham seems to me comparatively worthy of praise it is a determinate being what all the world in a cowardly halfandhalf manner was tending to be let us have the crisis we shall either have death or the cure i call this gross steamengine utilitarianism an approach towards new faith it was a layingdown of cant a saying to oneself well then this world is a dead iron machine the god of it gravitation and selfish hunger let us see what by checking and balancing and good adjustment of tooth and pinion can be made of it benthamism has something complete manful in such fearless committal of itself to what it finds true you may call it heroic though a heroism with its eyes put out it is the culminating point and fearless ultimatum of what lay in the halfandhalf state pervading mans whole existence in that eighteenth century it seems to me all deniers of godhood and all lipbelievers of it are bound to be benthamites if they have courage and honesty benthamism is an eyeless heroism the human species like a hapless blinded samson grinding in the philistine mill clasps convulsively the pillars of its mill brings huge ruin down but ultimately deliverance withal of bentham i meant to say no harm  but this i do say and would wish all men to know and lay to heart that he who discerns nothing but mechanism in the universe has in the fatalest way missed the secret of the universe altogether that all godhood should vanish out of mens conception of this universe seems to me precisely the most brutal errori will not disparage heathenism by calling it a heathen errorthat men could fall into it is not true it is false at the very heart of it a man who thinks so will think wrong about all things in the world this original sin will vitiate all other conclusions he can form one might call it the most lamentable of delusionsnot forgetting witchcraft itself witchcraft worshipped at least a living devil but this worships a dead iron devil no god not even a devil whatsoever is noble divine inspired drops thereby out of life there remains everywhere in life a despicable caputmortuum the mechanical hull all soul fled out of it how can a man act heroically the doctrine of motives will teach him that it is under more or less disguise nothing but a wretched love of pleasure fear of pain that hunger of applause of cash of whatsoever victual it may be is the ultimate fact of mans life atheism in briefwhich does indeed frightfully punish itself the man i say is become spiritually a paralytic man this godlike universe a dead mechanical steamengine all working by motives checks balances and i know not what wherein as in the detestable belly of some phalarisbull of his own contriving he the poor phalaris sits miserably dying  belief i define to be the healthy act of a mans mind it is a mysterious indescribable process that of getting to believeindescribable as all vital acts are we have our mind given us not that it may cavil and argue but that it may see into something give us clear belief and understanding about something whereon we are then to proceed to act doubt truly is not itself a crime certainly we do not rush out clutch up the first thing we find and straightway believe that all manner of doubt inquiry gr skepsis as it is named about all manner of objects dwells in every reasonable mind it is the mystic working of the mind on the object it is getting to know and believe belief comes out of all this above ground like the tree from its hidden roots but now if even on common things we require that a man keep his doubts silent and not babble of them till they in some measure become affirmations or denials how much more in regard to the highest things impossible to speak of in words at all that a man parade his doubt and get to imagine that debating and logic which means at best only the manner of telling us your thought your belief or disbelief about a thing is the triumph and true work of what intellect he has alas this is as if you should overturn the tree and instead of green boughs leaves and fruits show us ugly taloned roots turned up into the airand no growth only death and misery going on  for the scepticism as i said is not intellectual only it is moral also a chronic atrophy and disease of the whole soul a man lives by believing something not by debating and arguing about many things a sad case for him when all that he can manage to believe is something he can button in his pocket and with one or the other organ eat and digest lower than that he will not get we call those ages in which he gets so low the mournfulest sickest and meanest of all ages the worlds heart is palsied sick how can any limb of it be whole genuine acting ceases in all departments of the worlds work dexterous similitude of acting begins the worlds wages are pocketed the worlds work is not done heroes have gone out quacks have come in accordingly what century since the end of the roman world which also was a time of scepticism simulacra and universal decadence so abounds with quacks as that eighteenth consider them with their tumid sentimental vaporing about virtue benevolencethe wretched quacksquadron cagliostro at the head of them few men were without quackery they had got to consider it a necessary ingredient and amalgam for truth chatham our brave chatham himself comes down to the house all wrapt and bandaged he has crawled out in great bodily suffering and so onforgets says walpole that he is acting the sick man in the fire of debate snatches his arm from the sling and oratorically swings and brandishes it chatham himself lives the strangest mimetic life halfhero halfquack all along for indeed the world is full of dupes and you have to gain the worlds suffrage how the duties of the world will be done in that case what quantities of error which means failure which means sorrow and misery to some and to many will gradually accumulate in all provinces of the worlds business we need not compute  it seems to me you lay your finger here on the heart of the worlds maladies when you call it a sceptical world an insincere world a godless untruth of a world it is out of this as i consider that the whole tribe of social pestilences french revolutions chartisms and what not have derived their beingtheir chief necessity to be this must alter till this alter nothing can beneficially alter my one hope of the world my inexpugnable consolation in looking at the miseries of the world is that this is altering here and there one does now find a man who knows as of old that this world is a truth and no plausibility and falsity that he himself is alive not dead or paralytic and that the world is alive instinct with godhood beautiful and awful even as in the beginning of days one man once knowing this many men all men must by and by come to know it it lies there clear for whosoever will take the spectacles off his eyes and honestly look to know for such a man the unbelieving century with its unblessed products is already past a new century is already come the old unblessed products and performances as solid as they look are phantasms preparing speedily to vanish to this and the other noisy very greatlooking simulacrum with the whole world huzzaing at its heels he can say composedly stepping aside thou art not true thou art not extant only semblant go thy wayyes hollow formulism gross benthamism and other unheroic atheistic insincerity is visibly and even rapidly declining an unbelieving eighteenth century is but an exceptionsuch as now and then occurs i prophesy that the world will once more become sincere a believing world with many heroes in it a heroic world it will then be a victorious world never till then  or indeed what of the world and its victories men speak too much about the world each one of us here let the world go how it will and be victorious or not victorious has he not a life of his own to lead one life a little gleam of time between two eternities no second chance to us forevermore it were well for us to live not as fools and simulacra but as wise and realities the worlds being saved will not save us nor the worlds being lost destroy us we should look to ourselves there is great merit here in the duty of staying at home and on the whole to say truth i never heard of worlds being saved in any other way that mania of saving worlds is itself a piece of the eighteenth century with its windy sentimentalism let us not follow it too far for the saving of the world i will trust confidently to the maker of the world and look a little to my own saving which i am more competent toin brief for the worlds sake and for our own we will rejoice greatly that scepticism insincerity mechanical atheism with all their poisondews are going and as good as gone  now it was under such conditions in those times of johnson that our men of letters had to live times in which there was properly no truth in life old truths had fallen nigh dumb the new lay yet hidden not trying to speak that mans life here below was a sincerity and fact and would forever continue such no new intimation in that dusk of the world had yet dawned no intimation not even any french revolutionwhich we define to be a truth once more though a truth clad in hellfire how different was the luthers pilgrimage with its assured goal from the johnsons girt with mere traditions suppositions grown now incredible unintelligible mahomets formulas were of wood waxed and oiled and could be burnt out of ones way poor johnsons were far more difficult to burnthe strong man will ever find work which means difficulty pain to the full measure of his strength but to make out a victory in those circumstances of our poor hero as man of letters was perhaps more difficult than in any not obstruction disorganization bookseller osborne and fourpencehalfpenny a day not this alone but the light of his own soul was taken from him no landmark on the earth and alas what is that to having no loadstar in the heaven we need not wonder that none of those three men rose to victory that they fought truly is the highest praise with a mournful sympathy we will contemplate if not three living victorious heroes as i said the tombs of three fallen heroes they fell for us too making a way for us there are the mountains which they hurled abroad in their confused war of the giants under which their strength and life spent they now lie buried   i have already written of these three literary heroes expressly or incidentally what i suppose is known to most of you what need not be spoken or written a second time they concern us here as the singular prophets of that singular age for such they virtually were and the aspect they and their world exhibit under this point of view might lead us into reflections enough i call them all three genuine men more or less faithfully for most part unconsciously struggling to be genuine and plant themselves on the everlasting truth of things this to a degree that eminently distinguishes them from the poor artificial mass of their contemporaries and renders them worthy to be considered as speakers in some measure of the everlasting truth as prophets in that age of theirs by nature herself a noble necessity was laid on them to be so they were men of such magnitude that they could not live on unrealitiesclouds froth and all inanity gave way under them there was no footing for them but on firm earth no rest or regular motion for them if they got not footing there to a certain extent they were sons of nature once more in an age of artifice once more original men  as for johnson i have always considered him to be by nature one of our great english souls a strong and noble man so much left undeveloped in him to the last in a kindlier element what might he not have beenpoet priest sovereign ruler on the whole a man must not complain of his element of his time or the like it is thriftless work doing so his time is bad well then he is there to make it betterjohnsons youth was poor isolated hopeless very miserable indeed it does not seem possible that in any the favorablest outward circumstances johnsons life could have been other than a painful one the world might have had more of profitable work out of him or less but his effort against the worlds work could never have been a light one nature in return for his nobleness had said to him live in an element of diseased sorrow nay perhaps the sorrow and the nobleness were intimately and even inseparably connected with each other at all events poor johnson had to go about girt with continual hypochondria physical and spiritual pain like a hercules with the burning nessusshirt on him which shoots in on him dull incurable misery the nessusshirt not to be stript off which is his own natural skin in this manner he had to live figure him there with his scrofulous diseases with his great greedy heart and unspeakable chaos of thoughts stalking mournful as a stranger in this earth eagerly devouring what spiritual thing he could come at schoollanguages and other merely grammatical stuff if there were nothing better the largest soul that was in all england and provision made for it of fourpencehalfpenny a day yet a giant invincible soul a true mans one remembers always that story of the shoes at oxford the rough seamyfaced rawboned college servitor stalking about in winterseason with his shoes worn out how the charitable gentleman commoner secretly places a new pair at his door and the rawboned servitor lifting them looking at them near with his dim eyes with what thoughtspitches them out of window wet feet mud frost hunger or what you will but not beggary we cannot stand beggary rude stubborn selfhelp here a whole world of squalor rudeness confused misery and want yet of nobleness and manfulness withal it is a type of the mans life this pitching away of the shoes an original mannot a secondhand borrowing or begging man let us stand on our own basis at any rate on such shoes as we ourselves can get on frost and mud if you will but honestly on thaton the reality and substance which nature gives us not on the semblance on the thing she has given another than us  and yet with all this rugged pride of manhood and selfhelp was there ever soul more tenderly affectionate loyally submissive to what was really higher than he great souls are always loyally submissive reverent to what is over them only small mean souls are otherwise i could not find a better proof of what i said the other day that the sincere man was by nature the obedient man that only in a world of heroes was there loyal obedience to the heroic the essence of originality is not that it be new johnson believed altogether in the old he found the old opinions credible for him fit for him and in a right heroic manner lived under them he is well worth study in regard to that for we are to say that johnson was far other than a mere man of words and formulas he was a man of truths and facts he stood by the old formulas the happier was it for him that he could so stand but in all formulas that he could stand by there needed to be a most genuine substance very curious how in that poor paperage so barren artificial thickquilted with pedantries hearsays the great fact of this universe glared in forever wonderful indubitable unspeakable divineinfernal upon this man too how he harmonized his formulas with it how he managed at all under such circumstances that is a thing worth seeing a thing to be looked at with reverence with pity with awe that church of st clement danes where johnson still worshipped in the era of voltaire is to me a venerable place  it was in virtue of his sincerity of his speaking still in some sort from the heart of nature though in the current artificial dialect that johnson was a prophet are not all dialects artificial artificial things are not all falsenay every true product of nature will infallibly shape itself we may say all artificial things are at the starting of them true what we call formulas are not in their origin bad they are indispensably good formula is method habitude found wherever man is found formulas fashion themselves as paths do as beaten highways leading toward some sacred or high object whither many men are bent consider it one man full of heartfelt earnest impulse finds out a way of doing somewhatwere it of uttering his souls reverence for the highest were it but of fitly saluting his fellowman an inventor was needed to do that a poet he has articulated the dimstruggling thought that dwelt in his own and many hearts this is his way of doing that these are his footsteps the beginning of a path and now see the second men travels naturally in the footsteps of his foregoer it is the easiest method in the footsteps of his foregoer yet with improvements with changes where such seem good at all events with enlargements the path ever widening itself as more travel ittill at last there is a broad highway whereon the whole world may travel and drive while there remains a city or shrine or any reality to drive to at the farther end the highway shall be right welcome when the city is gone we will forsake the highway in this manner all institutions practices regulated things in the world have come into existence and gone out of existence formulas all begin by being full of substance you may call them the skin the articulation into shape into limbs and skin of a substance that is already there they had not been there otherwise idols as we said are not idolatrous till they become doubtful empty for the worshippers heart much as we talk against formulas i hope no one of us is ignorant withal of the high significance of true formulas that they were and will ever be the indispensablest furniture of our habitation in this world  mark too how little johnson boasts of his sincerity he has no suspicion of his being particularly sincereof his being particularly anything a hardstruggling wearyhearted man or scholar as he calls himself trying hard to get some honest livelihood in the world not to starve but to livewithout stealing a noble unconsciousness is in him he does not engrave truth on his watchseal no but he stands by truth speaks by it works and lives by it thus it ever is think of it once more the man whom nature has appointed to do great things is first of all furnished with that openness to nature which renders him incapable of being insincere to his large open deepfeeling heart nature is a fact all hearsay is hearsay the unspeakable greatness of this mystery of life let him acknowledge it or not nay even though he seem to forget it or deny it is ever present to himfearful and wonderful on this hand and on that he has a basis of sincerity unrecognized because never questioned or capable of question mirabeau mahomet cromwell napoleon all the great men i ever heard of have this as the primary material of them innumerable commonplace men are debating are talking everywhere their commonplace doctrines which they have learned by logic by rote at secondhand to that kind of man all this is still nothing he must have truth truth which he feels to be true how shall he stand otherwise his whole soul at all moments in all ways tells him that there is no standing he is under the noble necessity of being true johnsons way of thinking about this world is not mine any more than mahomets was but i recognize the everlasting element of heartsincerity in both and see with pleasure how neither of them remains ineffectual neither of them is as chaff sown in both of them is something which the seedfield will grow  johnson was a prophet to his people preached a gospel to themas all like him always do the highest gospel he preached we may describe as a kind of moral prudence in a world where much is to be done and little is to be known see how you will do it a thing well worth preaching a world where much is to be done and little is to be known do not sink yourselves in boundless bottomless abysses of doubt of wretched godforgetting unbeliefyou were miserable then powerless mad how could you do or work at all such gospel johnson preached and taughtcoupled theoretically and practically with this other great gospel clear your mind of cant have no trade with cant stand on the cold mud in the frosty weather but let it be in your own real torn shoes that will be better for you as mahomet says i call this i call these two things joined together a great gospel the greatest perhaps that was possible at that time  johnsons writings which once had such currency and celebrity are now as it were disowned by the young generation it is not wonderful johnsons opinions are fast becoming obsolete but his style of thinking and of living we may hope will never become obsolete i find in johnsons books the indisputablest traces of a great intellect and great heartever welcome under what obstructions and perversions soever they are sincere words those of his he means things by them a wondrous buckram stylethe best he could get to then a measured grandiloquence stepping or rather stalking along in a very solemn way grown obsolete now sometimes a tumid size of phraseology not in proportion to the contents of it all this you will put up with for the phraseology tumid or not has always something within it so many beautiful styles and books with nothing in thema man is a malefactor to the world who writes such they are the avoidable kindhad johnson left nothing but his dictionary one might have traced there a great intellect a genuine man looking to its clearness of definition its general solidity honesty insight and successful method it may be called the best of all dictionaries there is in it a kind of architectural nobleness it stands there like a great solid squarebuilt edifice finished symmetrically complete you judge that a true builder did it  one word in spite of our haste must be granted to poor bozzy he passes for a mean inflated gluttonous creature and was so in many senses yet the fact of his reverence for johnson will ever remain noteworthy the foolish conceited scotch laird the most conceited man of his time approaching in such awestruck attitude the great dusty irascible pedagogue in his mean garret there it is a genuine reverence for excellence a worship for heroes at a time when neither heroes nor worship were surmised to exist heroes it would seem exist always and a certain worship of them we will also take the liberty to deny altogether that of the witty frenchman that no man is a hero to his valetdechambre or if so it is not the heros blame but the valets that his soul namely is a mean valetsoul he expects his hero to advance in royal stagetrappings with measured step trains borne behind him trumpets sounding before him it should stand rather no man can be a grandmonarque to his valetdechambre strip your louis quatorze of his kinggear and there is left nothing but a poor forked radish with a head fantastically carvedadmirable to no valet the valet does not know a hero when he sees him alas no it requires a kind of hero to do thatand one of the worlds wants in this as in other senses is for most part want of such  on the whole shall we not say that boswells admiration was well bestowed that he could have found no soul in all england so worthy of bending down before shall we not say of this great mournful johnson too that he guided his difficult confused existence wisely led it well like a right valiant man that waste chaos of authorship by trade that waste chaos of scepticism in religion and politics in lifetheory and lifepractice in his poverty in his dust and dimness with the sick body and the rusty coat he made it do for him like a brave man not wholly without a loadstar in the eternal he had still a loadstar as the brave all need to have with his eye set on that he would change his course for nothing in these confused vortices of the lower sea of time to the spirit of lies bearing death and hunger he would in nowise strike his flag brave old samuel ultimus romanorum   of rousseau and his heroism i cannot say so much he is not what i call a strong man a morbid excitable spasmodic man at best intense rather than strong he had not the talent of silence an invaluable talent which few frenchmen or indeed men of any sort in these times excel in the suffering man ought really to consume his own smoke there is no good in emitting smoke till you have made it into firewhich in the metaphorical sense too all smoke is capable of becoming rousseau has not depth or width not calm force for difficulty the first characteristic of true greatness a fundamental mistake to call vehemence and rigidity strength a man is not strong who takes convulsionfits though six men cannot hold him then he that can walk under the heaviest weight without staggering he is the strong man we need forever especially in these loudshrieking days to remind ourselves of that a man who cannot hold his peace till the time come for speaking and acting is no right man  poor rousseaus face is to me expressive of him a high but narrow contracted intensity in it bony brows deep straitset eyes in which there is something bewilderedlookingbewildered peering with lynxeagerness a face full of misery even ignoble misery and also of the antagonism against that something mean plebeian there redeemed only by intensity the face of what is called a fanatica sadly contracted hero we name him here because with all his drawbacks and they are many he has the first and chief characteristic of a hero he is heartily in earnest in earnest if ever man was as none of these french philosophers were nay one would say of an earnestness too great for his otherwise sensitive rather feeble nature and which indeed in the end drove him into the strangest incoherences almost delirations there had come at last to be a kind of madness in him his ideas possessed him like demons hurried him so about drove him over steep places  the fault and misery of rousseau was what we easily name by a single word egoism which is indeed the source and summary of all faults and miseries whatsoever he had not perfected himself into victory over mere desire a mean hunger in many sorts was still the motive principle of him i am afraid he was a very vain man hungry for the praises of men you remember genliss experience of him she took jean jacques to the theatre he bargaining for a strict incognitohe would not be seen there for the world the curtain did happen nevertheless to be drawn aside the pit recognized jean jacques but took no great notice of him he expressed the bitterest indignation gloomed all evening spake no other than surly words the glib countess remained entirely convinced that his anger was not at being seen but at not being applauded when seen how the whole nature of the man is poisoned nothing but suspicion selfisolation fierce moody ways he could not live with anybody a man of some rank from the country who visited him often and used to sit with him expressing all reverence and affection for him comes one day finds jean jacques full of the sourest unintelligible humor monsieur said jean jacques with flaming eyes i know why you come here you come to see what a poor life i lead how little is in my poor pot that is boiling there well look into the pot there is half a pound of meat one carrot and three onions that is all go and tell the whole world that if you like monsieura man of this sort was far gone the whole world got itself supplied with anecdotes for light laughter for a certain theatrical interest from these perversions and contortions of poor jean jacques alas to him they were not laughing or theatrical too real to him the contortions of a dying gladiator the crowded amphitheatre looks on with entertainment but the gladiator is in agonies and dying  and yet this rousseau as we say with his passionate appeals to mothers with his contratsocial with his celebrations of nature even of savage life in nature did once more touch upon reality struggle towards reality was doing the function of a prophet to his time as he could and as the time could strangely through all that defacement degradation and almost madness there is in the inmost heart of poor rousseau a spark of real heavenly fire once more out of the element of that withered mocking philosophism scepticism and persiflage there has arisen in this man the ineradicable feeling and knowledge that this life of ours is true not a scepticism theorem or persiflage but a fact an awful reality nature had made that revelation to him had ordered him to speak it out he got it spoken out if not well and clearly then ill and dimlyas clearly as he could nay what are all errors and perversities of his even those stealings of ribbons aimless confused miseries and vagabondisms if we will interpret them kindly but the blinkard dazzlement and staggerings to and fro of a man sent on an errand he is too weak for by a path he cannot yet find men are led by strange ways one should have tolerance for a man hope of him leave him to try yet what he will do while life lasts hope lasts for every man  of rousseaus literary talents greatly celebrated still among his countrymen i do not say much his books like himself are what i call unhealthy not the good sort of books there is a sensuality in rousseau combined with such an intellectual gift as his it makes pictures of a certain gorgeous attractiveness but they are not genuinely poetical not white sunlight something operatic a kind of rosepink artificial bedizenment it is frequent or rather it is universal among the french since his time madame de stael has something of it st pierre and down onwards to the present astonishing convulsionary literature of desperation it is everywhere abundant that same rosepink is not the right hue look at a shakspeare at a goethe even at a walter scott he who has once seen into this has seen the difference of the true from the shamtrue and will discriminate them ever afterwards  we had to observe in johnson how much good a prophet under all disadvantages and disorganizations can accomplish for the world in rousseau we are called to look rather at the fearful amount of evil which under such disorganization may accompany the good historically it is a most pregnant spectacle that of rousseau banished into paris garrets in the gloomy company of his own thoughts and necessities there driven from post to pillar fretted exasperated till the heart of him went mad he had grown to feel deeply that the world was not his friend nor the worlds law it was expedient if any way possible that such a man should not have been set in flat hostility with the world he could be cooped into garrets laughed at as a maniac left to starve like a wild beast in his cagebut he could not be hindered from setting the world on fire the french revolution found its evangelist in rousseau his semidelirious speculations on the miseries of civilized life the preferability of the savage to the civilized and such like helped well to produce a whole delirium in france generally true you may well ask what could the world the governors of the world do with such a man difficult to say what the governors of the world could do with him what he could do with them is unhappily clear enoughguillotine a great many of them enough now of rousseau   it was a curious phenomenon in the withered unbelieving secondhand eighteenth century that of a hero starting up among the artificial pasteboard figures and productions in the guise of a robert burns like a little well in the rocky desert placeslike a sudden splendor of heaven in the artificial vauxhall people knew not what to make of it they took it for a piece of the vauxhall firework alas it let itself be so taken though struggling halfblindly as in bitterness of death against that perhaps no man had such a false reception from his fellowmen once more a very wasteful lifedrama was enacted under the sun  the tragedy of burnss life is known to all of you surely we may say if discrepancy between place held and place merited constitute perverseness of lot for a man no lot could be more perverse then burnss among those secondhand actingfigures mimes for most part of the eighteenth century once more a giant original man one of those men who reach down to the perennial deeps who take rank with the heroic among men and he was born in a poor ayrshire hut the largest soul of all the british lands came among us in the shape of a hardhanded scottish peasant  his father a poor toiling man tried various things did not succeed in any was involved in continual difficulties the steward factor as the scotch call him used to send letters and threatenings burns says which threw us all into tears the brave hardtoiling hardsuffering father his brave heroine of a wife and those children of whom robert was one in this earth so wide otherwise no shelter for them the letters threw us all into tears figure it the brave father i say alwaysa silent hero and poet without whom the son had never been a speaking one burnss schoolmaster came afterwards to london learnt what good society was but declares that in no meeting of men did he ever enjoy better discourse than at the hearth of this peasant and his poor seven acres of nurserygroundnot that nor the miserable patch of clayfarm nor anything he tried to get a living by would prosper with him he had a sore unequal battle all his days but he stood to it valiantly a wise faithful unconquerable manswallowing down how many sore sufferings daily into silence fighting like an unseen heronobody publishing newspaper paragraphs about his nobleness voting pieces of plate to him however he was not lost nothing is lost robert is there the outcome of himand indeed of many generations of such as him  this burns appeared under every disadvantage uninstructed poor born only to hard manual toil and writing when it came to that in a rustic special dialect known only to a small province of the country he lived in had he written even what he did write in the general language of england i doubt not he had already become universally recognized as being or capable to be one of our greatest men that he should have tempted so many to penetrate through the rough husk of that dialect of his is proof that there lay something far from common within it he has gained a certain recognition and is continuing to do so over all quarters of our wide saxon world wheresoever a saxon dialect is spoken it begins to be understood by personal inspection of this and the other that one of the most considerable saxon men of the eighteenth century was an ayrshire peasant named robert burns yes i will say here too was a piece of the right saxon stuff strong as the harzrock rooted in the depths of the worldrock yet with wells of living softness in it a wild impetuous whirlwind of passion and faculty slumbered quiet there such heavenly melody dwelling in the heart of it a noble rough genuineness homely rustic honest true simplicity of strength with its lightningfire with its soft dewy pitylike the old norse thor the peasantgod  burnss brother gilbert a man of much sense and worth has told me that robert in his young days in spite of their hardship was usually the gayest of speech a fellow of infinite frolic laughter sense and heart far pleasanter to hear there stript cutting peats in the bog or such like than he ever afterwards knew him i can well believe it this basis of mirth fond gaillard as old marquis mirabeau calls it a primal element of sunshine and joyfulness coupled with his other deep and earnest qualities is one of the most attractive characteristics of burns a large fund of hope dwells in him spite of his tragical history he is not a mourning man he shakes his sorrows gallantly aside bounds forth victorious over them it is as the lion shaking dewdrops from his mane as the swiftbounding horse that laughs at the shaking of the spearbut indeed hope mirth of the sort like burnss are they not the outcome properly of warm generous affectionsuch as is the beginning of all to every man  you would think it strange if i called burns the most gifted british soul we had in all that century of his and yet i believe the day is coming when there will be little danger in saying so his writings all that he did under such obstructions are only a poor fragment of him professor stewart remarked very justly what indeed is true of all poets good for much that his poetry was not any particular faculty but the general result of a naturally vigorous original mind expressing itself in that way burnss gifts expressed in conversation are the theme of all that ever heard him all kinds of gifts from the gracefulest utterances of courtesy to the highest fire of passionate speech loud floods of mirth soft wailings of affection laconic emphasis clear piercing insight all was in him witty duchesses celebrate him as a man whose speech led them off their feet this is beautiful but still more beautiful that which mr lockhart has recorded which i have more than once alluded to how the waiters and ostlers at inns would get out of bed and come crowding to hear this man speak waiters and ostlersthey too were men and here was a man i have heard much about his speech but one of the best things i ever heard of it was last year from a venerable gentleman long familiar with him that it was speech distinguished by always having something in it he spoke rather little than much this old man told me sat rather silent in those early days as in the company of persons above him and always when he did speak it was to throw new light on the matter i know not why any one should ever speak otherwisebut if we look at his general force of soul his healthy robustness every way the rugged downrightness penetration generous valor and manfulness that was in himwhere shall we readily find a bettergifted man  among the great men of the eighteenth century i sometimes feel as if burns might be found to resemble mirabeau more than any other they differ widely in vesture yet look at them intrinsically there is the same burly thicknecked strength of body as of soulbuilt in both cases on what the old marquis calls a fond gaillard by nature by course of breeding indeed by nation mirabeau has much more of bluster a noisy forward unresting man but the characteristic of mirabeau too is veracity and sense power of true insight superiority of vision the thing that he says is worth remembering it is a flash of insight into some object or other so do both these men speak the same raging passions capable too in both of manifesting themselves as the tenderest noble affections wit wild laughter energy directness sincerity these were in both the types of the two men are not dissimilar burns too could have governed debated in national assemblies politicized as few could alas the courage which had to exhibit itself in capture of smuggling schooners in the solway frith in keeping silence over so much where no good speech but only inarticulate rage was possible this might have bellowed forth ushers de breze and the like and made itself visible to all men in managing of kingdoms in ruling of great evermemorable epochs but they said to him reprovingly his official superiors said and wrote you are to work not think of your thinkingfaculty the greatest in this land we have no need you are to gauge beer there for that only are you wanted very notableand worth mentioning though we know what is to be said and answered as if thought power of thinking were not at all times in all places and situations of the world precisely the thing that was wanted the fatal man is he not always the unthinking man the man who cannot think and see but only grope and hallucinate and missee the nature of the thing he works with he missees it mistakes it as we say takes it for one thing and it is another thingand leaves him standing like a futility there he is the fatal man unutterably fatal put in the high places of menwhy complain of this say some strength is mournfully denied its arena that was true from of old doubtless and the worse for the arena answer i complaining profits little stating of the truth may profit that a europe with its french revolution just breaking out finds no need of a burns except for gauging beeris a thing i for one cannot rejoice at  once more we have to say here that the chief quality of burns is the sincerity of him so in his poetry so in his life the song he sings is not of fantasticalities it is of a thing felt really there the prime merit of this as of all in him and of his life generally is truth the life of burns is what we may call a great tragic sincerity a sort of savage sinceritynot cruel far from that but wild wrestling naked with the truth of things in that sense there is something of the savage in all great men  heroworshipodin burns well these men of letters too were not without a kind of heroworship but what a strange condition has that got into now the waiters and ostlers of scotch inns prying about the door eager to catch any word that fell from burns were doing unconscious reverence to the heroic johnson had his boswell for worshipper rousseau had worshippers enough princes calling on him in his mean garret the great the beautiful doing reverence to the poor moonstruck man for himself a most portentous contradiction the two ends of his life not to be brought into harmony he sits at the tables of grandees and has to copy music for his own living he cannot even get his music copied by dint of dining out says he i run the risk of dying by starvation at home for his worshippers too a most questionable thing if doing heroworship well or badly be the test of vital wellbeing or illbeing to a generation can we say that these generations are very firstrateand yet our heroic men of letters do teach govern are kings priests or what you like to call them intrinsically there is no preventing it by any means whatever the world has to obey him who thinks and sees in the world the world can alter the manner of that can either have it as blessed continuous summer sunshine or as unblessed black thunder and tornadowith unspeakable difference of profit for the world the manner of it is very alterable the matter and fact of it is not alterable by any power under the sky light or failing that lightning the world can take its choice not whether we call an odin god prophet priest or what we call him but whether we believe the word he tells us there it all lies if it be a true word we shall have to believe it believing it we shall have to do it what name or welcome we give him or it is a point that concerns ourselves mainly it the new truth new deeper revealing of the secret of this universe is verily of the nature of a message from on high and must and will have itself obeyed  my last remark is on that notablest phasis of burnss historyhis visit to edinburgh often it seems to me as if his demeanor there were the highest proof he gave of what a fund of worth and genuine manhood was in him if we think of it few heavier burdens could be laid on the strength of a man so sudden all common lionism which ruins innumerable men was as nothing to this it is as if napoleon had been made a king of not gradually but at once from the artillery lieutenancy in the regiment la fere burns still only in his twentyseventh year is no longer even a ploughman he is flying to the west indies to escape disgrace and a jail this month he is a ruined peasant his wages seven pounds a year and these gone from him next month he is in the blaze of rank and beauty handing down jewelled duchesses to dinner the cynosure of all eyes adversity is sometimes hard upon a man but for one man who can stand prosperity there are a hundred that will stand adversity i admire much the way in which burns met all this perhaps no man one could point out was ever so sorely tried and so little forgot himself tranquil unastonished not abashed not inflated neither awkwardness nor affectation he feels that he there is the man robert burns that the rank is but the guineastamp that the celebrity is but the candlelight which will show what man not in the least make him a better or other man alas it may readily unless he look to it make him a worse man a wretched inflated windbaginflated till he burst and become a dead lion for whom as some one has said there is no resurrection of the body worse than a living dogburns is admirable here  and yet alas as i have observed elsewhere these lionhunters were the ruin and death of burns it was they that rendered it impossible for him to live they gathered round him in his farm hindered his industry no place was remote enough from them he could not get his lionism forgotten honestly as he was disposed to do so he falls into discontents into miseries faults the world getting ever more desolate for him health character peace of mind all gonesolitary enough now it is tragical to think of these men came but to see him it was out of no sympathy with him nor no hatred to him they came to get a little amusement they got their amusementand the heros life went for it  richter says in the island of sumatra there is a kind of lightchafers large fireflies which people stick upon spits and illuminate the ways with at night persons of condition can thus travel with a pleasant radiance which they much admire great honor to the fireflies but     lecture vi the hero as king cromwell napoleon modern revolutionism  may 22 1840  we come now to the last form of heroism that which we call kingship the commander over men he to whose will our wills are to be subordinated and loyally surrender themselves and find their welfare in doing so may be reckoned the most important of great men he is practically the summary for us of all the various figures of heroism priest teacher whatsoever of earthly or of spiritual dignity we can fancy to reside in a man embodies itself here to command over us to furnish us with constant practical teaching to tell us for the day and hour what we are to do he is called rex regulator roi our own name is still better king konning which means canning ableman  numerous considerations pointing towards deep questionable and indeed unfathomable regions present themselves here on the most of which we must resolutely for the present forbear to speak at all as burke said that perhaps fair trial by jury was the soul of government and that all legislation administration parliamentary debating and the rest of it went on in order to bring twelve impartial men into a juryboxso by much stronger reason may i say here that the finding of your ableman and getting him invested with the symbols of ability with dignity worship worthship royalty kinghood or whatever we call it so that he may actually have room to guide according to his faculty of doing itis the business well or ill accomplished of all social procedure whatsoever in this world hustingsspeeches parliamentary motions reform bills french revolutions all mean at heart this or else nothing find in any country the ablest man that exists there raise him to the supreme place and loyally reverence him you have a perfect government for that country no ballotbox parliamentary eloquence voting constitutionbuilding or other machinery whatsoever can improve it a whit it is in the perfect state an ideal country the ablest man he means also the truesthearted justest the noblest man what he tells us to do must be precisely the wisest fittest that we could anywhere or anyhow learnthe thing which it will in all ways behoove us with right loyal thankfulness and nothing doubting to do our doing and life were then so far as government could regulate it well regulated that were the ideal of constitutions  alas we know very well that ideals can never be completely embodied in practice ideals must ever lie a very great way off and we will right thankfully content ourselves with any not intolerable approximation thereto let no man as schiller says too querulously measure by a scale of perfection the meagre product of reality in this poor world of ours we will esteem him no wise man we will esteem him a sickly discontented foolish man and yet on the other hand it is never to be forgotten that ideals do exist that if they be not approximated to at all the whole matter goes to wreck infallibly no bricklayer builds a wall perfectly perpendicular mathematically this is not possible a certain degree of perpendicularity suffices him and he like a good bricklayer who must have done with his job leaves it so and yet if he sway too much from the perpendicular above all if he throw plummet and level quite away from him and pile brick on brick heedless just as it comes to hand such bricklayer i think is in a bad way he has forgotten himself but the law of gravitation does not forget to act on him he and his wall rush down into confused welter of ruin  this is the history of all rebellions french revolutions social explosions in ancient or modern times you have put the too unable man at the head of affairs the too ignoble unvaliant fatuous man you have forgotten that there is any rule or natural necessity whatever of putting the able man there brick must lie on brick as it may and can unable simulacrum of ability quack in a word must adjust himself with quack in all manner of administration of human thingswhich accordingly lie unadministered fermenting into unmeasured masses of failure of indigent misery in the outward and in the inward or spiritual miserable millions stretch out the hand for their due supply and it is not there the law of gravitation acts natures laws do none of them forget to act the miserable millions burst forth into sansculottism or some other sort of madness bricks and bricklayer lie as a fatal chaos  much sorry stuff written some hundred years ago or more about the divine right of kings moulders unread now in the public libraries of this country far be it from us to disturb the calm process by which it is disappearing harmlessly from the earth in those repositories at the same time not to let the immense rubbish go without leaving us as it ought some soul of it behindi will say that it did mean something something true which it is important for us and all men to keep in mind to assert that in whatever man you chose to lay hold of by this or the other plan of clutching at him and claps a round piece of metal on the head of and called kingthere straightway came to reside a divine virtue so that he became a kind of god and a divinity inspired him with faculty and right to rule over you to all lengths thiswhat can we do with this but leave it to rot silently in the public libraries but i will say withal and that is what these divineright men meant that in kings and in all human authorities and relations that men godcreated can form among each other there is verily either a divine right or else a diabolic wrong one or the other of these two for it is false altogether what the last sceptical century taught us that this world is a steamengine there is a god in this world and a godssanction or else the violation of such does look out from all ruling and obedience from all moral acts of men there is no act more moral between men than that of rule and obedience woe to him that claims obedience when it is not due woe to him that refuses it when it is gods law is in that i say however the parchmentlaws may run there is a divine right or else a diabolic wrong at the heart of every claim that one man makes upon another  it can do none of us harm to reflect on this in all the relations of life it will concern us in loyalty and royalty the highest of these i esteem the modern error that all goes by selfinterest and the checking and balancing of greedy knaveries and that in short there is nothing divine whatever in the association of men a still more despicable error natural as it is to an unbelieving century than that of a divine right in people called kings i say find me the true konning king or ableman and he has a divine right over me that we knew in some tolerable measure how to find him and that all men were ready to acknowledge his divine right when found this is precisely the healing which a sick world is everywhere in these ages seeking after the true king as guide of the practical has ever something of the pontiff in himguide of the spiritual from which all practice has its rise this too is a true saying that the king is head of the churchbut we will leave the polemic stuff of a dead century to lie quiet on its bookshelves   certainly it is a fearful business that of having your ableman to seek and not knowing in what manner to proceed about it that is the worlds sad predicament in these times of ours they are times of revolution and have long been the bricklayer with his bricks no longer heedful of plummet or the law of gravitation have toppled tumbled and it all welters as we see but the beginning of it was not the french revolution that is rather the end we can hope it were truer to say the beginning was three centuries farther back in the reformation of luther that the thing which still called itself christian church had become a falsehood and brazenly went about pretending to pardon mens sins for metallic coined money and to do much else which in the everlasting truth of nature it did not now do here lay the vital malady the inward being wrong all outward went ever more and more wrong belief died away all was doubt disbelief the builder cast away his plummet said to himself what is gravitation brick lies on brick there alas does it not still sound strange to many of us the assertion that there is a godstruth in the business of godcreated men that all is not a kind of grimace an expediency diplomacy one knows not what  from that first necessary assertion of luthers you selfstyled papa you are no father in god at all you area chimera whom i know not how to name in polite languagefrom that onwards to the shout which rose round camille desmoulins in the palaisroyal aux armes when the people had burst up against all manner of chimerasi find a natural historical sequence that shout too so frightful halfinfernal was a great matter once more the voice of awakened nationsstarting confusedly as out of nightmare as out of deathsleep into some dim feeling that life was real that godsworld was not an expediency and diplomacy infernalyes since they would not have it otherwise infernal since not celestial or terrestrial hollowness insincerity has to cease sincerity of some sort has to begin cost what it may reigns of terror horrors of french revolution or what else we have to return to truth here is a truth as i said a truth clad in hellfire since they would not but have it so  a common theory among considerable parties of men in england and elsewhere used to be that the french nation had in those days as it were gone mad that the french revolution was a general act of insanity a temporary conversion of france and large sections of the world into a kind of bedlam the event had risen and raged but was a madness and nonentitygone now happily into the region of dreams and the picturesqueto such comfortable philosophers the three days of july 1830 must have been a surprising phenomenon here is the french nation risen again in musketry and deathstruggle out shooting and being shot to make that same mad french revolution good the sons and grandsons of those men it would seem persist in the enterprise they do not disown it they will have it made good will have themselves shot if it be not made good to philosophers who had made up their lifesystem on that madness quietus no phenomenon could be more alarming poor niebuhr they say the prussian professor and historian fell brokenhearted in consequence sickened if we can believe it and died of the three days it was surely not a very heroic deathlittle better than racines dying because louis fourteenth looked sternly on him once the world had stood some considerable shocks in its time might have been expected to survive the three days too and be found turning on its axis after even them the three days told all mortals that the old french revolution mad as it might look was not a transitory ebullition of bedlam but a genuine product of this earth where we all live that it was verily a fact and that the world in general would do well everywhere to regard it as such  truly without the french revolution one would not know what to make of an age like this at all we will hail the french revolution as shipwrecked mariners might the sternest rock in a world otherwise all of baseless sea and waves a true apocalypse though a terrible one to this false withered artificial time testifying once more that nature is preternatural if not divine then diabolic that semblance is not reality that it has to become reality or the world will take fire under itburn it into what it is namely nothing plausibility has ended empty routine has ended much has ended this as with a trump of doom has been proclaimed to all men they are the wisest who will learn it soonest long confused generations before it be learned peace impossible till it be the earnest man surrounded as ever with a world of inconsistencies can await patiently patiently strive to do his work in the midst of that sentence of death is written down in heaven against all that sentence of death is now proclaimed on the earth against it this he with his eyes may see and surely i should say considering the other side of the matter what enormous difficulties lie there and how fast fearfully fast in all countries the inexorable demand for solution of them is pressing onhe may easily find other work to do than laboring in the sansculottic province at this time of day  to me in these circumstances that of heroworship becomes a fact inexpressibly precious the most solacing fact one sees in the world at present there is an everlasting hope in it for the management of the world had all traditions arrangements creeds societies that men ever instituted sunk away this would remain the certainty of heroes being sent us our faculty our necessity to reverence heroes when sent it shines like a polestar through smokeclouds dustclouds and all manner of downrushing and conflagration  heroworship would have sounded very strange to those workers and fighters in the french revolution not reverence for great men not any hope or belief or even wish that great men could again appear in the world nature turned into a machine was as if effete now could not any longer produce great meni can tell her she may give up the trade altogether then we cannot do without great menbut neither have i any quarrel with that of liberty and equality with the faith that wise great men being impossible a level immensity of foolish small men would suffice it was a natural faith then and there liberty and equality no authority needed any longer heroworship reverence for such authorities has proved false is itself a falsehood no more of it we have had such forgeries we will now trust nothing so many base plated coins passing in the market the belief has now become common that no gold any longer existsand even that we can do very well without gold i find this among other things in that universal cry of liberty and equality and find it very natural as matters then stood  and yet surely it is but the transition from false to true considered as the whole truth it is false altogetherthe product of entire sceptical blindness as yet only struggling to see heroworship exists forever and everywhere not loyalty alone it extends from divine adoration down to the lowest practical regions of life bending before men if it is not to be a mere empty grimace better dispensed with than practiced is heroworshipa recognition that there does dwell in that presence of our brother something divine that every created man as novalis said is a revelation in the flesh they were poets too that devised all those graceful courtesies which make life noble courtesy is not a falsehood or grimace it need not be such and loyalty religious worship itself are still possible nay still inevitable  may we not say moreover while so many of our late heroes have worked rather as revolutionary men that nevertheless every great man every genuine man is by the nature of him a son of order not of disorder it is a tragical position for a true man to work in revolutions he seems an anarchist and indeed a painful element of anarchy does encumber him at every stephim to whose whole soul anarchy is hostile hateful his mission is order every mans is he is here to make what was disorderly chaotic into a thing ruled regular he is the missionary of order is not all work of man in this world a making of order the carpenter finds rough trees shapes them constrains them into square fitness into purpose and use we are all born enemies of disorder it is tragical for us all to be concerned in imagebreaking and downpulling for the great man more a man than we it is doubly tragical  thus too all human things maddest french sansculottisms do and must work towards order i say there is not a man in them raging in the thickest of the madness but is impelled withal at all moments towards order his very life means that disorder is dissolution death no chaos but it seeks a centre to revolve round while man is man some cromwell or napoleon is the necessary finish of a sansculottismcurious in those days when heroworship was the most incredible thing to every one how it does come out nevertheless and assert itself practically in a way which all have to credit divine right take it on the great scale is found to mean divine might withal while old false formulas are getting trampled everywhere into destruction new genuine substances unexpectedly unfold themselves indestructible in rebellious ages when kingship itself seems dead and abolished cromwell napoleon step forth again as kings the history of these men is what we have now to look at as our last phasis of heroism the old ages are brought back to us the manner in which kings were made and kingship itself first took rise is again exhibited in the history of these two   we have had many civil wars in england wars of red and white roses wars of simon de montfort wars enough which are not very memorable but that war of the puritans has a significance which belongs to no one of the others trusting to your candor which will suggest on the other side what i have not room to say i will call it a section once more of that great universal war which alone makes up the true history of the worldthe war of belief against unbelief the struggle of men intent on the real essence of things against men intent on the semblances and forms of things the puritans to many seem mere savage iconoclasts fierce destroyers of forms but it were more just to call them haters of untrue forms i hope we know how to respect laud and his king as well as them poor laud seems to me to have been weak and illstarred not dishonest an unfortunate pedant rather than anything worse his dreams and superstitions at which they laugh so have an affectionate lovable kind of character he is like a collegetutor whose whole world is forms collegerules whose notion is that these are the life and safety of the world he is placed suddenly with that unalterable luckless notion of his at the head not of a college but of a nation to regulate the most complex deepreaching interests of men he thinks they ought to go by the old decent regulations nay that their salvation will lie in extending and improving these like a weak man he drives with spasmodic vehemence towards his purpose cramps himself to it heeding no voice of prudence no cry of pity he will have his collegerules obeyed by his collegians that first and till that nothing he is an illstarred pedant as i said he would have it the world was a college of that kind and the world was not that alas was not his doom stern enough whatever wrongs he did were they not all frightfully avenged on him  it is meritorious to insist on forms religion and all else naturally clothes itself in forms everywhere the formed world is the only habitable one the naked formlessness of puritanism is not the thing i praise in the puritans it is the thing i pitypraising only the spirit which had rendered that inevitable all substances clothe themselves in forms but there are suitable true forms and then there are untrue unsuitable as the briefest definition one might say forms which grow round a substance if we rightly understand that will correspond to the real nature and purport of it will be true good forms which are consciously put round a substance bad i invite you to reflect on this it distinguishes true from false in ceremonial form earnest solemnity from empty pageant in all human things  there must be a veracity a natural spontaneity in forms in the commonest meeting of men a person making what we call set speeches is not he an offence in the mere drawingroom whatsoever courtesies you see to be grimaces prompted by no spontaneous reality within are a thing you wish to get away from but suppose now it were some matter of vital concernment some transcendent matter as divine worship is about which your whole soul struck dumb with its excess of feeling knew not how to form itself into utterance at all and preferred formless silence to any utterance there possiblewhat should we say of a man coming forward to represent or utter it for you in the way of upholsterermummery such a manlet him depart swiftly if he love himself you have lost your only son are mute struck down without even tears an importunate man importunately offers to celebrate funeral games for him in the manner of the greeks such mummery is not only not to be acceptedit is hateful unendurable it is what the old prophets called idolatry worshipping of hollow shows what all earnest men do and will reject we can partly understand what those poor puritans meant laud dedicating that st catherine creeds church in the manner we have it described with his multiplied ceremonial bowings gesticulations exclamations surely it is rather the rigorous formal pedant intent on his collegerules than the earnest prophet intent on the essence of the matter  puritanism found such forms insupportable trampled on such formswe have to excuse it for saying no form at all rather than such it stood preaching in its bare pulpit with nothing but the bible in its hand nay a man preaching from his earnest soul into the earnest souls of men is not this virtually the essence of all churches whatsoever the nakedest savagest reality i say is preferable to any semblance however dignified besides it will clothe itself with due semblance by and by if it be real no fear of that actually no fear at all given the living man there will be found clothes for him he will find himself clothes but the suitofclothes pretending that it is both clothes and man we cannot fight the french by three hundred thousand red uniforms there must be men in the inside of them semblance i assert must actually not divorce itself from reality if semblance dowhy then there must be men found to rebel against semblance for it has become a lie these two antagonisms at war here in the case of laud and the puritans are as old nearly as the world they went to fierce battle over england in that age and fought out their confused controversy to a certain length with many results for all of us   in the age which directly followed that of the puritans their cause or themselves were little likely to have justice done them charles second and his rochesters were not the kind of men you would set to judge what the worth or meaning of such men might have been that there could be any faith or truth in the life of a man was what these poor rochesters and the age they ushered in had forgotten puritanism was hung on gibbetslike the bones of the leading puritans its work nevertheless went on accomplishing itself all true work of a man hang the author of it on what gibbet you like must and will accomplish itself we have our habeascorpus our free representation of the people acknowledgment wide as the world that all men are or else must shall and will become what we call free menmen with their life grounded on reality and justice not on tradition which has become unjust and a chimera this in part and much besides this was the work of the puritans  and indeed as these things became gradually manifest the character of the puritans began to clear itself their memories were one after another taken down from the gibbet nay a certain portion of them are now in these days as good as canonized eliot hampden pym nay ludlow hutchinson vane himself are admitted to be a kind of heroes political conscript fathers to whom in no small degree we owe what makes us a free england it would not be safe for anybody to designate these men as wicked now few puritans of note but find their apologists somewhere and have a certain reverence paid them by earnest men one puritan i think and almost he alone our poor cromwell seems to hang yet on the gibbet and find no hearty apologist anywhere him neither saint nor sinner will acquit of great wickedness a man of ability infinite talent courage and so forth but he betrayed the cause selfish ambition dishonesty duplicity a fierce coarse hypocritical tartuffe turning all that noble struggle for constitutional liberty into a sorry farce played for his own benefit this and worse is the character they give of cromwell and then there come contrasts with washington and others above all with these noble pyms and hampdens whose noble work he stole for himself and ruined into a futility and deformity  this view of cromwell seems to me the not unnatural product of a century like the eighteenth as we said of the valet so of the sceptic he does not know a hero when he sees him the valet expected purple mantles gilt sceptres bodyguards and flourishes of trumpets the sceptic of the eighteenth century looks for regulated respectable formulas principles or what else he may call them a style of speech and conduct which has got to seem respectable which can plead for itself in a handsome articulate manner and gain the suffrages of an enlightened sceptical eighteenth century it is at bottom the same thing that both the valet and he expect the garnitures of some acknowledged royalty which then they will acknowledge the king coming to them in the rugged unformulistic state shall be no king  for my own share far be it from me to say or insinuate a word of disparagement against such characters as hampden elliot pym whom i believe to have been right worthy and useful men i have read diligently what books and documents about them i could come atwith the honestest wish to admire to love and worship them like heroes but i am sorry to say if the real truth must be told with very indifferent success at bottom i found that it would not do they are very noble men these step along in their stately way with their measured euphemisms philosophies parliamentary eloquences shipmoneys monarchies of man a most constitutional unblamable dignified set of men but the heart remains cold before them the fancy alone endeavors to get up some worship of them what mans heart does in reality break forth into any fire of brotherly love for these men they are become dreadfully dull men one breaks down often enough in the constitutional eloquence of the admirable pym with his seventhly and lastly you find that it may be the admirablest thing in the world but that it is heavyheavy as lead barren as brickclay that in a word for you there is little or nothing now surviving there one leaves all these nobilities standing in their niches of honor the rugged outcast cromwell he is the man of them all in whom one still finds human stuff the great savage baresark he could write no euphemistic monarchy of man did not speak did not work with glib regularity had no straight story to tell for himself anywhere but he stood bare not cased in euphemistic coatofmail he grappled like a giant face to face heart to heart with the naked truth of things that after all is the sort of man for one i plead guilty to valuing such a man beyond all other sorts of men smoothshaven respectabilities not a few one finds that are not good for much small thanks to a man for keeping his hands clean who would not touch the work but with gloves on  neither on the whole does this constitutional tolerance of the eighteenth century for the other happier puritans seem to be a very great matter one might say it is but a piece of formulism and scepticism like the rest they tell us it was a sorrowful thing to consider that the foundation of our english liberties should have been laid by superstition these puritans came forward with calvinistic incredible creeds antilaudisms westminster confessions demanding chiefly of all that they should have liberty to worship in their own way liberty to tax themselves that was the thing they should have demanded it was superstition fanaticism disgraceful ignorance of constitutional philosophy to insist on the other thingliberty to tax oneself not to pay out money from your pocket except on reason shown no century i think but a rather barren one would have fixed on that as the first right of man i should say on the contrary a just man will generally have better cause than money in what shape soever before deciding to revolt against his government ours is a most confused world in which a good man will be thankful to see any kind of government maintain itself in a not insupportable manner and here in england to this hour if he is not ready to pay a great many taxes which he can see very small reason in it will not go well with him i think he must try some other climate than this taxgatherer money he will say take my money since you can and it is so desirable to you take itand take yourself away with it and leave me alone to my work here i am still here can still work after all the money you have taken from me but if they come to him and say acknowledge a lie pretend to say you are worshipping god when you are not doing it believe not the thing that you find true but the thing that i find or pretend to find true he will answer no by gods help no you may take my purse but i cannot have my moral self annihilated the purse is any highwaymans who might meet me with a loaded pistol but the self is mine and god my makers it is not yours and i will resist you to the death and revolt against you and on the whole front all manner of extremities accusations and confusions in defence of that  really it seems to me the one reason which could justify revolting this of the puritans it has been the soul of all just revolts among men not hunger alone produced even the french revolution no but the feeling of the insupportable allpervading falsehood which had now embodied itself in hunger in universal material scarcity and nonentity and thereby become indisputably false in the eyes of all we will leave the eighteenth century with its liberty to tax itself we will not astonish ourselves that the meaning of such men as the puritans remained dim to it to men who believe in no reality at all how shall a real human soul the intensest of all realities as it were the voice of this worlds maker still speaking to usbe intelligible what it cannot reduce into constitutional doctrines relative to taxing or other the like material interest gross palpable to the sense such a century will needs reject as an amorphous heap of rubbish hampdens pyms and shipmoney will be the theme of much constitutional eloquence striving to be fervidwhich will glitter if not as fire does then as ice does and the irreducible cromwell will remain a chaotic mass of madness hypocrisy and much else   from of old i will confess this theory of cromwells falsity has been incredible to me nay i cannot believe the like of any great man whatever multitudes of great men figure in history as false selfish men but if we will consider it they are but figures for us unintelligible shadows we do not see into them as men that could have existed at all a superficial unbelieving generation only with no eye but for the surfaces and semblances of things could form such notions of great men can a great soul be possible without a conscience in it the essence of all real souls great or smallno we cannot figure cromwell as a falsity and fatuity the longer i study him and his career i believe this the less why should we there is no evidence of it is it not strange that after all the mountains of calumny this man has been subject to after being represented as the very prince of liars who never or hardly ever spoke truth but always some cunning counterfeit of truth there should not yet have been one falsehood brought clearly home to him a prince of liars and no lie spoken by him not one that i could yet get sight of it is like pococke asking grotius where is your proof of mahomets pigeon no prooflet us leave all these calumnious chimeras as chimeras ought to be left they are not portraits of the man they are distracted phantasms of him the joint product of hatred and darkness  looking at the mans life with our own eyes it seems to me a very different hypothesis suggests itself what little we know of his earlier obscure years distorted as it has come down to us does it not all betoken an earnest affectionate sincere kind of man his nervous melancholic temperament indicates rather a seriousness too deep for him of those stories of spectres of the white spectre in broad daylight predicting that he should be king of england we are not bound to believe muchprobably no more than of the other black spectre or devil in person to whom the officer saw him sell himself before worcester fight but the mournful oversensitive hypochondriac humor of oliver in his young years is otherwise indisputably known the huntingdon physician told sir philip warwick himself he had often been sent for at midnight mr cromwell was full of hypochondria thought himself near dying and had fancies about the towncross these things are significant such an excitable deepfeeling nature in that rugged stubborn strength of his is not the symptom of falsehood it is the symptom and promise of quite other than falsehood  the young oliver is sent to study law falls or is said to have fallen for a little period into some of the dissipations of youth but if so speedily repents abandons all this not much above twenty he is married settled as an altogether grave and quiet man he pays back what money he had won at gambling says the storyhe does not think any gain of that kind could be really his it is very interesting very natural this conversion as they well name it this awakening of a great true soul from the worldly slough to see into the awful truth of thingsto see that time and its shows all rested on eternity and this poor earth of ours was the threshold either of heaven or of hell olivers life at st ives and ely as a sober industrious farmer is it not altogether as that of a true and devout man he has renounced the world and its ways its prizes are not the thing that can enrich him he tills the earth he reads his bible daily assembles his servants round him to worship god he comforts persecuted ministers is fond of preachers nay can himself preachexhorts his neighbors to be wise to redeem the time in all this what hypocrisy ambition cant or other falsity the mans hopes i do believe were fixed on the other higher world his aim to get well thither by walking well through his humble course in this world he courts no notice what could notice here do for him ever in his great taskmasters eye  it is striking too how he comes out once into public view he since no other is willing to come in resistance to a public grievance i mean in that matter of the bedford fens no one else will go to law with authority therefore he will that matter once settled he returns back into obscurity to his bible and his plough gain influence his influence is the most legitimate derived from personal knowledge of him as a just religious reasonable and determined man in this way he has lived till past forty old age is now in view of him and the earnest portal of death and eternity it was at this point that he suddenly became ambitious i do not interpret his parliamentary mission in that way  his successes in parliament his successes through the war are honest successes of a brave man who has more resolution in the heart of him more light in the head of him than other men his prayers to god his spoken thanks to the god of victory who had preserved him safe and carried him forward so far through the furious clash of a world all set in conflict through desperatelooking envelopments at dunbar through the deathhail of so many battles mercy after mercy to the crowning mercy of worcester fight all this is good and genuine for a deephearted calvinistic cromwell only to vain unbelieving cavaliers worshipping not god but their own lovelocks frivolities and formalities living quite apart from contemplations of god living without god in the world need it seem hypocritical  nor will his participation in the kings death involve him in condemnation with us it is a stern business killing of a king but if you once go to war with him it lies there this and all else lies there once at war you have made wager of battle with him it is he to die or else you reconciliation is problematic may be possible or far more likely is impossible it is now pretty generally admitted that the parliament having vanquished charles first had no way of making any tenable arrangement with him the large presbyterian party apprehensive now of the independents were most anxious to do so anxious indeed as for their own existence but it could not be the unhappy charles in those final hamptoncourt negotiations shows himself as a man fatally incapable of being dealt with a man who once for all could not and would not understandwhose thought did not in any measure represent to him the real fact of the matter nay worse whose word did not at all represent his thought we may say this of him without cruelty with deep pity rather but it is true and undeniable forsaken there of all but the name of kingship he still finding himself treated with outward respect as a king fancied that he might play off party against party and smuggle himself into his old power by deceiving both alas they both discovered that he was deceiving them a man whose word will not inform you at all what he means or will do is not a man you can bargain with you must get out of that mans way or put him out of yours the presbyterians in their despair were still for believing charles though found false unbelievable again and again not so cromwell for all our fighting says he we are to have a little bit of paper no  in fact everywhere we have to note the decisive practical eye of this man how he drives towards the practical and practicable has a genuine insight into what is fact such an intellect i maintain does not belong to a false man the false man sees false shows plausibilities expediences the true man is needed to discern even practical truth cromwells advice about the parliaments army early in the contest how they were to dismiss their citytapsters flimsy riotous persons and choose substantial yeomen whose heart was in the work to be soldiers for them this is advice by a man who saw fact answers if you see into fact cromwells ironsides were the embodiment of this insight of his men fearing god and without any other fear no more conclusively genuine set of fighters ever trod the soil of england or of any other land  neither will we blame greatly that word of cromwells to them which was so blamed if the king should meet me in battle i would kill the king why not these words were spoken to men who stood as before a higher than kings they had set more than their own lives on the cast the parliament may call it in official language a fighting for the king but we for our share cannot understand that to us it is no dilettante work no sleek officiality it is sheer rough death and earnest they have brought it to the callingforth of war horrid internecine fight man grappling with man in fireeyed ragethe infernal element in man called forth to try it by that do that therefore since that is the thing to be donethe successes of cromwell seem to me a very natural thing since he was not shot in battle they were an inevitable thing that such a man with the eye to see with the heart to dare should advance from post to post from victory to victory till the huntingdon farmer became by whatever name you might call him the acknowledged strongest man in england virtually the king of england requires no magic to explain it   truly it is a sad thing for a people as for a man to fall into scepticism into dilettantism insincerity not to know sincerity when they see it for this world and for all worlds what curse is so fatal the heart lying dead the eye cannot see what intellect remains is merely the vulpine intellect that a true king be sent them is of small use they do not know him when sent they say scornfully is this your king the hero wastes his heroic faculty in bootless contradiction from the unworthy and can accomplish little for himself he does accomplish a heroic life which is much which is all but for the world he accomplishes comparatively nothing the wild rude sincerity direct from nature is not glib in answering from the witnessbox in your smalldebt piepowder court he is scouted as a counterfeit the vulpine intellect detects him for being a man worth any thousand men the response your knox your cromwell gets is an argument for two centuries whether he was a man at all gods greatest gift to this earth is sneeringly flung away the miraculous talisman is a paltry plated coin not fit to pass in the shops as a common guinea  lamentable this i say this must be remedied till this be remedied in some measure there is nothing remedied detect quacks yes do for heavens sake but know withal the men that are to be trusted till we know that what is all our knowledge how shall we even so much as detect for the vulpine sharpness which considers itself to be knowledge and detects in that fashion is far mistaken dupes indeed are many but of all dupes there is none so fatally situated as he who lives in undue terror of being duped the world does exist the world has truth in it or it would not exist first recognize what is true we shall then discern what is false and properly never till then  know the men that are to be trusted alas this is yet in these days very far from us the sincere alone can recognize sincerity not a hero only is needed but a world fit for him a world not of valetsthe hero comes almost in vain to it otherwise yes it is far from us but it must come thank god it is visibly coming till it do come what have we ballotboxes suffrages french revolutionsif we are as valets and do not know the hero when we see him what good are all these a heroic cromwell comes and for a hundred and fifty years he cannot have a vote from us why the insincere unbelieving world is the natural property of the quack and of the father of quacks and quackeries misery confusion unveracity are alone possible there by ballotboxes we alter the figure of our quack but the substance of him continues the valetworld has to be governed by the shamhero by the king merely dressed in kinggear it is his he is its in brief one of two things we shall either learn to know a hero a true governor and captain somewhat better when we see him or else go on to be forever governed by the unheroichad we ballotboxes clattering at every streetcorner there were no remedy in these  poor cromwellgreat cromwell the inarticulate prophet prophet who could not speak rude confused struggling to utter himself with his savage depth with his wild sincerity and he looked so strange among the elegant euphemisms dainty little falklands didactic chillingworths diplomatic clarendons consider him an outer hull of chaotic confusion visions of the devil nervous dreams almost semimadness and yet such a clear determinate mansenergy working in the heart of that a kind of chaotic man the ray as of pure starlight and fire working in such an element of boundless hypochondria unformed black of darkness and yet withal this hypochondria what was it but the very greatness of the man the depth and tenderness of his wild affections the quantity of sympathy he had with thingsthe quantity of insight he would yet get into the heart of things the mastery he would yet get over things this was his hypochondria the mans misery as mans misery always does came of his greatness samuel johnson too is that kind of man sorrowstricken halfdistracted the wide element of mournful black enveloping himwide as the world it is the character of a prophetic man a man with his whole soul seeing and struggling to see  on this ground too i explain to myself cromwells reputed confusion of speech to himself the internal meaning was sunclear but the material with which he was to clothe it in utterance was not there he had lived silent a great unnamed sea of thought round him all his days and in his way of life little call to attempt naming or uttering that with his sharp power of vision resolute power of action i doubt not he could have learned to write books withal and speak fluently enoughhe did harder things than writing of books this kind of man is precisely he who is fit for doing manfully all things you will set him on doing intellect is not speaking and logicizing it is seeing and ascertaining virtue virtues manhood herohood is not fairspoken immaculate regularity it is first of all what the germans well name it tugend taugend dowing or doughtiness courage and the faculty to do this basis of the matter cromwell had in him  one understands moreover how though he could not speak in parliament he might preach rhapsodic preaching above all how he might be great in extempore prayer these are the free outpouring utterances of what is in the heart method is not required in them warmth depth sincerity are all that is required cromwells habit of prayer is a notable feature of him all his great enterprises were commenced with prayer in dark inextricablelooking difficulties his officers and he used to assemble and pray alternately for hours for days till some definite resolution rose among them some door of hope as they would name it disclosed itself consider that in tears in fervent prayers and cries to the great god to have pity on them to make his light shine before them they armed soldiers of christ as they felt themselves to be a little band of christian brothers who had drawn the sword against a great black devouring world not christian but mammonish devilishthey cried to god in their straits in their extreme need not to forsake the cause that was his the light which now rose upon themhow could a human soul by any means at all get better light was not the purpose so formed like to be precisely the best wisest the one to be followed without hesitation any more to them it was as the shining of heavens own splendor in the wastehowling darkness the pillar of fire by night that was to guide them on their desolate perilous way was it not such can a mans soul to this hour get guidance by any other method than intrinsically by that samedevout prostration of the earnest struggling soul before the highest the giver of all light be such prayer a spoken articulate or be it a voiceless inarticulate one there is no other method hypocrisy one begins to be weary of all that they who call it so have no right to speak on such matters they never formed a purpose what one can call a purpose they went about balancing expediencies plausibilities gathering votes advices they never were alone with the truth of a thing at allcromwells prayers were likely to be eloquent and much more than that his was the heart of a man who could pray  but indeed his actual speeches i apprehend were not nearly so ineloquent incondite as they look we find he was what all speakers aim to be an impressive speaker even in parliament one who from the first had weight with that rude passionate voice of his he was always understood to mean something and men wished to know what he disregarded eloquence nay despised and disliked it spoke always without premeditation of the words he was to use the reporters too in those days seem to have been singularly candid and to have given the printer precisely what they found on their own notepaper and withal what a strange proof is it of cromwells being the premeditative evercalculating hypocrite acting a play before the world that to the last he took no more charge of his speeches how came he not to study his words a little before flinging them out to the public if the words were true words they could be left to shift for themselves  but with regard to cromwells lying we will make one remark this i suppose or something like this to have been the nature of it all parties found themselves deceived in him each party understood him to be meaning this heard him even say so and behold he turns out to have been meaning that he was cry they the chief of liars but now intrinsically is not all this the inevitable fortune not of a false man in such times but simply of a superior man such a man must have reticences in him if he walk wearing his heart upon his sleeve for daws to peck at his journey will not extend far there is no use for any mans taking up his abode in a house built of glass a man always is to be himself the judge how much of his mind he will show to other men even to those he would have work along with him there are impertinent inquiries made your rule is to leave the inquirer uninformed on that matter not if you can help it misinformed but precisely as dark as he was this could one hit the right phrase of response is what the wise and faithful man would aim to answer in such a case  cromwell no doubt of it spoke often in the dialect of small subaltern parties uttered to them a part of his mind each little party thought him all its own hence their rage one and all to find him not of their party but of his own party was it his blame at all seasons of his history he must have felt among such people how if he explained to them the deeper insight he had they must either have shuddered aghast at it or believing it their own little compact hypothesis must have gone wholly to wreck they could not have worked in his province any more nay perhaps they could not now have worked in their own province it is the inevitable position of a great man among small men small men most active useful are to be seen everywhere whose whole activity depends on some conviction which to you is palpably a limited one imperfect what we call an error but would it be a kindness always is it a duty always or often to disturb them in that many a man doing loud work in the world stands only on some thin traditionality conventionality to him indubitable to you incredible break that beneath him he sinks to endless depths i might have my hand full of truth said fontenelle and open only my little finger  and if this be the fact even in matters of doctrine how much more in all departments of practice he that cannot withal keep his mind to himself cannot practice any considerable thing whatever and we call it dissimulation all this what would you think of calling the general of an army a dissembler because he did not tell every corporal and private soldier who pleased to put the question what his thoughts were about everythingcromwell i should rather say managed all this in a manner we must admire for its perfection an endless vortex of such questioning corporals rolled confusedly round him through his whole course whom he did answer it must have been as a great trueseeing man that he managed this too not one proved falsehood as i said not one of what man that ever wound himself through such a coil of things will you say so much   but in fact there are two errors widely prevalent which pervert to the very basis our judgments formed about such men as cromwell about their ambition falsity and such like the first is what i might call substituting the goal of their career for the course and startingpoint of it the vulgar historian of a cromwell fancies that he had determined on being protector of england at the time when he was ploughing the marsh lands of cambridgeshire his career lay all mapped out a program of the whole drama which he then step by step dramatically unfolded with all manner of cunning deceptive dramaturgy as he went onthe hollow scheming gr upokrites or playactor that he was this is a radical perversion all but universal in such cases and think for an instant how different the fact is how much does one of us foresee of his own life short way ahead of us it is all dim an unwound skein of possibilities of apprehensions attemptabilities vaguelooming hopes this cromwell had not his life lying all in that fashion of program which he needed then with that unfathomable cunning of his only to enact dramatically scene after scene not so we see it so but to him it was in no measure so what absurdities would fall away of themselves were this one undeniable fact kept honestly in view by history historians indeed will tell you that they do keep it in viewbut look whether such is practically the fact vulgar history as in this cromwells case omits it altogether even the best kinds of history only remember it now and then to remember it duly with rigorous perfection as in the fact it stood requires indeed a rare faculty rare nay impossible a very shakspeare for faculty or more than shakspeare who could enact a brother mans biography see with the brother mans eyes at all points of his course what things he saw in short know his course and him as few historians are like to do half or more of all the thickplied perversions which distort our image of cromwell will disappear if we honestly so much as try to represent them so in sequence as they were not in the lump as they are thrown down before us  but a second error which i think the generality commit refers to this same ambition itself we exaggerate the ambition of great men we mistake what the nature of it is great men are not ambitious in that sense he is a small poor man that is ambitious so examine the man who lives in misery because he does not shine above other men who goes about producing himself pruriently anxious about his gifts and claims struggling to force everybody as it were begging everybody for gods sake to acknowledge him a great man and set him over the heads of men such a creature is among the wretchedest sights seen under this sun a great man a poor morbid prurient empty man fitter for the ward of a hospital than for a throne among men i advise you to keep out of his way he cannot walk on quiet paths unless you will look at him wonder at him write paragraphs about him he cannot live it is the emptiness of the man not his greatness because there is nothing in himself he hungers and thirsts that you would find something in him in good truth i believe no great man not so much as a genuine man who had health and real substance in him of whatever magnitude was ever much tormented in this way  your cromwell what good could it do him to be noticed by noisy crowds of people god his maker already noticed him he cromwell was already there no notice would make him other than he already was till his hair was grown gray and life from the downhill slope was all seen to be limited not infinite but finite and all a measurable matter how it wenthe had been content to plough the ground and read his bible he in his old days could not support it any longer without selling himself to falsehood that he might ride in gilt carriages to whitehall and have clerks with bundles of papers haunting him decide this decide that which in utmost sorrow of heart no man can perfectly decide what could gilt carriages do for this man from of old was there not in his life a weight of meaning a terror and a splendor as of heaven itself his existence there as man set him beyond the need of gilding death judgment and eternity these already lay as the background of whatsoever he thought or did all his life lay begirt as in a sea of nameless thoughts which no speech of a mortal could name gods word as the puritan prophets of that time had read it this was great and all else was little to him to call such a man ambitious to figure him as the prurient windbag described above seems to me the poorest solecism such a man will say keep your gilt carriages and huzzaing mobs keep your redtape clerks your influentialities your important businesses leave me alone leave me alone there is too much of life in me already old samuel johnson the greatest soul in england in his day was not ambitious corsica boswell flaunted at public shows with printed ribbons round his hat but the great old samuel stayed at home the worldwide soul wrapt up in its thoughts in its sorrowswhat could paradings and ribbons in the hat do for it  ah yes i will say again the great silent men looking round on the noisy inanity of the world words with little meaning actions with little worth one loves to reflect on the great empire of silence the noble silent men scattered here and there each in his department silently thinking silently working whom no morning newspaper makes mention of they are the salt of the earth a country that has none or few of these is in a bad way like a forest which had no roots which had all turned into leaves and boughswhich must soon wither and be no forest woe for us if we had nothing but what we can show or speak silence the great empire of silence higher than the stars deeper than the kingdoms of death it alone is great all else is smalli hope we english will long maintain our grand talent pour le silence let others that cannot do without standing on barrelheads to spout and be seen of all the marketplace cultivate speech exclusivelybecome a most green forest without roots solomon says there is a time to speak but also a time to keep silence of some great silent samuel not urged to writing as old samuel johnson says he was by want of money and nothing other one might ask why do not you too get up and speak promulgate your system found your sect truly he will answer i am continent of my thought hitherto happily i have yet had the ability to keep it in me no compulsion strong enough to speak it my system is not for promulgation first of all it is for serving myself to live by that is the great purpose of it to me and then the honor alas yesbut as cato said of the statue so many statues in that forum of yours may it not be better if they ask where is catos statue  but now by way of counterpoise to this of silence let me say that there are two kinds of ambition one wholly blamable the other laudable and inevitable nature has provided that the great silent samuel shall not be silent too long the selfish wish to shine over others let it be accounted altogether poor and miserable seekest thou great things seek them not this is most true and yet i say there is an irrepressible tendency in every man to develop himself according to the magnitude which nature has made him of to speak out to act out what nature has laid in him this is proper fit inevitable nay it is a duty and even the summary of duties for a man the meaning of life here on earth might be defined as consisting in this to unfold your self to work what thing you have the faculty for it is a necessity for the human being the first law of our existence coleridge beautifully remarks that the infant learns to speak by this necessity it feelswe will say therefore to decide about ambition whether it is bad or not you have two things to take into view not the coveting of the place alone but the fitness of the man for the place withal that is the question perhaps the place was his perhaps he had a natural right and even obligation to seek the place mirabeaus ambition to be prime minister how shall we blame it if he were the only man in france that could have done any good there hopefuler perhaps had he not so clearly felt how much good he could do but a poor necker who could do no good and had even felt that he could do none yet sitting brokenhearted because they had flung him out and he was now quit of it well might gibbon mourn over himnature i say has provided amply that the silent great man shall strive to speak withal too amply rather  fancy for example you had revealed to the brave old samuel johnson in his shroudedup existence that it was possible for him to do priceless divine work for his country and the whole world that the perfect heavenly law might be made law on this earth that the prayer he prayed daily thy kingdom come was at length to be fulfilled if you had convinced his judgment of this that it was possible practicable that he the mournful silent samuel was called to take a part in it would not the whole soul of the man have flamed up into a divine clearness into noble utterance and determination to act casting all sorrows and misgivings under his feet counting all affliction and contradiction smallthe whole dark element of his existence blazing into articulate radiance of light and lightning it were a true ambition this and think now how it actually was with cromwell from of old the sufferings of gods church true zealous preachers of the truth flung into dungeons whips set on pillories their ears crops off gods gospelcause trodden under foot of the unworthy all this had lain heavy on his soul long years he had looked upon it in silence in prayer seeing no remedy on earth trusting well that a remedy in heavens goodness would comethat such a course was false unjust and could not last forever and now behold the dawn of it after twelve years silent waiting all england stirs itself there is to be once more a parliament the right will get a voice for itself inexpressible wellgrounded hope has come again into the earth was not such a parliament worth being a member of cromwell threw down his ploughs and hastened thither  he spoke thererugged bursts of earnestness of a selfseen truth where we get a glimpse of them he worked there he fought and strove like a strong true giant of a man through cannontumult and all elseon and on till the cause triumphed its once so formidable enemies all swept from before it and the dawn of hope had become clear light of victory and certainty that he stood there as the strongest soul of england the undisputed hero of all englandwhat of this it was possible that the law of christs gospel could now establish itself in the world the theocracy which john knox in his pulpit might dream of as a devout imagination this practical man experienced in the whole chaos of most rough practice dared to consider as capable of being realized those that were highest in christs church the devoutest wisest men were to rule the land in some considerable degree it might be so and should be so was it not true gods truth and if true was it not then the very thing to do the strongest practical intellect in england dared to answer yes this i call a noble true purpose is it not in its own dialect the noblest that could enter into the heart of statesman or man for a knox to take it up was something but for a cromwell with his great sound sense and experience of what our world washistory i think shows it only this once in such a degree i account it the culminating point of protestantism the most heroic phasis that faith in the bible was appointed to exhibit here below fancy it that it were made manifest to one of us how we could make the right supremely victorious over wrong and all that we had longed and prayed for as the highest good to england and all lands an attainable fact  well i must say the vulpine intellect with its knowingness its alertness and expertness in detecting hypocrites seems to me a rather sorry business we have had but one such statesman in england one man that i can get sight of who ever had in the heart of him any such purpose at all one man in the course of fifteen hundred years and this was his welcome he had adherents by the hundred or the ten opponents by the million had england rallied all round himwhy then england might have been a christian land as it is vulpine knowingness sits yet at its hopeless problem given a world of knaves to educe an honesty from their united actionhow cumbrous a problem you may see in chancery lawcourts and some other places till at length by heavens just anger but also by heavens great grace the matter begins to stagnate and this problem is becoming to all men a palpably hopeless one   but with regard to cromwell and his purposes hume and a multitude following him come upon me here with an admission that cromwell was sincere at first a sincere fanatic at first but gradually became a hypocrite as things opened round him this of the fanatichypocrite is humes theory of it extensively applied sinceto mahomet and many others think of it seriously you will find something in it not much not all very far from all sincere hero hearts do not sink in this miserable manner the sun flings forth impurities gets balefully incrusted with spots but it does not quench itself and become no sun at all but a mass of darkness i will venture to say that such never befell a great deep cromwell i think never natures own lionhearted son antaeuslike his strength is got by touching the earth his mother lift him up from the earth lift him up into hypocrisy inanity his strength is gone we will not assert that cromwell was an immaculate man that he fell into no faults no insincerities among the rest he was no dilettante professor of perfections immaculate conducts he was a rugged orson rending his rough way through actual true workdoubtless with many a fall therein insincerities faults very many faults daily and hourly it was too well known to him known to god and him the sun was dimmed many a time but the sun had not himself grown a dimness cromwells last words as he lay waiting for death are those of a christian heroic man broken prayers to god that he would judge him and this cause he since man could not in justice yet in pity they are most touching words he breathed out his wild great soul its toils and sins all ended now into the presence of his maker in this manner  i for one will not call the man a hypocrite hypocrite mummer the life of him a mere theatricality empty barren quack hungry for the shouts of mobs the man had made obscurity do very well for him till his head was gray and now he was there as he stood recognized unblamed the virtual king of england cannot a man do without kings coaches and cloaks is it such a blessedness to have clerks forever pestering you with bundles of papers in red tape a simple diocletian prefers planting of cabbages a george washington no very immeasurable man does the like one would say it is what any genuine man could do and would do the instant his real work were out in the matter of kingshipaway with it  let us remark meanwhile how indispensable everywhere a king is in all movements of men it is strikingly shown in this very war what becomes of men when they cannot find a chief man and their enemies can the scotch nation was all but unanimous in puritanism zealous and of one mind about it as in this english end of the island was always far from being the case but there was no great cromwell among them poor tremulous hesitating diplomatic argyles and such like none of them had a heart true enough for the truth or durst commit himself to the truth they had no leader and the scattered cavalier party in that country had one montrose the noblest of all the cavaliers an accomplished gallanthearted splendid man what one may call the herocavalier well look at it on the one hand subjects without a king on the other a king without subjects the subjects without king can do nothing the subjectless king can do something this montrose with a handful of irish or highland savages few of them so much as guns in their hands dashes at the drilled puritan armies like a wild whirlwind sweeps them time after time some five times over from the field before him he was at one period for a short while master of all scotland one man but he was a man a million zealous men but without the one they against him were powerless perhaps of all the persons in that puritan struggle from first to last the single indispensable one was verily cromwell to see and dare and decide to be a fixed pillar in the welter of uncertaintya king among them whether they called him so or not   precisely here however lies the rub for cromwell his other proceedings have all found advocates and stand generally justified but this dismissal of the rump parliament and assumption of the protectorship is what no one can pardon him he had fairly grown to be king in england chief man of the victorious party in england but it seems he could not do without the kings cloak and sold himself to perdition in order to get it let us see a little how this was  england scotland ireland all lying now subdued at the feet of the puritan parliament the practical question arose what was to be done with it how will you govern these nations which providence in a wondrous way has given up to your disposal clearly those hundred surviving members of the long parliament who sit there as supreme authority cannot continue forever to sit what is to be doneit was a question which theoretical constitutionbuilders may find easy to answer but to cromwell looking there into the real practical facts of it there could be none more complicated he asked of the parliament what it was they would decide upon it was for the parliament to say yet the soldiers too however contrary to formula they who had purchased this victory with their blood it seemed to them that they also should have something to say in it we will not for all our fighting have nothing but a little piece of paper we understand that the law of gods gospel to which he through us has given the victory shall establish itself or try to establish itself in this land  for three years cromwell says this question had been sounded in the ears of the parliament they could make no answer nothing but talk talk perhaps it lies in the nature of parliamentary bodies perhaps no parliament could in such case make any answer but even that of talk talk nevertheless the question must and shall be answered you sixty men there becoming fast odious even despicable to the whole nation whom the nation already calls rump parliament you cannot continue to sit there who or what then is to follow free parliament right of election constitutional formulas of one sort or the otherthe thing is a hungry fact coming on us which we must answer or be devoured by it and who are you that prate of constitutional formulas rights of parliament you have had to kill your king to make prides purges to expel and banish by the law of the stronger whosoever would not let your cause prosper there are but fifty or threescore of you left there debating in these days tell us what we shall do not in the way of formula but of practicable fact  how they did finally answer remains obscure to this day the diligent godwin himself admits that he cannot make it out the likeliest is that this poor parliament still would not and indeed could not dissolve and disperse that when it came to the point of actually dispersing they again for the tenth or twentieth time adjourned itand cromwells patience failed him but we will take the favorablest hypothesis ever started for the parliament the favorablest though i believe it is not the true one but too favorable  according to this version at the uttermost crisis when cromwell and his officers were met on the one hand and the fifty or sixty rump members on the other it was suddenly told cromwell that the rump in its despair was answering in a very singular way that in their splenetic envious despair to keep out the army at least these men were hurrying through the house a kind of reform billparliament to be chosen by the whole of england equable electoral division into districts free suffrage and the rest of it a very questionable or indeed for them an unquestionable thing reform bill free suffrage of englishmen why the royalists themselves silenced indeed but not exterminated perhaps outnumber us the great numerical majority of england was always indifferent to our cause merely looked at it and submitted to it it is in weight and force not by counting of heads that we are the majority and now with your formulas and reform bills the whole matter sorely won by our swords shall again launch itself to sea become a mere hope and likelihood small even as a likelihood and it is not a likelihood it is a certainty which we have won by gods strength and our own right hands and do now hold here cromwell walked down to these refractory members interrupted them in that rapid speed of their reform billordered them to begone and talk there no morecan we not forgive him can we not understand him john milton who looked on it all near at hand could applaud him the reality had swept the formulas away before it i fancy most men who were realities in england might see into the necessity of that  the strong daring man therefore has set all manner of formulas and logical superficialities against him has dared appeal to the genuine fact of this england whether it will support him or not it is curious to see how he struggles to govern in some constitutional way find some parliament to support him but cannot his first parliament the one they call bareboness parliament is so to speak a convocation of the notables from all quarters of england the leading ministers and chief puritan officials nominate the men most distinguished by religious reputation influence and attachment to the true cause these are assembled to shape out a plan they sanctioned what was past shaped as they could what was to come they were scornfully called bareboness parliament the mans name it seems was not barebones but barbonea good enough man nor was it a jest their work it was a most serious realitya trial on the part of these puritan notables how far the law of christ could become the law of this england there were men of sense among them men of some quality men of deep piety i suppose the most of them were they failed it seems and broke down endeavoring to reform the court of chancery they dissolved themselves as incompetent delivered up their power again into the hands of the lord general cromwell to do with it what he liked and could  what will he do with it the lord general cromwell commanderinchief of all the forces raised and to be raised he hereby sees himself at this unexampled juncture as it were the one available authority left in england nothing between england and utter anarchy but him alone such is the undeniable fact of his position and englands there and then what will he do with it after deliberation he decides that he will accept it will formally with public solemnity say and vow before god and men yes the fact is so and i will do the best i can with it protectorship instrument of governmentthese are the external forms of the thing worked out and sanctioned as they could in the circumstances be by the judges by the leading official people council of officers and persons of interest in the nation and as for the thing itself undeniably enough at the pass matters had now come to there was no alternative but anarchy or that puritan england might accept it or not but puritan england was in real truth saved from suicide therebyi believe the puritan people did in an inarticulate grumbling yet on the whole grateful and real way accept this anomalous act of olivers at least he and they together made it good and always better to the last but in their parliamentary articulate way they had their difficulties and never knew fully what to say to it  olivers second parliament properly his first regular parliament chosen by the rule laid down in the instrument of government did assemble and workedbut got before long into bottomless questions as to the protectors right as to usurpation and so forth and had at the earliest legal day to be dismissed cromwells concluding speech to these men is a remarkable one so likewise to his third parliament in similar rebuke for their pedantries and obstinacies most rude chaotic all these speeches are but most earnestlooking you would say it was a sincere helpless man not used to speak the great inorganic thought of him but to act it rather a helplessness of utterance in such bursting fulness of meaning he talks much about births of providence all these changes so many victories and events were not forethoughts and theatrical contrivances of men of me or of men it is blind blasphemers that will persist in calling them so he insists with a heavy sulphurous wrathful emphasis on this as he well might as if a cromwell in that dark huge game he had been playing the world wholly thrown into chaos round him had foreseen it all and played it all off like a precontrived puppetshow by wood and wire these things were foreseen by no man he says no man could tell what a day would bring forth they were births of providence gods finger guided us on and we came at last to clear height of victory gods cause triumphant in these nations and you as a parliament could assemble together and say in what manner all this could be organized reduced into rational feasibility among the affairs of men you were to help with your wise counsel in doing that you have had such an opportunity as no parliament in england ever had christs law the right and true was to be in some measure made the law of this land in place of that you have got into your idle pedantries constitutionalities bottomless cavillings and questionings about written laws for my coming hereand would send the whole matter into chaos again because i have no notarys parchment but only gods voice from the battlewhirlwind for being president among you that opportunity is gone and we know not when it will return you have had your constitutional logic and mammons law not christs law rules yet in this land god be judge between you and me these are his final words to them take you your constitutionformulas in your hand and i my informal struggles purposes realities and acts and god be judge between you and me  we said above what shapeless involved chaotic things the printed speeches of cromwell are wilfully ambiguous unintelligible say the most a hypocrite shrouding himself in confused jesuitic jargon to me they do not seem so i will say rather they afforded the first glimpses i could ever get into the reality of this cromwell nay into the possibility of him try to believe that he means something search lovingly what that may be you will find a real speech lying imprisoned in these broken rude tortuous utterances a meaning in the great heart of this inarticulate man you will for thc first time begin to see that he was a man not an enigmatic chimera unintelligible to you incredible to you the histories and biographies written of this cromwell written in shallow sceptical generations that could not know or conceive of a deep believing man are far more obscure than cromwells speeches you look through them only into the infinite vague of black and the inane heats and jealousies says lord clarendon himself heats and jealousies mere crabbed whims theories and crotchets these induced slow sober quiet englishmen to lay down their ploughs and work and fly into red fury of confused war against the bestconditioned of kings try if you can find that true scepticism writing about belief may have great gifts but it is really ultra vires there it is blindness laying down the laws of optics  cromwells third parliament split on the same rock as his second ever the constitutional formula how came you there show us some notary parchment blind pedantswhy surely the same power which makes you a parliament that and something more made me a protector if my protectorship is nothing what in the name of wonder is your parliamenteership a reflex and creation of that  parliaments having failed there remained nothing but the way of despotism military dictators each with his district to coerce the royalist and other gainsayers to govern them if not by act of parliament then by the sword formula shall not carry it while the reality is here i will go on protecting oppressed protestants abroad appointing just judges wise managers at home cherishing true gospel ministers doing the best i can to make england a christian england greater than old rome the queen of protestant christianity i since you will not help me i while god leaves me lifewhy did he not give it up retire into obscurity again since the law would not acknowledge him cry several that is where they mistake for him there was no giving of it up prime ministers have governed countries pitt pombal choiseul and their word was a law while it held but this prime minister was one that could not get resigned let him once resign charles stuart and the cavaliers waited to kill him to kill the cause and him once embarked there is no retreat no return this prime minister could retire nowhither except into his tomb  one is sorry for cromwell in his old days his complaint is incessant of the heavy burden providence has laid on him heavy which he must bear till death old colonel hutchinson as his wife relates it hutchinson his old battlemate coming to see him on some indispensable business much against his willcromwell follows him to the door in a most fraternal domestic conciliatory style begs that he would be reconciled to him his old brother in arms says how much it grieves him to be misunderstood deserted by true fellowsoldiers dear to him from of old the rigorous hutchinson cased in his republican formula sullenly goes his wayand the mans head now white his strong arm growing weary with its long work i think always too of his poor mother now very old living in that palace of his a right brave woman as indeed they lived all an honest godfearing household there if she heard a shot go off she thought it was her son killed he had to come to her at least once a day that she might see with her own eyes that he was yet living the poor old motherwhat had this man gained what had he gained he had a life of sore strife and toil to his last day fame ambition place in history his dead body was hung in chains his place in historyplace in history forsoothhas been a place of ignominy accusation blackness and disgrace and here this day who knows if it is not rash in me to be among the first that ever ventured to pronounce him not a knave and liar but a genuinely honest man peace to him did he not in spite of all accomplish much for us we walk smoothly over his great rough heroic life step over his body sunk in the ditch there we need not spurn it as we step on itlet the hero rest it was not to mens judgment that he appealed nor have men judged him very well   precisely a century and a year after this of puritanism had got itself hushed up into decent composure and its results made smooth in 1688 there broke out a far deeper explosion much more difficult to hush up known to all mortals and like to be long known by the name of french revolution it is properly the third and final act of protestantism the explosive confused return of mankind to reality and fact now that they were perishing of semblance and sham we call our english puritanism the second act well then the bible is true let us go by the bible in church said luther in church and state said cromwell let us go by what actually is gods truth men have to return to reality they cannot live on semblance the french revolution or third act we may well call the final one for lower than that savage sansculottism men cannot go they stand there on the nakedest haggard fact undeniable in all seasons and circumstances and may and must begin again confidently to build up from that the french explosion like the english one got its kingwho had no notary parchment to show for himself we have still to glance for a moment at napoleon our second modern king  napoleon does by no means seem to me so great a man as cromwell his enormous victories which reached over all europe while cromwell abode mainly in our little england are but as the high stilts on which the man is seen standing the stature of the man is not altered thereby i find in him no such sincerity as in cromwell only a far inferior sort no silent walking through long years with the awful unnamable of this universe walking with god as he called it and faith and strength in that alone latent thought and valor content to lie latent then burst out as in blaze of heavens lightning napoleon lived in an age when god was no longer believed the meaning of all silence latency was thought to be nonentity he had to begin not out of the puritan bible but out of poor sceptical encyclopedies this was the length the man carried it meritorious to get so far his compact prompt every way articulate character is in itself perhaps small compared with our great chaotic inarticulate cromwells instead of dumb prophet struggling to speak we have a portentous mixture of the quack withal humes notion of the fanatichypocrite with such truth as it has will apply much better to napoleon than it did to cromwell to mahomet or the likewhere indeed taken strictly it has hardly any truth at all an element of blamable ambition shows itself from the first in this man gets the victory over him at last and involves him and his work in ruin  false as a bulletin became a proverb in napoleons time he makes what excuse he could for it that it was necessary to mislead the enemy to keep up his own mens courage and so forth on the whole there are no excuses a man in no case has liberty to tell lies it had been in the longrun better for napoleon too if he had not told any in fact if a man have any purpose reaching beyond the hour and day meant to be found extant next day what good can it ever be to promulgate lies the lies are found out ruinous penalty is exacted for them no man will believe the liar next time even when he speaks truth when it is of the last importance that he be believed the old cry of wolfa lie is nothing you cannot of nothing make something you make nothing at last and lose your labor into the bargain  yet napoleon had a sincerity we are to distinguish between what is superficial and what is fundamental in insincerity across these outer manoeuverings and quackeries of his which were many and most blamable let us discern withal that the man had a certain instinctive ineradicable feeling for reality and did base himself upon fact so long as he had any basis he has an instinct of nature better than his culture was his savans bourrienne tells us in that voyage to egypt were one evening busily occupied arguing that there could be no god they had proved it to their satisfaction by all manner of logic napoleon looking up into the stars answers very ingenious messieurs but who made all that the atheistic logic runs off from him like water the great fact stares him in the face who made all that so too in practice he as every man that can be great or have victory in this world sees through all entanglements the practical heart of the matter drives straight towards that when the steward of his tuileries palace was exhibiting the new upholstery with praises and demonstration how glorious it was and how cheap withal napoleon making little answer asked for a pair of scissors clips one of the gold tassels from a windowcurtain put it in his pocket and walked on some days afterwards he produced it at the right moment to the horror of his upholstery functionary it was not gold but tinsel in st helena it is notable how he still to his last days insists on the practical the real why talk and complain above all why quarrel with one another there is no result in it it comes to nothing that one can do say nothing if one can do nothing he speaks often so to his poor discontented followers he is like a piece of silent strength in the middle of their morbid querulousness there  and accordingly was there not what we can call a faith in him genuine so far as it went that this new enormous democracy asserting itself here in the french revolution is an unsuppressible fact which the whole world with its old forces and institutions cannot put down this was a true insight of his and took his conscience and enthusiasm along with ita faith and did he not interpret the dim purport of it well la carriere ouverte aux talens the implements to him who can handle them this actually is the truth and even the whole truth it includes whatever the french revolution or any revolution could mean napoleon in his first period was a true democrat and yet by the nature of him fostered too by his military trade he knew that democracy if it were a true thing at all could not be an anarchy the man had a hearthatred for anarchy on that twentieth of june 1792 bourrienne and he sat in a coffeehouse as the mob rolled by napoleon expresses the deepest contempt for persons in authority that they do not restrain this rabble on the tenth of august he wonders why there is no man to command these poor swiss they would conquer if there were such a faith in democracy yet hatred of anarchy it is that carries napoleon through all his great work through his brilliant italian campaigns onwards to the peace of leoben one would say his inspiration is triumph to the french revolution assertion of it against these austrian simulacra that pretend to call it a simulacrum withal however he feels and has a right to feel how necessary a strong authority is how the revolution cannot prosper or last without such to bridle in that great devouring selfdevouring french revolution to tame it so that its intrinsic purpose can be made good that it may become organic and be able to live among other organisms and formed things not as a wasting destruction alone is not this still what he partly aimed at as the true purport of his life nay what he actually managed to do through wagrams austerlitzes triumph after triumphhe triumphed so far there was an eye to see in this man a soul to dare and do he rose naturally to be the king all men saw that he was such the common soldiers used to say on the march these babbling avocats up at paris all talk and no work what wonder it runs all wrong we shall have to go and put our petit caporal there they went and put him there they and france at large chiefconsulship emperorship victory over europetill the poor lieutenant of la fere not unnaturally might seem to himself the greatest of all men that had been in the world for some ages  but at this point i think the fatal charlatanelement got the upper hand he apostatized from his old faith in facts took to believing in semblances strove to connect himself with austrian dynasties popedoms with the old false feudalities which he once saw clearly to be falseconsidered that he would found his dynasty and so forth that the enormous french revolution meant only that the man was given up to strong delusion that he should believe a lie a fearful but most sure thing he did not know true from false now when he looked at themthe fearfulest penalty a man pays for yielding to untruth of heart self and false ambition had now become his god selfdeception once yielded to all other deceptions follow naturally more and more what a paltry patchwork of theatrical papermantles tinsel and mummery had this man wrapt his own great reality in thinking to make it more real thereby his hollow popesconcordat pretending to be a reestablishment of catholicism felt by himself to be the method of extirpating it la vaccine de la religion his ceremonial coronations consecrations by the old italian chimera in notredamewanting nothing to complete the pomp of it as augereau said nothing but the halfmillion of men who had died to put an end to all that cromwells inauguration was by the sword and bible what we must call a genuinely true one sword and bible were borne before him without any chimera were not these the real emblems of puritanism its true decoration and insignia it had used them both in a very real manner and pretended to stand by them now but this poor napoleon mistook he believed too much in the dupability of men saw no fact deeper in man than hunger and this he was mistaken like a man that should build upon cloud his house and he fall down in confused wreck and depart out of the world  alas in all of us this charlatanelement exists and might be developed were the temptation strong enough lead us not into temptation but it is fatal i say that it be developed the thing into which it enters as a cognizable ingredient is doomed to be altogether transitory and however huge it may look is in itself small napoleons working accordingly what was it with all the noise it made a flash as of gunpowder widespread a blazingup as of dry heath for an hour the whole universe seems wrapt in smoke and flame but only for an hour it goes out the universe with its old mountains and streams its stars above and kind soil beneath is still there  the duke of weimar told his friends always to be of courage this napoleonism was unjust a falsehood and could not last it is true doctrine the heavier this napoleon trampled on the world holding it tyrannously down the fiercer would the worlds recoil against him be one day injustice pays itself with frightful compoundinterest i am not sure but he had better have lost his best park of artillery or had his best regiment drowned in the sea than shot that poor german bookseller palm it was a palpable tyrannous murderous injustice which no man let him paint an inch thick could make out to be other it burnt deep into the hearts of men it and the like of it suppressed fire flashed in the eyes of men as they thought of itwaiting their day which day came germany rose round himwhat napoleon did will in the longrun amount to what he did justly what nature with her laws will sanction to what of reality was in him to that and nothing more the rest was all smoke and waste la carriere ouverte aux talens that great true message which has yet to articulate and fulfil itself everywhere he left in a most inarticulate state he was a great ebauche a rudedraught never completed as indeed what great man is other left in too rude a state alas  his notions of the world as he expresses them there at st helena are almost tragical to consider he seems to feel the most unaffected surprise that it has all gone so that he is flung out on the rock here and the world is still moving on its axis france is great and allgreat and at bottom he is france england itself he says is by nature only an appendage of france another isle of oleron to france so it was by nature by napoleonnature and yet look how in facthere am i he cannot understand it inconceivable that the reality has not corresponded to his program of it that france was not allgreat that he was not france strong delusion that he should believe the thing to be which is not the compact clearseeing decisive italian nature of him strong genuine which he once had has enveloped itself halfdissolved itself in a turbid atmosphere of french fanfaronade the world was not disposed to be trodden down underfoot to be bound into masses and built together as he liked for a pedestal to france and him the world had quite other purposes in view napoleons astonishment is extreme but alas what help now he had gone that way of his and nature also had gone her way having once parted with reality he tumbles helpless in vacuity no rescue for him he had to sink there mournfully as man seldom did and break his great heart and diethis poor napoleon a great implement too soon wasted till it was useless our last great man  our last in a double sense for here finally these wide roamings of ours through so many times and places in search and study of heroes are to terminate i am sorry for it there was pleasure for me in this business if also much pain it is a great subject and a most grave and wide one this which not to be too grave about it i have named heroworship it enters deeply as i think into the secret of mankinds ways and vitalest interests in this world and is well worth explaining at present with six months instead of six days we might have done better i promised to break ground on it i know not whether i have even managed to do that i have had to tear it up in the rudest manner in order to get into it at all often enough with these abrupt utterances thrown out isolated unexplained has your tolerance been put to the trial tolerance patient candor allhoping favor and kindness which i will not speak of at present the accomplished and distinguished the beautiful the wise something of what is best in england have listened patiently to my rude words with many feelings i heartily thank you all and say good be with you all
