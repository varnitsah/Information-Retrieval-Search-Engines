 it was a hot september afternoon leland wondered vaguely how the harvesting and threshing were progressing in his own far distant country as he leant on the mossgrown wall of the terrace beneath the old house of barrockholme he had been a week there now as the guest of lieutenant denham whose acquaintance he had originally made out on the wide prairie in western canada and for whom he had a certain liking that was slightly tinged with contempt the estate would be jimmy denhams some day provided that his father succeeded in keeping it out of the grasp of his creditors those who knew the old man well fancied that he might with difficulty accomplish it for branscombe denham of barrockholme was not troubled by many scruples and had acquired considerable proficiency in the evasion of debts  the mansion stood on the brink of a ravine in the desolate border marshes part of it had been built to stand a siege in the days of the scottish wars the strong square tower was intact and habitable still the rest of the low building stretched round three sides of a quadrangle with a dry moat across the fourth beyond which lawn and flowergarden lay shielded from the shrewd border winds by tall lichened walls through an archway one could look down across silverstemmed birches and dusky firs upon the barrock flashing in the depths of the ravine  leland found the prospect pleasant as he lounged there with a cigar in his hand he was accustomed to his own country and there was something congenial and in a fashion familiar in the sweep of lonely moorlands and bleak scottish hills which stretched shining warm in the paling sunlight along the northern horizon it reminded him of his own country which was even more wild and desolate on the southern border of western canada he had been three months in england and was already longing to be home again though he had found what he called the hardness of the north congenial  it was a land of legends and traditions of which they were rather proud at barrockholme the grey tower had more than once been beset by the border spears on whom the dragons mouth on the wall above had spouted boiling oil there was an oak on the edge of the ravine which had borne bitter fruit in the days of foray andfor the men of barrockholme could strike back tellingly thenthe quadrangle had been filled with scottish cattle they were grim hard men and what he had heard of their doings appealed to leland he himself was in some respects a hard man and rather primitive the life of the wardens of barrockholme and the mosstroopers was rather more comprehensible to him than the one of which he had had brief glimpses in london  while he stood there jimmy denham came along the terrace and stopped beside him  youre not going down to join them he said indicating with a little wave of a particularly wellshaped hand the whiteclad figures that flitted to and fro across a sunken square of turf beyond the lawn  no said leland i dont play tennis well in fact i dont play any of your games i never had time to learn them  denham sat down upon the wall and looked at him languidly he was a wellfavoured young man tall and fair with pale blue eyes and distinguished by a finicking almost feminine daintiness in dress and person though he was proficient in most manly sports and a soldier his friends however were aware that his fastidiousness was much less noticeable in his character  one cant do everything he said lazily i dont know that ive seen another beginner show quite as good form at billiards as you do ill play you fifty with the same allowance as last time it will be some time yet before dinner  not just now it seems to me ive had about enough of billiards for one week to be quite straight one finds learning your amusements a trifle expensive and im not sure theyre worth it you see im not going to stay here forever and once i go back it will probably be a very long while before i take part in any of them again  denham laughed with undiminished goodhumour well he said though i have taken a little out of you the acquisition of knowledge is usually more or less costly theres a couple of hours to put in anyway what would you like to do  i dont mind poker if youll make it high enough  denham saw the little twinkle in his eyes and languidly shook his head  no he said i rather fancy you would have me there the suggestions a bit significant and i have a notion your nerves too good of course it isnt very sporting to say no but i really cant afford to face a risk just now  which was probably why you wanted to play billiards with me  denham regarded him reproachfully for a moment or two and then made a little gesture that coming from some people might be considered offensive but nobody seems to mind how you express yourself although your observations arent always particularly delicate still im willing to admit that i want fifty pounds rather worse than i generally do  i wonder said leland with a trace of dryness if you would take it amiss if i offered to lend it to you  jimmy denham smiled delicately where another man would have grinned not in the least in fact i should consider myself distinctly obliged to you  then you shall have a cheque after dinner  denham thanked him without effusion one could almost have fancied that it was he who was conferring the favour as leland listened a little sardonic smile crept into his eyes he was known in his own country as a shrewd man and was quite aware that he ran some risk in lending his comrade fifty pounds but jimmy had done him one or two kindnesses and that counted for much with leland  who is the very pretty girl who has just come into the tennis ground he asked  my sister said denham i had almost forgotten you had not met carrie she is rather pretty though while the governor and i are denhams she takes after the other side of the family in more ways than one she has only just come from town you know  leland did not know he had merely heard that there was a carrie denham but as he looked down across the moat he was conscious of a sudden interest in the girl she stood with one hand on the back of a basketchair her long white dress flowing in easy lines about her tall and shapely figure so far as he could see it her face beneath the big white hat was attractive too but it was her pose that vaguely impressed him there was a suggestion of strength and pride in it that was by no means noticeable in the case of either her father or jimmy denham the appearance of the man with whom she talked was however much less pleasing he was inclined to be portly his face was coarsely fleshy with the distinctive stamp of the city on him he looked out of place in that quaint old pleasance on the desolate border side he reminded leland forcibly of the caricatures he had seen of hebrew usurers  and the gentleman he asked  denham laughed you would expect his name to be moses or levy but as a matter of fact it isnt anyway he calls himself aylmer a friend of the governors and the usual something in the city comes down for a week or two at the partridges ostensibly at least though its quite possible there will be a dog or two and perhaps a keeper disabled before he goes away if you care to come down ill present you to carrie she knows you are here and is no doubt a trifle curious about you  if she was miss denham concealed the fact very well and leland who was not readily embarrassed felt a quite unusual diffidence as she held out a little white hand he noticed however that she looked at him frankly and that she had a beautiful hand like the rest of the denhams her face was cold and somewhat colourless with dusky hair low on the broad forehead unusually straight brows and dark eyes a beautiful face it seemed to him but one that had a vague suggestion of weariness in it just then carrie denham he thought in no way resembled her easygoing brother jimmy there was as he expressed it to himself more grit in her and yet he was without exactly knowing why rather sorry for her she was evidently not more than three or fourandtwenty and he felt there must be a reason for her quietness and reserve which appeared a trifle unnatural  she on her part saw a tall and wiry rather than stalwart man some four or five years older than herself especially straight of limb holding himself well whilst his bronzed face which was otherwise of browneyed english type showed undoubted force he was she fancied a man accustomed to exert authority but not exactly what in the most restricted english sense of the word would be called a gentleman at least he was evidently one who earned his living and his hands were curiously brown and hard while the manner in which he wore his shooting clothes suggested that he seldom wasted much time over his toilet  i hope you will find your stay at barrockholme pleasant she said in weather like this the birds should lie well you have not been here long  a week said leland  jimmy denham had in the meanwhile passed on his sister glanced at the fleshy aylmer who was about to move the chair for her  no she said in a coldly even voice you need not trouble i am not going to stay here have they shown you our drippingwell yet mr leland  leland who said he had not seen it surmised that miss denham desired to be rid of her other cavalier but aylmer who protested that he had an absorbing interest in drippingwells was not to be shaken off so they crossed the lawn and went out through the archway together then leland stopped a moment and flashed a questioning glance at carrie denham for the strip of pathway outside the wall was perhaps two feet wide and he could look almost straight down through the tops of the birch trees upon the barrock flashing in the hollow a hundred and fifty feet below he was thinking that it would probably go hard with anybody who stumbled there a railed walk led in the opposite direction  carrie denham however met his gaze with a faint understanding smile and he followed her in single file until the path grew broader beyond a bend of the wall then looking round he saw as he halfexpected that the passage had apparently been too much for the third of the party in another moment he met the girls glance again  i hope you were not afraid she said  lelands eyes twinkled but he made no disclaimer which for no apparent reason seemed to please her  there is of course another path she said  so i should surmise said leland do you really wish to show me the well  the girl laughed for the first time and the swift change in her face almost startled the man the coldness and reserve had gone and for a moment she was it seemed to him subtly alluring  well she said i have to justify myself and somebody may ask you what you think of it under the circumstances it might be better to go on although the way is often a little muddy when one gets among the trees  leland was fancying that it must have been muddier than usual or she would not have ventured there when they reached a spot where a tiny stream came trickling out of a hollow shrouded with sombre firs a few stones had evidently once been laid in the moss and mire but some of them had sunk and the gaps were wide between carrie denham stopped and surveyed them dubiously  i havent been here for a long while but i dont like to turn back she said  or the men who do  she flashed a little swift glance at him but his face was expressionless that goes without saying  leland glanced down at her little bronze shoes of course there is usually a way but the trouble is that i am a stranger if i were in my own country i should suggest a very simple means of getting you over  the girl looked at him with something in her eyes that suggested ironical appreciation of his boldness but her only action was to shake her head  it is just as well you are not she said we are a little less primitive here  then said leland i guess we must try the other way  he plunged boldly into the mossy quagmire into which he sank well above his ankles and held out his hand to her she noticed as she sprang from stone to stone how hard it was and how firm his grasp it seemed to her that what this man took hold of he would not easily let go an impression she remembered afterwards  she crossed dryshod and leland did not seem in the least concerned at the water squishing in his shoes there was then a scramble up the hillside under the shadowy firs until they reached the well which leland promptly decided was not very much to look at it lay at the head of a little green hollow a wall of fissured limestones sprinkled with mosses and tufted with hartstongue fern from the midst of which the water splashed drip by drip into a shallow basin carrie denham turned and glanced at him with a trace of somewhat chilly amusement in her face  you are no doubt wondering if i havent wasted your time she said still now you are here you may as well notice that the water has rather curious properties if you will pull out one of these sticks for instance you will see what is happening to them  leland stooped and drew out a slender birch branch whose feathery twigs were changing into what looked very like silver lace the stem was also crusted with a white deposit and it cost him a little effort to snap it across then he looked up at his companion with a smile as he saw that the interior was still soft  do you know that you strike me as being very like this twig he said and she noticed for the first time his western accent and modulation the hardness is all outside  whatever made you say that  leland met her halfindignant gaze gravely well he said with a little deprecatory gesture i have seen you laugh  ah said carrie there was a time when i laughed rather more frequently than i do now i should however like to point out that the stick had not been in quite long enough  leland still looked at her with a quizzical expression i think i know what you mean he said still i should scarcely have fancied you would have felt it yet anyway thats not the question and perhaps it wouldnt do for me to make you stop here there will be other people wanting to talk to you  they turned back together this time taking the easier way as they passed along a tall hedge leland heard a rustling on its other side and darted impulsively through leaving his astonished companion without a word following through a gap she came upon him as he picked up a rabbit from the grass the little creatures eyes were protuding in an agony of strangulation and a thin brass wire hung from its redsmeared fur then leland either saw or heard her for he turned his back to the hedge and flung over his shoulder what seemed to her rather too like a command  go back he said this is not a thing for you to see  carrie denham went back though she was more accustomed to do what pleased her and make others do it than to do what she was told it was a minute or two before leland joined her grim in face an ominous sparkle in his eyes  it was only halfchoked so i put it back in a burrow he said it would have pleased me to hang the brute who set that wire  carrie denham watched him with interest i believe it is the usual way of catching them  then said leland grimly there must be something very wrong with the folks who allow that abominable cruelty to go on the little beast might have struggled there for hours in horrible pain before it choked itself in its agony  the girl fancied that abominable was not the adjective he had wanted to employ but she said nothing further on the subject though there remained with her the picture of him holding the little furry creature with womanly gentleness while he slackened the torturing wire it was made even more impressive when on suggesting hanging for the man who had laid the snare something in his face and voice left her with the conviction that he would on due occasion be capable of carrying out his suggestion he was she decided altogether different from the men she usually saw when he left her in the quadrangle she contrived to fall in with her brother  who is he she asked  charley leland said jimmy with his nearest approach to a grin  i know that already  i cant tell you very much more and no doubt youll find out what you want to know for yourself i spent a month shooting round his place in western canada and made him promise if ever he came over hed look in upon me here then i met him in london a few weeks ago  what does he do out there  farm on a lordly scale i forget how many thousand acres he has under wheat and how many steers he owns but hes rather a famous man in assiniboia his father was i believe an englishman but he died when leland was young and the farm and the stockrun have doubled in the hands of the son thats about all except that i rather like the man he has his strong points but needs handling i fancy any one who roused him would see the devil  carrie denham asked no more questions but went somewhat thoughtfully to her room on the whole she felt a mild interest in charley leland     chapter ii  leland is roused to pity   the evening was unusually soft and clear and a warm gentle breeze kept the dew from settling leland strolled out on the terrace above the moat at barrockholme he had spent a fortnight there now and was beginning to find the easygoing life of its inmates somewhat pleasant though at first it had caused him contemptuous astonishment nobody appeared to have any duties or if they had he surmised that they were seldom attended to people got up at all hours and some of them seldom retired before the morning whenever he walked over the estate with jimmy denham he noticed many things that pained his eyes there was land that lay rushy and sour for the need of draining the roads in the barrock hollow were so illkept and rutted that he wondered how any one could haul a full load along them and rotting gates and tottering drystone walls dotted the entire acreage at barrockholme waste and shortsighted parsimony that defeated its own object apparently went handinhand once he ventured to point out to jimmy what was in his mind  if you put four or five thousand pounds into the land you would be astonished at what it would give you back he said  jimmy denham laughed the question is where we would get the four thousand pounds we are as you have no doubt noticed confoundedly hardup and a tenant with capital enough to stand a decent rent would think twice before he took a farm from us  i guess i wouldnt blame him said leland drily but what you folks spend personally in a couple of years would set the place on its feet  it is very probable and jimmy laughed again still you see you cant always live as you should in this country of course i could cut the service and we might let the house to a shooting tenant that is the thing is physically practicable the trouble is that it wouldnt suit me and the governor would veto it right off if it did to be candid there is no particular capacity for hard work and selfdenial in any of the family  leland made no further suggestions on the last point he quite concurred with jimmy but his own life hitherto had been one of strenuous endeavour and spartan simplicity and it was pleasant to feel the strain relaxed for a month or two  on the night in question he was quite content with circumstances and his surroundings as he strolled out on the terrace an hour after dinner with his cigar there was a clear moon above him and in the air a faint astringent smell of falling leaves the splashing of the barrock came up musically athwart the birches in the hollow  as he was strolling up and down the terrace in the evening dress no longer strange to him he saw carrie denham come out from one of the long windows that opened into the old stone gallery a glance about him showed aylmer to whom he felt an intuitive aversion hovering big and fat in the vicinity he fancied that the girl saw aylmer too for she came down the staircase at the end of the gallery farthest from him and moved in lelands direction she wore a light evening gown a fleecy white wrap concealing her shoulders and part of her dark hair flowing straight to the delicate incurving of waist it emphasised by suggestion the outline of her shapely figure leland felt a little thrill as she came towards him he surmised that she merely desired to make use of him for the purpose of ridding herself of aylmers company or perhaps as an incentive to the latter but that did not matter leland was shrewd enough to be aware of his own disabilities and no matter what her motive she looked ethereally beautiful with the soft moonlight upon her  you need not throw the cigar away she said when she stopped and seated herself on an old stone bench close to where he stood in fact i should be rather sorry if you did  thank you said leland with a little smile it would be a pity jimmy gave me two or three of them and theyre unusually good  one would fancy that you were not in the habit of throwing anything away she half asked half said  again the twinkle flashed in lelands eyes until i came to england i dont think i ever wasted anything effort or material in my life that is when i knew what i was doing at least  ah said carrie you would soon get into the way of doing it at barrockholme still why arent you playing bridge or billiards was the long day on the moors too much for you i believe you walked home  so did jimmy it was only four miles i have quite often ridden sixty in my own country and when its light i usually begin to work there at four in the morning  you are a farmer  yes as its understood out there our wheat furrows at prospect would run straight across four of the biggest holdings on this property and ive over a thousand cattle on the new range among the willow bluffs a farm of that kind requires looking after with wheat at present figures  you give all your time to it  every minute until the snow comes and we usually begin hauling grain in to the railroad on the bobsledges then in summer its work from sunup until its dark and you go to sleep in ten minutes after you come in  carrie denhams little shudder might have expressed either horror or sympathy  isnt that in one way a waste of life you have no amusement at all she asked  an hour or two after the antelope or the brent geese in the sloos in fall and spring when the salt pork runs out as to the other question there are people who want the wheat we raise some of them want it badly in your own english towns a mans life was given him to use at what suits him best its taking quite a responsibility to fritter it away  carrie denham had naturally heard this sentiment expressed before though she had never seen it taken seriously among her own friends and family she glanced at her companion curiously rather resenting his flinging maxims of that kind at her it rankled more when she realised that there was nothing about the speaker to suggest the trifler or the prig as a new sensation he was undoubtedly interesting  and you never take a holiday she asked  this is the first one and i mightnt have taken it if several fourbushel bags of wheat hadnt fallen on me in the granary the doctor we brought out two hundred miles to see me wouldnt let me do anything active when i commenced to crawl round again  i think jimmy said you were quite young when you were left alone  i had been three months at mcgillwhich is to us much the same thing as your oxford is to youwhen the news of my fathers death came and i went back and fought my trustees over what was to be done with the farm they were two of the cleverest grain and cattle men in winnipeg and i was a raw lad but i beat them i was to stay at mcgill and be educated while they let or sold the place they said but i had my way of it and instead went back to the prairie where i belonged prospect has doubled the acreage it had then  carrie denham listened with slightly languid interest the narrative had been a bit egotistical but she could imagine the struggle the lonely lad had waged with the wilderness she understood already that it was an especially desolate wilderness in which the prospect farm stood and jimmy had told her that leland had neither brother nor sister he had made his own way and had no doubt from his point of view done a good deal with his life but his outlook was it seemed to her necessarily restricted one should not however expect too much from a man born in the wilderness who had had only three months of what could be considered education she also wondered why he had told her so much since most of the young men she came across took some trouble to keep their best side uppermost until it occurred to her that he probably considered the doubling of the acreage of the prospect farm a very notable achievement it scarcely seemed to her to warrant the effort she loved pleasure though she was by no means without a sense of duty the little graces and amenities of life counted for much with her  aylmer and two of the other guests came along the terrace and leland looked at her with a little inquiring smile  shall i go on talking i can keep it up if you wish he said  no said the girl you have really done enough in the meanwhile  she rose and joined the others and leland was left wondering exactly what she meant though it was borne in upon him that she did not object to aylmer so much when he had a companion then he also rose and strolled along to where a little faded lady of uncertain age who had shown him some trifling kindness was sitting alone she swept her dress aside to let him pass looking at him with a smile but he seated himself on the broadtopped wall in front of her  why are you not playing cards or making love to somebody dont you know what you are here for she said  leland laughed im afraid im not good at either mrs annersly you see im from the wilderness  well said the lady there are i fancy one or two young women who would be willing to teach you the rules of one game  are you sure they would think it worth while to waste powder and shot on a prairie farmer  they might if it was understood that he was willing to sell his broad acres and settle down to the simple pleasures of an english country life  no by the lord said leland you will excuse me madam but i really meant it  mrs annersly laughed i believe you did still you must remember that there are not many english estates managed like barrockholme in fact one may observe traces of at least a moderate prosperity in parts of this country but we neednt talk of that you will notice that a few of the others besides ourselves have sense enough to prefer being outside on such a pleasant night  leland looked down across the lawn conscious that she was watching him meanwhile and saw carrie denham and aylmer cross it together the moonlight was upon them and the silvery radiance that made the girls beauty more apparent seemed to emphasise the grossness of her companion in that space of grass and flowers moated and hemmed in by mouldering walls that had flung back the keen winds of the border for five hundred years aylmer looked more out of place than he had done by daylight leland who had read no little english history could almost have fancied it was filled with memories of the old knightly days when the spears of ettrick and liddesdale came pricking across the brown moors and mosses on many such a night while aylmer was from the cities heavyfleshed soft of muscle and sensual of a wholly modern type  yes he said drily i see two of them  mrs annersly laughed again so does branscombe denham i surmise but that in all probability does not concern you or me she stopped and flashed a swift glance at her companion seeing that he made no denial she changed the subject you have been taking billiard lessons from jimmy denham dont you find it expensive  madam said leland jimmy denham is rather a friend of mine  of course he is also my relativewhich is however no great advantage to him besides i am a privileged person an encumbrance the denhams are scarcely likely to get rid of in the present state of their affairs which is perhaps a little unfortunate for everybody my tongue is supposed to be dipped in wormwood nobody expects anything pleasant from me and the weak points in the denhams constitute my special hobby as you have probably noticed they have a good many  leland looked at her gravely you couldnt expect me to admit it and if i did you wouldnt be pleased with me in different ways they have all of them been kind to me  have you asked yourself why  i certainly havent said leland a trifle sharply  well said the lady with an air of reflection there is usually a reason for most things though it is perhaps a little clearer in aylmers case they have been somewhat attentive to him too branscombe denham is one of the most improvident of men and in that respect jimmy is very like him but while the strength of the whole family is in the girls there is one thing to their credit they all stand by one another through thick and thin i fancy there is very little carrie would stop at if it was necessary to save the old man or perhaps jimmy from disaster  she turned her head a bit as it happened carrie denham and aylmer crossed the lawn again just then and leland following the direction of mrs annerslys glance felt that she wished to call his attention to them  yes she said unless something unexpected turns up i should not be astonished if they married her to that man  leland looked at her a slight flush in his grim face it would be almost indecent for several reasons to say nothing of his age but miss denham has surely a will of her own  though he seldom manifested the tenderness and pity in his nature until an opportunity for helpful action came his way his face grew softer as he watched the pair his life had of necessity been hard and lonely perhaps in some degree at least from ignorance of them he had grown up with an impersonal chivalrous respect for all women love as between man and woman was a thing still remote from him on the desolate prairie a woman was scarcely ever even seen it was a mans country as his eyes followed the strolling couple he was conscious of a longing to offer the girl the protection of his strength against aylmer  then the lady who had been watching him closely spoke again she decidedly has a will and what is more a tolerably large share of the family pride she said still she will probably marry her companion branscombe denham is usually at his wits end for money and jimmy i am very much afraid has been getting into difficulties again carrie is in one sense an excellent daughter she knows her duty and is scarcely likely to flinch from doing it  but is there nobody else no young man of good character and family available  what do you know against the character of the man yonder  nothing said leland tersely nothing at all except that he carries it about with him you can see it in his face if i had a sister i should feel tempted to kick a man of that kind for looking at her  mrs annersly smiled as she answered his previous question young men of the kind you mention with any means are not to be met with every day whats more they also naturally prefer a girl with money and at least there would in their case be a tying up of property in the settlements the happy man does not as a rule consider it necessary to contribute anything to the brides family  leland turned sharply and looked at her with a portentous sparkle in his eyes isnt it a horribly unpleasant thing you are suggesting  that is after all largely a matter of opinion  leland sat still a moment watching the two figures on the lawn with a curious blending of compassion and disgust then he rose and looked down on his companion  madam he said i wonder if i might ask you why you thought fit to tell me this  one should never ask for a womans reasons and i think i have informed you already that my tongue is dipped in wormwood  leland made a little impatient gesture is it aylmers money alone that counts with them or his station if he has any  one would certainly imagine that it was his means  leland left her presently as she watched him stride along the terrace her shrewd faded face grew gentle  if i have read that man aright there may be results she said in that case i almost fancy carrie will have much to thank me for  then she rose and crossing the quadrangle sought the cardroom it was an hour later when she came upon carrie denham sitting alone  i have been talking to mr leland and am rather pleased with him she said to the girl he is a curious compound of simplicity and forcefulness they must live like anchorites out there  carrie denham laughed i thought that type was distinctly out of date now it probably has its disadvantages  still said mrs annersly with an air of reflection he would scarcely jar as much on ones selfrespect as the people one would meet as the wife of the other sort of man     chapter iii  pressure of circumstances   the early breakfast over leland was walking up and down beneath the red beeches that grew close up to the old arched gateway of barrockholme one of his fellow guests beside him and a gun under his arm looking in through the quadrangle they saw a young groom holding with some difficulty a restive champing horse that pawed the gravel and shook his head impatiently  he doesnt like waiting either said lelands companion to the groom how long have you been holding him here  about half an hour mr terry said the groom  terry glanced at leland with a little uplifting of his brows and again addressed the groom  you cant pack all of us into that dogcart and its four miles anyway to the edge of garberry moor he said do you know how we are expected to get there  mr parsons of the dell farm keeps a smart cart and he promised to lend it mr james when he heard we had the tire loose on our other one it should have been here  then why isnt it  leland fancied that a suspicion of a smile flickered in the mans eyes  i dont know sir unless mr james forgot to let him know when we wanted it  i should consider it very probable said terry drily have you any objections to walking on as far as the dell leland it wouldnt astonish me greatly if jimmy kept us waiting an hour yet  leland having no objections they strode away together beechmast crackled underfoot between the colonnades of lichened trunks whose great branches stayed the high vaulted roof of gold and crimson leaves looking out through the openings between one could see the sweep of rolling champaign stretch away into the horizon through gradations of blueness and the rigid line of the fells smeared with warm brown patches of withered bracken  its rather a shame that jimmy and his father should have a place of this kind in their hands at all said terry still for the credit of the country i should like to explain that there are not very many english properties run on the same lines in fact the denhams are an exception to everything but i really think jimmy might have got up in time for once in a way  leland laughed the loss of an hours shooting seems to count with you  it does you see like a good many other people i have to work rather hard for my living and time is of a little more value to me than it apparently is to jimmy denham besides my stay here has cost me a good deal more than i expected and being engaged in commerce i cant help feeling that i ought to get something in return for my money  i dont quite understand that last remark  no said terry well perhaps you dont in fact i have had a fancy that you were a bonafide guest you see two or three of us arent  will you make that a little clearer and leland looked astonished though he remembered now several little incidents that had struck him as strange  with pleasure indeed i feel i owe it to jimmy for his losing us an hour or two every day our amusement costs two or three of us a good deal directly as well as the other way branscombe denham naturally doesnt advertise barrockholme as a shooting hotel but though affairs are arranged more tastefully it amounts to much the same thing you share expenses of watching and turning down handreared birds and you get so many days shooting with entertainment thrown in the latter however is usually costly one way or the other jimmy has taken one hundred pounds out of me  ah said leland is that sort of thing common in this country i had a notion that you were rather proud of yourselves it wouldnt strike us as quite nice in western canada  no said the other man still its done occasionally and as to family pride you are not likely to come across anybody who has more of it than the denhams how they reconcile it with some of the things they do is a different matter but you can take it as a rule that the less people have to congratulate themselves upon the prouder they are in fact jimmy denham who though one cant help liking him is a downright bad egg was at first a little shy of me i am a partner in a concern making a certain advertised specialty you see  i wonder said leland reflectively if the girls quite understand the position  i dont think they do anyway not exactly indeed its a little difficult to believe theyre daughters of branscombe denham or sisters of jimmy they show some trace of sense and temper whilst you cant ruffle jimmy still i fancy if it were necessary they would stand by their delightful relatives through thick and thin  leland lapsed into thoughtful silence he fancied that his companion was right for he had seen a good deal of carrie denham during the month he had now spent at barrockholme she had been in her own reserved fashion gracious to him and leland did not in the least resent the fact that there was in all she said a suggestion of condescension that he surmised was unconscious indeed this struck him as being what it should be though quite aware of his own value where men were concerned he had seen very few women and regarded them in general with a vague uncomprehending respect furthermore the girls physical beauty her pride and almost stately coldness made a strong appeal to him she was he was quite willing to admit a being of a very different order from a plain western farmer besides that she was the one person who had quite come up to his expectations for his visit to the old country had in most respects brought him disillusionment  his father had often spoken of it with all the exiles appreciation of the home he had left and he could remember his mothers daintiness and refinement it was perhaps not astonishing that he had learned to idealise the old land and those who lived in it it was also unfortunate that whilst it might have happened differently the few english men and women he had met on any terms of intimacy during his stay in london had resembled the denhams more or less and it had hurt him to discover what he considered was the reality for jimmy and his father he had a tolerant contempt and it was in fact only the presence of carrie denham that had kept him at barrockholme so long he was sorry for her and had a vague fancy that she might need a friend there was a vein of chivalry in him and he was also a just man his sense of justice led him to play billiards periodically for somewhat heavy stakes with jimmy it was one way of getting even as he expressed it for he did not care to be indebted to a man he looked down upon jimmy who was skilful and almost suspiciously fortunate at both billiards and cards had also no objections to emptying the pockets of his guests though as leland was aware the chance stranger very seldom leaves a ranch of western canada any poorer than when he came there  in the meanwhile it happened that branscombe denham sat talking to his son in what he called his library the few books in it for the most part related to the estate for denham had reasons for not trusting his affairs altogether to a steward or country lawyer he was in some respects a handsome man though his eyes were of too pale a blue and his thin face in spite of its unmistakable stamp of refinement lacked character the room was in the old tower ceiled with dark wood and sombrely panelled with one long narrow leadedglass window the tall sparelyframed man with his white hands and immaculate dress seemed out of place there he was essentially modern the room belonged to the more virile past there was a pile of letters before him and he took one up delicately  if i could have foreseen that it would lead to this kind of thing i should never have consented to your grandfathers breaking the entail he said with a little whimsical smile lancely has written me in his usual standanddeliver style againi am now directed to inform you that unless the last instalment with arrears of interest is remitted me by next quarterday my clients will regretfully feel themselves compelled to foreclose  he laid down the letter with a little lifting of his brows i really think they mean it at last and their mortgage covers most of the dell and the leys on stapletons holding i suppose it is no use asking if you could dispense with your next allowance  jimmy denham laughed though he was quite aware that the occasion was serious enough im afraid not sir in fact as i had regretfully to admit unless i can raise two hundred pounds in addition to it before my leave runs out i shall probably have to send in my papers fortunately i think i can manage it  he spoke quite frankly and there was nothing in the attitude of either to suggest that one was a father embarrassed by financial difficulties and the other a spendthrift son indeed they faced each other as comrades one could almost have said confederates for in spite of their shortcomings which were somewhat plentiful the denhams at least recognised the family bond standing by one another in everything  in that case said branscombe denham the allowance must stand though i dont know at present where it is to come from the other affair is more difficult in fact unless we face it resolutely it might become serious  so one would imagine said jimmy reflectively the dell is the best farm we have and to let those fellows have it would make things a little too plain to everybody besides its splitting up the property to a certain extent of course we are living upon our credit  branscombe denham nodded though there was a curious look in his pale blue eyes as he fixed them on his son  im rather afraid you dont quite grasp the point he said you see lancelys man holds a mortgage on most of the dell but as you perhaps remember lennox lent me a couple of thousand with the ploughland in the bottom as security he did it as a friend and didnt worry much about his papers while im not sure i remembered to mention lancelys bond to him so there is what one might call a certain overlapping of the mortgages then i found it necessary to realise a little on the oaks and beeches at arkil bank  jimmys face grew grave i rather fancy they brought you in a good deal they were unusually good trees you sold the timber after you raised the money on the mortgages  i did that is just the point of it i neednt say that i had then a scheme of retrenchment in my mind which would provide a kind of sinking fund to meet the interest and in due time extinguish the loan in which case the question of the timber would naturally never have been raised unfortunately the fall in rents and one or two other mattersrendered it unworkable  jimmy made a gesture of comprehending sympathy im afraid it would look rather bad sir if it came out lancelys man might make a good deal of trouble if he wants his timber and finds it isnt there to say nothing of what lennox who it seems has a claim on it as well might do still no doubt you did what you could sir and im rather afraid it was one or two of my little extravagances that put some of the pressure on you i neednt say that if there is anything i can do down to cutting the serviceor bearing part of the responsibility  thanks said denham as if he meant it you were not very extravagant jimmy as young men go and we have hitherto at least always stood by each other still im not sure that its my son i can count on now  ah and jimmys voice was a trifle sharper im afraid i never liked that notion sir i think ive mentioned it theres a good deal of the beast in aylmer has he said anything  a curious look crept into denhams face and it suggested repugnance as well as anxiety he came to me yesterday and his ideas of a settlement were liberal i pointed out a few of my difficulties to him and he mentioned rather tastefully that he fancied they could be got over if he had my good will in the other matter in fact he left me with the impression that the mortgage bonds would be handed carrie after the wedding  jimmy denhams face appeared a trifle flushed though he was considered a rather hard case by a certain officers mess  i dont like it sir he said again i cant claim to be very particular but that man is rather too much for me  then have you any proposition to make  jimmy sat still for at least a minute apparently lost in thought which was in his case a very unusual thing  the whole affair is a little unpleasant and i think you wont mind my saying that much still its evident that we have to face the circumstances and i scarcely think carrie will flinch when she understands the necessity there might however be a more suitable man than aylmer in fact i almost think i know of one  the canadian  exactly anyway the man is wholesome which is more than anybody could say of aylmer and i rather fancy he will be a person of considerable importance byandbye in his own country if as i suppose you havent given aylmer a definite answer yet i might suggest that you tell him he must make his own running and leave the rest to me though shes not fond of any of us but carrie ive no doubt that eveline annersly would stand by me  there was silence again for almost a minute and then denham sighed  well he said with a little gesture you will remember that there is not very much time left in the meanwhile arent you keeping the rest of them waiting  jimmy went out and none of the three men he drove to the garberry moor could have suspected that he had a single care they would certainly not have believed had he told them that he was for once sincerely disgusted with himself as well as his father and troubled with a very unusual sense of shame there was courage of a kind in the denhams and they could at least hide their feelings very well he inspired the rest with goodhumour and shot rather better than he generally did but he had grown grave again when he had an interview with mrs annersly shortly before dinner that evening she listened to him with a little frown  jimmy she said you are almost as deficient in estimable qualities as your father is  well said jimmy humbly i know i am but you might leave the governor out i think he is a little older than you areand he is my father anyway though you mightnt believe it i feel a trifle sick when i think of aylmer  what do you expect from me  jimmy smiled not a great deal only a persistence in your original policy i have rather a fancy that you and i have had the same thing in our minds  mrs annersly looked thoughtful if it must be one or the other ill do what i can in fact i dont mind admitting that seeing what it would probably come to i have as you surmise had the affair in hand already still it was not to make things easier for either you or your father     chapter iv  leland makes the plunge   there was for the first time a chill of frost in the air so none of the guests at barrockholme thought of lounging on the terrace after dinner some were in denhams gunroom some were playing cards and only a few were left in the big drawingroom where carrie sat at the piano leland stood beside her to turn the music over a duty which was new to him and indifferently fulfilled he had no very clear notion then or afterwards what she was singing still her voice which was indubitably good awakened a little thrill in him her proximity had also an exhilarating effect and he was lost in a whir of sensations he could not analyse as he looked down on the cold face with its crown of dusky hair and saw the gleam of ivory shoulders this was a man who had usually so much to do that it left him little time to dissect and classify his emotions  he did not think he was in love with carrie denham so far as his ideas on that subject went but until he had come to england the society of a woman of her description was an unknown thing to him her physical beauty appealed to him her cold reposeful sincerity and pride of station had made an even stronger impression and now he was sensible of a vague admiration and compassion for her he felt too a feeling of awkwardness in her presence realising at the same time that there was nothing to warrant it  he did not look awkward in the least his bronze face was quiet his grave brown eyes were steady and though he was quite unconscious of it the pose he had fallen into effectively displayed the spare symmetry of his muscular figure there was also upon him the stamp of the silent strength and vigour that comes of a clean life spent in wide spaces out in the wind and sun he did not know that several pairs of eyes were watching him with approval and that the owner of one of them smiled in a fashion which suggested satisfaction as she glanced towards aylmer the fleshy gentleman sat not very far away and leland fancied that his own presence at the piano was justified when he looked in that direction there was that in his nature which prompted him to offer protection to any one who needed it and he felt it was not fitting that such a man as aylmer should stand at carrie denhams side he had been sensible of this before but the feeling was unusually strong that night at last the music stopped and she looked up at him with her curious little smile  thank you she said and the man felt his blood stir for he fancied she understood what had brought him there still shrewd in his own way as he was he was strangely deceived in supposing that nobody except the girl and himself had grasped his purpose or that he would have been able to carry it out at all without the concurrence of one at least of those who watched him leland had grappled with adverse seasons and held his own against hard and clever men but he had not as yet had cultured englishwomen for his enemies or partisans  he turned away when carrie denham rose and moving about the room found himself presently near mrs annersly who was sitting alone just then on a divan with a big partlyfolded screen on one hand of her it cut that nook off from the observation of most of the rest as she was probably aware when she settled herself there but when she indicated the vacant place at her side it never occurred to leland that she had been lying in wait for him  you did that very cleverly i mean when you opened the piano first she said i never suspected you of being a diplomatist one could almost fancy that carrie was grateful too  leland was in no way flattered since all he had done was to reach the piano in advance of aylmer who was a trifle heavy on his feet in fact he was slightly disconcerted though he did not show it  well he said frankly it was either aylmer or i  his companion looked at him in a rather strange fashion exactly she said it was either you or aylmer and perhaps it was natural that carrie should prefer you  leland glanced across the big room towards where aylmer was sitting and was once more sensible of dislike and repulsion the man did not look well in evening dress it made his flabby heaviness of flesh too apparent and the sharply contrasted black and white emphasised the florid colouring of his broad sensual face he was just then regarding carrie denham out of narrow slits of eyes priggish eyes leland called them to himself and there was the easily recognisable stamp of grossness and indulgence upon him the westerner himself was hard and somewhat spare a man whose body had been toughened by strenuous labour and held in due subjection by an unbending will mrs annersly noticed the clearness of his steady eyes and the clean transparency of his bronzed skin as a man he was she decided certainly to be preferred to aylmer and perhaps the more so because there was a side of his nature which as yet it was evident had scarcely been awakened she was glad that the drawingroom was large and the place where they sat secluded because there was a notion with which she desired to inspire him she had already gone a certain distance in that direction and now it was time to go a little further she could see that her last speech had had some effect  madam he said with his usual directness i wonder what you mean by that  it ought to be evident said the lady with a little smile if everybodys suppositions are correct i really think carrie will have enough of aylmer byandbye there is no reason why she should commence the surfeit now  then if she feels as you suggest she does why in the name of wonder should she marry him  there are family reasons jimmy and his family are i fear in difficulties again and it will be the privilege of carries husband to extricate them i believe i told you as much before though you do not seem to have remembered it  a slightly darker tinge of colour crept into lelands cheek as a matter of fact madam the thing has been worrying me ever since you did a marriage of that kind is rather more than any one with a sense of the fitness of things could quietly contemplate  stilland mrs annersly looked at him steadilythe difficulty is that i am afraid there is nothing you or i could do to prevent it  leland was a trifle startled he could almost fancy that she expected a disclaimer from him and meant to suggest that if he wished it he might find a way where she had failed he did not know how she had conveyed this impression and as he could not be sure that she had desired to do so he sat in silence until she abruptly changed the subject with a man of this description there was no necessity for being unduly artistic the one thing was to get the notion into his mind  when are you going back she said  i dont quite know in a month or so of course i ought to be there now but it is the first time i have been away since i came home from montreal and it will probably be a long while before i take a rest again as it is my being away this harvest will probably cost me a good deal  it must be lonely on the prairie especially in the winter  leland smiled it is once we haul the grain in there is very little one can do with a foot of snow upon the ground and the thermometer at forty below theres just prospect and its birch bluff in the midst of the big white circle with the sledgetrails running out from it straight to the horizon not a house not a beast or any sign of life about  he stopped and made a little gesture of course there are big hotels where one could meet pleasant people as well as operas and theatres at winnipeg and one could get there in two days on the cars i dare say i could manage a trip to montreal or new york occasionally too and we have a few welleducated people from the east on the prairie not more than twenty miles away but since i have nobody to go with going away from home doesnt appeal to me so i spend the long night sitting beside the stove with the cedar shingles crackling over me in the cold now and then i read and when i dont there is plenty to think about in planning out the next years campaign  has it never occurred to you that it would be a good deal more pleasant if you were married  as a matter of fact it has but i put the notion away from me for one thing i remember my mother and if ever i married it would have to be somebody grave and sweet and dainty like her she was a well broughtup englishwoman and perhaps she lived long enough to spoil me she showed me what a wife could be and its scarcely likely there are many women of her kind who would ever care for a prairie farmer who knows very little about anything but wheat and cattle  you seem almost unreasonably sure of that said mrs annersly  leland laughed madam he said would you go out there to the prairie and trust yourself alone to such a man as i am  the little faded ladys eyes twinkled and in the tones of her reply there was something which suggested confidence in her companion  i scarcely suppose you mean me to consider that seriously she said still if i were twenty years younger i almost think i would and what is more i scarcely fancy i should be sorry that is at least if you were willing to take me to winnipeg or montreal now and then and bring out any friends i might make there to stay with me we however neednt concern ourselves with that question since you certainly dont want me the point is that one could fancy there are english girls of the kind you mention who would be willing to venture as far as i would still you would have to bestir yourself and make it evident that you wanted one in particular to go out with you you could hardly expect anybody to suggest it to you  leland was thoughtful for eveline annersly had done her work successfully she had first inspired him with a strong mans pity for carrie denham and awakened in him an undefined chivalrous desire to protect her whilst now she had gone a little further and suggested that there was perhaps a way in which he could do so he sat quite still for a moment or two the great bare room at prospect with its uncovered walls and floor and the big stove in the midst of it rose up before his fancy then he saw it changed and cosy filled to suit a womans artistic taste with the things he cared little for but which his wealth could buy for the gracious presence sitting there beside him then there would be something to look forward to as he floundered home from the railroad down the beaten sledgetrail beside his jaded team or swept up in his sleigh out of the white waste stiff with frost it was an alluring picture in its way but after all material comforts had not appealed to him greatly and while he sat silent by eveline annerslys side the visions carried him further  there were he knew doors that would be opened to him willingly in winnipeg he could conceive himself becoming a man of mark in the prairie city and lonely prospect filled in the shooting season with guests whose names were famous in the west hitherto he had been a mere grower of wheat but he had a quiet faith in his capabilities and fancied there was no reason why with a clever wife to help him he should not become famous too an influence in the new land whose future he and others were laboriously building up so far it was only his reason the fancies appealed to but as he glanced across the room towards where carrie denham sat he was conscious of a stirring of his blood she was very alluring with her reposeful stateliness dark eyes that shone with light when she smiled and dark hair that emphasised the clear ivory tinting of the patrician face beneath it the pity he felt for her was becoming lost in a quickening admiration  still he said what you suggest is a trifle difficult to believe if wheat keeps its value my life which is now in some ways a hard and lonely one might be changedit is my personality that presents the difficulty there is so much you set value on that i know nothing about and one could scarcely expect an english girl with any refinement to be attracted by a plain western farmer  mrs annersly smiled at him well she said i believe i told you i had no great fault to find with you and i dont believe the rising generation is more fastidious than my own in fact it wouldnt be difficult to persuade oneself of the contrary to be frank i really dont think you need be lonely any longer unless of course you prefer it  again leland did not answer her he sat looking straight in front of him with a faint glow in his eyes and his lips firmly set while an unreasoning impulse seized him and swept him away as he saw aylmer approach carrie denhams chair perhaps eveline annersly guessed part at least of what was in his mind for she raised her eyes a moment and glanced at jimmy denham who was talking to a young girl some distance away jimmy was a young man of considerable intelligence and though he made no sign he knew that he was wanted a minute or two later he made his way indirectly and leisurely across the room and drawing out a chair sat down near leland  you two look as if you had been discussing something important he said has he been persuading you to go out and preside over prospect aunt eveline  mrs annersly smiled no she said he naturally wants a younger and more attractive person but i understand is rather afraid that nobody of the kind would look at him i have been trying to show him that he is mistaken  of course said jimmy he doesnt quite grasp things yet there are few sensible girls who would say no to a man with his income in fact id feel reasonably sure of getting an heiress if i had a third of it  he stopped with a short laugh looking straight at leland with something that suggested a definite meaning in his pale blue eyes anyway theres no reason why you shouldnt get any one you have seen at barrockholme provided of course that the lady in question is in other respects pleased with you  leland closed his lips a little tighter for it was borne in upon him that jimmy denham had not spoken without a purpose and he realised that he might be listened to if he craved permission to offer himself as a suitor for his sisters hand jimmy however was too adroit to dwell upon the subject and changing it abruptly led leland into a discussion of hammerless guns still both he and eveline annersly realised that he had said enough which in most cases is a good deal better than too much as a matter of fact his words had stirred leland to the rashest plunge he had ever made in his life though during most of it he had usually taken the boldest course holding his wheat on a falling market and sowing in times of black depression when the prudent held their hand  on the next morning he had an interview with branscombe denham in the library which left him with a very unpleasant impression in fact the silence he forced himself to maintain hurt him and he felt it would have been a vast relief to tell the fastidious immaculately dressed gentleman precisely what he thought of him having on certain delicately implied conditions secured his goodwill leland set about the prosecution of his suit with a directness and singleness of purpose that was a matter of delight to those who watched his proceedings he however was quite oblivious of their amusement he knew what he wanted and it did not matter in the least that others should guess it too but apart from his obvious directness he played the suitor with a grave oldfashioned gallantry and deference that became him in fact since it was by no means what they expected from him they wondered how he came to have it though leland himself could not have told them its source it had been his practice in the long nights when prospect lay silent under the arctic frost to read and ponder over the best of the early victorian novelists his mother had been a woman of taste and he had perhaps unconsciously acquired from the books she had left him some of the mannerisms of a more punctilious time  it was in any case promptly evident to everybody that aylmer was outclassed lelands wooing was no doubt a trifle ceremonious but aylmers savoured too much of the freedom of the barroom and musichalls there was more than one maiden at barrockholme who felt that it was a pity she had not accorded a little judicious encouragement to the quiet bronzefaced canadian who it now transpired had large possessions after all his stilted courtesy was attractive in its way and had in it the interest of an entirely new sensation  nobody however knew exactly what carrie denham thought of it although it was evident that she preferred him to aylmer when at last he spoke his mind to her she listened gravely with a slightly flushed face and a thoughtful look in her eyes  if you are wise she said quietly you will not press me for an answer now you can wait at least until this time tomorrow then i shall be outside on the steps of the terrace  it was not very encouraging but leland made her a little inclination  if that is your wish i must try to be patient he said     chapter v  no escape   it was towards the middle of the next afternoon when carrie denham leaned upon the rails of the little path outside the grey walls of the garden at barrockholme from where she stood she could see the narrower and unprotected way along which she had ventured with leland a few weeks earlier and she could not help remembering his quiet glance of interrogation when he had come upon it suddenly she and jimmy had often crossed that somewhat perilous ledge in their younger days the more often in fact because it had been forbidden to them though it was of course new to leland he had displayed no hesitation when once she had made her wishes plain this had pleased her at the time since it suggested that he understood her resolution was equal to his own but now she brushed the recollection aside for just then she felt she almost hated him  close by a narrow flight of steps hewn out of the dripping rock led down into the ravine and she watched with a curious sense of strained expectancy the path which wound among the silvery birches from the foot of them to the mossy steppingstones round which the barrock flashed she knew this was unwise and that she could not escape from what lay before her but hope dies hard when one is young and there was still lurking at the back of her mind a faint belief that after all something might happen to stave off the impending disaster if so it would be only fitting that it should result from the efforts of the man in whom she had once had faith and confidence though neither now was so strong as it had been  a drowsy quietness brooded over barrockholme the men were away shooting and the women had driven to inspect some relics of the roman occupation among the fells she herself had made excuses for remaining behind  there was not a movement among the birch leaves still hanging here and there flecks of pale gold among the lacelike twigs beneath her and the murmur of the gently swirling water emphasised the silence of the hollow she could hear a squirrel shaking the beechmast down and the patter of the falling nuts rose sharply distinct from the thin carpet of yellow leaves then she felt her heart beat as the sound of footsteps reached her ears the man she had once believed in was coming and if there was any way out of the difficulties that threatened her it was his part to find it  he came up the rude steps hastily a wellfavoured young man of her own world and almost her own age which she felt was in some ways unfortunate then as he seized both her hands with a little resolute movement she drew them away from him  no she said a trifle sharply as i told you last time that is all done with now it was a little weak of me to see you and you must not come here again  the colour faded in the young mans face and he clenched his hands spasmodically  oh he said with a catch in his breath you cant mean it carrie in spite of what you told me i had been trying to believe the thing was out of the question  there was pain in carrie denhams face and a little bitter smile flickered into her eyes  the thing one shrinks from most is generally the one that happensunless one does something to make it impossible she said  the man reddened for though he was pleasant to look at a stalwart openfaced englishman he was very young and it was perhaps not his fault that there was a lack of stiffness in his composition he was not one to grapple resolutely with an emergency and carrie denham who had once looked up to him realised it then  what could i dowhat could anybody in my place do he said with a little gesture that suggested desperation stanley crossthwaite is only sixty and may live another twenty years while he does im something between his head keeper and a pensioner  isnt it a pity you didnt think of that earlier  the man made as though he would have seized her hands again but she drew back from him with a slight shiver of hopelessness running through her  you cant blame me he said who could help falling in love with you there was a time when i think you loved me too  carrie watched him with a quietness at which she herself marvelled she had at least fancied she felt for him what he had protested he felt for her but now there was a stirring of contempt in her her reason recognised that he was right and there was nothing he could do but for all that he had been her last faint hope and he had failed her  there is nothing to be gained by talking of that now she said quietly  the man who did not answer her leaned upon the rails gazing down into the ravine with his face awry until at last he looked up again  its not that awful brute aylmer he said hoarsely  no i could not have brought myself to that  the farmer fellow its horrible anyway but i suppose one couldnt blame youthey your father and jimmy made you  he straightened himself suddenly and moved along the path a pace or two its an abominable thing that you should be driven to such a sacrifice but you shall not make it cant you understand its out of the question you cant make it is there nothing you can do  the girls face was colourless and her lips were trembling but her eyes were hard for her contempt was growing stronger now the man had asked her the question to which it seemed fitting that he alone should find an answer she did not know what she had expected from him and since she had decided that the sacrifice must be made she recognised that there was in fact nothing she could expect but her strength had almost failed her had he suggested a desperate remedy and insisted on it masterfully she might have fled with him only it would have been necessary for him to compel her with an overwhelming forcefulness that was stronger than her will and that was apparently too much to ask of him  no she said with a quietness that was born of despair there is nothing fate is too strong for us reggie and you must go back now it would have been better had i never promised that i would see you i should not have done it but i wanted you to understand that i couldnt help myself  she held out a hand to him and the man flushed as he seized it then he drew her towards him but the girl shook him off with a strength that seemed equal to his own and though he scarcely saw her move in another moment she stood a yard or two away from him there was a spot of crimson in her cheek and she was gasping a little  go now she said and her voice had a faintly grating ring since you cannot help me you shall at least not make it harder than i can bear  he stood looking at her slightly bewildered irresolute and halfashamed though he did not quite realise for the moment why he should feel so then with a despairing gesture he went down the steps without a word whilst carrie denham still leaned dejectedly on the terrace railing eveline annersly coming through the archway caught a glimpse of a shadowy figure moving off through the trees  were you wise she asked the girl one has to be circumspect you know  carrie laughed bitterly  i do not think there was any great risk it is a very long while since young lochinvar swam the esk at netherby in fact unless men have changed with the times it is difficult to believe that he ever did  mrs annersly glanced at her shrewdly for she fancied she understood  im not sure they have she said there was a gentleman in the ballad who said nothing at all and presumably did nothing too but i dont know that im so very sorry for you reggie urmston is a nice boy but i imagine that is about all that could be said of him  she stopped a moment and looked at the girl with a little twinkle in her eyes i almost think my dear that if you had shown the canadian half the favour you have wasted on reggie he would even in these degenerate days have carried you off in spite of all the denhams could do to prevent him  then for the first time carrie denham flushed crimson as she heard the thought she had not permitted herself to put into words the impression sank in and she afterwards recalled it she however said nothing in comment and the two went back silently through the archway to the lawn  the rest of the afternoon seemed very long to carrie but it dragged itself away and at last she slipped out of the house as the still night was closing down a full moon had just lifted itself above the ridge of moor as she flitted along the terrace the pale silvery light was creeping across the old grey house it rose above her a pile of rudely hewn and weathered stone not beautiful for time itself could not make it that with its creeping mosses houseleek and lichens but stamped with a certain rugged stateliness and the girl who had much else to think of felt its influence  the pride of family was strong in her and she remembered what kind of men those were who had built themselves that home in the days of feud and foray they at least had not shrunk from the harder things of life and she who sprang from them could emulate their courage it seemed that barrockholme demanded a sacrifice and she must make it then a little flush crept to her face as she remembered the part her father and jimmy played it was a degenerate and paltry one to which she felt the very stranger to whom they were willing to sell her would never have stooped he was not of her world a man so far as she knew of low degree one who had held the plough but there were at least signs of strength and pride in him  she stopped for just a moment with a little catching of her breath as she saw him a dim figure in the shadow of the firs beyond the wall that lay in sharp black outline upon the dewy lawn then she went on again nerving herself for what must be borne when he had reached the foot of the terrace steps he stood waiting her there with his hat in his hand it was not exactly what jimmy denham or even reggie urmston would have done in a similar case but this quaint westerner had seen fit to make use of the formal courtesy of sixty years ago and what was most curious farmer as he was it did not appear ridiculous in him  it was he said very good of you to come though i was most afraid to hope that you would keep your promise  wouldnt such a thing imply an obligation  yesand leland made a little gesturei think it would with you still you see the fact that you made that promise was in one way an astonishing thing to me  he stopped and stood for a moment or two regarding her gravely and the girl noticed that he was one who could be silent without awkwardness it also seemed to her that he had made the opening moves rather gracefully  well he said at length i had the honour of making you an offer last night  the girl found something reassuring in his lack of embarrassment and his dispassionate tone she felt that the man was not in love with her and that promised to make things a good deal easier she was also relieved to find that she was mistress of herself  it was perhaps rather an unusual thing for me to ask you to meet me here but i fancied we should be quite alone she said there is something to be said  yes said leland gravely that is quite natural i am all attention  then will you tell me candidly why you wish to marry me  the moonlight showed the faint twinkle in lelands eyes as he made her one of his queer little bows  i wonder he said do you ever look into your mirror  pshaw said the girl that is after all a very indifferent reason i want the real one  leland stood very straight now looking at her steadily but it was evident that he was somewhat perplexed accustomed as he was to being frank with himself he did not quite know why he wanted to marry her then a few weeks earlier he had been swayed by no more than an unreasoning desire to save her from aylmer but he was by no means sure that was all now she stood full in the moonlight with the fleecy wrap about her shoulders intensifying the duskiness of her eyes and hair and the long light dress suggesting the sweeping lines of a beautifullymoulded figure and her freshness and beauty stirred his depths the faint trace of imperiousness in her pose and the unfaltering gaze of her dark eyes which were as steady as his own had an effect that was stronger still for her courage and composure appealed most to him in the meanwhile she was however apparently awaiting an answer and though he was usually candid nothing would have induced him to mention his original reason  well he said i think i have told you that you are the most beautiful woman i have ever at least spoken to but that though it goes some distance isnt quite everything youve got grit and fibre that are worth more than looks i am a lonely man with big fancies of my own and with you beside me to teach me what i do not know i think i could make my mark in my own country  you have nothing more to urge  leland made a little gesture  my dear i think you would find me kind to you  if the issue had been less serious carrie denham could have laughed his frankness and the absence of any sign of ardour or impassioned protest were she fancied under the circumstances somewhat unusual but that was after all a matter of relief to her she was willing to marry him but she meant to teach him to keep his distance afterwards which would naturally be more difficult to do in the case of a man in love with her then he fixed his gaze on her again  i almost fancy its my turn now he said i want the answer to a question i asked you last night will you come back to prospect with me as my wife  carrie denham felt her cheeks burn for she had to make him understand and it was harder than she had imagined  yes she said simply on conditions one must be honest and i could not make a bargain with youafterwardsyou can draw back now i think you know that i do not love youand i have nothing to give you except my fellowship still as you do not love me you will perhaps be content with that  the moonlight showed that leland started slightly and the darker colour in his bronzed face but he made her a little deferential gesture then he looked up again straightening himself with the glint in his eyes she had now and then seen there before  my dear he said you shall do most everything you like but when you say that i do not love you i am not sure that you are right  still said the girl sharply i at least know what i feel myself and i have tried to tell you that you must not expect too much from me  leland stooping caught her hand and held it fast  its a bargain he said you shall be your own mistress in every way and your wishes will be quite enough for me but i almost think that you will love me too some day i shall try to find how to make you and i have never been quite beaten yet in anything i undertook  he saw the look of shrinking in her face and though he had not expected it a little thrill of pain ran through him then he raised the hand he held and stooping touched it with his lips before he laid it on his arm as they went up the steps together he looked down on her again  in the meanwhile i will try to do nothing that could make you sorry you married me and you have only to tell me when anything does not please you  he left her at the entrance to the hall while he went in search of branscombe denham and as it happened saw very little of her during the rest of the evening it was late that night when the girl related to eveline annersly a part of what had passed the faded merry little woman her aunt and only confidante smiled as she listened  you probably know your own affairs best but i cant help wondering if you were wise in giving that man to understand that you didnt care in the least for him she said  why said carrie  because it is just possible that you may be sorry for it byandbye as it is i dont think there is any great necessity for pitying you if it had been aylmer it would have been a different matter  the girl looked at her with lifted brows  do you suppose i should ever care for a man like that one  well said her companion reflectively he seems to me a much superior man to reggie quite apart from that i never could discover any particular reason for the belief the denhams seem to have that they are set apart from the rest of humanity if there were any i should know it since im one of them myself you see henry annersly with all his shortcomingsand he naturally had themwas a much better man than jimmy will ever be in any case you would have had to marry somebody and if i had been your mother i would have shaken you for trying to fancy yourself in love with reggie  carrie denham flushed crimson and her brows straightened ominously but she restrained herself and laughed a little bitter laugh  well she said i suppose i did and i had my chances in two town seasons perhaps i was unreasonably fastidious but i wasif it wasnt more than thatfond of reggie and at least i am willing to bear the cost of my foolishness now  mrs annersly rose and after looking down on her a moment stooped and kissed her  still she said it wouldnt be quite honest to expect your husband to bear it too goodnight and try to think well of him i almost fancy he deserves it  she went out smiling but when the door had closed her face grew grave again  i wonder if that man will have reason to hate me for what i have done she said     chapter vi  the prairie   two long whistles came ringing up the track  carrie leland rose unsteadily in the big overheated car and struggled into the furs which had been one of her husbands gifts to her she had never worn furs of that kind before and indeed had never seen anything quite like them in her friends possession but while that had naturally been a cause of satisfaction it was nevertheless with a vague repugnance she put them on they were one of the visible tokens that in the most sordid sense of the word she belonged to him the man had not won her favour in fact he had made no great pretence of seeking it for which so far as that went she was grateful but he had evidently carried out his part of the bargain and now she was part of his property acquired by purchase the recognition of it carried with it an almost intolerable sting though hithertoand it was just a fortnight since her weddingshe had not felt it quite so keenly he had not been exacting and it had been comparatively easy to keep him at due distance on board the big mailboat and in the crowded train but she realised it would be different now they were almost home  in the meanwhile the great train was slowing down and when the clanging of the locomotive bell came back to her she went out through the vestibule and leant on the platformrails two huge wooden buildings grain elevators she supposed with lines of sledges beneath them flitted by it was with a shiver she glanced at the little wooden town it rose abruptly from the prairie without sign of tree or garden to relieve its ugliness an unsightly jumble of wooden houses in the midst of a vast white plain which stretched gleaming to the far horizon with not even a willow bluff to relieve its desolation she set her lips tight as the cars ran slowly into the station it consisted apparently of a stockyard a towering watertank and a weatherbeaten shed halfburied in snow and was as usual when the trains came in crowded with men who looked uncouth and shapeless in dilapidated skincoats and had hard faces almost blackened by exposure to the frost it was all strange and unfamiliar she had not a friend in that grim desolate land and she felt the physical discomfort almost a relief by way of distraction from her overpowering sense of loneliness when the bitter cold struck through her with the keenness of steel  then the cars stopped and her husband who swung her down into the dusty snow beside the track was forthwith surrounded by the crowd men with the snowdust sprinkled like flour upon their shaggy furs clustered about him and their harsh drawling voices grated on her ears they made it evident that he was one of them for they greeted him with rude friendliness as charley that was another shock to her prejudices leland however waved them aside and they fell back a pace or two gazing at her with unemotional inquiry in their eyes until he laid his hand upon her arm  i guess youre going to be astonished he said my wife boys  then the big fur caps came off while the men with the hard brown faces clustered thicker about the pair and awkwardly held out mittened hands they were most of them speaking and though it was difficult to catch all they said she heard from those at the back odd snatches which did not please her  why didnt you let us know and wed have turned out the band Â Â  its a great country you have come to maam Â Â  shes a daisy Â Â  whered he get her from Â Â  youve married the whitest man on the prairie mrs leland Â Â  some tone about that one  a little red spot burned in carrie lelands cheeks she hovered between anger and humiliation social distinctions counted for much in the land of her birth and it seemed to her that the man she had married might have spared her this vulgarity it might have been different had she loved him for she would then perhaps have found pleasure in his evident popularity but as it was she felt merely the indignity of being exposed to the gaze and comments of these oxdrivers or ploughmen as she took them to be that she was apparently expected to shake hands with them struck her as ridiculous the ovation however died away and there was for a moment an uncomfortable silence during which the crowd gazed at the cold beautiful woman who regarded them with unsympathetic eyes until her husband touched her arm again  wont you say just a word to them they mean to be kind he said  carrie made no response she felt she could not have done so had she wished and leland turned to the men again mrs leland doesnt feel quite equal to thanking you boys he said she has just come off a long journey and is feeling a little strange  the men murmured goodhumouredly one of them pushed his way through the crowd and shook hands with leland  we sent your wheat on to winnipeg as you cabled and your people have brought us another forty sledgeloads in he said were rather tightly fixed for room and want to know if youre going to send much more along no doubt you know wheat is two cents down  i do said leland drily still in the meanwhile i have got to sell  the man appeared a little astonished but he made a sign of comprehension well he said if you could have held back a month or two it might have been better theyve been rushing a good deal on to the markets lately but i guess youll want to straighten up after your trip to the old country your sleighs ready as you wired  leland who as she noticed seemed desirous of changing the subject turned to his wife  would you like some tea or anything of that kind he said if not we had better start at once its forty miles to prospect and theres not much of the afternoon left still of course if you prefer it they might fix you up a fairly decent room at the hotel tonight  carrie glanced at the little desolate town it appeared uninviting enough but when she spoke the words seemed to stick in her throat  no she said i would sooner gohome  leland said something to the man beside him and then led carrie into a very dirty wooden room with a big stove in the midst of it after which he left her to watch with a sinking heart the departing train clatter out into the darkness  he came back transformedwith a battered fur cap hiding most of his face in a very big and somewhat tattered fur coat with a fresh shock of dismay she noticed that he now looked very much as the others did in another minute he had lifted her into the sleigh and wrapped the big robes about her then he shook the reins and they were whirled away down the long smear of trail that led straight off to the horizon  it was beaten hard the team were fresh and fast and for a while the girl felt the exhilaration of the swift rush through nipping air the desolate town faded behind her a grey blur that lifted itself out of the horizon and was a big birch bluff came flitting back to her there was deep stillness only intensified by the screech of runners and the soft drumming of hoofs a vast sweep of fleckless azure overhung the glistening plain below it was not all white however for there were shades of grey and dusky purple in the hollows and the trail was a wavy riband that rose and fell in varying blue it was beautiful in its own way and the stinging air stirred her blood like wine that was for an hour or so but when the sun dipped a red copper ball amidst a frosty haze and the blues and greys crept wide across the whiteness of the plain the cold laid hold of her leland who had scarcely spoken looked down  are you warm he said  the girl was scarcely willing to admit that she was not but the frost of the northwest strikes keen and deep and after all it was his business to attend to her physical comfort  no she said i am very cold  leland nodded though there was light enough to show the curious look in his eyes well he said that ought to be excuse enough for me and its going to be a good deal colder presently  he slipped his free arm round her and drew her to him masterfully then he shook the furs higher about her neck with the hand that held the reins and carrie who felt that protest would be useless and undignified said nothing when she found her shoulder drawn against his breast though the old fur coat had a faint but unmistakable odour of tobacco and the stable about it  leland looked down on her with a little laugh after all that is where you ought to be he said perhaps if i am very good to you you will come there of your own will byandbye  carrie said nothing and though she felt her cheeks burn it was not altogether with anger against him the man had been tactfully considerate and had deferred to her as she felt that aylmer would not have done indeed she realised that she owed him a good deal if only because of the delicacy he had displayed and which she had scarcely expected from one so much beneath her in station it was not even so repugnant as she had fancied to lie there warmed by the heat of his body with his arm about her and she felt at least a comforting confidence in his ability to shelter and protect her what leland felt he did not tell her until some time afterwards he was accustomed to restraint and too the driving occupied most of his attention for darkness was creeping across the waste and the snow was deep outside the beaten trail  then the cold increased until it grew numbing and when the pain ceased all feeling died out of the girls hands and feet she gradually grew drowsy and looking up now and then with heavy eyes saw only the dim shapes of the horses projected against the bitter blueness of the night still at times they plunged into belts of shadow where there was a crackling under the runners and a flitting by of ghostly trees that vanished when they once more swept out into the awful cold of the open now and then leland called to the horses but his voice was lost again next moment in the silence it had scarcely broken a curious sense of the unreality of it all came upon the girl she almost felt that if she could cry out he and the team would vanish and all would be with her as it had been in england before she met him then the drumming of hoofs grew very faint and with a halfconscious desire for warmth she crept still closer to the silent man who looked down on her very compassionately and then setting his lips gave his attention again to the team she remembered nothing further until she roused herself at a pressure on her arm  prospect is close in front of us said her companion  she raised herself a trifle and looking round with a shiver saw a halfmoon sailing low above a dusky mass of trees what seemed to be a wooden house stood in the midst of them and its windows flung out streaks of ruddy light upon the snow behind it she could dimly see a range of strange shapeless buildings they did not in the least look like english stables barns or granaries then there was a sound of voices and a door swung open letting out a broader track of brightness in the midst of which the sleigh pulled up shadowy figures appeared here and there and leland who unstrapped the robes rolled them about her then before she quite realised his purpose he had lifted her and them together and was walking stiffly towards the house in another minute or two he set her down in a little logwalled room which had a tiled stove in the middle of it and a hardfeatured elderly woman came towards her with a kindly smile in her eyes  mrs nesbit carrie said the man she has been looking after the house for me lately my wifes most frozen and youll do what you can to make her comfortable Â Â  i suppose those are the fixings from montreal  mrs nesbit said they were but that they had arrived with one of the sledges too late to be opened that day leland pointed to several canvascovered rolls and bulky cases as he turned to the girl  theyre curtains and rugs and carpets and things of that kind he said we dont worry much about them on the prairie but this room and the next one are your own unless there are any you like better well get the cases opened tomorrow  he went out and it was some little time later when carrie found him awaiting her in a great bare room there were antelope heads guns axes rifles and here and there a splendid cluster of wheat ears upon the walls but there was nothing on the floor and the furniture appeared to consist of a table a carpenters bench a set of bookshelves and a few lounge chairs still it was well warmed by the big crackling stove and she sank with a little sigh of physical content into one of the chairs he drew out leland who now wore a jacket of soft white deerskin stooped beside her and took one of her still chilly hands in his it was also the one on a finger of which there gleamed the ring and he glanced at it with a queer halfwistful little smile  i hope you will be happy here what i can do to make it home to you will be done he said  he stopped a moment and seeing she made no response went on  all the way out i have thought of you sitting here since my mother no woman but mrs nesbit has crossed my threshold it has been all work and loneliness with me wont you try to make it different now  he laid his other hand gently on her shoulder and the girl who bore his name felt her cheeks burn as she turned her eyes away a caress would have been in one sense a very little thing but she could not bring herself to invite it then and she was further warned by what she saw in her companions eyes  leland for a moment closed one of his hard hands presently he smiled again and drawing another of the chairs up sat down beside her  well he said you will get used to me byandbye and i only want to please you in the meanwhile and now about mrs nesbit well send her away if it would suit you and you can get somebody from winnipeg though i dont know that it wouldnt be better to let jake do the cooking and cleaning as before its quite difficult to get maids in this country and when youve had them bout a week they marry somebody anyway thats your business the one thing to be done is what you like but if you could see your way to keep mrs nesbit it would please me  it was almost the only thing he had asked of her and she was willing to humour him in this of course she said in fact i rather like her who is she  a widow the mother of one of the boys who drives a team for me wages come down when theres little doing with the snow upon the ground and hes away railroading i told him id see the old lady was looked after until he came back again  but how could you have done that if i had sent her away  id have boarded her out with custer at the range whose wife wants help and cant hire it mrs nesbit would never have known where the money came from  carrie leland smiled it was only a few months since she had first set eyes upon the man but she felt that if she had been his housekeeper a device of that kind would not have availed with her there was no doubt that he had his strong points  then another young man came in and was presented to her as tom gallwey he called her husband charley and spoke with a clean english intonation  im going round to give the boys their instructions he said we have cleaned out the sod granaries as you cabled are we to break into the strawpile tomorrow  yes said leland youll go on hauling wheat in with every team  i suppose you know what has happened to the market one would fancy it wasnt a good time to sell  still youll haul that wheat in well go into the rest tomorrow will you come back to supper  the young man glanced at carrie if mrs leland will excuse me i think not he said and departed as he evidently considered tactfully  an englishman said the girl with a trace of colour in her face  ive never asked him but he talks like one i struck him shovelling on a railroad and looking very sick two or three years ago now he gets decent pay for looking after things for me  just then another man in weirdly patched bluejean who limped in his walk and carried the tray with his left hand brought in supper he gazed at carrie so hard that he spilled some of the contents of the dishes and when he went out she glanced at her husband with a smile  i suppose that is another pensioner she said  no said leland he earns his pay and all i did was to make it a little easier for him he got himself mixed up with a threshing mill at another place a while ago  and he naturally came to you  lelands eyes sparkled shrewdly well he said i guess i get my full value out of him wont you come to supper  carrie took her place at the head of the table and found the pork fried potatoes apples flapjacks and hot corncakes much more palatable than she had expected she also looked very dainty sitting there in the great bare room and was not displeased when leland told her so in fact the more she saw of him the more favourably he impressed her and though she remembered always that she was a denham of barrockholme and he a western farmer of low degree she did what she could to be gracious to him it was not until the meal was over that a trace of the bitterness she had felt towards him came back to her  i suppose you posted the letter i gave you at winnipeg she said  leland showed some little embarrassment i did i was going to talk to you about it in a day or two because it wouldnt be quite convenient to have mrs heaton out from chicago just now  carrie glanced at him sharply you told me i could fill the house with my friends if i wished  i believe i did said leland anyway i meant it still were not going to worry about that tonight  carrie saw that he was resolute and discreetly changed the subject she had not yet quite shaken off the effects of the cold and in another hour rose drowsily from beside the stove  leland opened the door and stood with his hand on it mrs nesbit will see you have everything you want he said dont come down too earlyand goodnight  he took the hand she held out and did not let it go at once the girl felt her heart beat a wee bit faster than usual as it had done once or twice before that day again she felt that it was only fitting she should offer her cheek to him but it was more than she could do  then he dropped her hand and made her a little inclination as he once more said goodnight     chapter vii  carrie makes her views clear   it was ten oclock next morning when carrie coming down to breakfast found that her husband had gone out two or three hours earlier gallwey also came in soon after she had finished the meal to say that leland might not be back until the evening and when he offered to take her round the homestead she decided to go with him mrs nesbit who equipped her with a pair of lined gumboots helped her on with her furs gazing at them admiringly  theres not another set like them on the prairie and i expect there are very few folks in montreal have anything quite as smart she said they must have cost a pile of money  a little flush crept into carries face but she answered languidly  i suppose they did she said mr leland had them made for me  well said the woman who gazed at her with an air of deprecation you have got a good man my dear theres not a straighter or a betterhearted one between winnipeg and the rockiesbut it would be worth while to humour him a little he has just a hard spot or two in him and he generally gets his way  carrie smiled a trifle coldly and so do i  she went out with gallwey but the hardhanded woman stood still a moment with a shadow of anxiety in her eyes and then sighed a little as she went on with her work again she would have done a good deal to save charley leland trouble and she foresaw difficulties  in the meanwhile the girl found the cold unlike anything she had felt in england but after the first few minutes more endurable than she had expected there was no trace of moisture in that crystalline atmosphere the sun that had no heat in it shone dazzlingly and the snow that flung the suns rays back fell from her feet dusty and dry as flour no cloud flecked the clear blueness overhead and fainter washes of the same cold colour marked the beaten trails and prints of horsehoofs that alone broke the gleaming surface of the white expanse below on the far horizon she could see grey blurs which were presumably trees  gallwey who was wrapped in an old fur coat from cheeks to ankles proved an agreeable companion he led her first a little way back among the slender birches where she could see the house it was she decided by no means picturesque a rambling frame structure roofed with cedar shingles built round what was evidently the original hut of small birch logs but it had a little verandah with rude pillars and trellis work on one side of it and gallwey assured her there were not many houses in that country to equal it then he showed her the barns and stables built in part of birch logs and for the rest of sods stretching back into the shelter of the bluff they were primitive and almost shapeless structures with roofs that apparently consisted of straw and soil and snow but she fancied their thickness would keep out even the frost of the northwest there were however only a horse or two and a few brawny oxen standing in them last of all he led her into one of the most curious edifices she had ever seen sitting down on one of the wheat bags inside it she looked about her  it had no definite outline and from the outside it had looked like a great mound of snow but she now saw that it had a skeleton wall of birch branches round this had been piled an immensity of very short straw and the roof which had partly fallen in as the bags beneath it had been cut out consisted of the same material it was filled with bags of wheat that here and there trickled redgold grain and she turned to gallwey with a question  is this the usual granary she said  gallwey laughed there are quite a few of them in this country you see we dont stack the grain here but leave most of the straw standing and thresh in the field whilst most of the smaller men rush their grain in to the railroad elevators as soon as that is done as a rule they want their money but charley had meant to hold wheat this year  carrie felt a little thoughtful for it was evident that her husbands change of purpose had attracted attention and she fancied she knew the reason for it  the stables are a little primitive too she said  they are no doubt very different from what you have been accustomed to in england but they serve their purpose and in a way theyre characteristic of your husband while there are men who would spend part of their profits making things comfortable every dollar charley leland takes out of the land goes back into it again and with the increase he breaks so many more acres each year its a tolerably bold policy but that is what suits him and it has succeeded well so far for one thing he wants very little for personal expenses to all intents and purposes he hasnt any  he stopped a moment and then went on deprecatingly i wonder if i may say that i am glad he has married after all it is scarcely fit for a man to live as he has done stripping himself of everything it has been all effort and selfdenial and you can do so much to make things pleasant for him  carrie was touched though she would not show it the man who apparently had no time for pleasure and no thought of comfort had been very generous to her it was also evident that there was much a woman could do to brighten the life he led if it was only to teach him that it had more to offer him than the material results of ceaseless labour still that had not been her purpose in marrying him and she felt an uncomfortable sense of confusion as she decided that it would have been very much better if he had chosen a woman who loved him as things were he must give everything and there was so little that she could offer  where are all the horses and the men gone she asked  to the railroad they started before the sun was up but charley has driven twenty miles to meet one of the winnipeg cattlebrokers its wheat or beef only with most men in this country but we raise the two and charley is thinking of cutting out some stock for the market though its very seldom done at this season we only keep store beasts through the winter and as they take their chances in the open when the snow comes they get poor and thin  gallwey excused himself in another minute or two and carrie who went back to the house spent the afternoon lying in a big chair by the stove with a book of which she read but little from what she had heard it was evident that leland was selling his wheat and cattle at a sacrifice which she could understand he would naturally not have done could he have helped it the reflection was not exactly a pleasant one for though branscombe denham had carefully refrained from mentioning to what agreement he and leland had come she was of course aware that her marriage had relieved him from some at least of his financial difficulties after all though she had sacrificed herself for him she could not think highly of her father and the fact that her husband had been thus compelled to strip himself was painful to contemplate it placed her under a heavy obligation to leland and there was so little she could do or at least was willing to do that would free her of it  it was dark when he came in walking stiffly with his fur coat hard with frost and her heart smote her again as she saw how his weary face brightened at the sight of her it cost her an effort to submit to the touch of his lips but she made it though she felt her cheeks grow hot and was sorry she had done so when she saw the glint in his eyes and felt the constraint of his arm drawing herself away from him she slipped back a pace or two leland stood looking at her wistfully  i didnt wish to startle you he said still it has been a little hard and lonely here and i fancied it was going to be different now i was looking forward to a kind word from you all the twenty miles home  an unusual colour crept into his wifes face both of them were glad that jake limped in just then with the evening meal which in that country differs in no way from breakfast or the midday dinner salt pork potatoes apples flapjacks or hot cakes with molasses and strong green tea it is usually very much the same from winnipeg to calgary few men have more or desire it on the prairie and fewer still have less at the end of the meal when jake had cleared away carrie leland looked up questioningly at her husband who sat opposite her beside the crackling stove there was nobody else in the big bare room  you havent told me why it is not convenient for me to have ada heaton here just now she said  you want her very much and again the man glanced at her wistfully  yes said carrie of course i do i must have somebody to talk to  leland made a gesture of vague appeal i suppose its only natural though i had most dared to hope you might be content for a little with my company anyway we wont let that count couldnt you bring mrs annersly out i like her and she told me that if i asked her she would come and stay a year then theres your younger sister  you dont suppose that lily would come to live here and there was something in her smile that jarred upon the man  well he said im sorry she was rather nice to me is there nobody else you could think of  one would almost fancy that you were trying to get away from the question it is why you dont want me to bring ada heaton here  leland leaned forward a little and laid his hand upon her arm wont you let it rest to please me i havent asked you very much  the girl was almost tempted to do so but unfortunately she had some notion of what was influencing him and resented it  no she said coldly i really think i ought to know  then im sorry but it wouldnt suit me to have mrs heaton here at all  why and an ominous red spot appeared in the girls cheek as she shook off his arm  leland stood up and leaning upon the chairback looked down at her perhaps he felt it gave him an advantage and he would need it in the struggle which was evidently impending he had never faced an angry woman before and he shrank from it now but not sufficiently to desist from what he felt he had to do  i wonder if you have ever asked yourself why mrs heaton is in chicago when her home is in london he said i cant believe that she told you  ahand carrie moved her head so that he could see the sparkle in her eyesyou have heard those tales and believed themabout a relative of mine presumably you have heard nothing about captain heaton  it was one of your people who told me they said the man was short of temper so are a good many of us and it seems he had some reason still theres rather more against mrs heaton than that shes not living with her own husband knowing you meant to ask her here i made inquiries  the girl turned towards him with anger and contempt in her face which was almost colourless now although she fancied that he knew rather more than she did about the recent doings of the lady in question the pride of family was especially strong in her as it occasionally is in cases where there is very little to warrant it  your time was well employed she said you who live here with your horses and cattle presume to decide how people of our station should spend their lives  there is one thing at least expected of a woman who is married its the necessary foundation of civilised society and the woman you want to bring here has openly disregarded it you must have heard something of the trouble between her and her husband in london but i cant quite think you know how she came to be in chicago  as a matter of fact carrie leland did not know still she would not ask the man who had apparently laid firm hands upon his temper and was looking at her appealingly it was unfortunate that she only remembered he had presumed to cast a slur upon one of her relations and was in her opinion very far beneath her she refused to answer and lelands face grew grim  well he said you are in almost every way your own mistress but there are points on which what i say stands this house was built for my mother i have brought my wife home to it now and mrs heaton does not enter its door  carrie rose and faced him imperious but at last dangerously cold in her anger  your wife she said could you have expected that i should ever be more than that in name to you  the veins showed swollen on the mans forehead as he looked at her and a dark flush crept into his bronzed cheek  madam he said now you have gone that far you have got to tell me exactly what you mean  it should be quite plain you could buy me it sounds absurd of course and a trifle theatrical but it is just what took place and there are no doubt many of us for sale isnt that alone sufficient to make me hate you cant you realise the sickening humiliation of it and did you suppose you could buy my love as well  leland made her a little inclination which though it was the last thing she had expected just then undoubtedly became him i had most ventured to hope that you might give it me byandbye he said  his restraint did not serve him the girl realised that she was in the wrong but she had failed in her desire to look down on him this she naturally felt was another grievance against him she had the old disdain of those who own the land for those who till it and although in this mans case the contempt she strove to feel seemed out of place it was horribly humiliating to recognise that she was wholly in his hands  to you she said with a bitter laugh that brought the dark flush to his face again  leland laid his hand on her shoulder and gripped it hard  i have perhaps no great reason for setting too high a value on myself he said what i am you know but if you must have plain talk there were two men made the bargain that disposed of you it cost me a big share of my possessions to satisfy your father but he showed no unwillingness to take my cheque and he would have taken aylmers could he have raised him high enough who was the lowest down the western farmer who at least meant to be kind to you or branscombe denham who was willing to sell his daughter to the highest bidder still you were right it was in one way about the meanest thing i ever did the blood was in my face when i made my offerand your father smiled by the lord if id made that proposition to any hardup wheatgrower between here and calgary hed have whipped me from his door  the girl had plenty of courage but she was almost afraid of him now for there was a strength and grimness in his bronzed face which she had never seen in that of any denham and the tightening grip of his ploughmans fingers bruised her shoulder cruelly perhaps unconsciously he shook her a little in a gust of passion and she set her lips hard to check the cry she would not have uttered had he beaten her  now he said in any case you belong to me that has to be remembered always how are we to go on what is it to be  carrie contrived to smile sardonically oh she said sit down and try to be rational all this is a trifle ridiculous  leland dropped his hand and when she sat down leaned upon the back of the other chair facing her  well he said  it seems to me that we must quietly try to come to an understanding once for all tonight in the first place why did you wish to marry me  leland set his lips for a moment it would have been a relief just then to tell her that it was to save her from aylmer but this appeared a brutality to which he could not force himself for in spite of what she had told him he could not be sure that it had been his only reason her shrinking from him painful to him as it was nevertheless had its attraction  i believe i said that you were the most beautiful woman i had at least ever spoken to he said i was a lonely man and it seemed to me i might perhaps do big things some day with a woman of your kind to teach me what i did not know that was part of it but i think there was more it was a hard life and a bare one here and i had a fancy that you could show me how much i might have that i was missing a smile would have helped me through my difficulties a word or two when one had to choose between the mean and right and the knowledge that there was some one who believed in me would have made another and gentler man of me well it seems that you have none of them to give me  he made an emphatic gesture still we have to face the position as it is and my parts plain everything you have been used to you shall have so far as i can get it for you you can have any of your friends here who will make the journey and be civil to your farmerhusband and you can go to them when it pleases you to save you ever asking me for money i will open you an account in a winnipeg bank and you need never see me unless you wish to  ah said carrie you are at least generous to make the understanding complete what do you expect from me  leland moved and laid his hand upon her shoulder again  only to remember that however little you think of your husband you are my wife after all  the girls cheeks burned but she looked up at him with a little hard laugh i think i could have struck you for that but it must go with the rest still even if i were all that your imagination could picture me and went as far as mrs heaton did why should it trouble you  leland stooped lower over her with the veins swollen on his forehead and a glint in his eyes  you and your father tricked metaking all i had to offer for nothing he said i suppose i ought to hate you tooand still i cant  once more he gripped her cruelly by the lord dolt that i am i think i almost love you for the grit that made you show your scorn still that doesnt count it is for me to go it alone  he let his grasp relax and left her suddenly turning at the door  you will want a companion will you write for mrs annersly tomorrow  i will said carrie coldly under the circumstances it is advisable she will be a protection  he went out and she saw no more of him for a day or two but that night she found a blue mark upon the whiteness of her shoulder     chapter viii  leland seeks distraction   dusk was creeping up from the eastwards across the great snowsheeted plain when leland pulled his horses up where a little bytrack branched off from the beaten trail behind him the wilderness losing its gleaming whiteness and fading into shades of soft bluegrey ran level to the hard blueness on the northern horizon in front of him there were rolling rises ridged with sinuous bands of birches black in broken masses against the lingering light in the south and west there was room for wheat enough to glut markets of the world on the leagues of rich black loam that undulated to the frozen waters of lake winnipeg already miles of it were banded together by belts of twofoot stubble but as yet the plough had not invaded the land of bluff and ravine creek and coulee where the shaggy broncho and the wild steer ran  leland was wrapped to the eyes in an old fur coat and his breath rose like steam into the dead still air a cloud of thin vapour floated above the horses it was exceptionally cold and gallwey who sat halffrozen beneath the piledup robes wondered why his companion had pulled the team up there when they were within some twenty minutes ride from shelter still he did not consider it advisable to inquire for certain colts of a blooded sire had been missing and leland who had shown signs of temper during the day looked unusually grim flinging the reins to gallwey he stepped down stiffly from the sleigh  drive on slowly tom you dont want to keep a warm team standing in this frost he said  gallwey contrived to clutch the reins though his hands were numbed through the big mittens  what are you going to do he asked  look at these tracks said leland drily they kind of interest me  gallwey spoke to the team and the sleigh which consisted of a light waggonbox mounted on a runner frame slid on sleighs such as are used about the eastern cities are not common in the northwest where indeed the snow seldom lies so deep or long and the prairie farmer either makes shift with his waggon or contents himself with the humble bobsled he now noticed what he had been too cold to notice before that there was something peculiar about the print of hoofs breaking out here and there a blur of scattered blue smudges in the trail he followed some seemed deeper than others and there were long spaces where they disappeared altogether this did not seriously concern him so he drove on until he reached the first grove of stunted birches which clung beneath the shelter of a winding rise here he waited until leland rejoined him it was quite dark now and he could not see his comrades face at all but as he flung himself into the sleigh he laughed in a fashion of his that gallwey knew usually portended trouble  go on leland said i want my supper and a little talk with jeff kimball too one would have figured that man had a little more sense in him its most two weeks i think since you had any snow  a week last monday just enough to dust the trail is there anything particular to be deduced from that  only that we had the rustlers round next day and ive a kind of notion my colts went then  gallwey sat silent while the sleigh glided on he did not know of course that leland had quarrelled with his wife but he had noticed the mans grimness during the day and now he was struck with the ring of his voice as he spoke of the rustlers  the cattle war in montana across the neighbouring border in which the great ranchers and small homesteaders contended for the land was over and when the united states cavalry restored order little bands of broken men ruined in the struggle and cattleriders who found their occupation gone had undertaken a smuggling business along the frontier the prohibition act was enforced in neighbouring parts of canada and there was accordingly an excellent profit to be made on any whisky they could run there was too among the chinamen in the united states a good demand for opium which it was supposed came in via vancouver for the most part the smugglers were tolerated perhaps from the same motives that prompt otherwise honest people to pardon outlaws who rob the rich and the government at any rate a farmer seldom grumbled when a horse was requisitioned though he knew that the animal might not be returned as a reward for his silence he was likely to find mysterious cases of whisky near his trail his opposite conduct could carry with it many results for instance grassfires so dangerous to homesteads and ripening crops had a suspicious way of starting in the harvest season the small farmer accordingly was loth to trouble the mounted police about anything he might have heard or seen and the rustlers as a rule knew when to stop and only seized a horse or killed a steer for meat when they urgently needed it  do you think its worth while making trouble said gallwey suggestively  i want my colts back said leland i guess im going to get them shake that team up its getting cold  gallwey who was half frozen already called to the horses and in another ten minutes they came into sight of a blaze of cheerful radiance in the gloom of a big bluff leland held the big cattle run in the vicinity though it lay a long ride from his homestead  gradually a little log house grew into shape and leland who drove the sleigh round to the back of it before he got out turned to the man who had slouched from the doorway  i guess well leave the sleigh here he said we have come for the night and well put the team in while you get supper  though he could not see the mans face for the dark gallwey fancied he was a little disconcerted at this announcement in another halfhour however they were sitting down to a meal leland said very little until it was over when taking his pipe out he pulled a hide chair up to the stove and looked at the man whom have you had round the place the last week or so jeff he said  thompson said the other he brought four or five horses along  he did i saw his tracks where he headed off the trail for the back range quite sure he hadnt any more that reminds me ill want to see him in a day or two about those steers  gallwey fancied this last was meant as an intimation that accuracy was advisable and he watched the big looselimbed man who was filling his pipe just then he appeared uneasy under all this scrutiny for leland was also quietly regarding him  now i come to recollect it was four  anybody else said leland  custer he came along with a bobsled yesterday  you cant think of any more  no said the other man who flashed a suspicious glance at him i cant quite figure how i could when they werent there  leland smoked on tranquilly apparently considering for a moment or two and then straightening himself a little looked hard at the man  jeff he said quietly its a kind of pity you dont know enough to make a decent liar  the man started but seemed to recover himself again and it was with quickening interest gallwey watched the pair a smoky kerosene lamp gave out an indifferent light and a red glare beat out from the open door of the stove streaming uncertainly upon the faces of the men  it showed leland sitting motionless a hard glint in his eyes and the other man making little uneasy movements as he shrank from the steady gaze as leland spoke again the man winced  if any man had said as much to me one of us would have been out in the snow by now he said have you no grit in you then why in the name of thunder did you take hold of a contract that was way too big for you did you think i could be bluffed by a thing like you  i cant quite figure what you mean said the other man sullenly  then ill have some pleasure in telling you soon after the last snow fell two rustlers came up this trailthere were more of them but they stayed down by the big one when they went away three of my horses went with them now who caught those horses and had them ready its kind of curious too that they were the pick of the bunch with good blood in them the only man round here who could tell them which were worth the lifting is you jeff you dont know enough to run a peanut stand and yet you figured you were fit to kick against the man who hired you  jeff appeared to rouse himself for an effort youre guessing a good deal of it  guessing when ive lived on this prairie all my life and the whole thing is written there in the snow cant i tell the difference between the tracks of a steady ridden horse and a young one thats not used to the halter however im open to listen now  ive just this to say it wont hurt you to lose a horse or two and thats about all anybody has ever taken out of you while its quite likely youll be worse off if you make trouble about it in fact taking it all around you cant afford to get rid of me  anyway that is what i mean to do i have no use for a man who sells my property to his friends youll get out of this place tomorrow  i guess ill go right now thompson will take me in  no said leland sharply youll stay just where you are until the morning though you can take your blankets into the other room as soon as you like its quite hard to keep my hands off you and if you come out before i call you to make breakfast im not going to try  jeff said nothing further but taking two dirty blankets out of a hayfilled bunk shuffled away into a second room behind a log partition leland went after him and laying his hands on the little window shook it violently  if you try to get out that way were going to hear you and then youll be sorry for yourself he said  he came back and flinging himself into the chair beside the stove filled his pipe  i dont quite know how you worried the thing out and perhaps it doesnt greatly matter but i rather think it was good advice he gave you said gallwey reflectively you certainly can afford to lose a horse or two and the rustlers are the kind of people it is just as well to keep on good terms with sergeant grier has only three or four troopers and the outpost is quite a long way off  leland smiled well he said horsestealing is getting to be a good deal more profitable business than liquorrunning they get horses for nothing and they have to buy the whisky they havent gone very far into it yet but its a sure thing that they will if they find out that none of us seem to mind it somebody has to make a protest and it may as well be me  so far as my observation goes most men would rather let their neighbour make it first said gallwey drily you however seem to be an exception  lelands face hardened the fact is i feel like taking it out of somebody soon i have had a good deal to worry me  one would not have expected you to feel like that just now  i guess well change the subject said leland grimly you are wondering what i sent jeff in there for well i didnt want him loose on the prairie it seems to me hes expecting a visit from his friends and id just as soon they came and let me have a word with them you get into the bunk there and go to sleep until i want you  wrapping one of the sleigh robes about him gallwey lay down for the night he saw leland put the light out and sit down again by the snapping crackling stove through its open door a flickering radiance now and again touched his earnest face though they had been out since dawn in the stinging frost he sat firmly erect gripping his unlighted pipe and gazing straight in front of him with hard unwavering eyes behind him the shadows played upon the walls of the gloomy shanty quiet save for the moan of the bitter wind gallwey who did not think it was the rustlers wondered what was worrying his comrade until his eyes grew heavy and though he had not intended it he fell asleep wearily  leland however sat still while the crackle of the stove died away and the stinging cold crept in he had much to think of and could see no way out of the difficulties that beset him and his wife he had known that she had no love for him but since the night she had met him on the terrace steps at barrockholme his admiration for her had grown steadily stronger and he had been conscious of a curious tenderness whenever he thought of her her smile was worth the winning by any effort he could make and the odd kind word she occasionally flung him would set his heart thumping  then the revelation had come and left him dismayed he had never counted on her hating him as it now seemed she must do or regarding him as one so far beneath her that the most she could feel for him was an impersonal toleration he was a proud man and her words had stung him deeply it was galling to realise that he was bound to a woman who shrank from him and despised him and that the bonds were unbreakable no matter how irksome they might become to both his wife and himself  then that mood passed for there was a silent deepseated optimism in him that had carried him through frozen harvests and adverse seasons and he began to appreciate her point of view and that it might not be an unalterable one he did not blame her for her courage or even for her scorn though it had hurt him horribly it was for him to prove it unwarranted or with patience to live it down but he did not know how either could be done and now and then a little fit of anger set his blood tingling as he sat in the growing shadows beside the emptying stove his resentment was not so much against the woman as the man who had knowing what she must feel forced her into marrying him but they were in england and he felt illogically that he must strike at some one nearer which was why he waited for the rustlers he had no pistol it is not often that the plainsman carries arms in western canada but there was a big axe at jeffs woodpile which would he fancied serve in case of necessity at last when the stove had almost gone out he roused himself to attention with a little start in the bitter cold and rising touched gallwey  get up he said slip in behind the door and shut it when i tell you there are horses on the trail  gallwey did as he was bidden half asleep though he heard a beat of hoofs that grew louder then there was a stamping of feet outside and leland flung a few split billets through the open top of the stove a sharp crackling followed and a blaze sprang up but the light only flickered here and there leaving the room almost dark  let them in he said  the door swung open two shadowy figures shapeless in fur coats and caps appeared in the opening and one of them turned sharply when gallwey slammed the door behind him  now he said what is that for i dont seem to recognise you anyway  leland laughed come right in gentlemen ive been waiting to see you and theres no mistake jeffs in the second room yonder and if he ventures to come out with any notion of making trouble hell run a considerable risk of getting himself hurt  he had raised his voice a trifle and the rustle that had commenced died away in token that jeff had heard in the meanwhile one of the rustlers had slipped his hand inside his furs but leland who noticed it made a little gesture  i guess its not worth while he said if youll sit down a minute i have a word or two to say to you  one of the men did so but the other stood near the door watching gallwey who was on the whole thankful that he had taken down jeffs rifle  well said the first outlaw it was jeff who gave us away  not exactly at least he didnt mean to you should have got a smarter man before you ventured to put up a bluff on me still thats not the question when are you going to bring my horses back  im afraid i cant quite promise said the other with a chuckle with us finding is sometimes keeping  you have two weeks if theyre not back in that time youre going to be sorry  the outlaw laughed openly come down and look at it reasonably we have got to live and we have after all stuck you for very little with four police troopers to watch this part of the country theres nothing you can do i guess weve got our grip on it just now  you have two weeks to bring back my horses in  then you mean to insist on it said the other man  i do dont you get to thinking the honest men in this country are a bit afraid of you theyre only lazy we have nothing to do with the whisky but this horselifting has got to be stopped get out and remember it before i use my feet on you  the outlaw was a big man as he slipped his hand beneath his furs leland quietly reached for the axe  i could shear your arm off before you got it out he said will you lay it down and see if you can stop in this shanty when i tell you to get out  the rustler looked at him for a moment and though there was very little light was apparently satisfied  no he said i guess thats not business anyway you wont get your horses but ill give you good advice sit tight and mind your farming and its quite likely you wont lose any more were not nice folks when were roused but were not looking for trouble  youll get it said leland drily unless my horses are back two weeks tonight open the door tom and let the gentlemen out  nothing more was said by either and in another minute or two there was a thud of hoofs as the outlaws rode away     chapter ix  farmers in council   nearly three weeks had slipped by since leland met the outlaws and his horses were missing still when he sat in council at prospect with a few of his scattered neighbours one bitter night the big room was as bare and comfortless as it had been in his bachelor days though there were cases at the railroad station whose contents would have transformed it had he troubled to haul them in leland was somewhat grim of face for the past few weeks had not been pleasant ones to him  the breach between him and his wife was still as wide as ever and he felt it the more keenly because since the night of their frankness she had shown no sign of anger instead she had treated him with a civility that was hard to bear and had professed herself content with all the arrangements at prospect as they were leland was too proud a man to make advances which he felt would be repelled and decided bitterly that since nothing he could do would please her the comforts she did not seem to care about might stay where they were until they rotted her own rooms at least were furnished and fitted luxuriously in so far as he had been able to contrive it and since she spent most of her time in them the one in which his mother had lived was good enough for him still all this reacted upon his temper and on the night when he had his neighbours there he was feeling the strain  there were four of them men who toiled early and late and had a stake in the country and they were all aware that others would probably be influenced by what they did they listened to him gravely sitting about the crackling stove with a box of cigars on the little table in front of them there was nothing to drink however since for several reasons including the enactments of the legislature strong green tea is the beverage most usually to be met with on the prairies and of that they had just had their fill at supper there was silence until one of them turned to the rest with a twinkle in his eyes  im with charley leland in most of what he says he said the laws necessary as you find out when you have lived as i have in a country where there isnt any still after all the enforcing of it is the business of the legislature and the most they do for us is to worry us for statistics and fine us for not ploughing unnecessary fireguards then there are two or three of us on this prairie who arent fond of tea and as things are we generally know where to get a little monongahela or bourbon when we want it i guess it would give a kind of tone to this soirÃ©e if we had some of it now  there was approving laughter until another man spoke  thats quite right just as far as it goes he said give me a chance of a square kick at the scott act and ill kicklike a mule in the meanwhile there it is and you have to figure if breaking it is worth while when you begin making exceptions its quite hard to stop now i dont want to go round with a pistol strapped on to me and while we stand by the law it isnt necessary so long as i know that the crops i raise are mine and nobody can take them from me i can do without my whisky thats why im with charley leland in this thing and you have to remember its quite a big one  it is said a third speaker here we are a few scattered farmers with stables and granaries that will burn and horses that can be run across the frontier behind us stand sergeant grier and his four troopers while if we back up leland we have a tolerably extensive organisation against us and the men who belong to it arent going to stick at anything if we are willing to live and let live what do we stand to lose a horse borrowed now and then an odd steer killed perhaps an unbranded beast or two missing well i guess it might work out cheaper than the other thing  there was silence for a moment or two and then a young man looked up languidly he had come out four or five years before from montreal  there is hard sense in all we have heard but i think lelands point of view is nearest the academic one he said every honest man has a duty to the state and it is certainly going to cost him more than he gains if he wont discharge it there are probably more honest men than rogues everywhere and yet one usually sees the rogues uppermost for this reason the honest man wont worry so long as they dont rob him and his neighbour cant make a fight alone nobody is anxious to face the first blow for the benefit of the rest and so the rogue gets bolder until he becomes intolerable then the honest man stirs himself and the rogues go down though it causes ever so much more trouble than it would have done if the thing had been undertaken earlier ill give you an example begbie hung a man in british columbia the first one who wanted it and there was order at once coleman and his vigilantes who were scarcely quick enough had to hang them by the dozen in california now we come to the question how bad have things got to be before you think it worth while to do anything  it was evident that he had made an impression he had shown them the dangers of toleration and they were men who while they did little rashly believed in the greatness of their country they looked at leland who turned to them with a little grim smile  they have gone quite far enough for me he said im going to move now the one thing i want to ask is who is going to stand in with me  the man who had last spoken glanced at the rest i think you can count upon the four of us  there was a murmur of concurrence and leland smiled as a matter of fact i did so already and asked sergeant grier to ride across and meet you tonight he should be here any minute now in the meanwhile i want to say that ive been riding up and down the country lately and have reasons for supposing theres a big load of whisky to be run during the next few days  as they talked over this news there was a knocking at the outer door and a grizzled man who wore what had once been a very smart cavalry uniform was shown into the room he sat down and listened with grave attention to what leland had to say then he looked up quietly  i have to thank you gentlemen and ill swear you in he said from what i can figure it must be ned johnstons gang and theyre about the hardest of the crowd i havent much fault to find with mr lelands programme except on a point or two  they discussed it for an hour and when all was arranged one of them laughed as he laid his hand on lelands shoulder i guess youre doing the right thing he said still in one way its a little curious that its you  why  well said the other man drily if i had just been married to a woman like mrs leland i figure i mightnt have been so willing to put myself in the way of a bullet id have let somebody else make the first move and stayed at home with her  lelands face grew a trifle hard as he forced a laugh i scarcely think marriage has made any great change in me or that its likely to do so  then his guests drove away but the man to whom he had spoken remembered the look in lelands face  now i wonder what charley meant by that he said getting into his sleigh  leland in the meanwhile had flung himself down into a chair beside the stove and was lying there moodily with an unlighted pipe in his hand when his wife came in it was evident that he did not notice her and she had misgivings as she noticed the weariness in his attitude after all he was her husband and he looked very lonely in the big bare room she sat down beside him and touched his arm your friends have gone she said  the man looked up sharply and she saw the little glow in his eyes which however faded out of them again  yes he said i hope we did not disturb you  you were suspiciously quiet what were you plotting together  nothing said leland that is nothing you would probably care to hear about  carrie felt repulsed though she would not show it she had meant to be amiable and she was a somewhat determined young woman so she tried again  isnt it a little lonely here she said why did you not come up to me i have scarcely seen you the last few days  lelands smile was not exactly reassuring i dont want to trouble you too often besides i have been out in the frost since early morning and feel a little tired and drowsy one naturally doesnt care to appear to any more disadvantage than is necessary  carries lips and brows straightened portentously were you afraid i might point it out to you or do you wish to make it evident to everybody that you are purposely keeping out of my way  i suppose i should have thought of that but its a thing that never occurred to me still you asked me another question and though perhaps its weak of me i cant help giving you an answer  he stopped a moment and pointed round the desolate room while the girl realised its dreariness as she saw the dry white ears on the walls quiver in the icy draughts and heard the wailing of a bitter wind outside the birchlog walls  do you supposethisis what i bargained for when i asked you to marry me you took the trouble not long ago to point out very plainly what you thought of me and i think you meant every word of it it was rather a bitter draught but perhaps your point of view was a natural one i am not the kind of man you have been accustomed to in fact there are very few points on which i resemble your father or jimmy  ah said carrie that was not meant to be conciliatory it rather emphasises the distinction you mention still i think you had not finished  not quite when you are willing to take me as i am without prejudice and give me a chance of winning your liking you will not find me backward until then i have a little too much selfrespect to support you in pretending to be the dutiful wife because you think it becoming your contempt was honest anyway  carrie rose with a little languid gesture i wonder how long this exceptionally pleasant state of affairs could be expected to continue  until you change your mind or one of us is dead if you get tired of it in the meanwhile you can always go back to the old country for a few months or so  it is really a little difficult to understand what could have induced you to marry me  leland looked at her with a little grim smile i believe i gave you my reasons on another occasion it would be rather more to the purpose to ask why you were content with them  the girls cheeks burned but she turned from him languidly you almost tempt me to tell you she said still perhaps i have already let my candour carry me too far  she went out of the big room quietly and naturally but when she reached her own apartment she clenched her hands passionately though she was very angry she had to realise that the mans attitude under the circumstances was by no means astonishing she had also exactly what she had wished for since it was clear that he would make no embarrassing advances now and yet her courage almost failed her as she looked forward to an indefinite continuance of their present relations he had said that unless she made it there could be no change until one of them was dead  it was the next day and she had seen nothing of leland when she met gallwey with whom she had become friendly  the young man she saw was quite willing to constitute himself her devoted servant at the same time she felt the sincerity of his attachment for her husband and drew from it a comfortable sense of security  of course you have heard the news he said i dont know if im presuming or if its kind to admit anything that might distress you but it would be a relief to me if you could persuade charley to be careful im not quite sure he realises what he has undertaken  carrie had of course heard nothing though she naturally refused to admit it she also realised the irony of the fact that everybody except herself seemed attached to her husband they were then standing in the big general room but after she had sat down and smilingly pointed the young man to a place near her ten minutes of judiciously directed conversation left her with a tolerably clear notion of the state of affairs she was also sensible of an illogical feeling of dismay and apprehension  but why does he do it she asked  gallwey looked thoughtful well he said somebody will have to take the thing up eventually and when there is anything unpleasant but necessary charley is usually there to do it i almost fancy he cant help it as they say in this country that is the kind of man he is still under the circumstances i really think he ought to let the others take an equal risk and it might be advisable for you to impress it upon him  you believe that what i said would have any influence asked carrie with a curious little smile  of course and gallwey gazed at her reproachfully surely that ought to be evident  well said the girl with a trace of languidness i have to thank you for warning me and i will do what i can though i am not very certain it will have any great effect on him  gallwey left her a few minutes later carrie who was now very thoughtful saw nothing of her husband that night or during most of the next day he came in and asked for supper a little before dusk and when he had eaten it carefully went over the lock and magazine action of a fortyfour marlin rifle then he put on his furs and girt himself with a bandolier on reaching the outer door he heard a swift patter of footsteps on the neighbouring stairs as carrie came up to him he stood still with the blue riflebarrel gleaming over his shoulder looking like a giant in his shaggy coat she was dressed as he noticed unusually prettily and although he set his lips the little sparkle crept into his eyes as it faded the bronzed face barely visible beneath the fur cap became once more impassive  the girl walked steadily up to him and laid a hand upon his arm  you have given me a good deal but i scarcely think i have asked you for anything yet i want you to run no risk that isnt necessary tonight she said  leland started but again he put a constraint upon himself  so you know he said  of course did you think when everybody else knew you could keep it from me still that isnt what i asked you i want you to be careful  leland looked at her and though she saw the blood creep slowly into his face his restraint was also evident  did you say that because you believed it was the correct thing madam he asked  carrie flushed but the man shaking her hand off his arm laid his big mittened one upon her shoulder and holding her away from him looked down on her gravely  you will try to forgive me that it was a trifle brutal he said and his voice sank still to be quite honest i could scarcely think that any risk i ran could cause you very much anxiety  carrie said nothing for with that steady gaze upon her she could not pretend even if her pride would have permitted her and leland smiled a trifle wistfully his face was almost gentle now  well he said you neednt force yourself to say it would if it hurts you and i daresay it was kindness that prompted you to try still you see i should want a good deal and anything you didnt mean wouldnt satisfy me after all it would make things easier for you if i didnt come back again  the girl shivered you surely cant believe i would think of that  no and leland made a little gesture which was expressive of weariness it was your sense of fitness that turned you against me  he let his hand fall from her shoulder after all my dear i am sorry for you  and yourself  it is a little rough on me but that cant be helped somehow or other i guess i can bear it  then he stooped and taking one of her hands held it between both of his before he turned and flung open the door  carrie saw him for a moment a tall black figure silhouetted against the cold blue and then he had vanished into the night     chapter x  homicide   an almost intolerable cold had descended upon the prairie when leland reached the coulee where sergeant grier was mustering his forces late at night they were not a very strong body three troopers of the northwest police all of them rather young two prairie farmers leland gallwey and the sergeant but the latter had decided that they would be enough for the purpose he was aware that in an affair of this kind a few men who understand exactly what they have to do and can be relied on to set about it quietly and collectedly are apt to prove more efficient than a larger body the unnecessary man he knew is usually busy getting in his comrades way there was also another reason which leland had pointed out since his acquaintances had undertaken the business it was advisable that they should carry it out without exposing themselves unnecessarily to the outlaws vengeance there were several bands of the latter acting more or less in concert and it would lessen the risks if there were only three or four men liable to them in place of several times as many  the sergeant quite concurred in this and when leland rode up stiff with frost quietly sent the men out to their stations just there the beaten trail that led south to the frontier dipped into one of the winding ravines traversing the country with many a loop and bend a sluggish creek flowed through its bottom beneath the ice and a growth of willows and birches that there found shelter from the winds straggled up its sides trees fringed the crest of the dip too and in places overflowed into the prairie in scattered spurs the trail ran through their midst and there was no doubt that if the outlaws came at all which was not certain they would come that way since there are disadvantages attached to leading loaded horses through a thick birchbluff in the darkness  a farmer and one of the troopers were sent back to where the trees ran farther out into the prairie and they were to lie hidden there and cut off the retreat in case the rustlers endeavoured to head back the way they had come the main body lined the trail in the thickest of the bluff just below the crest of the ravine and leland and one young trooper proceeded to the foot of the declivity it would be their business to stop anybody who might succeed in breaking through the rest of the ambuscade each of them knew precisely what was expected of him and the only uncertainty was whether the rustlers were coming and if so how many there would be of them  it was a suitable night for their purpose neither too dark nor too light the heavens were barred with drifting wreaths of cloud between which every now and then a halfmoon and an occasional star shone down the birches wailed as they shook their frail twigs beneath a bitter wind leland was sensible of a distressing tingling in his numbed feet and hands the young trooper beside him limped and stumbled a shadowy indistinct figure in his furs stiff with cold their softly moccasined feet made no sound both of them wondered whether they could use their slung rifles if the necessity arose  it is possible without feeling desperately cold to face the frost of the northwest in a prairie waggon when one is packed about with hay and wrapped in big fur robes but there are times when the man who travels on horseback runs the risk of freezing and because horses might be wanted farmers and police troopers had ridden instead of driving leland was capable of moving but the young trooper was in a far worse state and sighed with relief when at last they stopped beside the creek where a dense growth of willows kept off the stinging wind  im that cold i most cant hump myself he said seems to me i havent got any feet on i guess theyre froze still its not quite so cruel as the night the corporal got one of his nipped we were sleeping way back up long traverse trail in a pit in the snow and were too playedout to waken when the fire got low the frost had the corporal by the morning but wed most of twenty leagues to make with two or three mighty cold camps on the way and his moccasins opened up a wound you couldnt have told he had a foot when i last saw him  leland said nothing he was not inclined for conversation and knew that instances of the kind were not uncommon the wardens of the prairie probably know more about cold than anybody except arctic explorers and they are expected to face it shelterless in the open for days together when occasion arises they cannot always find a birchbluff to camp in and the snow is frequently too thin to throw up a bank between them and the wind only hard men continue in that service and perhaps the prairie wolf alone knows what becomes of some of the unfit who try it  the lad however seemed impelled to talk and stamped up and down beating his mittened hands with the swivel of his slung carbine jangling as he moved  one would most wonder why you folks took a hand in he said i guess if id been a farmer its more than id have done myself there seem to be a blame lot of the rustlers and so far as we can figure they stand in together the three or four of us cant be everywhere at once and they might take a notion of getting even by playing the firebug when the grass is dry in harvest season id plough my fireguards twice as wide it would be quite easy to burn up a ripening crop  leland was aware that there would unfortunately be no difficulty in doing this but he was willing to take his chances and did not answer the lad indeed the probable loss of a crop appeared a comparatively small matter to him just then he was sore and bitter and a feud with the outlaws would have been almost a relief he felt that branscombe denham had tricked him but sincerely desired to stand well with his wife in spite of her scornful attitude towards him he did not blame her for that altogether though her words still rankled but he would not expose himself to her disdain again and had decided that if things were to be different the first advances must be made by her in the meanwhile it was singularly unpleasant to both of them and that night he was in a very sensitive and somewhat dangerous mood as he stood shivering among the willows  i guess they should be here by now if the fellow who told us was playing a straight game said the lad the trouble is theyve a good many friends and nobody can tell exactly whos standing in with them its kind of easier to pick up an odd case of whisky and say nothing than to give us the office and have a firestick shoved into your granary im not counting too much on the ontario man  in the meanwhile the others fretted at the cold and wondered how long the outlaws meant to keep them waiting two of them upon whom all the rest depended for the warning were just then crouching almost frozen where the thinnest of the birches broke off abruptly watching a group of vague shadowy shapes moving in their direction across the white wilderness gallwey stood behind them a bank of sombre cloud sailed across the moon and left the watchers in almost utter darkness  i can make out four and there are more behind said the trooper its a sure thing snows deep and as we figured theyll stick to the trail guess youd better get back and tell the sergeant  gallwey slipped away and there was silence for several minutes while farmer and policeman crept a little further back amidst the trees then a soft patter of hoofs and an occasional rattle came up the bitter wind as a line of men and horses grew into shape they came on boldly the men growling to one another and at the beasts with no outriders forward they plunged into the shadow of the birches there the sounds grew louder and the thud of hoofs hoarse voices crackle of trodden twigs and creaking and jolting of burdens on packsaddles rang startlingly distinct through the crisp air the trooper counted at least a dozen horses but he could not quite make out how many men for they walked among the loaded beasts and the trail was very dark  they went on by halfseen dim shadows that jostled one another among the trees and when the voices and the trampling grew less distinct the trooper moved out into the trail with his carbine in his mittened hands the trap was sprung for if one or two of the outlaws succeeded in breaking through it was evident that they must at least leave their beasts behind with the farmer close behind him he moved cautiously a little nearer his comrades and then stood still again  it was perhaps five minutes later when leland who was pacing to and fro stopped abruptly and held up his hand as the young trooper materialised out of the gloom in front of him  cant you hear something he said  the trooper thought he could but his ears were almost covered by the big fur cap and whilst they stood listening the birches swayed and wailed before a bitter gust it seemed to search them to the marrow for the cold was keen as a knife then through the night there came a dull thudding sound down from the ridge above and the trooper flung his carbine forward  theyre here sure he said its even chances we dont get a whack at one of them  they stood listening for a minute or two intent and highstrung and heard only the wailing of the wind for the birches once more swayed about them it was almost dark for the moon was still behind a cloud as he moved his mittened hands on the marlin rifle leland forgot that he was stiff in every limb then a voice rang harsh and commanding out of the shadows above them  stop right there it said we have got you covered  it was followed by the whiplike crack of a pistolshot there was the louder jarring ring of a carbine or a farmers rifle and a confused din broke out men shouted and scuffled in the gloom loaded beasts blundered among the trees and the undergrowth while through it all there rose the detached beat of hoofs  one or two of them lit out anyway said the trooper guess theyd slash the pack lariat and get into the saddle when theyd let the whisky go that sounds like one of the boys after them chancing a gallop too theyll break their necks certain if they ride that way through the bluff  he stopped a minute and just then a faint silvery radiance swept athwart the birches as the moon shone down it sparkled on the dropping smear of snowsheeted trail and the lad ran forward a pace or two fumbling with his carbine  look out mr leland he shouted there are two of them riding slap down on us  two indistinct objects swept out of the shadows and a moment later resolved themselves into men and galloping horses they were thundering headlong down the sharply falling trail and leland felt his nerves tingle as he watched them he was in a particularly unpleasant temper that night and the prospect of an encounter stirred the halffrozen blood in him he glanced over his shoulder and saw the trooper standing a few paces away from him and then fixed his gaze up the trail ahead the horsemen were coming on at a mad gallop taking their chances of a stumble and he could see the powdery snow whirl about them like dust then they saw him standing grimly still in the middle of the trail for one shouted a warning to the other and the trooper cried aloud  hold on pull up before we plug you he said  there was no answer the riders were hard and fearless men probably wanted by montana sheriffs for things they had done during the cattle war and they showed no sign of drawing bridle one of them howled shrilly as he whirled a whip about his shoulders and for a moment leland saw him sway in the saddle with the beast stretched out beneath him  then there was a flash and a detonation he scarcely heard a cloud of smoke that floated up the trail and man and horse came thundering down on him he felt the jar of the marlin rifle on his shoulder as he aimed at the flying form of a horse in another moment the outlaw was almost upon him then in savage recklessness he leapt forward instead of back with a hand that sought the bridle and an arm the riders leg his fingers closed on somethingbridle or saddle or stirrupand he clung with a stiffened grasp while his feet were torn from under him and a rifle flashed  exactly what happened after that he did not know but he was hurled forward still clutching at something with feet that scraped the snowy ice of the creek and then there was a heavy crash and what he held was torn away from him he felt himself driven into a bank of snow and lay there for perhaps a minute wondering vaguely if the life had all been smashed out of him and listening to a sound of scuffling and floundering close by next he essayed to draw one of his feet up and to his astonishment found that he had no great difficulty in accomplishing it that done he raised himself shakily and scrambling to one of the birches leaned against it gasping a little a few seconds earlier he had been almost certain that he would never stand up again  in the meanwhile the moonlight had grown a trifle brighter for he could see a horse that lay near the middle of the creek still moving convulsively nearby wrapped in an old fur coat was an object that did not move at all the trooper who now had no carbine stood stooping a little as he looked down on it and there was a curious significant stillness in his attitude whilst as much as could be seen of his young face appeared a trifle colourless it was a moment or two before he became aware that leland was on his feet again  hes dead sure its the first man i ever plugged he said and his voice rang strained and harsh in the frosty air he just pitched off and never moved guess it couldnt have hurt him  one could have fancied he was anxious about the point but in another moment he turned away with a little deprecatory gesture and commenced to grope about for his carbine  anyway i couldnt help it and it was that quickhe never wriggled anyhe couldnt have felt it  the thing had its effect on leland though he had seen something very like it happen before and he laid his hand reassuringly on the lads shoulder  i dont think you need worry he said he took his chances when he wouldnt stop and its not your responsibility anyway we may as well make quite sure that he is dead  there was no doubt on that point when he dropped on one knee beside the man and he nodded as he glanced at the trooper  a sure thing id like some kind of notion of what happened he said  you jumped at him yonder but i didnt quite see what you got hold of anyway you went along with the horseand himuntil i pulled off and you all came down together you went down on the ice with a bang most fit to break it and then into the snowbank yonder guess you plugged the horse in a soft place when you fired in the meanwhile the other man went bywhoopinglike a whirlwind  that was about all the explanation leland ever got but in another moment or two the trooper who seemed to be looking at him curiously spoke again  im kind of dazed he said theres quite a lot of blood running down your forehead ive been watching and it never struck me youd better know ill go up now and tell the sergeant bout the other fellow who lit out  leland who thrust back his fur cap and felt the gash on his forehead decided that he was a little confused too or he would have noticed that there was a warm trickle running down the outside of his nose his mittens showed red smears in the moonlight when he tried to brush it away when he next looked round the trooper had disappeared and moving rather shakily for his fall had not been without its effect he too plodded up the climbing trail  when he reached the level he found several dejected men with manacled hands and a line of loaded horses with two of the troopers watching them the sergeant who appeared to be giving instructions to one of the troopers turned to him  we have got four of them and most of the horses but so far as i can figure two or three must have got away he said the boys will try to pick their tracks up and ill ask you to give us a hand with the packhorses as far as the forking of the trail  leland contrived to drive two of the loaded train though his head was aching and he felt very dizzy when at last he was about to turn off into a second sledgetrack the sergeant pulled up his horse beside him  we are much obliged mr leland and youll hear all thats done he said still its a kind of pity one of the two you fell in with got away  i dont suppose you are particularly pleased any of them broke through for that matter said leland  the sergeant made a little impressive gesture the point is that theyd both have got off if it hadnt been for you and that fellows partner isnt going to blamethe trooper thats all in the business well if i were you id keep clear of the bluffs and ravines if you have to go out when its dark  he shook his bridle and rode on whilst leland stood a minute or two watching the others straggle out along the trail last of all a trooper led a horse which carried an amorphous burden wrapped in a fur coat and lashed on with a packlariat something that looked like a moccasined foot trailed down on one side in the snow and judging from the trouble the beast gave its driver it did not like what it carried  its quite likely that fellows partner will try to get even he said     chapter xi  seedtime   the snow had gone and the frostbleached prairie lay steaming under the warm april sun when carrie leland pulled her team up on the crest of a low rise the waggon she drove a light vehicle of four high wheels with a shallow boxlike body had been made especially for her it was hung on comfortable springs and the harness and horses matched it there were few broncho teams on the prairie to compare with hers they were young but carrie liked a mettlesome beast and leland had carefully chosen and broken them  it was the same with everything he had given her only the best that could be had seemed good enough for her and at times she almost resented his generosity save when he lost his temper which happened not infrequently she could not put him in the wrong and she often felt that it would be easier for her if she could charge him with neglect or had something to forgive him he was gravely considerate for her comfort but it was very seldom that he went any further while this should have pleased her she was not quite sure that it did  on the morning in question eveline annersly who had been at prospect a month now sat beside her rejoicing in the sunshine and rush of warm wind she had reached the age when one looks for little and makes the most of what comes and the warmth and freshness of the morning delighted her the prospect would also in all probability have had its attractions for any one with eyes to see and a nature that could respond to the reawakening pulse of life in the land  round threefourths of the horizon the bleached prairie tinged now with sunny ochre melted into the sweep of lustrous blue but in the foreground the sod was gemmed with little crocuslike flowers and already flecked here and there with creeping green all this was waste and virgin but on the fourth side tall bands of golden stubble and belts of ashes where golden stubble had once been were narrowed down by the steaming chocolatetinted clods of the ploughs upturning grain ran up in long rippled ridges from prospect where the birches gleamed silver across the wide dip of basin and over its fringing rise into the luminous blueness of the sky that was mans work and man at prospect worked unusually hard for it was not his part there to plough where others had also sown but to grapple with the wilderness and subdue it in fulfilment of the charge given him when the waters dried the wilderness was there leagues of it but it required a stout heart and a steadfast toil to break it and cover it with redgold wheat when wheat was a drug upon a falling market  eveline annersly faded and frail was dainty still as she sat smiling in the waggon with the sunlight lying warm on her beautiful hands she was a part of the colour scheme in her soft greytinted draperies some women of the cities would have been a blotch on it she was the figure of tranquil autumn when the wealth of fruits had gone but her companion with the crimson lips and dusky eyes was spring when as yet nature is only stirring and has not awakened to riotous life at the burning kiss of the sun eveline annersly realised this vaguely and at times felt a thrill of concern for she knew there was fire beneath that cold exterior when the awakening should come much would depend upon whether the sudden untrammelled growth of the girls nature would cling for warmth and shelter to the man who was her husband  in the meanwhile she watched the toiling teams coming on across grey grass and golden stubble in echelon men sat above the horses heads on the drivingseats of the big gangploughs and from amidst the curling brown clods came the twinkling flash of steel the men had brown faces and some of them bare brown arms sun and wind had burned and beaten them and their garments to the colour of the soil they sprang from they seemed almost a part of it as they and the patient beasts did their share in the great harmonious scheme which in return for the sweat of effort gives man bread to eat this was not english farming mixed and variable but an unlocking of natures longstored wealth in milelong furrows that should fling the golden wheat by trainload and shipload on the markets of the world even eveline annersly who was not greatly interested in agriculture could realise that  it is a tremendous farm she said we have nothing like it in england the length of those furrows appeals to ones imagination how big is it carrie  the girl smiled a trifle languidly i really dont know she said charley has told me but i never could remember things like that he seems rather proud of having brokeni believe that is the right wordmost of it out of the prairie in fact he is easily content to break so many acres every year seems his one object in life i dont think its anybodys presumably its a question of temperament my husband appears to like his occupation and absorbs himself in it  which of course is just as you would have it  the girl made a little halfpetulant gesture oh she said i suppose so i naturally did not expect charley leland and i would have many mutual interests when i married him it would have been in several respects a trifle ridiculous still he is in his own way very good to me  so i should have fancied and eveline annerslys eyes twinkled did it ever occur to you that he might have expected a good deal from you  a flicker of colour showed in carries cheek in that case he at least shows no sign that he misses anything as you know we scarcely see him for two or three days together every now and then i believe these teams are in the field by six in the morning and it usually is dark when he comes in again  i wonder if you quite realise the restraint and selfdenial implied by a life of that kind after all your husband is probably no fonder of wearing himself out than most other men presumably he has a purpose or finds it necessary  she stopped a moment and smiled in a curious fashion as she glanced at her companion i suppose you have heard that they are building a new peachhouse and vinery at barrockholme  a bright crimson spot burned for a moment in carries cheek i hadnt she said with a trace of bitterness jimmy of course never writes and even alice seems to have forgotten me in fact i dont suppose there is one of them who ever gives me a thought now aunt eveline you are to stay here for ever so long  mrs annersly nodded reassuringly of course my dear she said as you perhaps know it is a good deal your fathers fault that i am reduced to living on my friends and i really think some of the money he is spending on the peachhouses should have come to me i have been inclined to wonder where he got it  carrie denham was usually reposeful but a trace of the confusion she felt showed itself in her face eveline annersly understood her as well as she understood herself and being aware of this she stood less upon her guard  oh she said i think you know it is a little hard to bear isnt it have they always been the same  one would almost fancy so henry annersly was well off when he married me and everybody knows i have scarcely a penny where the rest has gone only branscombe denham knows though im not even sure that he does no doubt he didnt intend to lose it but money wont stay with him and he never even writes to you  carrie laid a hand upon her arm aunt she said stay with us altogether charley likes youand i cant let you go  the little ladys eyes grew gentle but there was a faint smile in them my dear i think i know what you are feeling but after all you deserve it and im not so very sorry for you im going to make your husband stop and speak to me  their team stood stamping impatiently on the virgin sod as leland came up foremost of the long line of men and beasts he was sitting upright on the drivingseat of a great machine dressed in an old bluejean shirt that was open at his sunburnt throat with a wide grey hat on his head his arms were bare to the elbow corded hard and brown and his face was the deep colour of the clods that rolled away in long waves beneath the threefold shares four splendid horses plodded in front of him and the stain of the soil and the same stamp of enduring strength was on him and them he pulled the team up and springing down came towards the waggon with his hat in his hand  you are going to the railroad he said  yes said mrs annersly carrie wants some things but i understand we are to stay the night at mrs custers on the way  well said leland i may see you there there are some new harrows and seeders i have to wire about but i dont expect to get in until daylight tomorrow  you are going to drive all night  i may get an hours sleep before i go you see i have to be back by noon tomorrow our summer is short and there is a good deal to do the grain that goes in late is quite often frozen  he pointed as if in explanation to the great sweep of furrows that ran back narrowing all the way to where prospect nestled like a dolls house beneath its bluff with a great trampling two other teams came up just then they went by amidst a ripping and crackling of fibres as the prairie opened up beneath the gleaming shares and leland nodded with a little quiet smile  oh yes he said little time to do it in and a good deal to do some of us were born to feel that way  not all said eveline annersly there are as you know men who waste their substance to while the day away you are not that sort perhaps its fortunate for you  leland smiled again i dont quite know theres a great order and system that runs things though i cant quite get the hang of iti havent time every man works in this country as all nature does those little grasses have been ten thousand years building up the black loam im making wheat of the mallard the brent goose and the sandhill craneyou can see them coming up from the south in their skeins and wedges all day longhave to hunt their food from the shores of the caribbean to the pole well one feels there must be a balance struck some day and the men who dont do anything are having the soft things now  he laughed goodhumouredly and stroked one of the horses that turned its head to nibble affectionately at his shoulder ill be sorry for this by and by but you have a habit of making me give myself away  then we will be practical are you going to sow all that ploughing  i am i expect to break two hundred acres more there are folks who want the wheat and well feed the world some day  but wheat is going down  it is and lelands face grew a trifle hard no bottom to the market apparently thats why im buying new machines and cutting things down and down we must have everything that can save or earn a dollar at prospect now  carrie leland was struck by something in her husbands face it was a comely face as well as forceful cleanskinned in spite of its deepness of tint and there was a clearness in the steady eyes that is only seen in those of such men as he there was also in his features a suggestion of endurance and optimism that in fact was strongest in the time of stress and struggle sun and wind fruitful soil and barren nipping frosts drought and devastating hail all these were things to be grappled with or profited by with equal willingness he and his kind in new countries give without stint all they have been given from the sweat of tense effort each and every day to the smiling courage that cuts down hours of rest and goes on sowing when seasons are adverse and markets fall away and there is in turn usually set upon them plainly the symbol of mans dominion over the material world the patient beasts that toiled with him recognised it and again one of them muzzled his shoulder and caught at his arm  and said mrs annersly if the market still goes down  leland laughed an optimists soft laugh then we will go under i and the rest that is for a time nothing can stop us long and we will start again carrie i am thankful is provided for  he struck the horse with the palm of his hand i have been keeping you and there is a good deal to do  the big team stamped and strained he swung himself into the drivingseat and with a crackling of fibres the great plough rolled away mrs annersly smiled as carrie shook the reins  if i were twenty years younger i almost think i should fall in love with your husband she said there is a breadth of view and forcefulness reggie urmston could never attain even in his simplicity and his egotism becomes him its the quiet assurance of a man who knows what he can do and rather thinks that he is doing a good bit he takes all the risk and you are provided for carrie do you know what that man gave or lentits much the same thingto your father  no said carrie with the spot of colour once more in her cheek he would never tell me and how could i ask him it is a hateful subjectwhy should you mention it  mrs annersly looked out over the prairie a curious smile in her eyes  your husband is cutting down even his hours of sleep she said he is driving in forty miles to the railroad when his work is done tonight while branscombe denham is building peachhouses at barrockholme  carrie flushed crimson and flicked the team with the whip you she said are the only friend i have and yet you sometimes take a curious pleasure in tormenting me do you expect me to turn against my own flesh and blood  we have it on good authority that the wife should cleave to her husband and they are one there are of course people nowadays and probably always have been who think they know better  the girl caught her breath ah she said you dont quite understand if he were in difficulties i would face them with him cheerfully but he would never let me it was not said in bitterness but when he told you i was provided for it hurt me why should i be safe who helped to ruin him  eveline annersly glanced at her with gravely questioning eyes my dear i rather fancy you have almost thrown a great treasure away  whether the thing was of great value i do not know and it is scarcely likely i shall ever know i certainly threw it just as far as i was able to and though i do not know whether i was wise or not it is done and there is no use in being sorry  then she swung the whip again and sent the light waggon flying headlong down a long grassy slope mrs annersly found it advisable to hold on and in any case she had said her say her words must lie with the rest she had dropped until in due time they should bear their fruit eveline annersly was old enough to be somewhat of an optimist too  in the meanwhile leland went on with his ploughing and save for an hours halt at noon to rest the teams and for the six oclock supper toiled until a wondrous green transparency through which the pale stars peeped hung over the prairie then when the cold clear air was invigorating as wine he led the weary beasts to the stables and after walking stiffly to the homestead flung himself into a chair aching and drowsy  jake he said to the man who was busy in the room ill want some coffee in an hour or so make it black and strong  then gallwey came in and they sat for an hour going over a file of accounts from which leland made extracts on a sheet he laid it down at last and pointed to a bundle of papers on a dusty shelf  i was worrying over them before i slept last night and im no wiser now he said the one thing certain is that wheat is going down and what it will touch next harvest is rather more than any man can tell one has too many climates from california to new zealand to reckon with if we stop right now and sow wed come out just clear as the market stands i had expected to have quite a pile in hand but with the drop in values the bank balance against me needed considerable meeting  it certainly did i was a trifle astonished when you cabled me to arrange for the credit at winnipeg you were in view of your usual habits singularly extravagant for once  i was and leland laughed somewhat harshly still under the circumstances it wasnt quite unnatural anyway we have wiped it out and it has crippled me for the next campaign  gallwey asked no injudicious questions but he wondered how his comrade who had distinctly inexpensive tastes had got rid of all the money he had apparently spent in england mrs leland was not an extravagant woman so far as he was aware  the question is how we should meet a further drop he said  thats not very difficult unless the drop is too big we have for fixed charges the upkeep of this homestead besides wages and the feeding of the boys we cant do without and the working horses thats not going to alter more than a little anyway well we have the seed and there are broken horses on the run so its going to cost us just a few teamsters wages and the threshing to put oats in on as many extra acres as we can break you see we get a bigger crop on much the same cost  and the fall breaking  wheat said leland every acre  gallwey drew in his breath he knew his comrades boldness but this was almost incredible cautious men were already holding their hand but leland purposed to sow more freely than ever  it will be a huge crop he said about the biggest that was ever raised in this country now of course within a margin theres a good deal in your notion in increasing the ratio of production to dead charges but after all you cant sow a third as much again without its costing you something well if the price drops far enough to make that a loss  leland laughed again then he said it will be one of the biggest smashes ever known in this country but nobodys going to lose very much when theyve taken the land and stock from me its tolerably steep chances but theyre all on me  gallweys uneasiness showed itself in his face the magnitude of the risk almost dismayed him but while he sat silent leland made a little gesture  tell jake to bring that coffee in and see the waggons ready he said ill be off and let the team go easy theyll put me on to the wire at the depot at five oclock when the stopping freight comes through i should be back by noon youll start every man as usual  he drank the bitter coffee to keep himself awake and climbed into his waggon while gallwey shook his head as he watched him jolt away into the shadowy prairie  its a big thing almost too big for any other man he said it was the confounded bank balance against him that drove him into it i wonder how he spent all that money or if mrs leland knows     chapter xii  lelands protest   there were two breakfasts served in the occidental hotel which dilapidated and weatherscarred stands at the foot of the unpaved street of a desolate little town beside the railroad track most men commence their work early in the prairie country so the first meal was laid at six but there was another from eight to nine when a train came in this was a somewhat unusual concession to the needs of the few passengers who alighted there because throughout most of the northwest no selfrespecting hotel cook would prepare a meal out of the fixed hours not even for a cabinet minister or a railroad director nor would the proprietor vary a dish for in his estimation what suffices the plainsman is quite good enough for anybody else  the table had just been cleared when a small and select company of men who had nothing in particular to do pulled their chairs up to the stove on which as many of them as could find room put their feet it had not been lighted that morning or blackleaded for many days but habit was strong in them there are even in countries where most men are hard workers a few who spend their lives lounging on hotel verandahs and sitting round the stove nobody unused to it would in all probability have cared to linger there for there are few places of entertainment so wholly desolate and uninviting as the general room of the average prairie hotel  its walls were obviously made of dressed boards and had even borne a coat of paint at one time but they were bare and dirty now two lonely german oleographs of more than usually barbaric type hung on rusty nails cigarends and burnt matches littered the uncarpeted floor benches without backs to them ran along either side of the uncovered table the rest of the furniture consisted of the rusty stove and a few chairs which the loungers monopolised two of the group wore storeclothing with trousers so tight that one wondered how they ever got them on and two wore blue jean in sad need of patching they had rough dark faces relieved by no sign of amiability or unusual intelligence but they could talk loafers and tramps usually can  outside the open window bright sunshine flooded the verandah and fell upon the bare framehouses across the way a couple of light waggons with the mire of the spring thawing not yet washed off them passed clattering and jolting among the ruts the streets of a prairie town usually resemble a morass when the frost breaks up when they had gone a police trooper swung by on a spumeflecked horse with the dust of several leagues journey thick on his trim uniform then there was silence again until one of the loungers looked up from the greasy paper he was reading  wheat still going down he said theres no bottom to the market or if it had one its dropped out our boss farmers are going to feel it if things go on like this but nobodys going to be sorry for them they figure they own the country already  i hear leland of prospect is ploughing the same as if wheat was going up said another man  the third of the party shook his pipe out and pursed up his face which was not an attractive one into an expression of pitying contempt  lelands a blame fool and always was he said i once worked for him its the way the market went with him made him what he is that and nothing else  whyd you quit prospect jasper asked the remaining comrade and the others grinned  a vindictive gleam crept into the mans eyes well he said ive no use for being bossed by that kind of man and one day i up and told him what i thought of him there was considerable trouble before i walked out anyway between the market and the english girl hes married hes fixed just now  shes flinging his money away asked somebody  with both hands and too stuck on herself to be civil to him theyre made like that in the old country lelands no more to her than the hired man one of the boys told me  well whyd she marry him  for his money thats a good enough reason and its quite likely there was another one girls like her have got to marry somebody over there and the men with money are kind of particular i guess its not astonishing if you got hold of an english paper its full of their goingson  thats all right said one of the others in tight storeclothes still until theyre married theyve got to be careful afterwards it dont so much matter unless alls quite straight buyers hold off and the figure comes down  its quite easy guessing thats what was wrong with mrs leland what else would a girl with her looks make sure of him for charley leland comes along with his money and they plant her right on to him its even betting she goes off with another man if the market breaks him  he stopped abruptly as his neighbour drove an elbow into his ribs and his mouth gaped open as he dropped his feet from the stove then the others moved uneasily in their chairs for a man stood in the doorway regarding them with a singularly unpleasant smile  stand right up jasper youhog he said  jasper sat still glancing at the others as though he felt that while none of them appeared in any haste to do so it was their duty to support him until one evidently remembered that there were after all four of them  hes sitting where he is charley leland he said nobody asked you to hang round listening and if you dont like our talk you can go outside again  leland showed no sign of having heard him get up he said and tell them youre a liar  jasper sat still he was tolerably active and muscular or he would never have worked at prospect but there was a dangerous look in lelands eyes his quiet incisiveness was portentous realising that his comrades expected something of him jasper managed to retort  oh go home he said i guess youve plenty of trouble there without making any here  in another moment leland had crossed the room and swung him to his feet nobody was very clear about what happened during the next few seconds there is however a certain animal courage in every man who has lived by bodily toil and jasper who had also a vindictive temper did all he could when he had once felt lelands hand he clinched with him and reeling locked together they fell with a crash against the table and overturned one of the benches then gasping panting floundering and striking when they could they went swaying towards the door while jaspers friends howled encouragingly and men attracted by the uproar ran out of the opposite store foot by foot they neared the verandah and when leland gasping with passion made a supreme effort they staggered out into it  there was a crowd below it now and they set up a shout as lelands grasp sank lower down the other mans hollowing back jasper it seemed was not altogether a favourite of theirs after that there was silence for another moment or two while the two men swayed and strained with scuffling feet until one of them suddenly relaxed his hold and reeling backwards plunged down the verandah stairway he struck a rail as he did it and overturning came down headlong in the unpaved street somebody dragged him to his feet and he stood still a moment hatless with the dust upon his flushed face and his jacket rent gasping with futile rage then he slunk away through the gap that was opened up for him  leland leant somewhat heavily on the rails above the veins were swollen on his forehead blood trickled down his chin from one of his bleeding lips and his face was dark with rage altogether he was not exactly an attractive spectacle raising himself stiffly he disappeared into the hotel from which three other men made their way with as much haste as was compatible with any show of dignity a light waggon had stopped unnoticed just outside the crowd  a few minutes earlier carrie leland and mrs annersly had driven across the railroad track on their way to the drygoods store and as the waggon jolted in the ruts the girl pointed to the town with a little gesture of repugnance  could one well imagine anything less attractive than this she said still i believe the desolate place is looked upon as a rising city and they are actually proud of it  eveline annersly glanced up the single street with a twinkle in her eyes it somewhat resembled a ploughed field though the ruts and ridges the wheels had made were crumbling into dust above it ran a rickety sidewalk of planks by means of which foot passengers could escape the mire in spring and crude framehouses destitute of paint or any attempt at adornment rose from that in turn the fronts of most of them were carried sufficiently high to hide the pitch of sloped roof so that they resembled squares of timber pierced by little windows above the topmost of the latter there usually ran a blatant but halfobliterated commendation of the wares sold within for in the rising prairie town every house is as a rule either a store or a hotel  well she said one could scarcely call it picturesque but we have colliery and other industrial villages at home that are not very far behind it  carrie laughed still we have the grace to attempt to justify them on the score of necessity while they hold this place up as a model and a sign of progress it is a barbarous country  including prospect too  of course still prospect makes no pretence of civilisation it is part of the prairie and nobody could expect much from it  or of those who dwell in it  a little tinge of colour showed in the girls cheek well she said with faint scorn i dont mind admitting that too they are a distinctly primitive people  mrs annersly said nothing further she had her fancies respecting the reason for the girls bitterness and did not think that her marriage accounted for all of it this was in a way as she would have it she sat silent until carrie pulled the team up close to the drygoods store a crowd was collecting in front of it and they could get no further while they sat there a clamour broke out and amidst a sound of scuffling two men reeled across the verandah of the hotel opposite them their faces were not at first visible and carrie smiled contemptuously when the crowd encouraged them as they grappled with each other  that she said is evidently considered the correct thing when western gentlemen have a difference of opinion you will notice that nobody makes any attempt to put an end to it after all since they cannot keep their brutality under restraint there is something to be said for the use of pistols  in another moment one of the men brought his fist down with a dull thud upon the others halfconcealed face and a little spark of scornful anger crept into the girls eyes  it is a little disgusting but we cannot get on without driving over somebody and it would be a trifle absurd to have to go away again she said what brutes men of their kind are  still there is something to admire in their brutality said her companion that man has both lips cut open one would have fancied the blow would have stunned him but he seems to be disregarding it and is holding on  she stopped a moment with a little catching of her breath ah she said there will be no more of it  one of the men loosed his hold and reeled down the stairway then for the first time they saw the face of the other clearly as he leant upon the rails it was not wholly pleasant to look at for there was passion in it and blood trickled from the swollen lips carries hands tightened convulsively on the reins as she urged the team forward her cheeks were almost colourless but she met eveline annerslys eyes steadily and her voice had a bitter ring in it  yes she said it is my husband no doubt his comrades would expect me to be pleased with him  she stopped a moment and pulled the team up again i wonder if you can guess what it will cost me to go into that store but i am going after all it would be a little absurd for charley lelands wife to be particular  mrs annerslys face was compassionate my dear she said he had probably a reason for it  of course said carrie languidly no doubt they differed over the points of a steer or one of them was too attentive to the waitingmaid i believe they have two at the occidental  she swung herself down ignoring the hand of a man who had seized the reins and when mrs annersly had descended went into the big store she was perfectly conscious that everybody was watching her but she made her purchases with a cold serenity and then drove away she did not inquire for leland and was unaware that the object on the verge of the prairie was his waggon had she known it she would have held her team in a little for she had not the least desire to overtake him this however was scarcely likely for it was a long way to prospect and she intended to break the journey for an hour or so at an outlying farm to which the trail turned off in a league or two  in the meanwhile leland drove on as fast as his weary team could go until he reached the crossing of the ravine where sergeant grier had waylaid the outlaws the trail dipped in sharp twists between the birches into the hollow and he had raised himself a trifle on the drivingseat to swing the team round a bend when one side of the waggon dropped suddenly beneath him in another moment he went out headlong and coming down heavily on his shoulder lay as he fell half dazed for a time when he pulled his scattered senses together he saw that the team had stopped and that one of the waggon wheels lay not far away from him he rose with difficulty feeling very sore and very dizzy but finding that he could walk picked the wheel up the brass cap of the hub had gone and so had the nut which locked the bush on the axle he had put a new one on not long before and felt sure it had not come off of itself as he remembered how tightly it had fitted still it was evident that if anybody had loosened it the sudden strain upon the wheels as the waggon swung round the bend might have jarred it off even after it had held that far  that question could wait rolling the wheel downhill he attempted to put it on the hub an unloaded prairie waggon is usually so light that a strong man can lift one side of it but leland was badly shaken by his fall indeed he sat down more than once gasping and dripping with perspiration before he accomplished it it was a mighty task for any man to attempt after a long days ploughing a night spent upon the trail and a sixtymile drive  although he was bothered with a distressing headache and found that a branch had scored his cheek nevertheless when he had fitted on another nut from the toolbox in the waggon he drove ahead reaching prospect almost as worn out as the team still after a bite of food he climbed up into the drivingseat of the big gangplough summer is short in the northwest and the wheat that goes in late runs a risk of freezing so he needed in his struggle the efforts of every man he could get he drove the threefold furrow through the ripping sod until at last the copper sun dipped below the prairies verge then leaving his team to the men he went back to the house too weary to carry himself erect the birches swayed in a cold green transparency the crisp air had vim in it but the weary man noticed nothing as he plodded heavyeyed through the crackling stubble  he had just finished his lonely supper and was sitting dressed as when he came in with the dust of the journey on him and smears of the soil upon his heavy boots and leggings when his wife who apparently did not know he was there entered the room she started a little as she saw him and leland drowsily raised his hand to the raw red scar on his face he had not remembered that his lips were twice their natural size and very unpleasant to look at though they pained him  it doesnt amount to much he said deprecatingly ive been too busy to fix it i got thrown out of my waggon  carrie became rigidly erect a sparkle of indignation in her eyes  that is really a little unnecessary she said coldly i didnt presume to trouble you with any inquiries  leland looked at her as though puzzled with halfclosed eyes they wouldnt have been unnatural in the case of a man who was flung headlong out of his waggon  one excuse will no doubt serve as well as another the difficulty is that i happen to have some idea as to how you got your injuries  the man rose wearily i have the pleasure of telling you that i was thrown out coming down the ravine  and i said carrie coldly was at the settlement at the time you furnished everybody with that interesting spectacle on the hotel verandah i dont wish to be unduly fastidious but hitherto so far as i know at least you have not taken the trouble to deceive me wilfully  leland turned towards her with his cut lips pressed together and his scarred face grim and hard making a little gesture of weariness  well he said i guess it doesnt matter i dont suppose i could make you think anything but hard of me  he stopped a minute and then laughed i have faced the world alone so far and held my own with it i suppose there is no reason why i shouldnt go on doing it  i believe that is after all what most men have to do said carrie i shall endeavour to be as small a burden on you as i can manage  then she turned and left him but as had happened on other occasions her heart smote her in spite of her anger for he looked shaken and very weary and lonely in the big desolate room     chapter xiii  carrie abases herself   the warm spring day was over in that land of contrasts where there is no slow melting of season into season it is often hot while the last snowdrifts linger in the shadows of the bluffs carrie and mrs annersly were sitting by an open window of carries sittingroom the sun had gone but as usual at that season a filmy curtain of green overhung the vast sweep of prairie that had shaken off its hues of white and grey for the first faint colour of spring above hung a pale sickle moon and down the long slope over which the harrowtorn furrows ran lines of men and weary teams were plodding home round the rest of that half of the horizon the prairie melted into the distance imperceptiblyvast mysterious shadowy under a great tense silencewhile the little chilled breeze that came up had in it the properties of an elixir  the thinfaced woman who lay in carries big chair was not looking at the prairie she had watched the pageant of the seasons too often before and to her and her husband they had usually meant only a variation in the ceaseless struggle which had left its mark on both of them in that country man has to contend with drought and harvest frost and devastating hail for it is only by mighty effort and long endurance that the western farmer wrests his bare living from the soil when seasons are adverse and they frequently are a heavy share of the burden falls upon the woman too  mrs custer had borne hers patiently but her face which still showed traces of refinement was worn and her hands and wrists were rough and red while thomas custer toiled out in the frost and sunshine from early dawn to dusk to profit by the odd fat year or more often if it might by feverish work be done to make his losses good she cooked and washed and baked for him and the boys a term that locally signifies every male attached to the homestead she had also made her own dresses as well as some of her husbands clothes and darned and patched the latter with cotton flourbags yet the ceaseless struggle had not embittered her though it had left her weary perhaps it is the sunshine or something in the clean cold airs from the vast spaces of the wilderness for man holds fast to his faith and courage in that land of cloudless skies  it was the rich dark curtains the soft carpet ones feet sank into the dainty furniture the odds and ends of silver and the few good etchings at which the faded woman glanced with wistful appreciation she had been accustomed to such things once but that was long ago and she had never seen on the prairie anything like carrie lelands room with a wee contented smile she turned to the girl  it was so good of you to have me here although if toms sister from traverse hadnt promised to look after him i couldnt have come she said it is three years since i have been away and to know that one has nothing to do for a whole week is almost too delightful now  eveline annerslys eyes twinkled im rather afraid that some of us have that consolation if it is one all our lives she said they keep you busy at the range  from morning to night and now we must work harder than ever with one of the boys in montreal and wheat going down one feels inclined to wonder sometimes if the folks who buy our cheap flour would think so much of the quarterdollar on the sack if they knew what it costs us  she stopped a moment with a little wistful smile im afraid this is going to be a particularly lean year for a good many of us last year i was busy though i had a scandinavian maid but i shall be singlehanded now and the grocery bill must come down too its quite hard to pare it any closer when everything you take off means extra work and with it all the boys must be fed  mrs annersly glanced at carrie who for some reason did not meet her gaze  i think you mentioned that you came from montreal she said you must have found it very different on the prairie  i certainly did i had never done anything useful or been without all the money i wanted when i married tom custer who had gone out a year earlier my friends were against it and they would probably have been more so had they seen the range as it was then the house had three rooms to it and one was built of sod while all the first summer the rain ran in still we made out together and got on little by little struggling for everything a new stove or set of indurated ware meant weeks of selfdenial now i seem to have been pinching a lifetime though i am only forty but tom was always kind and i do not think i have ever been sorry  she lay still nestling luxuriously in the softly padded chair and through her worn face and hard hands the blurred stamp of refinement once more shone it was twenty years since she had turned away from the brighter side of life and though she did not expect compassion eveline annersly felt sorry for her there was also a certain thoughtfulness in carrie lelands expression which seemed to suggest that a comparison was forced upon her both of them realised that the wilderness is not subdued without a cost woman it seemed had her part in the tense struggle too and mrs custer was one of the many of whom it can be said they also serve  have you ever been home since you were married asked carrie  once said mrs custer with a faint shadow in her face i never went again the others were not the same or perhaps i had changed for they did not seem to understand me my younger sisters were growing up and they thought only of dances sleighrides and nights on the tobogganslides as i suppose i did once my dresses looked dowdy beside theirs too and they told me i was getting too serious i felt myself a stranger in the house where i was born one it seems loses touch so soon  again she stopped and laughed one night something was said that hurt me and i think i lay awake and cried for hours as i realised that i could never quite bridge the gulf that had opened up between the rest and me then i remembered that tom who had worked harder than ever to raise the wheat that sent me there wanted me alwaysand i went back to him  her voice fell a little and carrie was touched by the faint thrill in it she had seen thomas custer a plain somewhat hardfeatured and silent man and yet this woman who she fancied had once been almost beautiful had willingly worn out her freshness in coarse labour for him then a tiny flush crept into her face as she remembered that she too had a husband one who gave her everything and for whom she seldom had even a smile she was not innately selfish indeed she had shown herself capable of sacrifice as she sat unobserved in the growing shadow she sighed she wondered whether they still remembered her at barrockholme for if they did they had seldom written and she reflected sadly that she had not mrs custers consolation since there was nobody else who wanted her  you really believe this is going to be a lean year she said  i am afraid so still it is scarcely likely to trouble you except that your husband will have a good deal to face tom isnt sure he was wise in sowing so much with wheat going down and it seems he considered it necessary to quarrel with the rustlers too they are rather vindictive people and its a little astonishing they have left him alone though tom thinks they or their friends had something to do with what happened to his waggon he met him driving home the day he was thrown out and told me that charley who had evidently had a bad fall looked very shaky  carrie started he was thrown out of his waggon  of course didnt he tell you well perhaps he would be afraid of its worrying you it would be like charley leland and here i have been giving him away  carrie was troubled by an unpleasant sense of confusion as she remembered that her husband had really told her and what her attitude had been but mrs custer had more to say  charley leland is going to have his hands full this year the fall in wheat is bad enough and it is quite likely the rustlers will make trouble for him then he must fall out with a man at the settlement who tom says is in league with them perhaps i shouldnt have mentioned that though i almost think it was the only thing he could do  carrie seeing mrs annersly look up sharply controlled herself by force of will  would you mind telling me why you think that she asked calmly  mrs custer appeared to be looking at her in astonishment you dont know he hasnt told you that either  no said carrie quietly he certainly hasnt  the woman in the big chair sat silent for several moments and then made a little deprecatory gesture even if your husband doesnt thank me for telling you i think you ought to know it appears from what tom heard two or three of the loungers at the hotel were talking about you charley came into the verandah and heard them  ah said carrie with a sharpness in her voice that suggested pain so that was how it came about no doubt half the people in the settlement know what they were saying  once more mrs custer appeared to consider like most of his friends she believed in charley leland and it was of course not astonishing that she was aware that his relations with his wife were not exactly all they should be this to some extent roused her resentment and though she was inclined to like carrie she had halfconsciously taken up her husbands cause against her  my dear she said i scarcely think i could tell you and i really dont believe many people know still neither your husband nor the others appear to have noticed that the inner door of the room was open and the man who keeps the hotel heard them he told tom that he wouldnt have expected anything else from charley leland  carrie leant forward a little in her chair i want you to tell me exactly what they said it is right to my husband and myself that i should know  then you will forgive me if it hurts you they said you had only married him for his money and he was no more to you than one of the teamsters there was a little more i couldnt mention  there was an uncomfortable silence for a few seconds and carrie knew dark as it now was that mrs annersly was furtively watching her  ah she said then my husband came in  mrs custer laughed softly i believe the loquacious gentleman was very sorry for himself before charley had done with him  thank you said carrie thoughtfully now i think we will change the subject could you manage to light the lamp aunt eveline i cant very well get past you  mrs annersly lighting the lamp craftily led their visitor to talk of montreal for she thought carrie had suffered enough for the present  in the meanwhile leland who had been driving the harrows all day and had just come in sat with gallwey in the big room below he had a blackened pipe in his hand and his face was thoughtful his torn jacket and coarse blue shirt fell away to the elbow from one almost blackened and splendidly corded arm the man like most of his neighbours at that season was usually too weary with more than twelve hours labour to change his clothes when he came in for which there was indeed no great reason since he seldom saw his wife or mrs annersly in the brief hour between his work and sleep  wheats down another cent with sellers prevailing he said pointing to several newspapers on the table its most a pity i had fixed up to put in the big crop things are quiet in russia and that means a good crop theyve had rain in california and the kind of season they wanted in argentina india and australia it seems to me the whole things going to turn on the states crop this year from what ive been reading here theyre a little scared about sowing in the dakotas and minnesota theyd swamp out all the markets if wheat jumped up just now  it shows very little sign of doing it said gallwey things are going to be a little serious as it is a short crop in the states would give values a fillip but the trouble is that if they have frost or hail we are likely to get it too  leland smiled drily well he said if the market doesnt stiffen we can only go under it would hurt to give up prospect but it could be done in the meanwhile ive been wondering about that waggon it took me quite a while to screw the locknut on with the big boxspanner and the thing never loosened of itself  i dont think it did the last time you drove in to the settlement your waggon was standing probably four or five hours behind the occidental i think id try to find out if anybody borrowed one of porters spanners when i went in again how long was it after you threw jasper out when you drove away  about five minutes  well its quite possible he did it before i suppose you havent asked yourself how jasper makes a living he never seems to be doing anything and i believe it isnt difficult to buy whisky at the settlement thanks to our beneficent legislature whoever keeps it makes an excellent profit  lelands face grew a trifle harder and he closed one brown hand the same thing struck me and i guess youre right it seems i have a good deal against me this year the market would have been bad enough without the rustlers  gallwey rose and laid a hand on his shoulder you can count on me charley whatever comes along there are others too it isnt only the whisky men who feel they have to get even with you youll get what you like to ask for teams men to harvest for you and though its scarce in this country even money  he turned away a trifle abruptly and leland felt a thrill of gratitude he had many friends on the prairie and knew the worth of them though it did not occur to him that he had done quite sufficient to warrant their goodwill just then he was most clearly sensible that there was much against him  presently carrie came in looking very dainty and alluring in an evening gown she had not yet discarded all the social conventions to which she had been accustomed at barrockholme leland felt a stirring of his blood as he looked at her he rose and stood waiting as she watched him gravely a faint flush in her cheeks  charley she said and he thought how seldom she used his name i have a difficult thing to do but it would not be honest to shirk it i must ask you to forgive me for what i said when you told me about the waggon  why  the colour grew in the girls face mrs custer has told me that her husband saw you  leland smiled somewhat bitterly you find it easier to believe tom custer than me  please wait what could i think when you told me i was at the settlement that morning and saw your cut lips when you stood on the verandah  the man started a little but he promptly recovered from his astonishment and looked at her with twinkling eyes  now i understand he said you were a little disgusted with me the men you are used to wouldnt have thrown any one they couldnt agree with out of a hotel  no still there are cases when the provocation may be too strong for one  it is quite often that way with me im afraid i am a little short in temper  he leant upon the table as though he had nothing more to say and carrie recognised that he did not mean to tell her what had led up to the outbreak whether this was due to pride or generosity she did not know but the fact made its impression upon her her husband was it seemed sure enough of his own purposes to disregard what others thought of him but there was a certain sting in the reflection a desire on his part to stand well in her estimation would have been more gratifying still she overcame the slight sense of mortification  you havent told me what the provocation was she said  no said leland with a little quiet smile it wouldnt be quite the thing to worry you with an explanation every time i lose my temper i do it now and then  ah said carrie dont you care then what i think of you still in this case i neednt ask you mrs custer told me that too that is why i felt i must ask you to forgive me for presuming to blame you i want to be just and i was in my wilfulness horribly far from being so  you want to be just that was the only reason  the girl saw the tension in his face and stood silent swayed by a whirl of confused sensations she would not admit there was another reason though something in her nature clamoured for a breaking down of the restraint between them she had looked down on this man and wantonly wounded him while he had shown her what she realised was a splendid generosity and borne her scorn in silence it was once more his independent silence that troubled her and she felt just then that she would sooner have had him compel her to acknowledge that he was not what she had striven to think him  well he said a trifle sadly i suppose i must not expect too much  the girls heart smote her she knew just what he wanted her to say but she could not say it and yet she meant to do all she had undertaken  there is a little more and it must be said she said i know part at least of what those men said of me  she stopped and holding herself rigidly though one hand which she had laid on the table quivered a little looked at him steadily  if i could only prove them wrong but i cant she said  a deep flush crept into lelands face and the veins rose swollen on his forehead while he grasped her shoulder almost roughly  do you know what you are saying he asked  that i married you because we were poor at barrockholme it was a horrible wrong i did youand you have made me ashamed  the relief that swept into the mans face somewhat puzzled her but she had seen the anger and suspense in it a moment earlier and her heart throbbed painfully after all though she did not understand what had troubled him it seemed that he did care very much indeed  my dear he said quietly if you think you have done me any wrong it is wiped out now perhaps some day you will go a little further than you have done tonight and i must try to wait for it that is all i have to say and this is becoming a little painful to both of us  he turned slowly away and carrie moved towards the door but when she reached it she stopped and looked back at him  one can be a little too generous now and then she said  then the door closed and leland stood still leaning on the table with thoughtful eyes  i dont know if that was a lead or not and i dont seem able to think just now he said im not running prospect its driving me and im ground down mind and body by the load of wheat im carrying     chapter xiv  the outlaws strike back   the brief spring was merging suddenly earlier even than usual into summer and it was a still oppressive night when leland sat somewhat grim in face in a mortgage and land brokers office at the railroad settlement the little dusty room with its litter of papers and survey prints was very hot and leland who had just come in from the dusk was a trifle dazed by the light the kerosene lamp flung down he had in his hand two or three letters the broker had given him and glanced at one of them moodily only with difficulty fixing his attention on it he had toiled with feverish activity that spring and at last the strain was telling for his head ached and he felt limp and weary it had too been dry weather ever since he put the first plough into the ground and that night there was an oppressive tension in the atmosphere  macartney the landbroker sat opposite him a gaunt keeneyed man with a thin jacket over his white shirt leland knew him for an upright man though nobody is supposed to be particularly scrupulous in the business he followed  you are looking a little played out he said i can give you some ice and soda but its partly due to your own efforts that ive nothing else whisky can i believe be had but in the face of the fall in land and wheat the figure the few men want who venture to keep it is prohibitive  he filled a tumbler from the fountain on the sidetable and dropped in a lump of ice leland drained it thirstily  ive been round since sunup and have driven forty miles he said putting down the empty glass i guess its the weather for a thing of that kind shouldnt have troubled me not a blade of wheat up yet and the seedbeds all clods and dust there are very few of us going to escape the frost in the fall  macartney nodded sympathetically if i come out a hundred cents on the dollar when harvests over its rather more than i expect he said my stakes in land and wheat and i couldnt unload anything except at a smart loss just now in the circumstances it seems to me that bruce is making you a reasonable offer  im not likely to raise on it from anybody else and leland frowned as he glanced at the letter still if i let him have the cattle i cant stock the ranch again they should have cleared me quite a few thousand dollars if i could have held on and sold them fat in the fall  if i were in your place and could hold on i would still you have to have some money in hand the banks wont look at land and i couldnt raise you anything on mortgage except at a crippling interest  thats just my trouble i havent got any cash  the broker glanced at him reflectively well he said its not my business but you must have had a pile last year of course you were over in the old country but you could afford it and you never struck me as an extravagant man  leland smiled in a somewhat wry fashion i dont quite think i am but thats not the question ive got to have the money to go on with and as you say i couldnt get it on a mortgage that wouldnt ruin me tell bruce he can have the cattle and if hell let me know when he wants them well round them up for him its that or nothing but i stand to lose most enough on the run to break me this year  from what you told me if you hang on to the run youll have to let prospect go  lelands face hardened well he said i guess i would and that if it has to be is going to hurt me if i stood as i did last fall i could carry over but now the market and the season are both against me but i must be getting home youll fix it up with bruce  the ostler from the occidental was waiting outside with a hired horse and leland swinging himself wearily into the saddle rode down the unpaved street a blaze of light shone out from the verandah of the little hotel and he could hear the laughter of those inside and the hum of merry voices further on somebody was playing a fiddle in a house the door and windows of which stood wide open he sighed a little as he rode by a year ago he would have spent the night there or at the hotel taking his part in the pointed badinage with keen enjoyment his goodhumour had been infectious then and everybody had had a pleasant word for him but things were different now  the market was going against him the season was getting more unpropitious if ruin could be staved off it would be only by unceasing toil and spartan selfdenial after working from sunrise he had driven forty miles that afternoon and there was the same distance still to be covered in the saddle he might count himself fortunate if he reached prospect in time for barely two hours sleep before he must set about his work again he had never spared himself and he had no thought of doing so now when every effort he could make was urgently necessary branscombe denhams creditors had been if not satisfied at least pacified for a time with the money that would have seen him through and leland who knew his man smiled grimly as he recalled that denham had termed it a loan  there was nobody in the rutted street the stores were closed and only a single light burned in the little wooden shed beside the railroad track the place seemed deadly desolate and leland whose physical weariness had reacted on his mind shrank for once from the greater loneliness as he rode out into the silent empty waste save when the blue sheetlightning fell with a sudden blaze black darkness rested heavily upon the night the drumming of his horses hoofs rose with a jarring distinctness the air was thick and hot and the smell of sunscorched earth was in his nostrils a light fibrous dust settled on his perspiring face  the sod green no longer was turning white before its season and broad cracks seamed its surface from want of moisture he could remember only one or two springs that had been like this and they he recalled had broken many a prairie farmer seed will not germinate under such conditions and the prairie summer is usually quite short enough to ripen the crops there was nobody to observe him so he bent under the strain riding slackly in his weariness with all the vigour gone out of him what his thoughts were he could never quite remember indeed he was not sure that he had had any definite thoughts at all being conscious only of utter lassitude and dejection  the horse started in alarm whenever the blue radiance flashed athwart the prairie showing here and there a clump of willows or a birch bluff etched black against the brightness then darkness followed and he felt his way by the sound the hoofs made on the sunbaked soil of the trail he was astonished on making the big bluff by the ravine to hear a beat of hoofs among the trees he had not seen until he rode into the midst of them there were evidently a good many horses and it flashed upon him that only the rustlers would be riding that way in a body and at that hour of night he had no pistol nothing in fact but a heavy riding quirt this he grasped by the thinner end as he rode on in his present mood he would not have left the trail had he known absolutely that the outlaws had come there in search of him  they were hidden in the blackness but he could hear them calling to their horses as they climbed the trail out of the hollow and he stiffened himself a little shifting his hand on the bridle and feeling for a firmer grip with his knees as he did so the gap between the trunks was filled with a blue flash and he could plainly see the white faces of the foremost of the outlaws the light lasted long enough to show that men and beasts were dripping with wet then a curious thing happened lelands grasp of the riding quirt suddenly relaxed and he checked his horse  you have had rain boys he said  a shower said a startled man who had seen him for an instant more of it to the westwardsthe creeks rising  there was another blue flash and lelands horse plunged as he swayed in his saddle two at least of the others saw his face but they stood still in the black darkness that followed and he rode through the midst of them with a firm grasp on the bridle then he gave the startled horse the rein a confused clamour rose from the blackness behind him as he swept across the bridge and he felt that whimsical chance alone had saved him had he planned his moves with definite purpose the thing he had done would have been impossible  reining in when he reached the level beyond the ravine he sat listening there was no sound of pursuit as a big warm drop splashed upon one hand he started nervously then from out the silence came a soft murmur that rose in sharp crescendo suddenly a rush of rain smote his perspiring face the patter swelled into a roar and a heavy steamy smell like that of a hothouse rose from the drinking earth leland felt his pulse quicken as the warm deluge washed his cares away its value could be calculated in hard cash for it saved his wheat  he rode for a while bareheaded with the water trickling over him though he was physically very weary the lassitude and dejection melted out of him there was no longer a tension in the atmosphere and he was an optimist again vaguely thankful for the things he had and the strength to grapple with those against him with that a great tenderness towards his wife swept over him like a wave and he remembered not her scorn and bitter words but that there was so much she must miss at prospect he had left her alone neglected while he thought only of his work and even though she cared nothing for him he might in many ways have made her life pleasanter he could he reflected do it yet for ruin seemed remote now the wheat was saved the rain still beat his clothing flat against his tired limbs but he rode on almost lightheartedly with the mire splashing high about him welcoming every drop  it was still dark when he reached prospect wet through and halfasleep but swinging himself wearily down from the saddle he made shift to put the horse into one of the stables there were more than one of them for the buildings had been erected here and there as they had been wanted and as the farm had grown letting himself into the silent house and groping his way to his room he shed his wet and muddy garments on the floor and crawled deadtired into bed he slept very soundly for nature would have her way and it was seven in the morning when carrie who did not know he had returned entered his room though she knew little of household management she had during the last month or two been quietly assuming the direction of affairs at prospect  she started when she saw him but it was evident that he was very fast asleep so she stood for several minutes looking down on him one arm was flung out on the coverlet bare to the elbow sinewy and brown she noticed the hardness of the hand and her heart grew soft towards him as she saw how worn his face was with the resolution melted out of it the man looked so weary in his sleep when she glanced round the room his very clothes from which the water had spread across the uncovered floor were suggestive of the hard fight he had fought and the weariness it had brought him there had been no care in his face at barrockholme she she reflected had brought him trouble at the thought there came over her a feeling of disgust with herself and compassion for him it was not love perhaps but it was at least regretful tenderness and she drew nearer with a sudden impulse the blood creeping into her cheeks he lay very still apparently fast asleep and she knew that further trouble awaited him on wakening  then the impulse illogical as she felt it was grew stronger until it became uncontrollable and she bent down swiftly and kissed his cheek he made no sign but she rose with her blood tingling and not daring to look back at him slipped out of the room she met gallwey on the stairway and he looked at her in amazement for he had never before seen that colour in her face or that softness in her eyes  if one might be permitted to mention it the loss of sleep and the alarm last night seem to have agreed with you he said you are looking as fresh as the prairie after the rain  carrie laughed softly and it seemed to the man that her voice was also gentler than usual im afraid i cant make you an equal compliment she said you look very woebegone  i expect i do and gallwey made a little whimsical gesture in fact i wish it was any other persons duty to inform your husband what has happened i suppose i am in a way responsible and his remarks are rather vigorous occasionally  you are not going to waken him now  im afraid i must the kings command madam i have already gone a little further than was advisable in giving him an extra hour  but said carrie you dont seem to remember that there is a queen at prospect too let him sleep until nine oclock you have my dispensation  gallwey made her a little inclination and it was more deferential than joking though he smiled  with that madam i will risk my head he said i wonder if i may dutifully mention that we have wanted a queen for a long whileone who will rule  carrie felt her cheeks glow and she was glad when he turned and went down the stairs in front of her  it was two hours later when gallwey with some difficulty and not a few misgivings awakened leland but the latters first indignation died away when his comrade mentioned why he had not done so earlier gallwey who was carrie lelands devoted servant contrived to hide his smile though he had drawn his own inferences and was satisfied by the time he had said all he had to say lelands face had however grown grim again and that he was quiet was not a favourable sign  i will be down in five minutes and come with you he said one of the whisky boys or i would have needed burying if i had known of this last night  ten minutes had passed when he and gallwey walked towards the stables across the wirefenced paddock the rain had ceased and bright sunshine was licking up the gleaming moisture from the sod but leland saw only a wide space of sodden ashes and the blackened ruins of the logstables of which the roofs had fallen in the birchtrunks that still stood were charred and tottering and a little steam rose from them they went in among them together leland stopped suddenly with hands tight clenched and the veins on his forehead standing out when he saw what lay among a mass of halfburnt and fallen beams  four of them he said hoarsely brave old bright and valerie many a long furrow have they ploughed for me voyageur and blackfoot too  he swung round fiercely tom id almost sooner thehogs had crippled me teams id broke and driven year by year theyve done most as much for prospect as i have by the lord when next i run up against the boys who did it theres going to be a reckoning you are sure of what you tell me  gallwey touched his arm come and see  they went out together across the space of ashes that ran back several hundred yards from the stables then gallwey stooped beside a halfburnt tussock of taller grass and pointed to a little card of pasteboard sulphur matches they were as usual joined together at the bottom of the card and the heads had melted off them but gallwey stooping picked up a single halfburnt match and fitted it to the place from where it had evidently been broken off  i left them there for you to see he said as a rule nobody ever finds out how a grassfire starts but i think the origin of this one is tolerably plain you will of course have noticed that it is within the guardfurrows perhaps the fellow didnt remember the matches or he may have left them as a hint i suppose it is gratifying to feel that your enemy knows you intended it when you hurt him  gallweys face hardened and he went on  jake wakened first and we had the boys out in five minutes but the fire was on the stables then we couldnt get the door open either and had to wait while one of them brought an axe i dont know what jammed it because when i went back to see it was burnt but it never stuck fast before well we did what we could but we couldnt save the four horses you saw and if it hadnt been for the rain we might have lost them all  leland looking about him noticed again that the fire had started just where the grass was tallest and within the guardfurrows ploughed to cut the homestead off from the sweep of the prairie this fire it was very evident to him had been started with a definite purpose that it had come very near accomplishing  we have everything against us this year he said and his brown face showed very hard and stern still by the lord if we have to go under theres going to be a struggle first     chapter xv  beneficent rain   when gallwey left him leland walked slowly through the bluff where the birches rustled softly under the caress of a warm gentle breeze there was a different note in their low murmur now for the lacelike twigs were covered with slender leaves and a new scent rose from the steaming mould leland noticed it vacantly scarcely seeing the silver stems for susceptible as he was to all of natures moods he was at the time bracing himself for the long struggle before him  there was so much against him and the loss of his horses had filled him with an overwhelming indignation against the men who had wantonly injured him he was combative by nature as every man with a strenuous purpose must necessarily be with vindictive bitterness he thought of the burnt and mangled beasts that had worked for him so well once more his lips set and brushing heedlessly through the bluff he clenched one hard hand men and circumstances might prove too strong for him but he would at least go on until he was crushed and leave his mark upon his enemies before they brought him down  then coming out from among the trees he stopped with a little indrawing of his breath as he glanced at the ploughing it had been when he last saw it a waste of clods rent into hot and dusty fragments but now all the wide basin and long slope of rise were sprinkled with flecks of green and he stood gazing at it with softening face and glowing eyes the kindly rain had touched the parched and dusty soil and the old familiar miracle had again happened  life had emerged from darkness the wheat was up in token that while mans faith may falter and his hand grow slack the great beneficent influences are strongest still and seedtime and harvest shall not fail as those who worked for him had cause to know and as shrewd grain buyers in winnipeg admitted leland was an essentially practical man but there was in him as there must be in the optimist a vague recognition of the mysterious upholding purpose that stands behind and is partially revealed in the world of material things he could drive the long furrow he could rend the clods but there was that in the redgold wheat that did not come from them or him it was the essence of life a mystery and a miracle his to control or even to annihilate but a thing he could never create  he felt something of this while he stood there with the warm wind on his face the bitterness fell from him with his cares hope is eternal and it sprang up strong in him as his softening eyes wandered over the vast sprinkling of sunny green the harvest would follow the sowing and toil was indestructible his courage which indeed had never faltered changed its mood it was no longer the grim resolution of a desperate man but a more hopeful and gentler thing then and he was not astonished for it only seemed the natural sequence of things his wife came out from among the birches with a smile in her eyes  i have come to look for you breakfast is ready and i have been waiting ever so long she said  it was a trifling matter but the mans heart beat faster than usual it had not been her habit to rise in time to breakfast with him as often happened when he felt the most he could think of nothing apposite to say and stood looking at her in silence  i was almost afraid to venture until i saw you she said i had expected to find you angry it wouldnt have been astonishing  leland laughed softly im afraid i was he said still it didnt seem to last when i saw the wheat was up and it was bound to vanish when you came anyway  ah said carrie with a faint warmth in her cheeks its a long time since you have even tried to say anything of that kind to me well i have something to say and i would like you to believe it is not merely what you once called the correct thing i am very sorry for what has happened  my dear i think i know and leland smiled at her it was very good of you and the only thing that was needed to make my worries melt away i seem to feel im going to come out ahead of the market and the rustlers now could anybody be afraid when he had seen the wheat  the girl turned and gazed with only partial comprehension at the vast sweep of green  oh she said i suppose it is a little wonderful it looked so hopeless yesterday i am glad one at least of your troubles has vanished charley  and yours  am i supposed to have any  she spoke without bitterness as though questioning his faculty of comprehension and she saw the dark colour creep into his face still it was not the hue of anger and stooping he gently seized the hand that wore the ring  my dear he said you must have many i can feel it now and when i married you i was perhaps doing wrong how could one expect you to be content with such a man as i am  he stopped a moment and smiled wistfully i almost think i know how the life you lead here must look to you you can see it stretching out in front of you all arid and hopeless like those furrows yesterday still now you see them green with promise the rain has come  ah said carrie still the wheat was hidden there and in some of us there are only weeds and tares while even if there is among them a little wholesome grain who knows if the rain will ever come at all she looked up at him and hesitated charley do you feel that i have cheated you very badly  how  oh i suppose you will not admit it one could thank you for that but you know have i ever been a companion to you isnt your life harder than it was before  lelands grasp of her hand grew tighter well he said there are times when one must talk and i have felt that but i felt too that if i could wait there would be a change  i think you must have been always hopeful  hope said leland gravely is a little like the germ in the wheat it lies dormant but while its husk lasts it will not die i think and he glanced back at the vast sweep of sprouting green i was like that dusty ploughing waiting for the rain  the girl was silent for a while though she too was conscious of a curious stirring of her nature which showed itself by the warmth in her cheeks the man had she felt chosen a peculiarly fitting symbolism for when the beneficent rain had touched the arid clods they had put on beauty with sudden life and growth  and what do you expect then she asked  leland smiled i dont quite know but it must be something good and beautiful what is in all nature is in us too my dear and he made a little gesture one can feel and not quite understand the wheat yonder doesnt know why and how it grows but since you gave me your promise at barrockholme i have been waiting for something to come to me  ah said carrie again after what has happened you can expect it still  the man looked at her gravely hope is indestructible and some day the rain will come one cannot hurry it one can only work and wait  carrie smiled a little though once more pride and a curious tenderness struggled within her  well she said in the meantime jake is no doubt wondering whether we are coming in to breakfast  they turned and went back to the house with the sunshine bright upon them and the clean scents of the soil in their nostrils the gladness that was in all things reacted upon them both  half an hour later leland set about his work again and as he had leagues to ride to visit one or two farms and to see where there was likely to be any wild hay in the sloos dusk was closing down before he came back again in his absence something had happened that left carrie confused and startled the men were trooping in for the six oclock supper when a light waggon swung into sight over the crest of the rise as it reached the door of the homestead one of the two men in it sprang down carrie was standing in the entrance hall when jake showed him in and she caught her breath with a little gasp when she saw who it was the man who stood smiling at her with the sunlight on his face was the one she had parted from on the path above the ravine at barrockholme  reggie she said  urmston laughed yes he said in the flesh i have ridden most of two hundred miles on horseback and in a waggon to get here in the expectation that you would be pleased to see me  carrie stood still thankful that she was in the shadow though for the moment she could not tell whether she was pleased or not for one thing the mans assurance that she would feel so somewhat jarred upon her and the advantage was with him for he had come there knowing that he would see her and she had not expected him  of course i am she said but the waggon  i hired the man to drive me i suppose he can put up here and go back tomorrow your husband will no doubt set me on my way to the railroad when i go  carrie leland was not as a rule readily shaken out of her serenity but she was almost disconcerted now urmston evidently meant to stay and even the stranger has only to ask for shelter upon the prairie the man before her had once considered himself much more to her than a stranger  yes she said he will be glad to see you sit down while i tell jake about the teamster and see that your room is made ready  she left him somewhat abruptly and urmston laughed a little too startled even to shake hands with me he murmured i wonder if that is significant  twenty minutes later he was sitting down with carrie and mrs annersly at supper and was not altogether astonished when the elder lady who he fancied had never been fond of him turned to him with a frank question  what did you come here for she said  to see carrieand yourself madam and urmston smiled with a mischievous relish that made him look very young could one venture to hope that in your case the pleasure is reciprocated  i am at least disposed to tolerate anybody from the old country though i cant go very much further when one has been a few months here one is apt to become contented with the products of canada  the wheat have you turned farmer  eveline annerslys eyes twinkled no she said the men they are after all the finest thing this country raises  urmston laughed though he felt that he had been favoured with a hint mrs annersly however had more to say  have you suddenly grown energetic and decided to do something she asked  no said urmston as a matter of fact i came out to see the country and enjoy myself although i have an ostensible mission geoffrey crossthwaite is as you are aware a meddler in social economics and has lately become interested in one of the especially commendable schemes for dumping into our dependencies the folks nobody seems to want at home  ah said eveline annersly that explains the thing  urmston flushed a trifle and forced a smile  well he said im not quite sure that it does in itself i happen to know a little about english farming and am expected to report upon the prospects of giving other undesirables a start in life here though there are two regular experts with the party  so you made a journey of two hundred miles to see carrie and me while they did the work still i have no doubt her husband will be able to teach you a little about canadian farming  urmston made a little gesture i am a stranger madam and in your hands treat me gently  this was said goodhumouredly and with some gracefulness but trifling as the matter was carrie contrasted his attitude with the one she fancied her husband would have adopted he would have braced himself for the encounter against much longer odds she was grateful however to eveline annersly for the bantering conversation as it gave her time to decide exactly what her own course must be the circumstances were certainly somewhat embarrassing when at last the meal was over eveline annersly stuck to them persistently and it was only when the chill of the clear cold evening settled down upon the prairie that she left them alone upon the verandah urmston who lay languidly graceful in a cane chair glanced at carrie  i have been looking forward to seeing you for days and now i feel that this is not quite what i expected you have changed he said  carrie laughed though she felt that the wistful note in his voice was genuine she remembered too that she had once been fond of and believed in him but she had as she expressed it grown since then while it was evident that he was still the same in fact she felt he was remarkably young  well she said you have not  no said urmston i am unfortunately one of the people who dont change at all it would be so much easier for me if i did  this was sufficiently plain but it brought no gratification to the girl on the whole she was rather annoyed with him though she had a lingering tenderness for him still after all he had loved her as well as he was capable of loving and that counts for a good deal with some women  there was he said only one woman who could have made the most out of me and have led me to a higher level  and she married another man it is remarkably hard to reach a more elevated level alone and a woman would naturally rather lean on than drag her companion  urmstons face flushed i think i could have been capable of a good deal more than i probably ever shall be now if you could have trusted me  still said carrie with a halfwistful sense of regret she could not wholly drive out the time when i might have done so has gone  the man leant forward a trifle nearer her carrie he said a trifle hoarsely are you happy with this canadian  the girl felt her cheeks burn and was glad that the soft dusk was now creeping into the verandah well she said i am as happy as i deserve to be  then there was a drumming of hoofs and she was only pleased when leland swung himself down hot and dusty from the saddle he came into the verandah and stood a moment glancing at the stranger  mr reginald urmstonan old friend of mine at barrockholme said the girl i am not quite sure whether you have ever met my husband before  leland held out a hard hand and carrie was grateful for the swiftness with which he did it it suggested an unquestioning confidence in her  oh yes he said i remember glad to see you mr urmston carries friends are always welcome hope youll stay here a month if you feel like it  mrs annersly and gallwey entered the verandah just then and when the others left them shortly afterwards remained there gallwey thought that his companion had something to say to him though there was nothing very definite to warrant it he felt that they were allies  one could almost fancy that you didnt seem quite pleased withcircumstances he said  well said eveline annersly i dont think i am if that man had fallen out of his waggon and broken his leg before he got here i almost believe i should have been happier i do not care in the least whether that is a judicious speech or not  gallwey grinned there are he said significantly a good many badgerholes scattered about the prairie and the horse that puts its foot in one is apt to come down awkwardly i wonder if there is anything definite you expect from me  i should suggest that you insist upon teaching urmston farming and keep him busy at it said mrs annersly     chapter xvi  urmston shows his prudence   it was falling dusk when reginald urmston strolled along the little trail through the birch bluff with one of lelands cigars in his hand he had been at prospect a week now and had on the whole found the time pass pleasantly though he felt that carries attitude towards him while no doubt the correct one left much to be desired from his point of view if he had been asked exactly what he had expected from her when he came there he would have had some difficulty in framing a concise answer for he was a man who acted on impulse without prevision or any great strength of purpose still he had certainly not looked for the matteroffact friendliness she displayed he felt that a few hints of regret for happiness thrown away or at least a sorrowful protest or two against the stern necessity which had separated them would have been considerably more appropriate and he would have been prepared to offer delicate sympathy  it is also probable that he would have done it gracefully for although he had not exactly shone at the crisis as a passionate lover he had the capacity for making a successful philanderer carrie however had never admitted that she was either unhappy or dissatisfied with her husband and the farmers indifference was somewhat galling leland did not seem to resent in the least the fact that the stranger spent a good deal of his time in his wifes company and frequently strolled up and down with her in the lingering twilight between the house and the birch bluff it suggested that leland had either an implicit confidence in his wife or a very low opinion of urmstons attractiveness and the latter found neither of these surmises particularly consoling he had certainly loved carrie and fancied that he did so still  on the evening in question he expected to meet her and hoped eveline annersly would not as generally happened be there as well he did not like eveline annersly or her little ironical speeches for while he could not have complained of her active hostility had she shown any it was naturally not gratifying to be made to feel that she was merely amused with him it was a clear still day and the pale green of evening gleamed behind the birches while their slender stems stood out like ebony columns against the glare of smoky red on the verge of the prairie the coolness was exhilarating and there was something in the deep stillness under which the prairie rolled away vast and shadowy that vaguely stirred the man he was in a somewhat complacent mood for carrie had been unusually gracious to him that day and his cigar was very excellent he was thinking of her when he was startled by a soft beat of hoofs and looking up saw a mounted man come suddenly out of the shadows  the stranger pulled his horse up sharply and sat at rest for a moment or two gazing down on him he wore a wide hat a loose shirt above his jean trousers and long boots with one hand on the holster at his hip he looked undoubtedly truculent  lelands in the house he asked  i believe so said urmston who felt a bit uneasy  the stranger moved his hand a trifle so that the butt of a pistol appeared above the edge of the holster  then walk straight in front of you through the bluff and out on to the prairie he said if you turn round or come back in the next ten minutes youre going to have trouble with my partner who is watching you  urmston did not move at once he did not think this visit promised anything particularly pleasant to leland but that was after all not his affair still though he was not expecting either of them just then there was a chance that carrie or mrs annersly might enter the bluff he had no reason to suppose that the stranger would cause them any annoyance if they did but the mans appearance was far from prepossessing  well said the latter sharply what in the name of thunder are you stopping for hump yourself before youre sorry  urmston saw the pistol slide almost out of the holster and the mans hand move on the bridle the gestures were suggestive and he did as he was bidden carrie he decided had not come out yet or he would have seen her he did not stop until rather more than the prescribed ten minutes had expired and then found himself well out in the silent prairie it was almost dark now but he thought he saw a dim object moving down the edge of the wheat and that he could hear the muffled beat of hoofs there was only one horse however and he realised that the part he had played had perhaps not been an altogether brilliant one on the whole he fancied it would be advisable to say nothing about it he went back through the bluff and came upon carrie moving across the space of dusty grass between it and the house  do you know who it was that rode through the bluff a little while ago she asked  no said urmston as carelessly as he could i certainly do not  carrie so far as he could make out appeared a trifle astonished well she said i thought you must have met the man i saw him come out and ride towards the house but didnt seem to recognise him still i daresay he was one of our visitors cattle boys  i scarcely think its worth worrying about said urmston reflectively for one thing its too beautiful a night to waste in thinking about a canadian stockrider one would hardly imagine any of them are sufficiently interesting to warrant it  carrie understood that this was probably as far as he considered it advisable to venture since she knew that he considered her husband a stockrider too although she was not exactly pleased it did not seem worth while to show her displeasure  one must talk of something she said  urmston appeared to glance at her reproachfully there was a time when you and i could be content without a word silence is now and then wonderfully expressive thoughts are often spoiled by being forced into clumsy speech  that time has gone by some little while ago she said and there was a quiet decisiveness in the girls tone that the man did not seem to notice perhaps it was our own fault though i do not know circumstances were against us but it might have been different had we had the courage to take our destiny in our hands still i am not admitting that i am sorry we did not do so  urmston was sensible of a slightly uncomfortable feeling it had been borne in upon him that had he shown himself bolder and more persistent carrie might after all never have married leland still he did not think it kind that she should remind him of it if that indeed was what she had meant to do  those days he said gently will always live with me i have only the memory of them to cheer me and i cherish it as my dearest possession  the girl did not know whether she was touched or not she was naturally at least a little sorry for him but his selfcompassionate sentimentality was apt to become tiresome at times  wouldnt it be wiser if you made an effort to keep it a little further in the background she said it would in the circumstances at least be more appropriate  the man dropped his voice carrie he said i couldnt if i wished to love of one kind is indestructible even the fact that you were forced into marrying another man cannot destroy it he is after all an accident  carries face had flushed but she laughed outright urmstons love indestructible as he said it was had as she realised now prompted him to do very little while there was something singularly inapposite in his terming her strenuous forceful husband an accident she felt that had he been in her disconsolate lovers place he would at any cost have broken through the encompassing difficulties  ah she said that was really a little ridiculous charley leland is rather unalterable inflexible of purpose  urmston appeared confused and it was perhaps a relief to both when eveline annersly came up  havent those people got through their business yet asked carrie  no said the elder lady they were still talking as earnestly as ever when i passed the door i think something of importance must be going on  the surmise was as a matter of fact warranted for that evening leland and his neighbours once more sat about the little table discussing the outlaws a little apart from them sergeant grier sat intent and upright the windows of the big room were wide open and the cool evening air flowed in  my part is quite simple the sergeant said i shall be glad to act upon any reliable information you may be able to put before me and if it appears necessary call upon you for assistance in heading off or laying hands on the whisky men in that case you will be for the time being practically police troopers i guess its not my business to ask if you are acting as an organisation or not theres nothing to stop any citizen giving me information in fact its his duty  the question said one of the others is how far you consider it necessary for us to go into the thing systematically and not just report any facts that happen to come under our notice  that said the sergeant a trifle drily is for you to settle among yourselves but i can give you something to figure on i reported to headquarters that the toughs among the railroad settlements were standing in with the outlaws and that there was probably going to be trouble soon the answer was that they had no complaints from the settlement or from any of the farmers and that they could hardly spare a man if things promised to become serious i was to report again and in the meanwhile they would try to send me two more troopers you know as well as i do how much i can do with them  leland laughed oh yes he said boys its quite evident that if we want anything done we shall have to do it ourselves  you have hit it said one of the others the one point is whether or not merely to want it wouldnt be just as wise ive had two steers driven off since i took a hand in the fight nevis has had the hay burned off his sloos and we know what has happened at prospect nothing has gone wrong in the case of the men who left things to the police i guess thats significant if the sergeant calls me out ill come but ive no desire to go round hunting trouble  that said a comrade sounds far more sensible than it is the sergeants troopers cant do anything there arent enough of them and theres the frontier near enough for the boys to skip out across well it may be some time before the police bosses get a move onit usually isand in the meanwhile well have every tough in the country standing in with the whisky men while we lie quiet theyre going to get bolder  just then leland turned sharply in his chair and the others who noticed it leant towards the window it was wide open and there was no light in the room outside the green transparency was just fading into the soft blueness of early dusk nobody else had heard anything but lelands figure was outlined against the last of the light and there was an ominous tenseness and expectancy in his attitude they waited a moment though none of them knew exactly why until a little square object which had evidently entered by the window struck the table  in another moment leland had swung himself out by the narrow window which was some distance from the floor then there was a crash outside and the rest made for the outer door on the opposite side of the building there was no sign of anybody when they reached it but two of them heard a beat of receding hoofs the rider did not seem to be in any great haste and they fancied he was rather bent upon slipping away quietly then leland appeared again limping and beckoned them back to the room where he lighted the lamp before he sat down his face was drawn  i wasnt exactly careful how i went out and came down hard on my elbow and my knee he said it took all the running out of me and the fellow evidently had his horse ready before we could get a horse saddled hed be most two miles away well well see what he has sent me though i have a notion what it is  he opened the little packet and took out a pistol bullet that may have been meant to weight it or quite as likely as a hint now ill tell you what he says  one of them moved the lamp for him and there was close attention as he read the note that had been wrapped about the bullet let up before you get hurt you have had two warnings but its going to be different with the third one theres a man or two on your trail who mean business  he flung the note on the table with a little contemptuous laugh i think its genuine and he means well but im going on  thats not very clear to me said one of his companions  its quite easy the rustlers are there for the money and arent anxious for trouble though if its necessary they are quite willing to make it that i figure is the view of most of them but they had a man killed not long ago and its probably different with one or two of his friends unless the others freeze them off they may undertake to run me down for the fun of the thing  there was a murmur of sympathy and agreement and leland saw that the rest were watching him curiously  oh he said impatiently im going on  then they set about discussing the rumour that another lot of whisky was being run by the time this was over they were all including the man with the misgivings of one mind again still the sergeant knew that if leland had hesitated it was quite probable he would have looked in vain for any support worth having from most of them the last man had driven away when carrie found him sitting thoughtfully in the empty room  something has disturbed you she said  leland looked up and there was a trace of dryness in his smile i have had quite a few things to worry me lately he said handing her the note this is merely one of them  the girl read it and looked at him with a perplexed frown on her face its contents troubled her for she had acquired from gallwey and others a good deal of information concerning the outlaws she also knew that leland would in all probability not have given it to her had he reason to suppose that it could cause her any great anxiety and the knowledge hurt her  well she said quietly what do you propose to do  leland smiled a little my dear what would you expect me to do  there was a faint flash in carries eyes and she lifted her head a trifle oh she said there is of course only one thing possibleto you  thank you im afraid there may be just a little risk in this for my wife as well i didnt quite remember it at the time  carrie laughed do you think that would count then she laid her hand upon his shoulder still charley you willto please mebe very careful  leland fancied he felt her hand tremble and thought he saw a sudden softness in her eyes but he could not be quite sure before he could decide how to profit by it she had turned her face aside and gone     chapter xvii  carrie makes a comparison   a week had passed since the last meeting of the farmers at prospect when carrie and eveline annersly sat out on the verandah of the house somewhat late at night a full moon hung over the prairie and the silence was impressive urmston who was as usual also there leant against the balustrade with his back to the light missing every uplifting appeal in the boundless sweep of softly gleaming grass of the prairie he was not one of the men upon whom the silent strength of nature has any marked reaction his thoughts concerned himself and the pleasures of the moment and he was seldom still or silent very long though his activities like his speeches were usually petty for the capacity for absorption in a sustaining purpose was not in him carrie leland had come to realise it of late though she did not exactly know why it may have been the result of a subconscious comparison of him with another man in any case the recognition of the fact had brought her a sense of annoyance for there was strength as well as pride in her and she was fond of urmston who was a man of her own world  urmston in the meanwhile found the contemplation of her sufficient for him and it is probable that most other men would have done the same she lay clad in a long white dress in a big loungechair with the silvery moonlight full upon her it brought out the duskiness of her eyes and hair and made her somewhat cold beauty the more apparent though there was at the time a faint illusory gentleness in her face a note the man had noticed more than once of late he would have liked to think that he had brought it there but could not quite persuade himself that this was so though there had been a time when he had seen that soft light creep into her eyes as she greeted him he had also a vague uncomfortable feeling that although circumstances had certainly been against him it was perhaps his own fault that he could now no longer call it up carrie was gracious to him save when he was too venturesome but he saw that her regard for him was widely different from what it had been there was more reserve in her attitude towards him than her mere recognition of what was due to her husband could account for he also noticed that she was a trifle anxious which brought him no great consolation in view of the fact that leland had ridden out with his rifle early the day before eveline annersly finally spoke after the silence that had lasted for several minutes  gallwey seems to fancy charley should have been back several hours ago she said charley told him he would be in to supper if all wentas they expected it to  she stole a swift glance at carrie who was then gazing out across the prairie as though in search of something and though the girl did not move she fancied there was a change in her expression it suggested a growing uneasiness  i scarcely suppose charley could tell exactly how long they would be she said  that said eveline annersly is very probable and in any case he is not likely to come to harm in fact one would be more inclined to feel anxious about the outlaws he might fall in with than about charley leland i daresay it was fanciful but when he rode away he reminded me of the picture the acres have of the mosstrooper you of course know the one i meanthe man in the steel cap with the moonlight sparkling on his spear there is something of the same grimness in both faces and in the mosstroopers case the artist hit it rather well it is an intangible something one cant well define primitive probably for i dont remember having seen it in the face of any man i am acquainted with at home  she turned towards urmston with a little laugh you havent got it reggie though now and then i almost fancy that carrie has i dont think you would have made a good mosstrooper  urmston smiled in turn i really dont think the kind of life they led would have appealed to me  no said eveline annersly you would have sat with the harp in the bower and made love rather nicely and judiciouslythat is when circumstances were propitious  urmston flushed glad he was in the shadow where carrie could not see him he felt as he had felt before that he would rather like to gag eveline annersly  can one fall in love judiciously he asked  as a matter of fact im not sure that one can in the days we are referring to they very seldom did the border knights apparently put on steel cap and corselet when they went wooing when lochinvar rode to netherby he swam the esk and it is very probable that the men who made love in his fashion later on had their swords loose when they crossed it whipping hard for gretna by the lower bridge of course as everybody knows all that has gone out of fashion long agoonly i think the primitive something remains which would drive a man full tilt against circumstances for sweet loves sake at least one sees it now and then in the eyes of the men out here  urmston longed to stop her but he had discovered on other occasions that an attempt to do so was very apt to bring about unwishedfor results he accordingly said nothing and carrie who perhaps felt as he did changed the subject  it was rather curious that the man who threw the note through the window when our neighbours were last here was able to creep up without being seen she said  i cant help thinking that somebody must have seen him said eveline annersly  then why didnt they mention it  i naturally dont know still one would fancy that the outlaw found means of impressing whomever he came across with the fact that he didnt want to be announced and that it would be wiser to fall in with his wishes afterwards the man he met would no doubt feel that as his silence wasnt altogether creditable it would be advisable to say nothing about it  carrie looked up sharply of course that sounds possible only from what i know of them he would hardly have succeeded in overawing any of the boys at prospect  you cant imagine your husband or gallwey standing against a tree with his eyes shut for ten minutes because a ferocious stranger requested him to  no and carries laugh had a little ring in it i certainly couldnt in fact i think it would be very apt to bring trouble on the stranger  she stopped a moment and looked again expectantly across the prairie  i cant understand how the rustler got here without being noticed at all she said reflectively jake was in the paddock when i went out and he feels quite sure that nobody could have slipped by without his seeing them of course it is possible the man came through the bluff  i fancy not in that case reggie would have met him i was standing by the window when he sauntered into the wood and it would be about ten minutes or perhaps a little more before you left the house  she flung a glance in the direction of urmston who felt horribly uncomfortable it occurred to him that if she had seen him enter the bluff it was also possible that she had seen the outlaw come out that she did not say she had done so was after all no great consolation for he knew eveline annersly could be silent when she had a reason he was afraid that if she had one now the result might not be altogether creditable to him when she saw fit to speak in the meanwhile it was evident that she expected him to say something  i believe you were right about the time he said  carrie looked up for his indifference seemed too pronounced to be quite natural but she brushed the halfformed thought out of her mind urmston was a man of her own station and could not she reasoned be deficient in qualities which even her husbands teamsters possessed still while she sat silent looking out upon the vast sweep of plain she could not help once more contrasting him with the man she had been driven into marrying she understood leland better now that she had seen the land he lived in for there were respects in which he resembled it men indeed usually do not only fit themselves to their environment but borrow from it something that becomes a part of them  it was evidently from the prairie that charley leland had drawn his strength of character his capacity for holding on with everything against him and his silent deeprooted optimism she had seen that plain bleached with months of frost and parched with drought but the flowers had sprung up from the streaming sod and now the wheat was growing tall and green again one could feel out there that while all life is a struggle which every blade of wheat must wage in due time fruition would come her husband it seemed realised it and had also faith in himself she remembered how when his neighbours hesitated fearing the outlaws vengeance he had said he was going on even if he went on alone she also knew that he would be as good as his word for he was not the man to turn back because there was peril in his path she could rather fancy him hastening to meet it with the little hard smile she had often seen in his steady eyes  then from out of the great stillness there crept the distant sound of a moving horse and carrie felt a feeling of relief come over her she would scarcely admit it to herself but during the past two or three hours she had been troubled by a growing sense of uneasiness she would not have felt it a few months earlier for while she would have had no harm come to him there was no hiding the fact that it would have set her free from an almost intolerable bondage it was however different now  the thud of hoofs grew louder and the dim figure of a mounted man grew out of the prairie a little thrill ran through her as she watched him swing past at a canter and draw rein between the house and the stables he waited a moment as though looking for somebody in whose care to leave the horse and carrie could see that he was weary and dusty though his face was dimly visible she fancied it was drawn and grey slanting over his shoulder the barrel of his marlin rifle glinted in the moon  that said eveline annersly is i think more suggestive than ever of the border spear  she glanced at carrie as the girl rose and went down the stairway then eveline annersly turned to urmston with a little smile  i scarcely think they will want us and im going in she said  urmston had moved into the moonlight now and his face was set there is of course no reason why you shouldnt but im not sure that you are entirely right he said in fact if its permissible to mention it i had a notion that carrie asked you here to make the convenient third  his companion looked at him with a faint gleam in her eyes you havent any great penetration after all or you would have seen that i have outstayed my usefulness in any case i feel inclined to favour you with a piece of advice it may save you trouble if you go back to your agricultural duties as soon as possible  you seem unusually anxious to get rid of me said the man with something in his tone that suggested satisfaction  eveline annersly laughed as she rose and moved back into the shadow oh dear no if i were really anxious the thing would be remarkably easy  she left him with this and urmston who leant somewhat moodily on the balustrade felt that his love for her was certainly no greater than it had been before he began to feel himself especially unfortunate in having fallen in with the rustler  in the meanwhile leland who started as he saw the girl coming towards him swung himself out of the saddle and stood awaiting her with the bridle of the jaded horse in his hand his face was worn and weary and he stood slackly with all the springy suppleness apparently gone out of him the grime was thick upon his coarse blue shirt and jean jacket  it was very good of you to wait so long he said  carrie smiled in a curious fashion did you expect me to sleep  you were a little anxious about me then  of course said the girl softly wouldnt it have been unnatural if i hadnt been  leland made an abrupt gesture my dear i dont want you to do the natural or the correct thing that is just because it is so  ah said carrie who can tell exactly why they do anything still i was anxious how have you got on  the man laughed a trifle grimly badlywe were either fooled or outgeneraled and the whisky boys came out ahead of us we had one horse shot and another broke its leg in a badgerhole hadnt you better go in now itll take me some time to put up  i slept most of last night and you have been out on the prairie two nights and days im coming with you to the stable i can at least hold a lantern  they turned away together leland walking very stiffly the girl who felt her heart beating close at his side until they reached one of the uninjured buildings it was very dark inside and redolent with the smell of wild peppermint in the prairie hay leland groped for a lantern and when he had lighted it hung it to a hook in the stall joist so that its light fell upon them  i really think you would have been sorry if the boys had brought me back with a bullet in me he said halfquestioningly  he saw the little shiver that ran through his companion but in another moment she was standing very straight and still how can you ask me that she said i did not think you would be vindictiveto me  look at me and leland leaning forward laid a hard dustgrimed hand on her shoulder it wouldnt have been a release when you had got over the shock of it  the colour crept into carries face and after the first moment she did not meet his eyes while the man with an impetuous movement slipped a hand about her waist then with a forced calm he slowly drew her towards him and kissed her on the brow and cheek and mouth for an instant only he held her fast then he let his hands fall  carrie looked at him with the hot blood tingling in her cheeks  now he said gravely though there was a faint ring of exultation in his voice that is for a sign that you belong to me and i guess im strong enough to keep what is mine you couldnt get away from me if you wanted to  carrie realised it though the fact no longer brought her any sense of intolerable restraint or disgust she said nothing and made no sign leland went on  still im not going to hurry you or spoil things by impatience he said you will be willing to take me for what i am some day and if things hurt you as they are now thats the one way of escape there cant be any other until one of us is dead  he turned from her and commenced to unbuckle the horses girth while carrie scarcely knowing why slipped past him busying herself with the headstall then she brought the chopped fodder while he went for water and stood holding the lantern while he rubbed the jaded beast down neither of them said anything but it was evident to both that the distance between them had been lessened by and by they went back together towards the house and leland laughingly held up the lantern when they reached the threshold  you see i never even remembered to put this thing down he said  carrie smiled but there was a trace of diffidence in her manner  i have kept your supper and will bring it in as soon as you come down she said everything you will want clean is laid out in your room  oh yes said leland reaching out and grasping her arm mrs nesbit is quite a smart housekeeper  carrie shook his grasp off and flitted away from him mrs nesbit is not responsible this time she said laughingly im afraid i havent looked after my household duties as i should have done hitherto     chapter xviii  a midnight visitor   summer had come in earnest and leland who had ridden out at daybreak with every man at prospect to cut prairie hay had not come back when carrie sat late at night beside the stove in the big room the stove was lighted and a kettle stood on it a meal was laid out upon the table for carrie expected that leland would arrive during the next hour in fact a horse stood ready saddled in one of the stables and she was trying to decide whether she should ride out to meet him or stay where she was it was a still night the house was unpleasantly hot and the thought of a canter through the cool darkness was attractive leland who was busier than ever had however been away somewhat frequently of late and pride was still strong in her she would not unbend too far or give him reason to believe that he could be sure of her while there was also the difficulty that urmston who was then sitting close by would probably insist upon accompanying her and she fancied that such an arrangement might not commend itself to her husband urmston too had been growing somewhat presumptuous and she felt that on the whole it might not be advisable to have him for a companion something however urged her to set out though she would not admit that it was the thought of lelands satisfaction at meeting her she had scarcely seen him except for an odd five minutes during the last week or two and that piqued her although she knew that he had many anxieties and much to do there was it seemed nothing to be gained by being unduly gracious so long as he was content without her company  this was perhaps a little hard upon leland who was then toiling at something or in the saddle from early morning to late at night he had a good many teams to be fed and hay was scarce after the unusually dry spring hay is seldom sown in that country and as the natural grass is for the most part only a few inches high the prairie farmer must cut it where it grows harsh and tall in the sloos or hollows that are turned for a few weeks into lakes and ponds by the melting snows most of them had dried up prematurely that season and as the supply of the natural produce was becoming a serious question leland had to make long journeys in search of it on the night in question the men were camped beside a distant sloo though he himself purposed to ride home calling on one of his neighbours on the way while carrie considered whether she would set out to meet him or not urmston glanced at the tray upon the table with a sly little laugh  you are getting domesticated carrie he said i used to fancy that you looked down upon anything connected with housekeeping be warned and dont go too far you saw what domesticity has done for mrs custer  she seems happy said the girl reflectively custer i believe is in his own way very kind to her  there was a trace of wistfulness in her voice that jarred upon the listener and the colour rose in his face  carrie he said with sudden passion the possibility of you ever becoming like her is horriblewholly horrible there is much that custer is responsible for one can see what that woman was before she married him and what has happened to her since is a warning the struggle has worn all the daintiness and refinement out of her with that brood of children to be provided for what has she to look forward to but a life of hard work that will steadily drag her to the level of an english dairy drudge  carrie shivered a little for there was she knew some truth in this there is she said a considerable difference between charley leland and tom custer  of course and urmston who appeared to put a restraint upon himself smiled drily in his own halfanimal fashion custer is as you mention evidently fond of her if he hadnt been she might have escaped part at least of what she had to put up with im not sure one couldnt term it degradation the difference between the man you married and custer is the one thing i am sincerely thankful for  reggie said carrie sharply i should like to know just what you mean  urmston laughed i suppose im presuming but i dont seem to mind your husband is at least content to leave you very much alone he apparently comes home to eat and when he is no longer hungry disappears again it does not seem to matter that he generally gets his meals alone i fancy it is a week since i have seen him  he stopped and leant forward a little in his chair i didnt say it to hurt you carrie but because the fact that it is so is and must necessarily be an unutterable relief to me the indifference of such a man is incomparably better than what he would probably consider his affection you can see what it has brought mrs custer  carrie leland flushed angrily it is not especially pleasant to any woman to be told that although she may not be fond of him her husband or lover is indifferent to her but it was not that alone which brought the blood tingling to her face she was capable of passion but domesticity in itself had no great attraction for her in fact she rather shrank from it and urmstons words had been unpleasantly prophetic since she knew that the placid affection of a man who only expected that she should rear a brood of children and keep his house in order would become intolerable to her still she felt that this at least would never be her husbands view concerning her and that there was a much greater difference than urmston realised between him and thomas custer leland in fact had by a clean life of effort and grim selfdenial in which the often wornout body was held in stern subjection to the will attained a vague indefinite something which was not far removed from spirituality  reggie she said what have i done that would lead you to believe you were warranted in speaking to me in this fashion  the man made a little passionate gesture oh he said nothing you are in everything beyond reproach that is what makes it so hard to bear why should you be wasted upon a man without appreciation  that is enough as carrie checked him with a lifted hand a sparkle came into her eyes do you suppose for a moment that i would listen to anything further  urmston sat silent his face flushed and his fingers fumbling with his watchchain for five minutes neither of them spoke it was very still in the big room save for the crackling of the stove then carrie started with a little gasp for the door swung softly open apparently of itself and she grasped urmstons arm  shut it be quick she said  urmston swung round and she felt the involuntary move he made when his eyes rested on the door there were in the house as both remembered only eveline annersly who had retired early with a headache and mrs nesbit who would have come in by the other entrance doors do not open of their own accord when there is not a breath of wind astir and it is somewhat disconcerting when they appear to do so in the middle of the night urmston accordingly sat where he was watching the opening grow wider his nerves atingle with something akin to fear carrie gripped him hard  get charleys rifle she whispered  at last with no great alacrity he rose to his feet but the time when he might have done anything had passed for a masked man stood just inside the threshold with a big pistol in his hand  i guess youll stop just where you are he said  urmston stood still as most men would have done though lelands rifle hung close above his head the stranger moved forward a pace or two he wore soft moccasins and a strip of grainbag pierced at the eyes and bound about his face added nothing to his attractiveness  dont move mrs leland he said where is your husband  carrie straightened herself with an effort she did not like the mans tone nor his inquiry urmston was close beside her but she felt that she had not much to expect from him though she was too distracted to feel any contempt for him on that account  i dont know she said why do you want him  the man appeared to smile well he said i guess theres a reason for it but if hes willing to be reasonable nobodys going to hurt him in fact we just want to make a little bargain  carrie glanced at the watch on her bracelet which was another of the things which her husband had given her and realised he might be home at any time during the next halfhour then she glanced covertly towards the other door which led to the kitchen but it was some distance away and the stranger had a pistol an almost paralysing fear came upon her for she knew her husband was not the man to be driven into doing anything he did not like the stranger watched her with eyes that glittered wickedly behind the mask  you know where he went he said  i do said carrie a trifle too swiftly as she remembered that he would not be there now he rode out to the sloos on the traverse trail to cut prairie hay  exactly and the man laughed only he went away again or we wouldnt have come on here now there are four or five of us and we want a word with your husband and mean to have it its not going to take us two minutes to find out if hes in the house  then why dont you do it  the man looked at her with obvious admiration though there was fear in her heart there was none in her face she had the pride of her station and every inborn prejudice in her protested against submission to any dictation from this intruding ruffian there was a gleam in her dark eyes and the red spot showed in her otherwise colourless cheeks again  well said the outlaw i guess we mean to but im not going to leave you while you and your partner sneak away  he raised his voice hes not here tom but you may as well go round and make sure of it  there was a tramp of booted feet in the hall outside and then footsteps on the stairs first mounting and then again descending no a voice said he hasnt come home  light out and tell the others ill fix things with the lady said his comrade in the room then he turned to urmston youre a little too near that rifle get across there  urmston crossed the room as he was bidden for which one could scarcely blame him and the man sat down where he could watch them both  now he said im talking mrs leland you listen to me we are going to see your husband and it might be better if we saw him here if you can persuade him to be reasonable you will please the boys and me well its only natural that you should know where he is and you cant do anything old jakes fast asleep in his shed and theres not a boy about the homestead  still said carrie quietly i havent the least intention of telling you anything  the man showed his impatience in a gesture  then i guess all we have to do is to wait for him but i cant quite figure why you should be willing to make trouble for yourself everybody knows you dont care two cents for charley leland  carrie winced and felt she could have struck urmston when she saw the little sardonic smile in his eyes her face grew almost colourless with anger and she closed one hand at her side something which had been latent within her was now wholly roused and dominant she knew that what the man had said was wholly untrue and that her husbands safety depended then on her she did not suppose for a moment that he would yield because of anything these men could do and it was clear that they were desperate men with a bitter grievance against him they might even kill him and she resolutely grappled with a numbing fear she dared not let it master her for something must be done and once more she felt that she had only herself to depend upon  charley leland will make you sorry for that some day she said  the man grinned it is quite likely he is going to be sorry for himself before we are through with him anyway i dont know any reason why i shouldnt eat his supper ive ridden most of forty miles today trailing him  he drew the tray upon the table nearer to him and ate voraciously while carrie grew faint with apprehension as she watched him urmston who had taken out a cigar sat motionless save that he fumbled with it instead of his watchchain the room was once more very still except for the snapping of the stove and the unpleasant sounds the outlaw made over his meal time was flying and leland might arrive at any moment now she feared that the other men were hidden beside the trail through the birch bluff waiting to waylay him  then the outlaw turned to her i guess it would be nice to be waited on by a lady and it might please charley leland when he hears of it id like some coffee and i see the pot here bring me the kettle  carrie looked at urmston at any risk he would surely resent this insult to her but though there was a shade more colour than usual in his cheeks urmston sat still then in a flash the inspiration came with a glance towards the rear door which led to the kitchen she rose with the kettle in her hand the lamp stood upon the table about a yard from the man but as he was sitting a little nearer to her  will you hold out the pot she said its scalding hot take care of your hand  the man turned his eyes a moment and that was enough for before he looked up again carrie swung the kettle round and there was a crash as it struck the lamp then there was sudden darkness out of which rang venomous expletives and howls of pain carrie sped towards the second door she heard the man falling among the chairs behind her and wasted another moment or two turning the key which was outside this cost her an effort for the lock was rusty from disuse then she flitted along the dark corridor and opening the kitchen door softly looked out upon the prairie there was no moon and the night was still and dark she could hear no sound on that side of the homestead  slipping out she crept in quiet haste along the wall and with wildly beating heart crossed the open space between it and the stable nobody however attempted to stop her and in another moment or two she was standing beside the horse which jake had ready saddled the animal was fresh and mettlesome and she lost several precious minutes before she contrived to get into the saddle by scrambling on a mound of sod piled against the outside of the building then she struck him viciously with the quirt one cut was all that was needed and they were flying out into the darkness at a furious gallop  she knew that her flight was heard for shouts rose behind her but she knew too that her horse was fresh and the outlaws tired after a hard days ride it was also very probable that his comrades had tethered their horses somewhere while they watched the trail since it is usually difficult to keep a prairie broncho quiet very long all this flashed upon her while the lights of prospect blinked and vanished as the barns and stables shut them in with a sigh of relief she brought the quirt down again  there were stars in the heavens but the night was dark and she could just discern an outlying birch bluff a shadowy blur against the sky a mile in front of her the prairie was rutted deep along the trail by waggonwheels and riddled here and there with deadly badgerholes but these were hazards that must be taken as they came one thing was surethe man she had married was in imminent peril and she alone could deliver him the fact that urmston was left behind in the outlaws hands did not seem to trouble her indeed she scarcely remembered him at all  she swept on her light skirt blown about her her loosened hair whipping her hot face while a thud of hoofs broke out behind her the horses blood was up too so she let him go stretched out at a flying gallop up low rise and over long level the birches flashed by and the open waste lay in front while nobody riding that pace could find the trail there was a shallow coulee a league away with stunted birches on the edge of it which would presently rise for a landmark out of the prairie once she glanced over her shoulder there was only the soft darkness out of which there came a thumping that seemed to be growing fainter  she was almost upon the birches when she heard another beat of hoofs in front of her now and she sent up a breathless cry  charley she called and again in fierce impatience charley  for a moment she was conscious of a torturing suspense and then a mans voice came out of the darkness in answer  all right it said im coming straight along  in another few moments a shadowy figure had materialised out of the prairie she pulled her horse up with a struggle when leland drew bridle beside her  steady my dear he said get your breath and tell me what it is  carrie gasped out her news and the man sat silent a moment or two  urmstons there and mrs annersly he said i dont think theyll hurt them but id better get on  carrie leant out from the saddle and attempted to touch his bridle as the fidgeting horses pranced side by side  no she said you mustnt i will not have you go i think they mean to kill you  leland appeared to smile i guess that contract would be a little too big for them still if urmston riled them they might hurt him the mans a friend of yours  carrie laughed somewhat bitterly i dont think he will do anything very injudicious eveline annerslys room is just across the house and she sleeps very soundly  they wouldnt hurt her said leland reflectively one could count on that urmston would be all right too if he has sense enough to keep quiet now there are two of griers troopers camping in a bluff a league back to watch the trail and if i could only bring them up before the rustlers go we ought to get one or two of them its most worth while trying youll ride round with me  nothing more was said when carrie signified that she was willing and they rode on again to where the troopers were then with these reinforcements they turned back to prospect arriving there when dawn was climbing into the sky there was no sign of the rustlers but urmston stood just outside the door  they went soon after mrs leland got away he said i feel that i ought to make excuses for leaving the thing to her though im not sure that there was in view of the circumstances any other course open to me  leland laughed as he swung himself from the saddle thats all right you did the sensible thing and nobodys going to blame you he said if you dont mind rousing jake well get the troopers breakfast before they go away you know your way to the stables boys  urmston and the troopers disappeared and carrie looked down on her husband who stood a shadowy figure beside her stirrup  you she said with a little soft laugh would have found another course  leland said nothing but stretched his arms up and when she slipped from the saddle into them held her there while he kissed her     chapter xix  prairie hay   it was the middle of a scorching afternoon when carrie drew her waggon over a low rise and down the long slope to the driedup sloo urmston riding beside it sprinkled white with dust looked uncomfortably hot and eveline annersly whose face was unpleasantly flushed tried in vain to shelter herself beneath her parasol in the jolting waggon  i am positively melting and my head aches she said if i had known how hot it was you would never have got me here and if mrs custer will keep me i am not going back to prospect tonight how does your husband work this weather  carrie laughed as she pulled her team up near the sloo she at least looked delightfully fresh and almost cool in her long white dress and big white hat  he would probably tell you it is because he has to she said in any event he seems to be working rather harder than ever  it is one of charley lelands strong points that he knows when a thing has to be done and eveline annersly glanced at urmston with a little smile there are men who dont and never will though they are sometimes able to shift the consequences on to the shoulders of other people  then she turned and blinked about her with halfdazed eyes in front of the waggon a haze of dust floated up against the intense blueness of the sky and under it a belt of tall harsh grass rustled drily in the scant hot breeze everything seemed white and suffused with brightness beyond them the parched grey prairie rolled back to the horizon there was no shade anywhere nor so far as the eye could travel a single speck of green  and this is a prairie sloo she said i had pictured a nice cool lake where the wild duck swim charley is presumably haymaking though i never saw it done this way before  the dust settled a little and with a clashing tinkle there came out of it three big teams and lurching machines the grass went down before them crackling harshly and the horses plodded on with tossing heads and whipping tails amidst a cloud of flies men followed behind them heaping the hay in piles and across the mown strip of sloo more men almost naked were flinging the last of the mounds into a waggon there is no need of turning and winnowing in that country the one thing necessary is to find grass tall enough to cut and get it home before the fires do the reaping  the big machines came nearer with a clash and clatter and gleam of sliding knives and leland swinging his team out from the grass got down from his drivingseat  wheres my jacket tom he said to the man on the machine behind his  i expect it has gone home you pitched it into the waggon said tom gallwey who swinging off his hat as his team went by plunged into the dust again  leland moved forward with a deprecatory gesture as he stopped beside the waggon he wore a coarse blue shirt and old jean trousers both of which were smeared with black grease on which the dust had settled for one of the mowers had given him trouble that morning there was dust too on his dripping face and bare arms which were scarred here and there still the thin attire lent a certain grace to his wiry figure and he appeared the personification of strength and activity from another point of view his appearance was however distinctly against him and carrie fancied she knew what urmston was thinking as he sat still in his saddle immaculate save for a sprinkling of dust in neat boots straw hat and tweed the difference between the men would have had its effect upon her once but now she looked down at leland with an understanding smile  you have been mowing all the time she said  since sunup and leland laughed i couldnt give the teams more than an hours rest either we have to clean this sloo up by dark  carrie glanced at the great belt of grass and wondered how it was to be done  it looks out of the question and its very hot she said couldnt you stop a little earlier for once and ride over to the range mrs custer half expects you at supper  she evidently wanted him to come and leland who seemed to feel it glanced back irresolutely at the sloo  im afraid not he said its quite a way and i havent a horse the others couldnt get done by dark without me and we couldnt come back here tomorrow youll have to excuse me  carrie was displeased though she would not show it for she had seen the smile of satisfaction in urmstons eyes appearances she knew counted for a good deal with him as much in fact as they had once done with her and she would sooner he had not been there when the dusty haymaker made it evident that he was unwilling to leave his work although she had suggested that this would please her  i suppose its necessary she said  leland appeared to hesitate a moment i must get this grass home tonight but if its not too late i would like you to drive round and pick me up it would get me back most an hour earlier  carrie was sensible with a little annoyance that urmston was watching her well she said i cant exactly promise it will depend upon when mrs custer lets us go  just then a light waggon came jolting down the opposite slope and its driver pulled his team up when it drew even with them  ive some letters for prospect and you have saved me most a leagues ride that counts on a day like this he said  leland caught the packet from him and handed one or two of the letters to urmston the man drove on again as carries waggon also jolted away leland leant against the wheel of the mower opening those addressed to him gallwey who was passing pulled his team up and looked down at him inquiringly  anything of consequence he said  leland shrugged a weary shoulder the usual thing he said the implement man wants his money now though i understood he was going to wait until harvest the fellow in winnipeg cant sell the horses theres a letter from the bank too if i purpose drawing on them further theyd like something as security the rest are unpleasantly big accounts from the stores  then he thrust the papers into his pocket with a harsh laugh im not going to straighten things out by standing here and they want a lot  he called to his horses and the mower clashed on again the dust rose and settled on his face once more set hard and grim as he was toiling on with the perspiration dripping from him urmston rode beside carries waggon exchanging light badinage with her carrie was feeling a trifle hurt but she would not have either of her companions become aware of it urmston she noticed did not open his letters after they had been an hour at the range he came with one of them in his hand into the room where she sat his face was flushed and there was an anxious look in his eyes he glanced round the shadowy room where is eveline annersly he asked  carrie smiled absently though something in his attitude caused her a slight uneasiness looking at mrs custers turkeys i believe she said it shows her goodnature because i dont think they appeal to her any more than they do to me  urmston stood a moment or two as though listening there was no sound from the buildings outside and the house was very still he moved forward closer to her and leant upon the table his hand clenched on the letter  i have been endeavouring to get rid of that insufferable custer for the last hour he said there is something i have to tell you  well the incisive monosyllable expressed inquiry without encouragement  the men i came out with are going on north to edmonton and expect me to go with them in fact they have been good enough to intimate that they are astonished at my long absence and it is evident that if i am to go on with the thing i must leave prospect today or tomorrow  well said carrie with a disconcerting lack of disquietude you couldnt expect them to wait indefinitely  the man gazed at her in evident astonishment dont you understand i couldnt get back here from edmonton  that is tolerably evident  urmston looked his disappointment but he roused himself with an effort carrie he said i cant go you dont wish me to  carrie looked at him steadily though there was now a faint flush in her cheeks  i think it would be better if you told me exactly what you mean by that she said  is it necessary to ask me you know that i loved youand i love you now if you had been happy i might have hid my feelingsat least i would have triedbut when i find you with a ploughman husband who could never understand or appreciate you silence becomes impossible he cares nothing for you and neglects you openly  the girl glanced down at the ring on her finger still she said with portentous calm that implies a good deal  urmston grew impatient pshaw he said hoarsely one goes past conventions you never loved him in the least how could you it would have been preposterous  and i once loved you well perhaps i did but let us be rational what is all this leading to  her dispassionate quietness should have warned him but it merely jarred on his fastidiousness he was not then in a mood for accurate observation  only that i cannot go away he said this summer was meant for us leland thinks of nothing cares for nothing but his farm he has not even feeling enough to be jealous of you  ah said carrie while the red spot grew plainer in her cheek and then a summer after all does not last very long  the man appeared embarrassed and confused at the girls hard insistent tones  go on she said sharply what is to happen when the summer is gone  again urmston was silent with the blood in his face carrie leland slowly rose for a moment she said nothing but he winced beneath her gaze  you do not know she said well i think i can tell you when i had earned my husbands hate and contempt you would go back to england you would not even take me with you and you would certainly go for what would you do in this country the life the men here lead would crush you of course you realised it before you came to me today  urmston made a gesture of protest but she silenced him with a flash from her eyes  i have had patience with you because there was a time when i loved you but you shall hear me now if you had shown yourself masterful and willing to risk everything for me when we were at barrockholme i think i should have gone away with you and forsaken my duty but you were cautiousand half afraid you could not even make love boldly indeed i wonder how i ever came to believe in such a feeble thing as you  but said urmston hoarsely you led me on  again carrie silenced him wait she said did you suppose that if i hated my husband and loved you still i could have requited all that he has done for me with treachery do you think i have no sense of honour or any sense of shame it was only for one reason i let you go as far as you have done i wanted to see if there was a spark of courage or generosity in you because i should have liked to think as well as i could of you there was none after the summer youwould have gone away  she hesitated with a catch of her breath reggie she said do you suppose that even if you had courage enough to suggest it anything would induce me to leave my husband becauseyouasked me to  the man winced again and his face grew even hotter beneath her gaze  you would have done so once he said as though nothing else occurred to him  and i should have been sorry ever since even if i had never understood the man i have married as it is i would rather be charley lelands slave or mistress than your wife  at last the mans eyes blazed you can love that ploughman that halftamed brute  carrie laughed softly yes she said i love him if it is any consolation i think it was partly you who taught me to  there was a moments silence and then urmston who heard footsteps in the hall swung round as eveline annersly came in she looked at them both with a comprehending smile for she was shrewd and their faces made comparatively plain the nature of what had taken place  i wonder she said if i am intruding  no said carrie in fact i think reggie would like to say goodbye to you he is going away today  ah said eveline annersly the twinkle still in her eyes i really think that is wise of him he must be keeping the farming experts waiting indeed im not sure it wouldnt have been more considerate if he had gone before  urmston said nothing but went out to make his excuses to custer in another halfhour he was riding to the railroad across the prairie carrie watched him from the homestead until at last he sank behind the crest of a low rise then she went back into the house with a little sigh of relief eveline annersly who was in the room when she came in smiled curiously  i am not going back tonight the sun has given me a headache for one thing she said besides that mrs custer insists on keeping me for a day or two you can drive round for charley  the waggon said carrie will easily hold three  her companion looked at her with twinkling eyes i almost think two will be enough tonight  carrie made no answer but did as was suggested it was about nine oclock that evening when she pulled her team up beside the sloo leland who had found his jacket and brushed off some of the dust was standing there beside a pile of prairie hay there was nobody else in sight a row of loaded waggons and teams loomed black against the sunset at the edge of the prairie there was a fond gleam in his eyes as he looked up at carrie  eveline annersly is staying all night she said you will be worn out there is almost a load of the hay left  leland looked at the big pile of grass we couldnt get that lot up unfortunately its a long way to come back tomorrow  well said carrie merrily this waggon must have cost you a good deal and it is one of the few things about prospect that has never done anything to warrant its being there i really dont think a little clean hay would harm it  leland appeared astonished you are sure you wouldnt mind he asked  of course not i will help you to load it if you will hand me down  the gleam in lelands eyes was plainer when he reached up and grasped her hands carrie who remembered what had happened last time shrank from the caress she half expected perhaps leland realised it with his quick intuition for he merely swung her down then she threw in the hay by the armful while he plied the fork the soft green radiance that precedes the coming dusk hung above the prairie when he roped the load down securely it was piled high about the drivingseat of the waggon making a warm fragrant resting place into which he lifted his wife then as the team moved on slowly he turned and looked at her  thank you my dear he said that was very kind  carrie flushed surely not when you have so much to do it saves you a long drive tomorrow doesnt it but why were you waiting i did not promise to come round and you could have ridden home on one of the waggons it must be six miles  well said leland seriously it seemed quite worth while to wait most of the night even if id had to walk in afterwards i knew mrs annersly meant to stay and you and i have had only one drive together  carrie felt her cheeks grow warm again her usual composure had vanished during that other journey she had lain halt frozen in his arms there had been snow upon the prairie then and she had shrunk from him but it was summer now and all was different the hay overhung and projected all about them so that there was very little room on the drivingseat and she felt her heart throbbing as she sat pressed close against his shoulder leland said nothing and the waggon jolted on through the silent night to the tune of horses hoofs while the green transparency faded into the dusky blueness of the night     chapter xx  an understanding   a deep stillness hung over the prairie and the stars were high and dim while the waggon jolted on though the team moved slowly leland had apparently no wish to hurry them a clean aromatic smell of wild peppermint floated about the pair on the drivingseat as the faint dew damped the load behind them they sat in a hollow of the fragrant grass and the softness and the warmth of it were pleasant for as sometimes happens at that season the night was almost chill the other teams had vanished and they rode on over the vast shadowy levels alone every rattle of the harness every creak of jarring wheels rang through the silence with a startling distinctness  some vague influence in it all reacted upon the girl and she sat very still pressed close against lelands shoulder content to be there and almost afraid to speak lest what she should say might rudely break the charm she knew now what she felt for the man at her side and remembered what eveline annersly had said it was fit that she should cleave to him since they were one leland finally spoke  urmston did not come back with you  no said carrie realising that the crisis was at hand and yet almost afraid to precipitate it he rode in to the railroad  leland called to the horses before he spoke again  carrie he said slowly any of your friends are welcome at prospect and especially mrs annersly but i have felt for some little while now that i must ask you why that man is staying here so long  the girl summoned her selfcontrol with an effort for she felt she must play the part she had decided on but she felt her heart beat as she moved a little so that she could look up at her companion he had moved too and though his face showed but vaguely she could feel that his eyes were fixed upon her  the night you would not have mrs heaton here you said something that made me very angry though from your point of view you were right she said i think we must understand each other once for all do you consider it necessary to remind me of the same thing now  no said leland still quietly though there was a suggestion of tension in his voice i was ashamed of it afterwards i lost my temper i know you have too much pride and honesty not to keep your bargain to the letter and i am not in the least jealous of urmston you have my ring upon your hand how could i be still one has now and then to talk plainly urmston is a man who might take much for granted and presume your good name is precious to me  thank you for that you do not know that there was a time when if circumstances had been propitious i would have married reggie urmston  leland appeared to smile i think i knew that too  and you said nothing when he came here  my dear said leland gravely i had by that time perfect confidence in you the clean pride that held you away from me would keep you safe in spite of anything that such a man might do or say  well said carrie with a calm dignity he will never come back again i have sent him away  she felt the man start and saw his hands tighten on the reins  carrie he said you will tell me more if you wish if not it doesnt matter there is another thing i want to say i have often been sorry for you but i felt that you would not find it quite so hard some day that is why i waitedi think very patientlythough it was a little hard on me too i thought i knew what you must feelindeed you showed it to meand i was horribly afraid that if i was too hasty i might lose you  and that would have troubled you  leland turned again and his voice was a trifle hoarse my dear i do not understand these things i have been too busy to worry about my feelings but i know that while i only admired you at barrockholme something else that was different soon took hold of me and kept on growing stronger the more i saw of you i think it first gripped me hard the night you told me what you thought of methough why then i dont know now i am sure at least that it will never let me go  then his selfrestraint failing him he slipped an arm about her and held her tightly to him carrie he said harshly it is getting too hard for me do you know that now and then something almost drives me into taking you into my arms and crushing you into submission i could do it nowthe touch of you almost maddens me this cant go on i have felt lately that you were growing kinder and shrank from me less after all i am a man and nothing more how long do you mean to keep me waiting  carrie laughed softly with a little catch of her breath bend your head a little charley she said i have something to tell you  as he did her bidding she stretching up a soft warm arm round his neck drew his face down to hers his hand closed convulsively on her waist  charley she said again it neednt go on any longer than you wish i dont want it to i only want you to love me now  the man laughed almost fiercely in his exultation for a space she lay crushed and breathless beneath his engirdling arm with his kisses hot upon her lips when at last his grasp relaxed her head with the big white hat all crushed and crumpled was still upon his breast her cheeks were burning and her blood ran riot for she was one who did nothing by half as she clung to him in an ecstasy of complete and irrevocable surrender the man broke out into a flood of disjointed halfcoherent unrestrained words  it was worth while waitingeven if i had waited yearsthough now and then you almost drove me mad he said your daintiness your pride the clean hard grit that was in you made me want to take you in my arms and break you and make you yield still i knew somehow that was not the way with you and i held myself in it was hardoh it was hard the beauty of you your freshness your beautiful little hands even the coldness in your face set me on fire at times they were mine you belonged to me and yet i would claim nothing that went with your dislike i wanted you to give them all to me  carrie laughed though there was a little break in her voice they are yours and so am i only you must think them preciousand never let me go  then she stretched her arm up and slipped it round his neck again charley at the very first what was it made you want to marry me  well said leland with an air of reflection havent you hair as softly dusky as the sky up there and eyes so deep and clear that one can see the wholesome thoughts down in the depths of them havent you hands and arms that look like alabaster until one feels the gracious warmth beneath  and a vixenish temper if i ever show it to you you must shake me and shake me hard there was a time when you did it and left a blue mark on my shoulder but i deserved it and now i wouldnt mind i would sooner have you shake me every day than never think of me still you havent told me what i asked you yet  leland stooped and kissed the shoulder when a man looks at you he can see a hundred reasons for wanting you and every one sufficient  still that was not all if you do not tell me i shall ask aunt eveline and i think she knows dont you see that we must understand everything tonight  then it seemed to me it would be a horrible thing to marry you to aylmer  carrie drew her breath in oh she said i always fancied it was that and i could love you if it was only for saving me from him then she broke out into a little soft laugh charley it was the wrong shoulder you kissed  that is very easily set right and the man bent down again as he looked up he called sharply to the horses and shook the reins  i wonder how long we have been waiting here he said i suppose you havent noticed that the team has stopped  they rode on again in silence seldom broken into a land of beatific visions with a little wistful sense of regret they saw prospect at last rise black and shadowy against the big birch bluff the teamsters however had not gone to sleep yet and leland leaving the waggon to one of them walked silently with carrie towards the house he stooped and kissed her as they crossed the threshold  from now on it is home he said i only want to please you and you must tell me when i fail  they went in together and he lighted the big lamp you had supper with mrs custer but that is quite a while ago and there should be a little fire yet in the cookshed stove he said is there anything i can make you  carrie laughed as she took off the big crumpled hat and flung it on the table  no she said you will sit still while i see what can be found it will be my part to cook and bake and wait on you i almost think if it were necessary i could drive a team too  they decided it by going into the cookshed together and late as it was carrie wasted a good deal of flour attempting to make flapjacks under her husbands direction achieving a general disorder that mrs nesbit surveyed with astonishment next morning but the good souls astonishment grew when she came upon carrie setting the table in the big room at least half an hour before leland came in for his early breakfast  i guess youre not going to want me much longer and its hardly likely that charley leland will either she said  carries face flushed oh yes she said you must stay here and teach me everything that a farmers wife ought to know i am afraid you will be a long while doing it  the hardfeatured woman smiled at her in a very kindly fashion  youre going to find it all worth while she said  carrie set about it that morning and her sympathy with mrs custer grew stronger with every hour she spent in mrs nesbits company for it was evident that there was a great deal a woman could do at prospect too indeed although she had already taken a spasmodic interest in the work what she was taught before evening left her more than a little confused and by no means pleased with herself it was disconcerting to be brought suddenly face to face with the realities of life and the conviction that things did not run smoothly of themselves she realised for the first time almost with dismay that by coldly standing aside while the others toiled she had made her husbands burden heavier than it need have been she had perhaps not altogether unnaturally fallen into the habit of assuming that it was only fit that all she desired should be obtained for her and had never inquired about the effort it entailed but as this point of view did not seem quite warranted now she resolved that the future should be different finally realising her obligations she did not shrink from the responsibility  eveline annersly coming home that evening found her sitting deep in thought by the window of her room a new softness in her eyes she drew up a chair close by and sat looking at her in a shrewd way that the girl appeared to find disconcerting  carrie she said i wonder if you know that you look quite as well in that simple dress as you do in your usual evening one still your hair is a little ruffled surely you havent been rubbing it against somebodys shoulder  carrie leland blushed crimson which was somewhat remarkable as it was a thing she was by no means in the habit of doing  well she said with a little musical laugh there was no reason why i shouldnt it was my husbands  then she rose impulsively and drawing up a footstool sank down beside eveline annersly and slipped an arm about her  i think you know she said at least you have done what you could to bring it about for ever so long we are friends at last charley and i  that is pleasant to hear still im not sure it would quite satisfy charley havent you gone any further  carries face was hidden as she replied in a voice that quavered a bit i think we are lovers too she murmured  well said her companion if he had known all i do you might have been that some time ago in fact it would have pleased me if he had slapped you occasionally if you had made him believe what you tried it is very probable that you would never have forgiven yourself but i think you ought to be more than lovers  feeling a tremor of emotion run through the girl she stooped and kissed her halfhidden cheek carrie looked up  charley is my husbandand all that is worth having to me she said he is sure of it at last i have told him so  she sat silent for a minute and then turned a little and took out a letter  its from jimmy she said it was among charleys papers and he gave it to me when we came home  he wants something said mrs annersly drily  yes and carries voice was quietly contemptuous jimmy it seems is in difficulties again if he hadnt been he would not have written of course it is only a loan  you have a banking account in winnipeg  i have i owe it to my husbands generosity and i shall probably want it very soon do you suppose that while charley is crushed with anxiety and working from dawn to dusk i would send jimmy a penny  well said eveline annersly reflectively i really dont fancy it would be advisable but this is rather a sudden change on your part not long ago you wouldnt let me say a word against anybody at barrockholme  carrie laughed in a somewhat curious fashion everything has changed all that is mine i want for charley and while he needs it there is nothing for anybody else  she stopped for a moment aunt eveline there are my mothers pearls and diamonds which i think i should have had i did not like to ask for them but i always understood they were to come to me when i was married i dont quite understand why my father never mentioned them  mrs annersly looked thoughtful i am under very much the same impression in fact i am almost sure they should have been handed to you still what could you do with them here  i may want them presently  in that case you had better write and ask for them very plainly  carrie rose with a determined expression in her face well i must go down she said charley will be here in a few minutes i see the teams coming back from the sloos  eveline annersly sat thoughtfully still the jewels in question were she knew of considerable value for that very reason she was far from sure that carrie could ever have the goodwill of anybody at barrockholme if she insisted on her rights of possession     chapter xxi  a willing sacrifice   three weeks had slipped away since the evening carrie leland had asked about her mothers jewels when she and eveline annersly once more referred to them as they sat in her room a little before the supper hour the window was wide open and the blaze of sunlight that streamed in fell upon carrie as she took up a letter from the little table before her  only a line or two to say the casket has been sent she said with a halfsuppressed sigh one could almost fancy they did not care what had become of me at barrockholme i might have passed out of their lives altogether  im not sure its so very unusual in the case of a married woman said her companion a trifle drily besides it is quite possible that your father was not exactly pleased at having to give the jewels up in fact it may have been particularly inconvenient for him to do so they are worth a good deal of money  still they really belong to me  yes said eveline annersly they evidently do or you would not have got them of course it would be a more usual thing for them to have gone to jimmys wife when he married but they were your mothers and as you know they came from her family it was her wish that you should have them though i was never quite sure it was mentioned in her will in fact to be candid i am a little astonished that you have got them  carries face flushed  aunt she said i dont like to think of it and i would not admit it to anybody else but i felt what you are suggesting when i wrote for them still i would have had them even at the cost of breaking with them all at barrockholme  i expected a break hadnt you better open the casket  in a few minutes said carrie leaving the room  she wore a dinnergown when she returned sitting down at the table she opened the little metalbound box before her there was an inner box and when she opened that in turn the sunlight struck a blaze of colour from the contents of the little velvet trays carrie looked at them with a curious softness in her eyes when she turned to her companion however there was a lingering wistfulness in her smile  i cant resist putting them onjust this once she said i shall probably never do it again  her companion watched her gravely as she placed a diamond crescent in her dusky hair and then hung a string of pearls about her neck they were exceptionally beautiful but it was the few rubies that followed them and the gleam of the same stones set in the delicate bracelet the girl clasped on her wrist that roused eveline annersly who had seen them before to a little gasp of admiration the bloodred stones shone with a wonderful lustre on the polished whiteness of carries neck and arm  they were of course never meant for a necklet and your mother had always intended to have them properly set but i suppose money was scarce at barrockholme then she said you look positively dazzling but you carry them well my dear  carrie turned to the mirror in front of her and surveyed herself for a minute with a curious gravity then the little wistful look once more crept into her eyes after all she had been accustomed to the smoother side of life and the beauty of the gems appealed to her she had worn some of them once or twice before and had seen them stir mens admiration and other womens longing at brilliant functions in the old country she also knew that they became her wonderfully well and yet it was scarcely likely she would put them on again then she heard a little gasp and turning suddenly saw mrs nesbit gazing at her from the doorway in bewildered admiration  the boys are coming in shall i have the table set for supper she said  not yet said carrie you might ask mr leland to come up i want him  mrs nesbit went out apparently still lost in wonder carrie turned to her companion impulsively  i should like charley to see me as i amfor once she said  five minutes later eveline annersly slipped away as leland came in dressed in worn and faded jean he gave a start of astonishment and a look that almost suggested pain when carrie turned to him she looked imperial in the long graceful dress the diamonds in her dusky hair glinted crystalclear and the rubies gleamed on the polished ivory of her neck but her eyes were more wonderful than any gem in their depths of tenderness then the man saw himself in the mirror bronzed and hot and dusty with hard hands and broken nails and the stain of the soil upon him another glance at her and he turned his eyes away  arent you pleased said carrie  leland turned again slowly with a little sigh one of his brown hands tightly clenched  you are beautiful my dear he said but if you were old and dressed in rags you would always be that to me with those things shining on you you are wonderful but it hurts me to see them  why  they make the difference between us too plain you should wear them always it was what you were meant for and when i married you i had a notion that i might be able to give you such things some day and take you where other people wear them everything however is against me now we may not even keep prospect and you are only the wife of a halfruined prairie farmer  carrie held her arms out i wouldnt be anything else if i could you know that too come and kiss me charley and never say anything of the kind again  the man hesitated and she guessed that he was thinking of his dusty jean  have i lost my attractiveness that you need asking twice she said  leland came towards her and she slipped an arm about his neck regardless of the costly dress taking up his hard brown hand she looked tenderly at the broken nails  ah she said it has worked so hard for me do you think i dont know why you toil late and early this year and never spend a cent on anything that is not for my pleasure i must have cost you a good deal charley  she saw the blood rise into the mans face and laughed softly oh i know it all once i tried to hate you for itand now if it hadnt made it so hard for you i should be almost glad still charley i would do almost anything to make you feel thatit was worth while  my dear said leland hoarsely i have never regretted it and i would not even if i had to turn teamster and let prospect go except for the trouble it would bring you  carrie laughed softly still it will never come to that this hand is too firm and capable to let anything go and i fancy i can do something too after all i do not think mrs custer is very much stronger or cleverer than i am  she pushed him gently away from her now go and get ready for supper i will be down presently  leland went away with glad obedience when eveline annersly came in later she found carrie once more attired very plainly and the casket locked her eyes were a trifle hazy but she looked up with a smile  i shall not put them on again but i do not mind she said they will go to ploughing and harrowing next season there is something to be done beforehand and i want you to come in to the railroad station with me tomorrow  they went down to supper during which carrie was unusually talkative when eveline annersly left them after the meal was over she turned to her husband  charley she said you could get along alone for two or three days if i went into winnipeg  i could said leland still i wouldnt like it but what do you want to go there for  well said carrie reflectively there are two or three things i want and one or two i have to dobusiness things at the bank i had a letter from barrockholme you know i suppose those bankers are really trustworthy people  leland laughed oh yes i think they could be trusted with anything you were likely to put into their hands  well said carrie perhaps i will tell you what it is by and by in the meanwhile since i am going tomorrow there are several things i have to see to  starting next morning with eveline annersly she was on the following day ushered into the managers room at lelands bank the gentleman who sat there appeared a trifle astonished when he saw her as though he had scarcely expected to see the stamp of refinement and station on lelands wife he drew out a chair for her and urbanely asked what he could do for her carrie laid a casket and a small bundle of papers upon the table  i think you are acquainted with my husband she said  certainly said the banker we have had the pleasure of doing business with mr leland of prospect for a good many years  then said carrie decisively you are on no account to tell him about any business you may do for methat is unless i give you permission to do so  the banker concealed any astonishment he may have felt merely saying that it was his part to fall in with his clients wishes carrie held out a passbook  i suppose i could have this money any time i wished she said  certainly you have only to write a cheque for it  carrie opened a paper and handed it to him i have had it all explained to me but i am afraid i dont understand it very well she said until i was married i could get only a little of the money as my trustees gave it to me and they put the rest into an english bank for me i have the book here you will see how much the dividends and interest come to every year  the banker studied the document carefully then he took the passbook she handed him well he said you can do whatever you like with it now quite a sum of money has accumulated  i could put it into your bank here  of course i should be glad to arrange it for you you would also get more interest for it than you seem to have done in england  then i want you to do it you lend people money i wonder if you could let me have as much now as i would get in the next four or five years of course you would charge me for doing it  the banker smiled a little and shook his head as he glanced at the document you will excuse my mentioning that the interest on the money involved is only to be paidto you  ah said carrie of course i might die and then i remember it would go back again still that only makes what i want to do more necessary i suppose i could make over to my husband all the money there is in the english bank and anything else that really belongs to me that is i could put it into his account here you see i dont want him to knowanything about it for a little while  the banker reflected he had done business for years with leland and considered him a friend this dainty womans devotion to her husband appealed to him he decided that he might for once go a little further than was usual from a business point of view well he said reflectively i think i should wait a little if you kept the money in your own name you could hand him as much as you thought advisable at any time it appeared necessary on the whole i fancy that would be wiser  why  again the banker pondered nobody knew better than he how many of the wheatgrowers were near ruin that year and he had naturally an accurate notion of what would probably happen to leland when after harvest the wheat of the west was thrown trainload by trainload upon a lifeless market  i think there are a good many reasons why it is sound advice i am offering you for one thing wheat is still going down you see  carrie made a little gesture of comprehension for financial difficulties had formed a by no means infrequent topic at barrockholme yes she said quietly i understand you will get the money and put it to my name but there is another thing will you please open that casket  the man did so and appeared astonished when he saw its contents these things are very beautiful he said  you could lend me part of their value asked carrie with a little flush in her face  the man looked thoughtful the smaller banking houses in the west are usually willing to handle any business they can get but precious gems are not a commodity with which they are intimately acquainted  they would have to be valued and i fancy that could only be done in montreal he said after getting an experts opinion we could i think advance you a reasonable proportion of what he considered them worth shall i have it done  of course said carrie and went out ten minutes later with a sense of satisfaction she found eveline annersly waiting and smiled as she greeted her i have been arranging things and perhaps i can help charley after all i am afraid he will want it she said now if you wouldnt mind very much we can get the westbound train this afternoon i am anxious to get back to prospect again  eveline annersly would have much preferred to spend that night in a comfortable hotel instead of in a sleepingcar but she made no protest after lunch they spent an hour or two in the prairie city waiting until the train came in ridged with mazy wires and towering telegraphpoles and open to all winds winnipeg stands at the side of its big slow river in the midst of a vast sweep of plain boasting of few natural attractions there is the quick throb of life in its streets as carrie and her aunt made their way through bustling crowds past clanging cars they gradually observed an undertone of slackness in the superficial activity about them the faces they met were sombre and there were few who smiled the lighthearted rush of a western town was missing loungers hung about the newspaper offices and bands of listless immigrants walked the streets aimlessly carrie had heard at prospect that it was usually difficult in the northwest to get men enough to do the work and this air of leisure puzzled her  there was however a reason for this lack of enterprise winnipeg lives by its trade in wheat selling at a profit to the crowded east and scattering its storegoods broadcast across the prairie just then however the world appeared to possess a sufficiency of wheat and flour and the great mills were grinding halftime or less while it happened frequently that western farmers caught by the fall in values could not meet their bills when this happens there is always trouble from the storekeepers and dealers in implements who have supplied them throughout the year carrie caught the despondent tone wondering why she did so since she felt that it would not have impressed her a little while ago perhaps it was because she had then looked upon the toilers with an uncomprehending pity that was half disdain and she had since gained not only sympathy but appreciation she stopped outside the newspaper office where a big placard was displayed  smitten dakota wails it read crops devastated thunder and hail ice does the reaping in minnesota  oh she said i must have a paper  eveline annersly smiled a little it was between the hours of issue and the wholesale office did not look inviting but carrie went in and a clerk who gazed at the very dainty lady with some astonishment gave her a paper  now she said we will go on to the depÃ´t i must sit down and read the thing  by the time she had mastered the gist of it the big train was rolling out with her amidst a doleful clanging of the locomotive bell it was momentous enough the hail which now and then sweeps the northwest had scourged the dakotas and part of minnesota spreading devastation where it went meteorologists predicted that the disturbance would probably spread across the frontier carrie laid down the paper and glanced out with a little shudder of apprehension at the sliding prairie into which town and wires and mills were sinking she was relieved to see that there hung over it a sweep of cloudless blue  there are hundreds ruined and whole crops destroyed she said perhaps the men who sowed them worked as hard as charley it would be dreadful if it came to us  i am afraid it would said eveline annersly still i dont think it would have troubled you when you first came out that is not so very long ago is it  carrie smiled i think i have grown since then she said     chapter xxii  hail   a thin crescent moon hung low in the western sky the prairie was wrapped in silent shadows leland stood outside the homestead with the bridle of an impatient horse in his hand and talked with his wife there was only one light in the house behind them and everything was very still but leland knew that two men who could be trusted to keep good watch were wide awake that night the barrel of a marlin rifle hung behind his shoulders glinting fitfully when it caught the light as he moved without thinking of what he was doing he fingered the clip of the sling  the moon will be down in half an hour and it will be quite dark before i cross the ravine near thorwalds place he said jim thorwald is straight and standing by the law but none of us are quite sure of all of his boys anyway we dont want anybody to know whos riding to the outpost  carrie laid her hand upon his arm i suppose you must go this once at least  of course said leland with a smile if im wanted i must go again the troubles spreading  then said carrie why cant they bring more troopers in why did you ever have anything to do with it charley  it seemed necessary a man has to hold on to what is his  carries fingers tightened on his arm perhaps it is so i suppose it must be but after all i dont think that was your only reason i mean when you started the quarrel no you neednt turn away i want you to look at me  its dark my dear and im glad it is i dont want to talk of those times and if it were light enough to see you im afraid it would melt the resolution out of me  still carrie persisted you know you first quarrelled with the rustlers because you were angry with me  leland laughed softly well perhaps that was the reason though i would sooner believe it was because i recognised what i owed the state  but it is all differentyou are not in the least angry with me now  the moonlight was very dim and showed no more than the pale white oval of her face but leland felt the appeal in her voice and knew that it was also in her eyes  my dear he said quietly how could i be  carrie lifted her hand and laid it on his shoulder charley i cant stop you now but i want you to promise you will not go back again do you know that i sit still shivering when darkness comes while you are away trying not to think of what you may be doing i darent think cant you understand charley that i have only you  feeling how hard it was to leave her and fearing that further tenderness from her might weaken his firm purpose he sought refuge in a frivolous retort  there are still a few of your relatives at barrockholme he said  they never write me perhaps i couldnt expect them to i thought you knew that i had offended them  offended them  carrie laughed a trifle harshly oh she said it is a wifes duty to take her husbands part but after all that is not the question i hadnt meant to mention it it doesnt matter in the least  well said leland i almost think it does anyway if it worries you what have you been falling out with them over carrie  that is not your business they dont care about me now but you do  leland had only one free hand but he slipped it round her waist she sighed contentedly as she felt his protecting clasp  charley you will not go back again she said once more  the man drew his arm away though she could scarcely see his face he appeared to be looking down upon her gravely  it is a little hard not to do what you ask me straight away but i think you can understand he said whatever i went into the thing for i am in it now practically im leader it is not the sergeant the boys look to but me and im not quite sure they would have kept the thing up if i hadnt worried them into doing it still theyll go on now and they would only think of two reasons if i backed down would you like them to fancy the rustlers had bought me over or made me afraid of them  could any one think that and carrie laughed scornfully though her voice grew suddenly soft again it wouldnt matter in the least to me what anybody said  well said leland gravely i most think it would and i should like it to anyway if i backed down it would be because i was afraid in fact im afraid now though i never used to be its a little difficult to tell you this though you know it but when i stirred the boys up i could not be sure you would ever be what you are to me it didnt seem likely then but i made no conditions when the rest stood in with me now i think you see i cant go back on them  carrie made a little nod of agreement and with an effort repressed a sigh for she knew that she had failed her husbands code was simple and perhaps crude but it was at least inflexible after all honour and duty are things well within the comprehension of very simple men indeed it is often the case that where principles are concerned the simplest men have the clearest vision  ah she said with something like a sob then you must go but stand still a minute charley i want to see if the clip i bought you in the winnipeg gunshop is working properly  leland smiled as she pressed a little clasp and then dropping one hand smartly caught the rifle as the sling fell apart carrie had changed suddenly and curiously the pride that was in her had awakened and she was at one with her husband and wholly practical  it is ever so much quicker than passing it over your shoulder and after all you must go she said  she stretched up her arms and kissed him when the man had swung himself into the saddle she looked long after him with eyes that were hazy when he became a blur in the distance she went slowly to the house head proudly erect there eveline annersly greeted her  my dear she said you need not tell me you have been trying to hold your husband back and you have failed the thing was out of the question you might have known  carrie made a little halfwistful gesture though there was a faint glow in her eyes yes i did what i could and now i shall not rest until he comes back again still i think i deserve it and im not sure that i would have him different i think nothing would change charley i used to wonder more than i do now how he who was born on the prairie came to have all the real essential things which were not in any of us at barrockholme  eveline annerslys eyes sparkled and her manner was sardonic its not very explicit but i think i know what you mean havent you lost your faith in the old fetish yet men are mengood bad and indifferentthe world over and though it would be rather nice to believe it we havent and never had a monopoly in our own class of what you call the essentials indeed im not quite sure one couldnt go a little further  she was standing near the open window with the light which was low some distance away from her turning she drew carrie within the heavy curtains the very old and the very new are apt to meet she said there is an example yonder  carrie looked out into the soft moonlight and saw a mounted figure cut against the sky on the crest of a low rise it was indistinct and shadowy but as she gazed she twice caught the gleam of the pale cold light on steel and knew it for the flash of a riflebarrel  oh she said since i came to this country i have felt it too that was how the border spears rode out six hundred years ago Â Â  of course you were right a little while ago i think the things that are essential must always have been the sameprimitive and unchangeable faith and courage have always been needed as they are needed still after all we cannot get away from death and toil and pain  the lonely figure vanished into the night and as her companion moved away carrie let the curtain fall behind her with a little sigh it is getting late and i can only wait and try to think there is no danger until he comes back to me no doubt others have done it back through all the centuries  she went out but eveline annersly sat a while thoughtfully by the open window what she had expected had at last come to pass and she had the satisfaction which does not always attend the efforts of the matrimonial schemer for there was no longer any doubt that carrie leland loved her husband once more as nature will often have it like had drawn to unlike with a fusion of discordant qualities in indissoluble and harmonious union that what the one lacked the other might supply the pair she had brought together were no longer two but one which while she was quite aware that it did not always happen was when it did like the springing up of the wheata mystery and a miracle  eveline annersly was old enough to know that there are many mysteries but that by love alone man may come nearest to their comprehension  then she remembered that it was getting late and leaving the window open for the night was hot and still sought her room and in another halfhour was sound asleep she had slept several hours when she was awakened by a queer sound that seemed to come from outside through the open door it was a dull noise which accustomed as she had grown to the beat of hoofs suggested a company of mounted men riding up out of the prairie the sound kept increasing until she could have fancied that it was made by a regiment and then suddenly swelled into the roar of a brigade of cavalry going by on the gallop the house seemed to reel as under a blow the doors swung to with a crash and there was a clatter of things hurled down in the adjoining room then she rose and flung on a dressinggown and crossing the room stopped when she had clutched the door handle almost afraid to open it bewildered by the indescribable tumult at last a gleam of light appeared between the chinks mustering courage to open the door she saw carrie standing in the room half dressed with a candle in her hand that was just for a moment for the feeble gleam went out and she groped her way through black darkness towards the girl  what is it she gasped  the hail said carrie hoarsely come with me we must shut the window quick  it cost them both an effort and carrie was some little time lighting the lamp when they had accomplished it then eveline annersly sank into the nearest chair with her arm about the shoulders of the girl who knelt beside her even with the windows shut the lamplight flickered and when it fell upon her carries face showed set and white  ah she said the wheat it will all be cut down by morning and charley ruined  it was a minute or two before eveline annersly quite understood her for there was just then a deafening crash of thunder and after it the stout wooden building appeared to rock at the onslaught of an icy wind that struck through every crevice with a stinging chill the hail roared on walls and shingled roof with a bewildering din then the uproar slackened a little and as she glanced towards the melting ice which had beaten into the room it seemed to her scarcely possible that lelands crop could have escaped disaster she had never seen hail like that in england in fact it scarcely seemed hail at all but big lumps of ice and the crash of it upon the roof was like the roar upon a beach of surfrolled stones  the sound of it and the wild wailing of the gale sapped her courage so she understood the strained look in carries eyes there are times when men as well as women stand appalled by the elemental fury and shaking off all restraint that a complex civilisation may have laid upon them become wholly human and primitive again carrie was half crouching at her aunts feet gazing up at her with wild fierce eyes eveline annersly shuddered a little as she glanced at her  will the house stand she gasped  the girls laugh rang harshly through the roar of the hail i dont know what does that matter anyway cant you understand the wheat will all be cut down i have ruined charley  then there was a lull for a minute or two and carrie reaching up a hand gripped her companions arm  did you ever hear how much i cost my husband she said  terrified as she was eveline annersly started at the question it was not expressed delicately but after all there was no doubt that the girls marriage had been more or less a matter of bargaining of course not she said  i dont know either but im sure it was ever so much and carries fingers trembled on her arm though her eyes were fierce in one way i am glad it was i like to feel that he was willing to offer everything that was his for me it isnt in the least degrading to belong to charley leland however i came into his possession not in the least how could it be still once it seemed horrible even to think of it  she stopped a minute with a little indrawing of her breath besides i am glad in another way because if he is really ruined i am going to get all i cost him back again jimmy and my father would call it a loan  eveline annersly was distinctly startled though she understood that all restraint had been flung aside and carrie leland had responded to the influence of this storm that had brought her face to face with a crisis in her husbands affairs the raw human nature in her had come uppermost and she was for the time being merely a woman with primitive passions raised ready to fight for her mate it was her companion recognised a thing that not infrequently happeneda part indeed of natures scheme that had a higher warrant but for all that she was sensible again that there was in the girls set face something from which people of fastidious temperament who had never felt the strain might feel inclined to shrink  carrie she said the thing is out of the question they are your father and brother you cannot force them into an open rupture you must put it out of your mind  the girl gripped her arm cruelly one must choose sometimes and i am my husbands flesh and blood once that seemed a curious fancy repugnant too but it is real nowone of the great real things to charley and me  eveline annersly said nothing and the wind beat upon the house as the girl went on aunt she said before charley is ruined i will make them repay the loan they would have to if i insisted for they would never dare let me tell that tale  once more her laugh rang harshly through the uproar of the hail oh she said charley would pour out his blood for me and what do i owe my father and jimmy but a badge of shame  she was shaking with passion and very white in face eveline annersly at last realised how deeply the shame had bitten before love had come to lessen the smart of it the girls temperament had been as she knew distinctly virginal and it was perhaps not astonishing under the circumstances that she had at first shrunk from her husband almost with hatred and certainly with instinctive repulsion indeed it was clear to eveline annersly that had not leland been what he was a man accustomed to restraint she would in all probability have continued to hate him until one of them died yet the contrast between the girl who had always borne herself with a chilling serenity at barrockholme and the passionate woman who crouched at her side was a very wonderful thing  then suddenly the wind fell and the sound of the hail commenced to die away it no longer roared upon the shingles but sank in a long diminuendo drawing further and further away across the prairie there was a deep impressive stillness as it ceased altogether  carrie rose abruptly im going out she said in a strained voice are you coming too  eveline annersly had little wish to go the storm had left her shaken and unwilling to move but she forced herself to get up for it seemed that carrie might have need of her so they went out together there was now a little light in the sky and the bluff showed up black and sharp against it the air was fresh and chill carrie however noticed nothing as she moved swiftly through the wheat through the melting ice that lay thickly upon the sod other shadowy figures were also moving in the same direction and there was a murmur of voices when at last she stopped  its mrs leland said somebody and the group of men drew back a little  then carrie caught her breath with a sob for the tall wheat had gone and so far as she could see ruin was spread across the belt of ploughing the green blades lay smashed and torn upon the beaten soil the crop had vanished under the dread reaping of the hail the light was growing clearer and it seemed to eveline annersly who remembered how the roar had suggested the beat of horses hoofs that instead of a brigade of cavalry an army division with guns and transport had passed that way through the grain then something in the fancy struck her as especially apposite and she turned to carrie who stood rigid as though turned to stone  look she said it isnt everywhere the same  a man came up and she recognised him as gallwey he apparently heard her for he beckoned to them  will you come forward mrs leland he said we have a good deal to be thankful for  they went with him a hundred yards or so then carrie gasped at what she saw in the growing light of dawn  oh she cried joyously it hasnt reached the rest of it  no said gallwey we are on the dividing line i dont know how many bushels it has reaped but by comparison it is not enough to worry about a little wonderful still i believe its not unusual and i have seen very much the same thing once before  is there no more of the wheat damaged asked carrie and there was still a tension in her voice  not a blade said gallwey ive been all round  then all the strength seemed to leave the girl moving shakily with her hand on eveline annerslys arm she turned towards the house as the pearly greyness crept into the eastern sky eveline annersly said nothing for she could feel that her companion was trembling and hear her catch her breath carrie stopped when they reached the homestead and looked eastward with teardimmed eyes  ah she said i wonder why this favour was shown me i felt i had ruined charley a little while ago  then she pulled herself together aunt eveline she said softly did you ever hate and despise yourself  eveline annersly said nothing but she smiled with comprehension in her eyes for she understood what was in carrie lelands mind     chapter xxiii  gallweys adventure   the night was still dark and there was not then or afterwards any sign of hail when sergeant grier halted his little force under the blackfoot ridge there were in all eight of them excellently mounted and most of them rode with a magazine rifle slung across their shoulders in front of them a deep ravine wound away into the ridge which though sometimes called a mountain consisted of a long broken rise perhaps two hundred feet above the level of the rest of the prairie stunted birches and where the grounds were moister a dense growth of willows clothed its sides behind the first rise lay a rolling deeply fissured plateau lined here and there with trees it stretched away before them a black and shadowy barrier and sergeant grier sat with his hand upon his hip looking at it reflectively  i guess your news can be relied on mr leland he said  leland patted his fidgeting horse i wouldnt have worried you with it unless i had felt tolerably sure he said two waggons driven by strangers passed through the cannersly settlement three days ago i dont know what was in them but they were full of something and i have my notion as to what it was the same night four men who asked about those waggons rode into cannersly they stayed there just five minutes and that appeared significant to me  the sergeant sat silent a moment and then turned to the rest  boys he said ive been worrying the thing out most of the way the whisky boys have friends round barber and theyd get packhorses there west of the settlement the folks are shy of them and its easy figuring theyd push on to get up north beyond my reach well it would cost them a day to work a traverse round the mountain and thats why im putting down my stake on their coming through theres only one good trail and were here to block it but a man who knew the way might bring them out by the willow coulee i guess its not more than two miles away he raised his voice a little trooper standish you and tom gallwey will ride up the coulee and lie by in the old herders hut if you hear anything a shot will bring us in at a gallop trooper cornet youll push on straight ahead for half an hour with mr custer and hide your horses clear of the trail i guess once the boys get into the mountain theyre going to have some trouble getting out again  the troopers saluted and four shadowy men melted into the darkness when they passed out of hearing the sergeant swung himself from the saddle  lead your horses well back among the trees boys and tether them he said then well camp down here i figure were not going to see the whisky boys before the morning  they did his bidding presently leland and one or two of the others lay down among the first of the birches the sergeant sat close by with his back to one of the trees his pipe in his hand  its bout time we got in a blow he said things are going bad and with the new country opening up north i cant get more men now we wouldnt be long running off the regular whisky men the trouble is that every blamed tough between here and the frontier is standing in with them and unless you catch him out at night youve nothing to show against him when he comes home hes a harmless settlement loafer or an industrious preemptor a good year would kill the thing but i guess theres more in whisky than wheat at present figures  theres more in running off horses said one of the others the boys get them for nothing and ive lost three of mine how much have they taken out of you altogether charley  most of four or five thousand dollars one way or another and i have a notion theyve not done with me yet in fact it seems to me that either the whisky boys or i will have to get out of this part of the prairie  the sergeant nodded it will be the whisky boys he said you can bluff the law for awhile if youre smart enough but its quite hard to keep it up and the first mistake you make its got you sure in another way mr lelands right id have done nothing with my few troopers if he hadnt brought you in we have nothing to raise trouble overa few steers and horses missing a grass fire raised theyre things that happen all the time the whisky boys know it as well as i do and since i cant get more troopers it means that what is done must be done by you they know that too and its running up quite a big account against the man whos leading you  there was a little murmur of concurrence and leland laughed  well he said theres a per contra claim and i fancy its going to be settled byandbye ive had about enough to pull against this season and i dont feel kind towards the men who have made it harder still for me  though he calmly filled his pipe one or two of those who heard him fancied that the reckoning he looked forward to would be a somewhat grim one when it came leland of prospect was as they were aware not the man to submit patiently to an injury and his quietness had its significance still he was only one man and his enemies were manymen who struck shrewdly in the dark and left no sign to show who they were none of those who rode with him envied their unofficial leader  in the meantime gallwey and the young trooper picked their way along the edge of the bluff the night was dark and hazy and there were no stars in the sky the smoke of a big grass fire drifted in a grey mist athwart the sweep of the plain now and then a crimson blaze leapt up and faded on the horizon and the still air was heavy with the smell of burning it was advisable to ride cautiously for there were a good many badgerholes and here and there the ground was seamed by a watercourse brittle branches occasionally snapped in the dense silence  i guess i could hear myself a mile away the trooper said still that horse of yours is making row enough for a squadron  gallwey did not contradict him for as it happened the horse just then blundered into a little watercourse and plunged down the slope of it with a great smashing of undergrowth gallwey contrived to avoid a fall with some noise they scrambled up the other side though this time trooper standish made an effort to control his indignation  i guess you would report me if i told you what i think of you he said  still they made the coulee without mishap and the trooper checked his horse as they rode into it it opened up before them a black and shadowy hollow with little streamlets trickling through dim trees rolled up its sides blurred masses against the sky above save the soft splash of the stream no sound broke the stillness  nobody here anyway he said well push on for the herders hut it was built when the scotchman who had listers ranch put sheep on the mountain but the timber wolves got most of them and he let up its bout the only place in this country where there are any wolves and the agent didnt think it worth while to mention it when he gave his lease out i guess you dont have timber wolves in scotland  gallwey said they didnt he made no further observations for his horse fell into the stream with a loud splash after this they pushed on up the coulee as silently as they could until trooper standish pulled his horse up  were here he said that looks like the hut well get down and hitch up the horses at the back of it  gallwey made out a shadowy mass among the birches and swung himself out of the saddle as his comrade did it was not what sergeant grier would have done but gallwey knew nothing of vedette duty and standish was very young he had hitched his bridle round a branch when the latter turned to him  we may as well go in and make ourselves comfortable he said if the whisky boys come down this way its a sure thing that well hear them  they turned back towards the door of the hut gallwey a few paces behind the trooper who thrust the door open gallwey could barely see him for they were in the deep shadow of the trees just after standish strolled in there came the sound of a scuffle out of the darkness then there was a crash a cry and the thud of a heavy fall  gallwey stood fumbling with his pistolholster which as it happened was buttoned down the button fitted tightly and he was clumsy in his haste as he tore at it he heard a sound behind him and was swinging round when a pair of sinewy arms were wound round him he struggled furiously reaching back with one foot for his assailants leg and succeeded in so far that he and the unseen man came down heavily together the other man however was uppermost and when somebody else came running up gallwey lay still  let him up said the last arrival and when he rose shakily his assailant jerked one arm behind him  walk right into the shanty before you get hurt he said  gallwey did it since there was apparently no other course open to him the way the man held his arm was excruciatingly painful somebody struck a sulphur match and lighting a lantern held it up it showed two more men busily engaged in holding trooper standish who kicked and struggled valiantly on the floor then the third man laid down the lantern and taking up a rifle prodded the trooper with the butt of it it was no gentle perfunctory prodding  let up and lie still before youre made youre going to get it hard if you move again he said and turned to gallwey sit right down yonder  gallwey who fancied that his expostulations would not be listened to did as he was bidden his holster was buttoned down still and he did not think he could get it open without attracting undesirable attention presently one of the men unclasped the belt it was fastened to and flung it aside while gallwey recognising that a conciliatory attitude was advisable nearly laughed as he looked at trooper standish the lad still lay flat upon the earthen floor flushed in face and hurled a stream of vitriolic compliments at his captors one of them grinned broadly but did not move his hands from the troopers arms  now he said if one of you will pass me that packrope well tie him up  it took two of them to accomplish it during the operation trooper standish contrived to kick one of them where it seemed to hurt still they did tie him and the lad lay still breathless with fury with wrists bound behind him his ankles lashed together then the men turned to gallwey  i guess your hands will be enough hold them out said one  gallwey did it without protesting which it was evident would be of very little use while one of the men went out of the hut another watched him  nobodys going to hurt you if you sit quite still he said  gallwey sat flat on the floor a position far from comfortable while standish who now lay with his head turned from him did not move at all then another man went out leaving only one who stood on guard with nothing in his hand in spite of certain notions there are after all very few pistols to be seen in the west and though a good many men have rifles they keep them because game is plentiful it was perhaps ten minutes later when a beat of hoofs grew louder down the coulee until though the door was shut gallwey could hear what seemed to be a line of loaded packanimals going by he glanced at his jailer who smiled sardonically  i guess youre not quite smart enough to play this game he said youre from prospect arent you  gallwey said he was a servant of lelands  thats all right said the man its kind of lucky you arent his partner we have nothing in particular against you but when we get hold of charley leland well fix him differently  gallwey did not answer him the last horse had gone by when one of the men outside flung the door open  we have to get up and hustle he said what are you going to do with them  i dont quite know said his comrade we might lash this one up as we have the trooper and leave them here they couldnt chew that packrope through you have got their horses  the other man said he had and gallwey broke in  we couldnt get very far without our horses and you wouldnt be taking any risk by leaving us as we are he said its quite evident that i couldnt loose the trooper and to be tied up so you cant move at all is abominably uncomfortable  the outlaw laughed well he said you have some sense in you and as you havent made us any trouble ill put a short hobble on you hold your feet out  gallwey did so and the man busied himself for a minute or two with a piece of rope it was evident that he was acquainted with the secure hitches used in lashing a load on the packsaddle  now he said you might jerk yourself along half a mile in the hour if you were careful though its quite as likely youd come down on your nose anyway by the time you find the sergeant well be quite a few leagues away thats about all i think goodnight to you  he went out and as they heard him ride away the trooper wriggling round looked up  can you get out he said  yes said gallwey i think i could though its rather more than probable that i shall fall over in attempting it under the circumstances half a mile an hour would i fancy be an excellent pace  still youve got to try it said the trooper get up right away and go for the sergeant  gallwey endeavoured to do so managing to get out of the door before the rope jerked him off his feet he fell over a good many times descending the coulee stopping to rest for a minute or two on each occasion still he persevered and made some progress dawn was in the sky when a farmer caught sight of him he and his companions had just decided that lelands informant had deceived him or that the rustlers had gone another way after all when a weird figure moved out of the gloom beneath the bluff they could not see it clearly for there was only a faint grey light as yet but it seemed to be moving in a most extraordinary fashion well said one of them i never saw a man walk quite like that it is a man anyway there arent any bears on the prairie  he broke off abruptly for the mysterious object toppled over and vanished altogether  it might have crawled into a hole said another man no the blamed things getting up again anyway its like a man im going along  they all went together a few minutes later they came upon gallwey sitting in the grass he had lost his hat and there was a good deal of dust and grass and leaves on him he sat still smiling somewhat feebly  i dont suppose my appearance is exactly prepossessing but thats not my fault and im unusually pleased to see you boys he said as you may have surmised the sergeants little plan didnt quite work out as it should have done ill try to tell you about it if youll take these ropes off  sergeant grier coming up at this juncture made several observations that are unrecordable but after the first outbreak he put a check on his temper  they have come out ahead again he said well its quite likely well get straight with them yet and bout all we can do now is to pick up their trail  but they could find no trail for as little dew falls on a cloudy night the grass was dry and dusty by sunrise they spent most of that day riding about in twos and threes but nobody at the scattered farms where they made inquiries had seen a single outlaw they and their whisky had apparently vanished altogether     chapter xxiv  leland makes sure   the nights were growing longer dusk was creeping up from the eastward across the leagues of whitened grass an hour earlier than it had done when they cut the hay leland stood outside the homestead door with a few newly opened letters in his hand the waggon of the man who had brought them was just then lurching over the crest of the rise and carrie stood watching it near her husbands side his face was a trifle sombre but he smiled when she glanced at him inquiringly  from my broker in winnipeg he said he doesnt know what to make of the market and i cant blame him wheats lower than i ever remember it but the bears are still working their hardest to hammer prices down in a month or so theyll have the whole wheat of the west flung into the market to make it easier for them but they dont seem to have it quite so much their own way as i had expected one could almost fancy that somebody was buying quietly anyway theres a man willing to take most of my crop off me when its ready at a little under todays nominal figure you see the prospect hard reds firstgrade for milling  if you sold how would you stand asked carrie  very close to ruin the cattle run would certainly have to go but that wouldnt count so much its less than half stocked now  why cant you hold  the trouble is that all accounts must be met at harvest and ive got to have at least five thousand dollars to wipe out the most pressing ones the rest might be carried over at a stiff interest then there are wages harvesting and threshing besides if i held the grain up id be taking a big risk it may go down another two or three cents or even more when every man west of winnipeg rushes his crop in and that would turn me out upon the prairie  still you mean to hold carrie looked at him steadily with a little gleam in her eyes  i almost think i do  carrie laid her hand upon his arm the faint flush in her cheeks was born of pride well she said that pleases me it is like you charley hold it dear every bushel and before you yield an inch let them break you if they can  she turned abruptly and glanced at the tall wheat which rolled back dusky green with faint opal gleams in it across the great level and over the swell of rise into the smoky crimson that lingered in the western sky  its yours she said proudly you made it grow and do you think i dont know what it has cost you you have gone without sleep for it and worn yourself to skin and bone perhaps you have always worked hard but i think never quite so cruelly hard as you have done this year  she stopped and gazed fondly on him then she went on  oh she said i understandeverything charley dear it isnt without a reason you are so thin and gaunt and brown and your handsthe hands that have done so much for meare hard and scarred still i want them to hold on to what is yours you have made the splendid wheat grow and you wont let anybody rob you of it now  leland smiled though it was evident that he was stirred  well he said it would be a little easier to stop them doing it if i knew where to get five thousand dollars which is one thousand pounds of course i owe a great deal more but with that in hand to settle the odd accounts that must be met i neednt force my wheat on the market for a month or so  oh said carrie with a little laugh there will not be the least difficulty about the money i am going to give it to youtwo thousand pounds if you want it  leland stared at her in evident astonishment my dear i never knew you had so much and if you have it must be every penny that belongs to you i couldnt let you strip yourself of everything for me  what have you been doing ever since i came to prospect still that doesnt matter you must humour me do you think after all you have done i could stand by and see you ruined when there was anything that belonged to me charley you must use this money cant you see that you must if its only to show that you have forgiven me  she turned swiftly and threw an arm about his shoulder if you dont you will almost make me hate you again you dont want that then you will make no more silly objections we are going into this fight together  leland made a little gesture of surrender well he said slowly since you have made your mind up i cant say no i dont think it would be much use anyway but it will be a big risk my dear  but said carrie that is one of the things that appeal to me still its all decided you shall have a cheque for ten thousand dollars thats right isnt it now tell me what is in the rest of the letters  she drew back from him a little when leland looked at her smilingly a faint flush crept into her cheek again  oh she said i know what you are thinking i always do still you see it isnt entirely my fault that im different from the girl you married and now tell me about the other letters  leland handed her one of them with an illuminated device at the top of it its an annual function one of the biggest in winnipeg and women attend it everybody with a stake in the country will be there and they want to make me a steward my brokers on the committee and prospect is rather a big farm you see i am requested to bring mrs leland along with me  carries eyes brightened after all it was lonely at prospect and she had played her part in two london seasons now and then she felt a longing to move among people of her own station again and the prospect of attending the function was undeniably attractive her dresses would not be out of fashion yet and after the long months on the dusty prairie it would be delightful to appear for once attired becomingly at a brilliant assembly there were also eminent names upon the invitation and she felt that apart from any pleasure she might derive it would be a source of satisfaction to see her husband among the notables of the land  you would like to go he asked  i would like it better than anything  leland appeared thoughtful i would like to see you there you could put on the bracelet i saw you with and the crescent in your hair  no said carrie who looked away from him i think i would sooner go very plainlythat is if i could go at all  the trace of eagerness in her voice was not lost upon the man and he stood silent a moment before he made a little resolute gesture  well he said well go its the first little pleasure of that kind i have been able to offer you and i daresay gallwey will see the guards ploughed just as well as i could  there is some reason why you shouldnt go after all and carrie glanced at him sharply you are too busy  im not quite sure there is i expect its mostly fancy but a man gets into the way of thinking that when theres anything of consequence to be done he should see it done himself now those fireguardsand he pointed to a belt of furrows that cut off the homestead from the prairieare the regulation width but i was thinking of doubling them the grass is tinderdry and the oats will soon be ripe enough to burn  ah said carrie you think the rustlers might try again  leland smiled drily well he said grassfires are in no way unusual at this season  carrie guessed what he was thinking as he looked in silence out across the ripening wheat as she gazed at the vast sweep of grain she too was stirred with the pride of possession and accomplishment she longed now for the glitter of the assembly for conversation as one of them with men and women of culture and station with a fervour which in all probability any one who had lived as she had on the lonely prairie levels would quite understand but with a little sigh she crushed the longing down  then she said quietly we will stay here charley  leland appeared irresolute after all we wouldnt be so very long away  no said carrie firmly there is a lot against you and you mustnt leave a single advantage to the enemy  leland stooped and kissed her well i guess youre rightstill i think i know what youre going to do without for me  nothing more was said but it was not needed for there was perfect understanding between them as they went into the house together  it was early next morning when leland harnessed four horses to the big gangplough and as there was moonlight that night he still sat behind another four until long after the red sun went down there were other men he could have bidden to do the work for him but he knew the odds against him and meant to do it himself thoroughly it was also careful ploughing and not done in haste as is most usual in the west for throughout most of it the clods ran dead smooth and level without a break to let the grass tussocks through their sides gleaming from contact with the polished steel were laid towards the prairie presenting to it a serried phalanx of good black loam but where the sod was unusually friable leland got down to toil with the spade  a grassfire needs very little to help it a tuft or two of dry grass projecting from a halfturned clod will suffice and the flame will sometimes creep in and out between and across the ridges wherever a few withered stalks may lie leland knew he had not done with the rustlers yet and it was advisable to take due precautions the standard guardfurrows were considered quite enough by most of his neighbours who indeed now and then neglected to plough them but he had a good deal at stake and meant in so far as it was permitted him to make quite sure  he went round the wheat and oats and then spent several days ripping odd strips here and there across the prairie in the track of the prevalent winds it was fiercely hot weather but he was busy every hour from dawn to dusk and at nights his men grinned as they mentioned it charley leland was getting very afraid of fire they said when he was satisfied with the ploughing he had the axes and grubhoes ground and set the men to work cutting out the smaller growth of willows of underbrush in the strip of birches that stretched close up to the homestead from the bluff when gallwey who had other duties found him busy at it the first morning he smiled a little  i suppose its really necessary if not it would be a considerable waste of time he said  well said leland drily i almost think it is a good deal of this stuff is tinderdry and you cant plough through the bluff i dont know if you have ever seen a bad fire in the underbrush you cant beat it out as you can now and then when its in the grass  gallwey looked thoughtful all this points to one thing you feel tolerably satisfied that the rustlers will make another attempt  its a sure thing leland straightened himself a little with a lean brown hand clenched on the haft of the big axe before the snow is on the ground i or the whisky boys will have had to quit this prairie i dont want it to be me  then he turned away abruptly and whirling the great blade high buried it at a stroke in a dry and partly rotten birch his comrade smiled he had seen lelands face and there was something vaguely portentous in the flash of whirling steel and the crash of the blow charley leland he knew could wait and take precautions but it was also evident that when the time came he could strike in a somewhat impressive fashion  leland worked on for several more days and then one night carrie and he stood outside of the door of the homestead watching a great pile of underbrush blazing furiously the man smiled as he turned to his companion his hands were blackened and his old bluejean garments singed  well he said i guess ive done what i can i had to do it anyway since you lent me that two thousand pounds if the market would only stiffen youd get your money back with an interest that would astonish people in england  he broke off for a moment with a curious little laugh my dear he said you and i should have been in winnipeg tonight  carrie said nothing but the firelight was on her face when she looked up at her husband and once more he was satisfied     chapter xxv  a portentous light   it was growing dusk of a thick hot evening when leland at last pulled up his jaded horses and turning in the iron saddle raised his hand in signal behind him a drawnout line of machines and plodding teams were moving on at measured distances binder after binder halfhidden by the tall oats that went down before them with a harsh crackle where they passed men toiled hard among the flungout sheaves and the trampling of weary horses rasp and tinkle of the knives and the clash of the binders wooden arms rang far across the great dusky plain the sounds of strenuous activity had risen since the sun first crept up above the vast sweep of grass and continued through the burning heat of the day but now they ceased suddenly and men stripped to coarse blue shirt and trousers of dusty jean wiped their dripping faces and straightened their aching backs before they loosed the teams their hoarse voices came up to leland with the clatter of flungdown poles and the tramp of horses among the stubble as he got down from his binder  men toil hard at harvest the world over but perhaps nowhere is the work so fierce or demands so much from those engaged in it as on the wide levels which stretch back from the wheat lands of western canada into the dakotas across the border there flesh and blood must keep pace with unwearying machines the latest and most ingenious that mans brain can conceive the reaper has gone the binder that is a year or two out of date is broken up and while the machine does more and more the strength of the men who serve and drive it remains the same for all that none of them can afford to be left behind they have no use for the incompetent in that country and though at times the pace is apt to kill man must strain overtaxed muscle and sinew in the tense effort to keep up with wooden arms that never ache and with clashing steel the toilers are for the most part well paid and generously fed and they give all that is in them from pride of manhood and in some degree from sheer necessity the ban that is still a privilege has never been lifted yet and while wheat may glut the markets and flour be cheap it is alone by the sweat of somebodys strenuous effort that man has bread to eat  leland was aching all over but that was of course nothing new to him and he turned to gallwey who was standing close by when a man came up to lead his team away  if youll put the saddle on coureur tom and bring him out id be obliged he said ill sit here and smoke a pipe before i ride out to meet carrie and mrs annersly they should be well on their way from custers now  gallwey ventured to expostulate with him i believe i heard mrs leland tell you not to come and if you are going to start again at four oclock tomorrow one would fancy you had done about enough he said im quite sure i have  well said leland i want a look round anyway there has been a good deal of smoke about most of the day and theres a big grassfire or probably more than one somewhere out on the prairie the winds freshening too  that at least was evident for a rush of hot breeze came up out of the growing darkness and during the last few hours the sun had been hidden by driving haze gallwey who felt the wind upon his dusty cheek turned and glanced down the long row of sheaves which ridged the edge of the prairie for he guessed what his comrade was thinking behind the oats there rolled long rippling waves of wheat and though they were dusky now the daylight would have shown that they were tinted with bronze and gold the tall stems were hot still and the prairie sod was white and thick with fibrous dust  everything is about as safe as you could make it he said we have good guards and you ploughed checkfurrows outside of them  i did said leland drily i cut them across the track of the usual winds this ones an exception and i have seen a fire jump guards that were most as wide there would be trouble if a spark got in among the stubble and im taking no chances just now  gallwey made a little gesture of concurrence as he once more glanced down the long rows of sheaves the stubble stood among them kneehigh and above the strip of ploughing that cut it off from the prairie for straw has no great value in that country  well he said i daresay you are right its a little hard to see how a fire could get in but after all one can never make quite sure of anything  he went away and when he came back with the horse leland swinging himself stiffly into the saddle rode out across the rise into the silent prairie half an hour had passed before he met the waggon but he then turned back with it checking his lively horse as carries team which had travelled a considerable distance that day plodded slowly through tussocky grass up a slope there are places where the prairie runs dead level from horizon to horizon but here and there it lifts in long gentle rises as the ocean does when the swell of a past gale disturbs its oily surface often the change is imperceptible until one comes to the dip where the incline softly falls away again as they crossed the ridge carrie pulled the horses up and gazed about her  its a trifle impressive no sky and darkness on the unseen earth there are only the fires moving in a void she said  the others did not answer though they were in sympathy with her thick darkness hid the prairie and they on the crest of the ridge seemed utterly alone in an immeasurable immensity of space somewhere in the midst of it were long smears of crimson light that seized the eye with their suggestion of distance as they flung themselves aloft when the waggon crossed a rise still the rise remained invisible and as carrie had said the fires seemed to be moving through a great emptiness it was curiously and almost hauntingly impressive  i suppose they cant be near prospect she said  leland turned his face to the wind which was filled with the smell of burning the nearest should be most of a league away from the homestead he said its fortunate it is that fires an unusually big one  there was silence again for a minute or two while they watched the moving radiance and then carrie stood up suddenly  prospect should be straight in front of us over the horses heads she said  almost you couldnt see it the rise hides the house  ah said carrie with a little gasp then theres another light behind it something low and little that twinkles like a star  leland shook his bridle and touched the horse with his heel take your own time he said hoarsely im going on im afraid youll have light enough before youre home  in another moment he had vanished into the darkness and they heard a drumming of hoofs grow fainter as he rode towards prospect at a furious gallop for a while there was nothing he could see but when he swept across the last rise and the lights of prospect twinkled close in front of him he made out a little patch of radiance beyond them on the prairie it was evident to him that nobody at the homestead which stood lower would see it then he struck the horse again and was riding by the stables at a wild gallop when a voice hailed him  that you mr leland it said  leland remembering what instructions he had given the watcher shouted and pulled up his horse with a struggle  turn out the boys he said get them along to the south side of the oats with the wet grain bags and shovels tom gallweys in the house  the unseen man said he was and in another minute leland who rode on swung himself down at the homestead door gallwey who had apparently heard him coming ran out  bring me my old marlin and get yours said leland theres a firebug getting his work in to windward of us on the prairie  gallwey disappeared but came back with two rifles in less than a minute leland who had let the horse go turned to him  were going on foot to get that fellow if we can he said i guess the boys will know what to do  gallwey considered that this was probable for grassfires are common at that season and leland had more than once explained exactly what the part of each would be in case one approached the homestead he and his comrade accordingly set off through the bluff at a steady run though gallwey twice fell over an unseen obstacle while when they came out there were two moving lines of fire small as yet but growing on the prairie behind it it was also evident that the hot wind would bring them down upon the oats leland however did not head for either blaze but for a point some distance to the left of the one farthest off  that man means to make quite sure he said hell figure hes as safe as he was when he started the first fire since weve shown no sign of seeing it  i suppose there is a man gasped gallwey  leland seemed to laugh though he was running hard well he said breathlessly its quite a usual thing for one fire to come along in weather like this but its rather too much of a coincidence when two of them start in the same place while when you see a third one too its enough to make one anxious for a good grip of the man whos lighting them  i cant see a third  leland swung his arm up and appeared to be pointing in front of him youre going to go on slow but be ready to run when you see a twinkle the one thing to remember is that you have a rifle  he turned off and vanished while gallwey pulled up to a walk there was a very big fire a league or so away and two small ones behind him which were extending rapidly but all the rest of the prairie was wrapped in utter darkness when he turned after glancing at the wide blaze of radiance he could not see a yard in front of him where his comrade was he did not know but he fancied his object was to place the incendiary between the two of them when he betrayed himself by the third blaze gallwey was however not quite sure there would be a third blaze while it appeared not improbable that if the man still lingered he might hear them  for five minutes he walked straight on or at least he fancied so it seemed to be getting darker for the air was thick with drifting smoke and there was no moon then a pale twinkle leapt up in front of him and that was all he could be certain of for since there was no horizon it might have been for all that he could tell either above him or beneath it was a feeble blink of light that presently went out again still he had his direction now and his heart beat a good deal faster than usual as he went on at a run until the pale blaze sprang up a second time then he dropped swiftly and crouched with one foot under him and the rifle in his left hand watching the radiance increase he could see the taller tussocks of grass between him and the fire now and drew in his breath pitching the rifle forward with his elbow on his knee when a black figure became faintly visible behind it  he could not see the sights but the man who shoots duck on the sloos handles the rifle in that country much as one uses a doublebarrel and gallwey felt that the chances were in favour of his driving a fortyfour bullet into the black figure by the fire still something in him recoiled from doing so without at least a warning and he raised his voice  stand still he said i have you covered it is possible that the man did not believe him and made a swift calculation of the chances against him in any case he vanished incontinently and it was a moment or two too late when gallweys rifle flashed he felt the jar of the butt on his shoulder but as usual heard no report he was listening for the whine of the bullet and the thud which would tell him whether it had reached its mark he did not hear that either and slamming down the slide fired again at a venture then he heard a drumming of hoofs and rose to his feet it would be lelands turn now and he fancied his comrade would at least have endeavoured to place the man between himself and the fire it was certain that there was nothing to be gained by running after a man upon a horse  while he stood still he saw a little pale flash and heard the ringing of a rifle the flash appeared again and this time was followed by a cry and a heavy crash gallwey ran as fast as he could in the direction whence it seemed to come and in another few minutes stopped beside a big shapeless object that was moving convulsively on the grass he made out his comrade stooping over it  get hold said leland the horse is done for but he has the man pinned down under him  then it became apparent that another object which had a certain human semblance lay among the horses legs and a faint voice rose from it  hump yourselves before he rolls over and smashes me all up it said  gallwey was not sure what his comrade did but he laid hold of what seemed to be the mans arm and as the horse rolled a little succeeded in dragging him clear of it he let him go and stood looking down on him stupidly  legs broke gasped the man the beast fell on me  well said leland drily it will save us some trouble youre not going to walk very far like that and when we get the fire under control well see what can be done for you its your own fault that youll have to wait a little  then he swung round to gallwey back to the guardfurrows for your life  gallwey fancied that he had never run quite so hard before but when he reached the strip of ploughing between stubble and prairie leland was already there shouting breathlessly to the men spread out along it not far away a wavy wall of fire was moving down on them out of the prairie and there were two more some distance to the left though it would evidently be a little while before the last of them rolled up already a thick and acrid vapour whirled among the oats and when it melted a little and a brighter blaze sprang up he could see the mens tense faces and the curious rigidity of their attitudes  then there was a trampling of hoofs and turning he saw carrie leland pull her plunging team up in the midst of the smoke she stood up on the front of the waggon and a flickering blaze of radiance showed that she was dripping with water a pile of wet bags lay behind her  throw them out boys she said there are more of them waiting  in another moment leland ran up and seized the near horses head as the beast kicked and plunged in the stinging smoke  go home and leave the team to one of the boys he said  carrie laughed standing bolt upright the firelight on her face the reins in her hands  no she said theyre wanted and do you think we cant drive in england get the bags out as fast as you can boys  the warning seemed necessary for one of the horses forelegs left the ground and the others hind hoofs crashed against the front of the waggon then leland was almost swung off his feet and carrie laughed again  let them go ill hold them if youre quick she said  she dropped into the drivingseat with her feet braced against the board and the men made what haste they could while the frantic team kicked and plunged and backed the waggon in among them gallwey was stirred to admiration as he watched the tense shapely figure braced against the strain upon the reins that was now and then forced up by the fire and lost again  then a thick wreath of blinding smoke whirled down on them and carrie cried out as she swung the whip there was a thud of hoofs and a rattle the men leapt aside and the waggon plunged into the vapour as gallwey said afterwards like a thunderbolt     chapter xxvi  fighting fire   there was silence for a minute the tense silence that precedes a struggle when the waggon lurched away and the men stood still intent and at a strain blinking at the fire the wind had lulled and the smoke went almost straight up shining luminously in the red glare beneath it a wavy line of flame rolled on across the prairie licking up the parched grass as it came as it happened the grass thereabouts was higher than usual unless there is a gale behind it a grassfire does not move with much celerity and that night the one that menaced lelands crop seemed inordinately slow to those who watched it indeed one or two of them found it strangely hard to stand still while it rolled down on them which in cases of the kind is by no means an unusual thing action of any kind even purposeless action is a relief to men under strain  there was however in the meanwhile nothing that they could do and they commenced to growl inarticulately as they glanced at one another with fierce set faces here and there one of them twisted the end of the wet bag he held to give him a firmer grip or fidgeted aimlessly with his shovel the rest frowned and coughed for which there was some excuse or stood woodenly still according to their temperament leland however swung round towards the row of binders that stood half buried among the oats  thats one thing we overlooked and they have got to take their chances now he said we couldnt get a team to face the smoke and nobody could harness them if we did if theyre burned were going to have trouble to get the harvest in  gallwey who stood near him made a sign of agreement every binder in the country was in use just then for since machines are remodelled yearly implement dealers stock no more than they expect to sell and let on hire any by chance left upon their hands it was accordingly evident that if these were burned his comrade could not replace them and in face of the wages usually paid nobody could garner the harvests of the northwest without the binder which not only cuts the grain but ties it into sheaves it is by saving costly labour alone that the prairie farmer pours his wheat into the markets of the east and retains a small margin for himself in spite of fifteen hundred miles railway haulage and three thousand by sea it is the gangplough and the automatic binder that have opened up the prairie  you couldnt get another anywhere in time to be of use he said  leland however now laughed harshly well he said after all i neednt worry about them its no great comfort but im not likely to want them if theyre burnt in that case therell be no crop to harvest  it seemed to gallwey that this was probable enough the oats stood half as high again as most of those he had seen in england on thick flinty stems that had dried and yellowed under a scorching sun while behind them rolled the wheat that was almost as ripe there had been no rain for days and very little dew and now when a fierce hot wind was driving down the fire on them the whole crop seemed ready for the burning the guardfurrows would check the flame but they could not stop the sparks and sheaves and tall stubble lay spread like tinder for them to fall among  then once more the wind descended and a long wreath of smoke blotting out everything drove on a great shower of sparks blew forward out of the midst of it and when it was rent aside there sprang up a great crackling blaze it leapt forward with a roar and then broke up running low among the grass while the smoke whirled past the men choking and blinding them thicker than ever  stand by cried leland theres the first beat it out hold on dont crowd in on them  his voice was lost in the crackle of the fire and that was the last intelligible thing he said for some time a further hail of sparks came out of the smoke and a blaze sprang up among the stubble it spread even while two men fell upon it with wet grain bags but flickered out when a third reinforced them with a shovel then it grew intolerably hot and the action became general  the fire was almost up to the guardfurrows and a rain of burning particles blew on before it incipient blazes broke out where they fell and men fought them savagely in the blinding smoke now and then they fell over each other and one here and there was struck by his comrades shovel but nobody heeded that epithets that at other times would have been answered by the clenched fist passed unnoticed and choking gasping whirling bag or shovel they fought on now and then the smoke thinned a little and the fierce red light beat upon their dripping faces and bowed figures only to fade into a confused opacity again that made but faintly visible the forms flitting like phantoms amidst the vapour here and there a man cried out but nobody heard what he said and his feeble voice was drowned in the crackle of the flame leland appeared to be wherever the fire was fiercest once knocking gallwey down as he came floundering through the stubble towards a spreading blaze  then the fire rolled up to the edge of the ploughing a wall of flame perhaps a hundred yards from end to end leaping up with a mad roaring then it stopped and fell away the sparks dropped short too in a lulling of the wind and what by contrast seemed black darkness rushed down upon that part of the prairie then there was an impressive silence and men half dazed by the heat and effort wiped their streaming faces and looked round in search of their invisible neighbours  none of them knew how long this lasted but though they had won so far the fight was not yet over presently the smoke that streamed past them was torn aside again and a red light shone along the line the second fire was coming on and there was still another behind the flickering radiance showed the dusky figures that leant upon the shovelhafts or shook out the halfdried bags here and there it also showed a blackened face surmounted by frizzled hair  gallwey as it happened found himself close to leland and looked at the latter with a little sardonic smile not knowing that he himself was not much more prepossessing in his outward appearance lelands wide hat hung shapelessly over his blackened face there was a charred gap in the front brim as well as several big holes in his jean jacket which was badly rent blood was trickling from one of his hands  i dont know if i did that myself or if somebody hit me with a shovel he said anyway when i fell down one or two of them ran over me  then he turned fiercely towards the moving fires the next ones bigger if the wind would only drop  gallwey who fancied by the way the smoke drove past them that there was very little chance of it coughed its evidently not going to if we had only a little water one could be more content i feel as if there was not a drop of moisture anywhere in me  one or two of the others heard him and cries went up  water said somebody is there any  im most as dry as this bag it will blaze next time said another man my jackets singed to tinder too howre we going to do when our clothes start burning  leland stood up where the rest could dimly see him on the spoke of a binder wheel  you should have thought of that before boys he said anyway youll have to hold out until the things over its too far to the homestead and nobody could bring up a team  just then a man further back along the line flung out a pointing hand  well he said i guess that looks as if somebody was trying  the sound of a trampling in the stubble rose through the crackle of the fire and a halffrantic team and a waggon materialised out of the vapour a slim dimlyseen figure swayed with the jolting upon the drivingseat and when the watchers saw another apparently clinging to the load behind a confused shouting broke out  wet bags and water get hold of the beasts some of you its mrs leland shes a daisy  there was a rush of shadowy figures towards the waggon and every man was wanted for the team would not stand still blackened hands clutched at rein headstall harness whatever they could get a finger on and the terrorstricken animals borne down by sheer weight could not make off with nearly a dozen men hanging on to them the rest swarmed about the waggon where carrie still sat with the light of the fire on her while jake the cripple hurled down dripping bags and strove to wriggle out a water barrel they got it down between them and carrie made a sign to leland who was struggling amidst the press  that will do he said stand clear boys carrie dont come back  then there was a sudden scattering of the crowd a clatter and a trampling of stubble and once more waggon and team were lost in the darkness and driving smoke after that men surged about the barrel striving to dip their hats in it it was a little while before they were satisfied and then one of them waved his dripping hat as though to enforce attention  boys he said i guess its not every woman would have got that team here and its not mrs lelands fault theres only water in the barrel you can blame that on your legislature anyway you were glad to get it and i never struck a farm where they fixed the hired man better than leland of prospect and his wife do thats why now the other fires coming along its up to every man to see them through  there were some laughter and shouts of approval and the shadowy figures trooped away to meet the second fire it was fiercer than the first but though some burned their clothing and odd patches of their limbs they overcame first it and then the smaller one that came behind it then leland who called gallwey and two of the men strode away through the darkness to where he had left the outlaw they found the horse without much difficulty and it was dead but there was no longer any sign of the man when they shouted it happenedvery much as they had expectedthat nobody answered them  i guess the whisky boys must have played the possum on you said one of the men  gallwey laughed a little as he turned to his comrade well he said reflectively in his cleanest english considering everything its almost a pity one of us didnt think it worth while to examine his leg you see he couldnt very well have walked off if it had really been broken  leland who had perhaps some excuse for being consumed with vindictive fury swung round on him  how far could you walk with a broken leg he said do you think i have no sense at all  once more gallwey appeared to reflect one would scarcely fancy you had shown your usual perspicacity tonight of course im not saying anything about myself  though it was very dark leland appeared to glare at him for a moment or two and then broke out into a little laugh  tom he said you do it very wellso well that once or twice ive found it hard to keep my hands off you before i saw the point of it you only want an eyeglass to make the thing perfect well i can wait until my turn comes and you have helped me shake the black fit off  gallwey said nothing further as they went back together towards the house but he was content he was well acquainted with his comrades temperament and knew that his silent simmering anger was not wholesome for himself or calculated to make things pleasant for anybody else still a very little thing would usually serve to dissipate it they overtook the rest on the way to the homestead and when they approached the door which it was necessary for the men to pass saw that it was open carrie who appeared just outside it beckoned leland to her and then turned to the rest standing close beside him  she was now attired in a long dress almost but not quite an evening gown that became her well but leland was blackened all over and there were many singed holes in his clothes wet and smeared with ashes and part of the wide brim of his hat was missing the men seemed to notice the contrast between the pair and there was a little goodhumoured laughter carrie leland smiled at them in turn though she would have borne herself very differently to these rough men a few months ago  are there any of you burnt boys she asked  several of them admitted that they were though they said it was nothing to count and were directed to repair to the kitchen where mrs nesbit had oil and flour ready then carrie made a little gesture as though to invite attention  boys she said i cant thank you for what you have done tonight you see there are things one really cant thank people for properly but i think charley and i would have been ruined if you hadnt been the kind of men you are still its been a long while since the six oclock supper and i expect if id been with you i should be hungry too of course in one way theres nothing quite good enough for you but we have been busy while you were putting out the fire so if youll go along to the dinnershed youll find jake and mrs nesbit have done what they can there is another thing nobody need get up until he likes tomorrow not a team will leave the stables until after dinner  leland turned and looked at her in bewildered astonishment for nothing had ever delayed work at prospect at harvest or indeed at any other time before and probably because the men understood what he was feeling there was a great roar of laughter when his wife turned and laid her hand upon his shoulder  it is all right charley i mean it she said  the rest stood still a minute gazing at her not awkwardly for selfconsciousness is rarely a characteristic of the plainsman but as if they felt that there was something to be said or done perhaps her beauty appealed to them and it is also possible that the offer of a feast had its effect but her gracious simplicity went considerably further no one would have more quickly resented condescension than these hardhanded men who thought themselves with some reason the equal of any in the world but they could recognise the distinction between that and sympathy and were willing to yield her everything she did not claim yet they were a trifle puzzled for this was not the attitude the cold and silent woman who had come to prospect had once adopted towards them then there was a murmuring among them until one stood forward with his hat in his hand  madam he said in excellent accent the boys desire me to reply for them and i must first admit that the thought of a supper appeals to them and me perhaps it would be admissible to say that having had the honour of dismissal from a good many farms between dakota and prince albert i know a little about prairie rations and cookery and i would like to testify that in respect to both prospect stands alone one might also venture to observe without making any invidious reflections upon mrs nesbit and the somewhat unvarying jake that the menu has become even more attractive lately for which there is no doubt a sufficient reason  there was further laughter and carrie who saw the little twinkle in her husbands eyes felt the blood creep into her cheeks but the man went on  so much for the supper and it has its interest man is usually hungry especially when he has to work hard enough to satisfy charley leland but i would like mrs leland to understand that we wish her to consider us her devoted servants anybody can hire a man you can buy his labour for so many hours a day but there must always be a good deal left outside that kind of bargain and its all thats left outside we would on an occasion like this like to offer mrs leland in fact it would not be a great matter to put a fire out every night if it would please her if you sympathise with these few remarks will you signify your approbation boys  there was a clamorous shout and as the men trooped away jakes voice rose up  get a big grin on over my cooking would you he said its saltpork bones and bad beans youre going to get if i can fix it you hungry hogs  leland laughed but carrie felt that his eyes were on her when they went in and glancing at him covertly she saw the little gleam of pride in them  theyre yours he said and she knew he meant the men whatever you want done you have only to ask them but it wasnt because of the supper  the blood crept into carrie lelands cheek everybody is very kind to me she said     chapter xxvii  leland feels the strain   supper had not long been cleared away on an evening some three weeks after the fire and the sunlight still streamed into the big general room but leland lay somewhat limply in a loungechair which considering that there was a good deal of the wheat still to be cut was a somewhat astonishing thing for him to do his face was paler than usual indeed here and there a trace of greyness had crept into the bronze and his eyes were heavy but a mass of papers lay on the little table in front of him and it was evident that he had just been writing his mail which had come in two or three hours earlier had been an unusually large one carrie sat not far away watching him a trifle anxiously she had been more than a little startled when he came in for supper walking unsteadily  you are still looking far from well she said  leland laughed though his eyes were half closed oh he said ill be round again tomorrow all right it was as hot as i ever remember it this afternoon and each time i came down the long stretch with the binder the sun was on the back of my neck i just want to sit still a little and cool off  carrie shook her head you have been working too hard she said cant you take it a little easier it surely isnt necessary for you to drive a binder  just now anyway i almost think it is when im there the boys cant do less than i do and i set the pace for every man in the field there are you see quite a few of them and the little extra effort each one makes counts for a good deal besides i have always worked and now it would be quite hard to get used to walking round with nothing in my hands even if i wanted to anyway it wont go on for more than another month or so  he made a little involuntary gesture of weariness i dont think ill be sorry it has been getting a little hard lately and if the market doesnt break me well go away when the wheat is in you would like to go to montreal or new york for a week or two we would do all the concerts and theatres  carrie felt that she would like it very much indeed for after all life at prospect had its disadvantages but she had reasons for not displaying too much eagerness finances were straitened and leland in spite of his simple tastes was apt to be extravagant where she was concerned  of course she said i mean if circumstances permitted it but that depends upon the market doesnt it what has it been doing lately  leland took up a circular standing still for a week and that is rather a curious thing you see with the first wheat pouring in the bears quite often get their own way just now and hammer prices down but quotations seem to have been quite steady in chicago the last few days theyve had a bad season in minnesota and the hail wiped out a good deal of wheat in dakota what one or two states can grow doesnt count in itself so much against the worlds supply but its now and then enough to upset a delicate balance in winnipeg the bears made another raid but they couldnt break the price and im inclined to fancy that all they offered was quietly taken up the outside men who like a little deal now and then arent all of them babes in the wood  im afraid i could never quite understand these things said carrie  in one way its simple the world wants so much wheat though the quantity varies because there are places where they eat other things when it gets too dear now you can get statistics showing how many million bushels they have raised here and there and its evident that if its less than usual its going to be dearer on the other hand if theres more than the world has apparently any use of the men it belongs to have some trouble in selling it and values come down thats the principle but there are men who make their living by shoving prices up and down and theyre able to do it sometimes against all reason now and then they half starve poor folks in europe and now and then they ruin farmers in the western states and this part of canada they have millions of dollars behind them and theyre clever at crooked games still it sometimes happens that nature turns against them and drowns them in floods of wheat or when theyre squeezing the lifeblood out of the farmers it strikes men up and down the country that wheat was so cheap it ought to be dearer then if the bears slacken their grip a little men who like to gamble and have the money to spare send their buying orders in and the bears find it hard to get the wheat they have pledged themselves to deliver that sends prices up and up  you think that is likely to happen  leland looked very thoughtful i cant say nobody could theres one significant thing prices are steady though the wheat is coming in youll get considerably more than your two thousand pounds back if they go up we could have a month in new york then and youd go to operas with that crescent glittering in your hair  carrie said nothing for though she had not quite understood all he said it was sufficiently clear that if prices went down she would never put the crescent on again she had further reasons too for not desiring to discuss that subject while she sat silent gallwey came in and leland taking up a paper handed it to him  that he said is a little idea of mine and if wed had any sense we would have thought of it earlier with the new country opening up to the north the police bosses at regina have their hands full they dont want to be worried and sergeant grier seems kind of afraid to admit he cant put the whisky boys down or to pitch his reports too strong  gallwey nodded the same thing he said has occurred to me all along his attitude is comprehensible and i have a certain sympathy with the folks at the head of the police to attend to everything they would want a brigade  well said leland drily i have no intention of getting my homestead burnt because it suits anybodys hand and youll start round tomorrow and get this petition signed by every responsible man its a plain statement of what we have been putting up with and a delicate hint that there are folks among the governments opposition who might find the information interesting in case the police bosses do nothing i almost fancy that ought to put a move on them  gallwey smiled a little as he read the document which however was worded with a tactfulness he had scarcely expected from his comrade lelands proceedings were as a rule rather summary and vigorous than characterised by any particular delicacy  i shall be away three or four days at least he said  wont that be a little awkward you are not very well just now  leland made a little impatient gesture ill be all right again tomorrow  his comrade did not contradict him though he had some doubt upon the subject and sitting down talked about other matters for several minutes while when he rose he contrived to make carrie understand it was desirable that she should find an excuse for going out soon after him she did so and came upon him waiting in the kitchen  he persists that there is nothing the matter with him but i am a little anxious she said you dont think he is looking well  gallwey appeared thoughtful i scarcely fancy it is serious but there is no doubt he has been worrying himself lately and doing a good deal too much in fact the strain is telling still i dare say a little rest would do wonders couldnt you keep him in tomorrow  keep him in said carrie with a little expostulatory smile  there was a twinkle in gallweys eyes it will probably be difficult but i almost think in your case not absolutely impossible  well i will do what i can it is rather a pity you have to go away  the smile grew a trifle plainer in gallweys eyes as a matter of fact and although i am quite aware that there will probably be trouble about it i am not going one of the boys will have to ride round with the paper instead of me still you will have to decide how you can keep your husband in  he went away and left her to grapple with the question which since leland was a selfwilled man was a somewhat difficult one it was some little while before there occurred to her a rather primitive device which appeared likely to prove effective she had however not quite realised the inherent obstinacy of her husbands temperament  it accordingly happened that when the crippled jake was busy cleaning up the big general room early next morning he was astonished to see leland attired in airy pyjamas appear in the doorway he raised his hand as though in warning and glanced towards the other door it occurred to jake that he did not look well  mrs nesbits not around leland asked  jake said she was in the cookshed just then and leland sat down somewhat limply in the nearest chair  slip up into tom gallweys room and bring me a suit of his clothes the new ones he goes to the settlement in he said that will square the deal because i cant help thinking he had a hand in the thing  wheres your own asked jake in evident bewilderment  that said leland drily is just what is worrying me but you do what i tell you quick before mrs nesbit comes in  jake did as he was bidden for there was a look in lelands eyes which warned him that further questions would not be advisable and when he came back with the clothing the latter dressed himself hastily and slipping out made his way to the stable he had some difficulty in putting the harness on the team and was considerably longer over it than usual but he managed to lead them out and had reached the binder with them about the time carrie and eveline annersly entered the room he had quitted the first thing they saw was a suit of pyjamas lying on the floor and the elder lady laughed as she turned to carrie  i fancied you would find it a little difficult to keep charley leland in against his will she said  carrie who did not answer her summoned jake  where is mr leland she asked  i guess hes working in the wheat said the man with a grin  carrie appeared astonished and eveline annersly laughed again charley is a trifle determined but there are i almost fancy lengths to which he would not go he has probably borrowed someones clothing  did he leave any message asked carrie turning to the man  no said jake reflectively i dont think he did he wasnt coming back for his breakfast i was to take it out to him and he figured tom gallweys storeclothes wouldnt look quite so new by sundown  he went away and eveline annersly smiled at her companion youll simply have to put up with it she said it really doesnt sound as if he was very ill  in the meanwhile leland after stopping some twenty minutes for breakfast climbed into the binders saddle and drove through the wheat until almost noon he did not seem to see quite so well as usual and his head ached almost intolerably gallweys jacket also hampered him until tearing it off he let it fall it was afterwards found ripped in several places by the knife and tied up in a sheaf the day was fiercely hot and the dust rose thick from crackling stubble and trampled soil but leland drove on swaying now and then in his saddle the perspiration dripping from him  it was close upon the dinner hour and the sun was almost overhead in a cloudless sky when he approached a turning the glare from the yellow wheat was dazzling and the ironwork on the binder almost too hot to touch with the hand and leland once more found his sight grow blurred as he strove to turn his team they did not seem to answer the guidance of the reins and when the machine turning short ran in among the wheat he raised himself a little as he called to them that was the last thing he remembered  the next instant the man behind him saw him reel and topple from the saddle as the whirling arms came round he pulled his team up and jumping down ran as for his life but most fortunately lelands tired horses had stopped of their own accord in a pace or two for when the other man came up their driver lay partly across the knifesheath with his feet among the wheat what could be seen of his face was darkly flushed while the sleeve and breast of his dusty shirt were smeared with trickling red the other man startled as he was had however sense enough to seize the near horses head before he shouted to his comrades  lay hold of the wheel two of you he said when several of them came running up now get up somebody and pull the drivingclutch out we dont want to saw him open  he had kept himself in hand but he gasped with relief when the deadly steel was thrown out of action then still holding the horses he directed the rest to drag leland clear it was a minute later when he pushed the others aside and bent over him leland lay limp and still in the dusty stubble with eyes half closed and a red trickle dripping into the thirsty soil beneath him the man who had seen a good many bad axewounds in the ontario bush rolled back the breast and sleeve of the torn shirt before he straightened himself and wiped his dripping face  i guess he has come off quite fortunate in one way theres no big vessel cut or it would spout he said the first thing to do is to get him out of the sun and its not very far to the house  they picked him up and four of them carried him to the homestead as gently as they could at the door they met carrie she closed one hand hard and turned very white when the men who stopped stood gasping a little and looking at her stupidly with their burden hanging limply between them then while she struggled with a numbing sense of horror the leader awkwardly took off his hat  i guess its nothing very bad hes cut in two places and the binder hit him on the head but a man of his kind will soon get over that he said now i know quite a little about cuts and things and if youll send for mrs nesbit well soon fix him up get a move on boys mrs leland will show you where to take him  the words had a bracing effect carrie shook off her first terror and though she was trembling went up the stairway in front of them she was almost afraid to look round at the men who stumbled noisily with their burden still she felt a little easier when in the course of half an hour the ontario man managed to stop most of the bleeding with a few simple compresses and to get leland who had not opened his eyes yet into bed he turned to carrie who was standing close by with a tense white face  i guess all he got after he fell off the binder is not going to worry him much but i dont know what he had before he said it might have been sunstroke and it might just as well have been something else he was kind of shaky all the morning anyway ill tell tom gallwey and hell send some one of the boys in to the railroad to wire for a doctor  he went out and carrie was left in the darkened room kneeling by her husbands side while tom gallwey drove the fastest team at prospect furiously across the prairie he did not send another man but went himself and the horses he drove had reason to remember that journey     chapter xxviii  carries responsibility   carrie leland spent two very anxious days before a doctor from one of the larger settlements down the line arrived in company with gallwey who drove him in from the station the latter had during the journey favoured gallwey with his professional opinions as to the cause of lelands illness as soon as he reached the homestead he was shown into the sickroom leland who had recovered consciousness after the first few hours submitted to a lengthy examination with a patience which somewhat astonished his comrade after which the doctor who asked him a few questions nodded as though satisfied  i have no great fault to find with anything the man did who attended to you in the first place he said in fact i have seen considerably worse dressings a bushman i presume  leland looked at him languidly out of halfclosed eyes hes not going to be sorry it would be more to the purpose if you told me what was the matter with me  an abrasion on your forehead and a bruise on the back of your head which should apparently have been sufficient to produce concussion of the brain the doctor said then your arm is cut half across and if the knife hadnt brought up on a bone you would probably not have survived the wound on your breast i almost think that is quite enough  anyway its not quite what i mean the cuts will heal what made me turn dizzy and fall off the binder ive never had anything of that kind happen to me before  the doctor smiled drily well he said in similar circumstances you will in all probability have it happen again it rests with yourself to decide whether you like it speaking generally its the result of worry and trying to work a good deal harder than its fit for you to work to be a little more definite you have had what one might call incipient sunstroke on the top of it and though i dont know how you fell on the binder the thump you got had its effect upon your brain thats almost as near as one can get to it in everyday language  leland laughed the question is when can i get up  it depends upon yourself if you lie quite still and dont worry about anything i will consider the matter when i come back again  leland could extract nothing more definite from him and when he went out carrie took him into her sittingroom  there is nothing to be anxious about he said the surgical aspect of the case is in no way serious and ill leave you an antiseptic dressing and mail you some medicine i dont know when i can get back but it will be a week anyway so if there is any change that seems to make it advisable you will wire me from the depÃ´t what your husband needs is absolute quiet he is on no account to be worried about any business  i think i can promise that said carrie still there are his letters if i dont give him any it will certainly make him restless and as most of them are about the price of wheat and accounts im afraid they would scarcely be likely to soothe him  the doctor appeared a trifle uncertain and flashed a swift glance at eveline annersly who sat not far away like most of his profession he was acquainted with the little shortcomings of human nature and was quite aware that there are men whose wives would probably be none the happier if supplied with an insight into all their husbands affairs he was too young to conceal very successfully what he was thinking and though he was perhaps not altogether conscious of it he looked to eveline annersly for guidance she said nothing but there was he fancied comprehension and an answer in her little smile  well he said i might suggest that you open them and keep back anything that seems likely to disturb him  in a few more minutes mrs nesbit came in to announce that a meal was awaiting him when he went out eveline annersly smiled again as she glanced at her companion  that man is painfully young she said i suppose you are not afraid of opening charleys letters  no said carrie with a little flash in her eyes why should i be  well said eveline annersly reflectively one would almost fancy that when jimmy marries he would sooner his wife did not see everything that came for him it was a letter that first made the trouble between captain and ada heaton in such cases it not infrequently is  carrie turned upon her with a red spot in her cheek you will succeed in making me angry presently you know there is nothing charley would keep from me  that i think is saying a good deal but while you are no doubt right my dear any one who had only seen you in england would be inclined to wonder what had happened to you lately if i had suggested anything of the kind once upon a time you would only have looked at me with chilling disdain but now a word against charley leland brings a flash into your eyes that however is by the way i wonder if you have heard that heaton has at last taken proceedings  i havent i never hear from home  i have had a letter and a paper the decision was in his favour there was practically no defence there couldnt very well have been in face of the disclosures and while i had a certain sympathy with ada at first i have none now  carrie sat silent a minute a faint flush in her face then she suddenly raised her head  aunt she said i suppose you dont know it was about ada that charley and i quarrelled in fact it was on her account i nearly drove him away from me altogether in that too it seems that i was wrong i wonder sometimes how he ever forgave me or why i have so much i never deserved to have at all  she said nothing further and went out presently that afternoon and for several subsequent days she opened lelands letters finding nothing that must be kept back from him but one evening however she sent for gallwey when he came in from harvesting and signing him to sit down handed him a letter from the winnipeg broker  will you tell me what you think i ought to do she said you will see that the man must have an answer  gallwey studied the letter carefully for several minutes when he laid it down he felt a certain sympathy with mrs leland though he fancied she would show herself equal to the occasion  its rather unfortunate it should have come just now she said still it is here and i want your views  gallwey looked thoughtful the thing is rather a big one as i daresay you know there are different kinds of wheat but our hard red is rather a favourite with millers there is it seems a man who subject to one or two conditions about samples being up to usual grade is willing to buy about half the crop from charley at a cent the bushel more than he previously offered i wonder if you quite grasp the significance of that  prices are rising  not necessarily though they are certainly steadier this man may have orders for some special flour for which our grade of red is preferable though he could of course get other wheat which would no doubt do almost as well still prices have at least stiffened it is what is called a rally and it may last a week or so though it is somewhat strange it should happen now when everybody has wheat to sell  he stopped a moment if you sell this wheat and prices fall you will have made an excellent bargain though the figure doesnt cover expenses on the contrary if prices go up you will have thrown a good deal of money away you have to bear in mind that it represents about half the crop which makes it evident that a good deal depends upon a right decision  have you any idea what prices will do  gallwey made a little gesture to be frank i havent and i should shrink from mentioning it if i had there are thousands of people up and down this country trying in vain to reason it out and i have no doubt that some of the keenest men in the business find the same difficulty i darent advise you  carrie sat silent for at least a minute and then looked at him gravely  if i sell we shall not cover expenses if i hold we may be ruined altogether or it might pour hundreds of dollars into charleys bank  yes said gallwey that is it exactly  again there was silence and then carrie looked up with a little sparkle in her eyes charleys not so well today and this would certainly make him ill again it seems i must not shrink from the responsibility when he does not know exactly what to do it is the boldest course that appeals to him write the man in winnipeg that i will not sell a bushel  gallwey rose and made her a little inclination it shall be done he said i wonder if one might venture to compliment you on your courage  now the thing was decided carrie leland sat still somewhat limp and pale in face again  after that some ten days passed uneventfully until the doctor came back he did not appear particularly pleased with lelands condition and repeated his instructions about keeping him quiet and undisturbed he left carrie anxious for she could not persuade herself that her husband was looking any better he was however rapidly becoming short in temper and soon after the doctor had gone she had another struggle with him entering the room quietly she found he had raised himself on the pillows and was looking about him  if you would tell me where my clothes are id be much obliged he said that mans no good at his business im going to get up  he made an effort to rise then and there with some difficulty carrie induced him to lie down again he listened to what she had to say with evident impatience and then shook his head  im to keep quiet and not worry theres no sense in the thing he said how can i help chafing and fuming when i have to lie here while everything goes wrong and nobody will tell me what is being done i felt a little dizzy just now or you wouldnt have got me back again but im going to make another attempt tomorrow you have to remember that when i get up i get better ive never been tied up like this before and the only thing thats wrong with me is that ive had a doctor  carrie contrived to quiet him though she did not find it easy when at last he had gone to sleep she went out meeting gallwey in the hall he glanced at her with a little sympathetic smile  i came upon the doctor riding away he said it appears that charley has been telling him frankly what he thought of him i suppose he has been trying to get up again  carrie said he had and gallwey appeared to consider  well he said it might perhaps help to keep him quiet if you let him know that the appeal to the police authorities has been considered favourably i met sergeant grier and he told me that they have sent him half a dozen more troopers he seems tolerably confident that he can lay hands on the rustlers leaders though he was in too much haste to tell me how it was to be done by the way im afraid you will have to get charley to write a cheque in a day or two well have to pay the ontario harvesters shortly  he left her relieved at least to hear that grier saw some prospect of putting the outlaws down but another couple of weeks had passed before she heard anything more of him or them in the meanwhile the sergeant as he had indeed expected met with a good many difficulties he was supplied with plentiful information concerning the outlaws but the trouble was that he could not always decide how much of it was meant to be misleading until he had acted upon it after a weeks hard riding during which his men had very little sleep he found himself one night with six of them rather more than sixty miles west of prospect he had that day surrounded what he had been told was one of the whisky boys coverts in a big bluff and drawn a blank a thing that had happened once or twice already the horses were dead weary the men wornout so he decided to camp where he was in a thick growth of willows a cooking fire was lighted and when the men had eaten all but two who were left to watch the horses lay down rolled in their blankets  it was about an hour before the dawn when trooper standish paced up and down on the outskirts of the bluff he had been in the saddle under a hot sun most of twelve hours the previous day and now felt more than a little shivery as well as weary a little breeze came sighing out of the great waste of plain and the chill of it struck through his thin damp clothing in which he had ridden and slept trooper standish was also more than a little drowsy though he would not have admitted it in fact few men are capable of very much either in the shape of effort or watchfulness at three oclock in the morning  a hundred yards or so behind him a comrade was standing near the tethered horses though he might have been very much further away for all standish could see of him a thin fringe of willows lay between standish and the prairie when he turned a little he could see the faint glow of the fire which had not quite gone out where the bushes were thicker though there was a breeze it had no great strength and the willows rustled beneath it fitfully with a faint and eery sighing as it happened this was a little louder than usual when trooper standish stopped to listen and consider his duty in such cases was of course quite clear but now that the willows had stopped rustling there was no sound and he was aware that the young trooper who rouses his wornout comrades without due cause after a hard days ride has usually reason to regret it besides this he remembered that he had not played a very brilliant part in another affair and he still tingled under the recollection of the others jibes accordingly he prowled cautiously through the bluff and then sauntered back towards his comrade  i guess you have heard nothing suspicious he said  no said the man i didnt expect to anyway  you didnt hear me call out either  i didnt if youd made any noise i would have heard you have any of the whisky boys been crawling in on you  trooper standish gazed hard at the man who had evidently asked the question ironically he certainly seemed wide awake and it occurred to standish that he might have been half asleep himself and had only fancied that he called out he accordingly decided that it might be just as well if he said nothing further about the matter and he strode away on his round again  the sun was creeping up above the prairie when one of his comrades rising to waken the sergeant saw a strip of folded paper of the kind used by the storekeepers for packing fixed between the branches of a willow close by grier took it down and his face grew intent when he saw that there was a message scribbled across one part of it  if you want to do leland a good turn get up and ride it said the boys are holding prospect up tonight  then grier turned to the astonished troopers it may be a bluff to put us off the trail he said leland keeps good watch at prospect and has it full of harvesters  well said one of the others i dont quite know last time i met one of his teamsters he told me theyd have no use for most of the harvesters in a day or two he said something too about the boys going out to the railroad to haul the new thresher in i guess that would keep them away three or four days altogether  grier looked thoughtful oh yes he said ive heard that mills an extra big one and they were most of a day getting the old one across the ravine its quite certain too that leland has a good many friends up and down the country who now and then break prairie or cut hay for him and as some of them stand in with the rustlers too its easy to figure why the man who sent us this warning didnt want to show himself well i guess well take our chances of being wanted though the horses are dead played out and i dont know where to get another within thirty miles nobody who can help it is going to let us have a horse at harvest time  then he turned sharply who was on horseguard with ainger  standish said one of the men  grier smiled unpleasantly send him along then get your fire lighted and look after your horses well start for prospect when youve had breakfast but i guess some of you are going to walk a few leagues today     chapter xxix  leland strikes back   it was about ten oclock at night and carrie was sitting with eveline annersly in the big general room at prospect leland who had been brought downstairs to be further away from the hot roof lay asleep in another room that opened off the corridor leading to the kitchen almost every man attached to the homestead was away the threshers were expected on the morrow for throughout that country the wheat is threshed where it stands in the sheaves and it had always been a difficult matter to convey the mill and engine across the ravine the thresher now expected was an unusually large one and gallwey had set out with most of the teams to assist the men in charge of it he had however promised to come back with some of the boys that night  carrie was a little sleepy for she had borne her part in the stress of work usual in a western homestead at harvest time but she had no thought of retiring until gallwey arrived nothing had been heard of the outlaws since the fire but since most of the harvesters would require to be paid and sent home in a day or two there was a good deal of money for the purpose in the house it seemed that eveline annersly was also thinking of it for presently she looked at her companion with a little smile  it is on the whole fortunate my nerves are reasonably good she said it would be singularly inconvenient if charleys whiskysmuggling friends should visit us tonight your bills could one would fancy be got rid of more easily than english notes and i understand there are a good many of them in charleys room  carrie laughed for she was unwilling to admit she had any apprehensions she felt that if she did so they might become oppressive  there are she said a visit to the settlement means two days lost and gallwey and i decided to get enough to pay the threshers too so as to save another journey i had expected him back by now  she rose and going out opened the homestead door it was a quiet starlit night with no moon in the sky and the prairie rolled away before her dim and shadowy not a sound rose from it even the wind was still as she gazed out across the dusky waste something in its vastness and silence impressed her as never before she had grown to love the prairie but there were times when its desolation reacted almost unpleasantly on her the homestead with its barns and stables standing back beneath the stars seemed so little an insignificant speck on that great sweep of plain she roused herself to listen but no beat of hoofs crept out of the soft darkness and it was evident that gallwey was a long way off yet  then she turned with a little shiver and went back into the house crossing the big room she went down the corridor and softly opened the door of the room where her husband slept a lamp was burning dimly and it showed his quiet face now a trifle haggard and lined with care carries eyes grew gentle as she looked at him for he had been very restless and apparently not so well that day while it was evident to her that his vigour was coming back to him very slowly then as she turned her eyes rested on the safe and again a thrill of apprehension ran through her she was glad that gallwey had the key  she went back to the general room and though she had not noticed it so much before found the stillness oppressive there was not a sound and when her companion turned over a paper the rustle of it startled her  i almost wish i had not let tom gallwey go she said still it was necessary the threshers couldnt have got their machine here without the boys  eveline annersly looked up i certainly wish he had come back though i suppose he cant be very long now he told you ten oclock i think in the meanwhile you might find this account of the wedding at scaleby garth interesting  carrie held out her hand for the paper but her attention wandered from the description of the scene in the little english church she had left the outer door open and found herself listening for a reassuring beat of hoofs but nothing disturbed the deep silence of the prairie half an hour had passed when she straightened herself suddenly in her chair with her heart beating fast and saw that eveline annerslys face was intent as she gazed towards the door  oh she said you heard it too  yes said the elder lady with a tremor in her voice it sounded like a step  in another moment there was no doubt about it and carrie rose with a little catching of her breath as a shadowy figure appeared in the hall for a moment she stood as though turned to stone and then suddenly roused herself to action as a man came into the room  he stopped just inside the threshold a big dusty man with a damp bronzed face but as it happened it was eveline annersly his eyes first rested on he glanced at her suspiciously and then swung round as he heard a rattle just in time to see carrie snatch down her husbands rifle  she stood very straight breathless and a trifle white in face but there was something suggestive in the way the rifle lay in her left hand the man could see that a swift jerk would bring the butt in to her shoulder and the barrel in line with him while the girls gaze was also disconcertingly fixed and steady she had stood now and then just outside the woods at barrockholme with a little 16bore in her hands getting her share of the pheasants as they came over the intruder could shoot well enough himself to realise that when the barrel went up her finger would be clenched upon the trigger his hand was at his belt but he kept it there and for a second or two the pair looked at one another then he quietly turned round which argued courage and called to somebody outside  come in boys he said heres a thing we hadnt quite figured on  carrie turned when he did and in another moment she was standing with her back to the door that led to the corridor while eveline annersly who gasped looked at her with horror in her eyes  what are you going to do she said  carrie did not look in her direction she was watching the outer door and stood tense and still but with something in her pose that suggested a readiness for swift decisive movement in fact her attitude vaguely reminded her companion of a bent bow or a snake half coiled to strike her face was set and there was a portentous glint in her very steady eyes her voice was harsh but impressively quiet  if they try to get into charleys room i am going to kill one of them she said  then two other men came in and one of them made a little halfwhimsical gesture  hadnt you better be reasonable mrs leland he said were not going to hurt you  what do you want asked the girl  money said the man who had come in first anyway thats the first thing you have plenty of it here tom gallwey brought a big wallet out from the settlement a week ago theyre in the safe in the room behind you too  carrie nervous and overwrought as she was decided to temporise gallwey could not be long and he had promised to bring some of the boys home with him  well she said in a strained voice i havent the key  one of the men laughed thats not going to worry us if we cant open it with a stick of giantpowder well take the safe along its hardly likely to be a big one  then its only the money you want  carries perceptions had never been keener than they were that night and she saw one of the others glance at his comrade warningly she also saw the little vindictive gleam in another mans eyes and she understood it was not alone to empty lelands safe they had come and he lay sick and helpless in the room where it stood one other thing was also clear to her and it was that none of them should go in there at any cost  well said the outlaw if we got the money without unpleasantness it would help to make things pleasanter for everybody and were going to get it anyway the only two men about this homestead are held up in the stable and there are quite a few of us here i guess you had better let us in to the safe  carrie moved a trifle bringing her left arm which was aching further forward i think there are two keys belonging to the safe she said i wonder if i could remember where the other one is  she delayed them at least a minute while she appeared to consider and then the men evidently lost their patience for one of them turned angrily to their leader  we have no use for so much talking and want to get ahead he said its a sure thing they wouldnt leave the place empty any length of time with leland sick and i guess youre going to have gallwey and the boys down on you if you stay here long  one of his comrades growled approvingly oh he said quit talking if she hasnt got that key on her she doesnt know where it is well run in and get hold of her its even chances she has nothing in the gun  it was evident that the suggestion commended itself to all of them but the trouble was that nobody seemed anxious to put it into execution carrie pressed down the magazine slide with one hand it would however only move a very little and she realised that the magazine was almost full then she laughed harshly and the sound jarred on eveline annerslys ears  well she said why dont you come  then she started and endeavoured to put a further restraint upon herself for it seemed to her that a very faint drumming sound rose from the prairie none of the others however appeared to hear it in another moment an inspiration seemed to dawn on one of the men  put the lamp out and well get her easy in the dark he said  eveline annersly failed to check a little startled cry but carrie turned towards the leader of the outlaws very quietly  stop a moment she said you darent hurt a woman it would raise all the prairie against you but if one of you comes near that lamp i will certainly shoot him  the leader made a little gesture half of admiration and half of anger  now he said weve had bout enough talking and your husband spoiled our game when he brought those troopers in we know who sent for them well were lighting out for good after weve cleaned his safe out and done one or two other little things we dont want to hurt you but were not going to be held up by a woman its your last chance do you mean to be reasonable  carrie was white to the lips for it was perfectly plain that they intended to have a reckoning before they went with the man who had driven them out  keep back from the light she said  then the outlaw made a little halfimpatient gesture of resignation well he said youll have to get hold of her boys  they came forward but though that would have been wiser they did not run two of them moved crouchingly and carrie could not see the third man still they had only made a pace or two when one of them suddenly straightened himself  look out he said were going to have trouble now  carrie could not see the door behind her open but eveline annersly saw it and gasped then she laughed a little hoarse laugh that at any other time would have jarred on those who heard it as leland appeared in the opening he was in pyjamas and his face was white and haggard one arm still bound up hung at his side but a big pistol glinted in his other hand one of the outlaws recoiled but his comrade sprang towards the lamp mrs annersly saw carries rifle pitched forward there was a double detonation two jarring reports so close together that one could scarcely distinguish between them and the man nearest the light reeled and struck the table before he sank into a huddled heap on the floor a streak of blue smoke hovered in the middle of the room and another filmy cloud floated about the inner door through which leland presently lurched gaunt and pale and grim with a look in his eyes that eveline annersly remembered afterwards with horror he said nothing whatever but his pistol blazed and the room resounded with the quick whiplike reports then there was thick darkness as the light went out so far as eveline annersly who was the only one who remembered anything could make out two of the outlaws retreated towards the door shouting for their comrades but they did not reach it for a voice rang sharply outside  hold up it said weve got you this time sure  what took place outside did not appear at once but a few minutes later somebody came in calling out for mrs leland and struck a match it went out but another man soon appeared holding up a lamp the light of which showed leland leaning upon the table with an arm round his wife who was laughing hysterically  i didnt hit him i didnt you fired first she said  thats all right said leland soothingly anyway theres a good deal of life in him yet im quite sure i plugged another of them just before the light went out  carrie turned half round glancing towards the man who was struggling to raise himself from the floor and then once more clung to leland with a little cry  then trooper standish set down the lamp and sergeant grier came forward while several hot and dusty troopers stood revealed about the door  is there anybody hurt except this man he asked  leland said there was nobody so far as he knew and the sergeant nodded  then i guess you and mrs leland had better light out of this while we see what can be done for him and another man the boys have outside ill come along and tell you about it later  leland began to expostulate ive been tied up by the leg long enough and there are one or two things i want to do right now  the sergeant who ignored him turned to carrie with a little dry smile  get him back to his bed mrs leland as quick as you can and send your friend away he said youre going to have no more trouble but this is no place for you  carrie seemed to rouse herself and with some difficulty led her protesting husband away half an hour had passed when the sergeant and gallwey who had arrived in the meanwhile were admitted to lelands room he now lay partly dressed in a big chair for nothing that carrie could do would induce him to go back to bed again grier sat down with a little smile and carrie looked at him warningly  you are not to excite him she said  excite me said leland its the one thing that has cured me ill be going round with the threshers in a day or two  well said the sergeant its quite a simple tale one of your friends perhaps a boy whod worked for you gave us the office at sunup and we started as soon as we heard what the rustlers meant to do it seems from what one or two of them have admitted that they knew the game was up when the new troopers came and meant to get even with you before lighting out  how did they know the boys were away and what in the name of thunder did gallwey keep them all this while at the ravine for leland broke in  grier raised his hand you keep still im telling this thing my own way how the whisky boys found out more than that is one of the points im going to inquire into well we started and before we were halfway most of the horses were dead played out and though i went round by a ranch the boys were out driving cattle and had only two horses in the stable i guess we led the horses most of the rest of the way until when we were a league off i rode on with one of the boys then coming in quietly we saw there was something wrong while we waited for the boys we fixed things so that we got our hands on four of the gang two of them are the bosses and one of them wants a doctor as well as the other man with the bullet in his leg thats about all there is to it youre not going to have any more trouble with the rustlers  will the man charley shot get well asked carrie with tense anxiety  the sergeant smiled oh yes he said hell be on his way to regina jail in a day or two  he went out with gallwey byandbye and carrie sat down by her husband with a little happy laugh  oh she said thats one trouble done with and if you wont excite yourself charley ill tell you something more wheat is going up     chapter xxx  harvest   there was no longer any fierceness in the sunshine and the day was cloudless and pleasantly cool when carrie leland and eveline annersly strolled through the harvest field at the middle of afternoon the aspect of things had changed since the morning leland had fallen from his binder for though there was a little breeze the wheat no longer rolled before it in rippling waves it stood piled in long rows of sheaves that gleamed with bronze and gold in a great sweep of ochretinted stubble beyond which the prairie stretched back dusty white to the cold blueness of the northern horizon  the sheaves were however melting fast for waggons piled high with them moved towards a big machine that showed up dimly against a cloud of smoke and dust in the foreground a long spout rose high above it pouring down a golden cascade of straw upon a shapeless mound and a swarm of halfseen figures toiled amidst the dust the threshers are usually paid by the bushel in that country and since they have as they would say no use for anything but the latest and most powerful engine and mill it was only by fierce persistent effort the men of prospect kept the big machine fed its smoke trail drifted far down the prairie and through the deep hum it made there rose the thud of hoofs and the sounds of human activity which it seemed to carrie leland as she stood in the bright sunshine under the cloudless sky had a glad exultant note in them it stirred her curiously with its vague suggestion of faith that had proved warranted once more there had been a fulfilment of the promise made when the waters dried and in spite of drought and scourging hail the harvest had not failed  ah she said it is easy to be an optimist today it is the looking forward when everything appears against one that is difficult but when i remember the springtime i feel i shall never have any reason to be proud of myself again  eveline annerslys eyes twinkled im not sure the time you mentioned could have been particularly pleasant to charley either  still said carrie with a little sigh he held fast to his optimism and worked while i let the gloom of it overmaster me  and now as the result of it that machine is threshing out i dont know how many thousand bushels of splendid wheat  carries eyes grew gentle and there was a little thrill in her voice we have both of us ever so much more than the wheat to be thankful for she said  then she changed the subject abruptly aunt if you want to catch the new york mail you will have to answer that letter tonight you know that neither of us wants you to go  would you like to go back to england  carrie looked at the wheat and great sweep of prairie with glowing eyes i think i should be content wherever my husband went there was a time when i fancied that if we had several good harvests and he sold prospect it would be nice to go back with him to the old country but now i do not know i seem to have grown since i came out here and the prairie has as he would say got hold of me it is so big and strenuous there is so much in this country that is worth doing and i think charley is like it in many ways no i scarcely fancy he would ever be quite happy in england but after all that is not the question we want you do you feel you must go back again  her companion smiled a little i am not altogether sure that i do but one has to consider a good many things the house florence writes about at cransly is pretty and convenient and by sharing expenses we could live there comfortably enough still you know the life two elderly ladies would lead at cransly and after barrockholmeand prospectthere are ways in which it would not appeal to me very strongly  oh i know and carrie laughed you would be expected to set everybody a model of propriety and to rule with the vicars wife such society as there is in the place you would have to know the exact shade of graciousness to bestow upon the wife of the local doctor and how to check the presumptuous advances of the retired tradesman or the daughters of the stranger who settled within your borders isnt it all a little small and petty  she turned once more to the prairie with a gesture of pride ah she said out here its only what is essential that comes first we open our gates to the stranger and give him our best even when he comes on foot in dusty jean its manhood that counts for everything and charley and the others are always opening the gates a little wider we take all who come the poor and the outcast and ask no questions one has only to look round and see what the prairie has made of them aunt i think the greatest thing in human nature is the faith of the optimist no i shall stay here and you will stay with me  i think a little would naturally depend upon what charley wants  carrie laughed well she said we will ascertain his views he is not as a rule very diffident about expressing them  tom gallwey somewhat lightly dressed drove up just then in a waggon piled with grain bags  where is charley she asked  gallwey smiled lifting fourbushel wheat sacks into a waggon he has been doing it most of the afternoon too and i almost think it would be wise if you looked after him  he drove on and carrie attempted to frown isnt he exasperating she said the doctor told him he was to take it very easy for at least another month and he promised me he would do nothing hard  they went on towards the thresher walking delicately among the flinty stubble until they reached the edge of the whirling dust overhead the straw was rushing down through a haze of smoke below halfnaked men toiled savagely about the big machine steam was roaring from the engine for the threshers were firing recklessly and the thudding clank of the engine and hum of the clattering mill were almost deafening there was a constant passing upwards of golden sheaves a constant downward stream of straw and the dusty air seemed filled with toiling men and kicking teams  then carrie went forward into the midst of the press for it was naturally where the activity was fiercest that she expected to find her husband he was with another harvester pitching up big sacks into a waggon as a bushel of wheat weighs approximately sixty pounds it was an occupation that demanded much from the man engaged in it she touched him on the shoulder looking at him reproachfully when he swung round and let the bag drop  charley she said you remember your promise  the twinkle crept into lelands eyes oh yes he said i told you id do nothing hard when you know the trick of it this things quite easy  it did not appear so to carrie come away at once she said you are to do no more this afternoon  leland made a little whimsical gesture of resignation but it is possible that he was not altogether sorry for though he had recovered rapidly since the affair with the whisky boys his full strength had not come back and he had been lifting grain bags for several hours in any event he put on his jacket and brushing a little of the dust off his person went away with her they sat down together with eveline annersly beneath one of the strawpile granaries that stood in a row amidst the stubble  aunt eveline is thinking of going away said carrie  leland started and there was no doubt that his concern was genuine oh he said the things quite out of the question she told me she was going to stay with us as long as we wanted her  i did said eveline annersly still i really think you can do without me now  both carrie and her husband knew exactly what she meant but it was the latter who had the courage to admit it  madam he began  eveline annersly checked him with a smile the title has gone out of fashion with a few other oldfashioned things you still seem to cling to in the newest west i do not like itfrom you  leland made her a bow that included carrie well he said aunt evelineand that because of the humanity in it is perhaps a finer titleim talking now and you are going to listen to me you were kind to me at barrockholme where i was what you call an outsider and you gave me the greatest thing i ever had or that ever could come to me you didnt find it easy things were far from promising when you were halfway through but you stood by me and now do you think there is anything that would be too much for me to do for you  there was a little silence it was the first time the fact that all three recognised had been put into words and a faint flush mantled eveline annerslys cheeks still her eyes were gentle and there was no doubt that the bond between the little faded lady upon whom the stamp of station was plain and the gaunt prairie farmer with the hard hands and the bronzed face sprinkled with the dust of toil was a wondrous strong one in england it would perhaps have seemed incomprehensible an anachronism but amidst the long rows of sheaves he had called up out of the prairie there was nothing strange in their communion after all it is manhood that counts in the new northwest  well she said quietly it was a great responsibility and there were times when i was horribly afraid still events have proved me right and i think it is the greatest compliment i could pay you when i say that it was to make carrie safe i did it  carrie said nothing but there was faith and confidence in her eyes when she turned them for a moment upon her husband as he spoke again  and now you talk of going away he said aunt eveline we want you here always both of us you stood by us through the struggle for it has been a hard one this year and now i want you to share in the result of it oh i know in some ways its a hard country for a woman brought up like you but things will be different at prospect with wheat going up and theres one great argument you cant get overwhat carrie leland is content with is sufficient for any woman on this earth  they had just decided that she was to stay when sergeant grier rode up he swung himself out of the saddle and tossed leland a bundle of papers  i got one or two at the settlement and custer asked me to hand you the rest he said i guess youll be glad to see that wheat is jumping up it seems as if everybody was buying still that wasnt what i came to talk about  you dont want me at the trial of the rustlers friends asked leland impatiently  grier laughed i guess well fix them without you its quite easy to find out things now the gangs are broken up i heard from regina the other day and the man who got the bullet in his leg is already doing something usefulmaking roads i think the other fellow is going out with the work gang as soon as hes strong enough  but if they let them out wont they run away asked carrie  i guess not said the sergeant drily they hitch a nice little weight to their ankles when it appears advisable and a warder with a shotgun keeps his eye on them then he turned to leland i want a few particulars about that last fire you had  youll get them after supper in the meanwhile theres something tom gallwey wants to talk to you about hadnt you better put up your horse  sergeant grier appeared willing to do so for the fare at prospect was proverbially good presently he moved off to the stables carrie then remembered that she had several matters to attend to the commissariat required supervision when there were threshers about she however made leland promise that he would do nothing further and left him with eveline annersly he turned to the latter with an apologetic smile as he took up one or two of the papers the sergeant had brought  im rather interested in the markets you dont mind he said  eveline annersly said she didnt and watched him with pleasure as he glanced at the papers in turn for it was evident that the news was reassuring  theyve got the bears this timescrewed up tight he said two of the big men gone undercouldnt get the wheat to cover and it looks to me as if there is a bull movement everywhere i cant remember prices ever stiffening this way before when the wheat was pouring in and if the bulls can swing the thing over harvest theres no saying what they may go to  im glad youre satisfied said eveline annersly still your observations are not very clear to me  leland looked at her with a smile the fact is that it seems quite likely im going to be comparatively rich im most where i stood this time last year already and if the market doesnt break away under the harvest prices are going up and up one things certaincarries going to have a month in new york  he stopped a moment and looked at his companion steadily its rather a curious thing that when i suggested she might like a run over to barrockholme she didnt seem to want to go and theres another point thats puzzling me when i mention the crescent or the pearls why does she want to change the subject  eveline annersly decided to tell him the two things go together it happens now and then that a woman has to choose between her relations and her husband carrie chose you those jewels are you know worth a good deal of money and while they belong to her there is reason for believing that unless she had shown herself resolute jimmy would have had them instead in fact i have a notion that her father found it distressingly inconvenient to send them one can raise money on such things in england  a deeper hue crept into lelands sundarkened face i understand nowthat is some of it he said it would be better if you made the whole thing clear  well there was a time when you were rather hard pressed for a thousand pounds carrie if i remember found you a much larger sum but she evidently did not tell you where her jewels went  the mans eyes glowed when at last he spoke there was a thrill in his voice  it hurts me in a way to think of itbut what does that matter he said her jewels everything she had Â Â  when i was in a tight place she brought them all to me Â Â  it was the two thousand pounds that saved me Â Â  shall i have time enough to get even with her in all my life aunt eveline  eveline annersly smiled reassuringly one ought to do a good many little things in a lifetime and after all it is deeds of gratitude that please us most  they went in some little time afterwards while they sat at supper together one of lelands distant neighbours came in  ive ridden straight from the settlement macartney had a wire from winnipeg just before i left he said wheat jumped up another cent today  leland looked across the table at gallwey tom he said before i fell sick my broker sent along an offer for about half the crop i wouldnt sell but i have wondered once or twice if the other man made another bid  he did said gallwey with a quiet smile there were as you may remember two or three weeks when we told you very little and you wouldnt have understood anything during the first of them at the time everybody round here was anxious to sellthat is except mrs leland by her instructions i wrote your broker that you meant to hold on to every bushel  leland said nothing for there were others present but carrie felt her face grow hot when he looked at her it was also significant that soon after the meal was over the others seemed to feel they would be excused if they went out to watch the threshing gallwey whose face beamed surmised that the impression was conveyed to them by eveline annersly though he could not be sure how she had accomplished it  the dusk came early now but a full moon was rising above the prairie and men still toiled about the big machine whose hum rang through the stillness loaded waggons lurched through the crackling stubble outside the homestead leland sat with his wife watching them  the first wheat we sell will get that crescent back he said the next will take us for two months to new york well start when the snow is on the ground but it will not be like that first drive we had  there was a curious little tremor in carrie lelands voice charley she said everything is different now you have driven out the rustlers and you have saved your wheat  leland laughed  that isnt quite what you mean and after all it wouldnt go very far by itself the thing that counts the most is that carrie leland is content with her prairie farmer     popular copyright books  at moderate prices  any of the following titles can be bought of your bookseller at 50 cents per volume
