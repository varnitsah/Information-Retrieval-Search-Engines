49954069	the great stone face and other tales of the white mountains  by nathaniel hawthorne   1882   contents       introduction      the great stone face      the ambitious guest      the great carbuncle      sketches from memory     introduction  the first three numbers in this collection are tales of the white hills in new hampshire the passages from sketches from memory show that hawthorne had visited the mountains in one of his occasional rambles from home but there are no entries in his note books which give accounts of such a visit there is however among these notes the following interesting paragraph written in 1840 and clearly foreshadowing the great stone face  the semblance of a human face to be formed on the side of a mountain or in the fracture of a small stone by a lusus naturae freak of nature the face is an object of curiosity for years or centuries and by and by a boy is born whose features gradually assume the aspect of that portrait at some critical juncture the resemblance is found to be perfect a prophecy may be connected  it is not impossible that this conceit occurred to hawthorne before he had himself seen the old man of the mountain or the profile in the franconia notch which is generally associated in the minds of readers with the great stone face  in the ambitious guest he has made use of the incident still told to travellers through the notch of the destruction of the willey family in august 1826 the house occupied by the family was on the slope of a mountain and after a long drought there was a terrible tempest which not only raised the river to a great height but loosened the surface of the mountain so that a great landslide took place the house was in the track of the slide and the family rushed out of doors had they remained within they would have been safe for a ledge above the house parted the avalanche so that it was diverted into two paths and swept past the house on either side mr and mrs willey their five children and two hired men were crushed under the weight of earth rocks and trees  in the sketches from memory hawthorne gives an intimation of the tale which he might write and did afterward write of the great carbuncle the paper is interesting as showing what were the actual experiences out of which he formed his imaginative stories      the great stone face and other tales of the white mountains     the great stone face  one afternoon when the sun was going down a mother and her little boy sat at the door of their cottage talking about the great stone face they had but to lift their eyes and there it was plainly to be seen though miles away with the sunshine brightening all its features and what was the great stone face embosomed amongst a family of lofty mountains there was a valley so spacious that it contained many thousand inhabitants some of these good people dwelt in loghuts with the black forest all around them on the steep and difficult hillsides others had their homes in comfortable farmhouses and cultivated the rich soil on the gentle slopes or level surfaces of the valley others again were congregated into populous villages where some wild highland rivulet tumbling down from its birthplace in the upper mountain region had been caught and tamed by human cunning and compelled to turn the machinery of cottonfactories the inhabitants of this valley in short were numerous and of many modes of life but all of them grown people and children had a kind of familiarity with the great stone face although some possessed the gift of distinguishing this grand natural phenomenon more perfectly than many of their neighbors  the great stone face then was a work of nature in her mood of majestie playfulness formed on the perpendicular side of a mountain by some immense rocks which had been thrown together in such a position as when viewed at a proper distance precisely to resemble the features of the human countenance it seemed as if an enormous giant or a titan had sculptured his own likeness on the precipice there was the broad arch of the forehead a hundred feet in height the nose with its long bridge and the vast lips which if they could have spoken would have rolled their thunder accents from one end of the valley to the other true it is that if the spectator approached too near he lost the outline of the gigantic visage and could discern only a heap of ponderous and gigantic rocks piled in chaotic ruin one upon another retracing his steps however the wondrous features would again be seen and the farther he withdrew from them the more like a human face with all its original divinity intact did they appear until as it grew dim in the distance with the clouds and glorified vapor of the mountains clustering about it the great stone face seemed positively to be alive  it was a happy lot for children to grow up to manhood or womanhood with the great stone face before their eyes for all the features were noble and the expression was at once grand and sweet as if it were the glow of a vast warm heart that embraced all mankind in its affections and had room for more it was an education only to look at it according to the belief of many people the valley owed much of its fertility to this benign aspect that was continually beaming over it illuminating the clouds and infusing its tenderness into the sunshine  as we began with saying a mother and her little boy sat at their cottagedoor gazing at the great stone face and talking about it the childs name was ernest  mother said he while the titanic visage miled on him i wish that it could speak for it looks so very kindly that its voice must needs be pleasant if i were to see a man with such a face i should love him dearly if an old prophecy should come to pass answered his mother we may see a man some time for other with exactly such a face as that what prophecy do you mean dear mother eagerly inquired ernest pray tell me all about it  so his mother told him a story that her own mother had told to her when she herself was younger than little ernest a story not of things that were past but of what was yet to come a story nevertheless so very old that even the indians who formerly inhabited this valley had heard it from their forefathers to whom as they affirmed it had been murmured by the mountain streams and whispered by the wind among the treetops the purport was that at some future day a child should be born hereabouts who was destined to become the greatest and noblest personage of his time and whose countenance in manhood should bear an exact resemblance to the great stone face not a few oldfashioned people and young ones likewise in the ardor of their hopes still cherished an enduring faith in this old prophecy but others who had seen more of the world had watched and waited till they were weary and had beheld no man with such a face nor any man that proved to be much greater or nobler than his neighbors concluded it to be nothing but an idle tale at all events the great man of the prophecy had not yet appeared  o mother dear mother cried ernest clapping his hands above his head i do hope that i shall live to see him  his mother was an affectionate and thoughtful woman and felt that it was wisest not to discourage the generous hopes of her little boy so she only said to him perhaps you may  and ernest never forgot the story that his mother told him it was always in his mind whenever he looked upon the great stone face he spent his childhood in the logcottage where he was born and was dutiful to his mother and helpful to her in many things assisting her much with his little hands and more with his loving heart in this manner from a happy yet often pensive child he grew up to be a mild quiet unobtrusive boy and sunbrowned with labor in the fields but with more intelligence brightening his aspect than is seen in many lads who have been taught at famous schools yet ernest had had no teacher save only that the great stone face became one to him when the toil of the day was over he would gaze at it for hours until he began to imagine that those vast features recognized him and gave him a smile of kindness and encouragement responsive to his own look of veneration we must not take upon us to affirm that this was a mistake although the face may have looked no more kindly at ernest than at all the world besides but the secret was that the boys tender and confiding simplicity discerned what other people could not see and thus the love which was meant for all became his peculiar portion  about this time there went a rumor throughout the valley that the great man foretold from ages long ago who was to bear a resemblance to the great stone face had appeared at last it seems that many years before a young man had migrated from the valley and settled at a distant seaport where after getting together a little money he had set up as a shopkeeper his name but i could never learn whether it was his real one or a nickname that had grown out of his habits and success in lifewas gathergold  being shrewd and active and endowed by providence with that inscrutable faculty which develops itself in what the world calls luck he became an exceedingly rich merchant and owner of a whole fleet of bulkybottomed ships all the countries of the globe appeared to join hands for the mere purpose of adding heap after heap to the mountainous accumulation of this one mans wealth the cold regions of the north almost within the gloom and shadow of the arctic circle sent him their tribute in the shape of furs hot africa sifted for him the golden sands of her rivers and gathered up the ivory tusks of her great elephants out of the forests the east came bringing him the rich shawls and spices and teas and the effulgence of diamonds and the gleaming purity of large pearls the ocean not to be behindhand with the earth yielded up her mighty whales that mr gathergold might sell their oil and make a profit on it be the original commodity what it might it was gold within his grasp it might be said of him as of midas in the fable that whatever he touched with his finger immediately glistened and grew yellow and was changed at once into sterling metal or which suited him still better into piles of coin and when mr gathergold had become so very rich that it would have taken him a hundred years only to count his wealth he bethought himself of his native valley and resolved to go back thither and end his days where he was born with this purpose in view he sent a skilful architect to build him such a palace as should be fit for a man of his vast wealth to live in  as i have said above it had already been rumored in the valley that mr gathergold had turned out to be the prophetic personage so long and vainly looked for and that his visage was the perfect and undeniable similitude of the great stone face people were the more ready to believe that this must needs be the fact when they beheld the splendid edifice that rose as if by enchantment on the site of his fathers old weatherbeaten farmhouse the exterior was of marble so dazzlingly white that it seemed as though the whole structure might melt away in the sunshine like those humbler ones which mr gathergold in his young playdays before his fingers were gifted with the touch of transmutation had been accustomed to build of snow it had a richly ornamented portico supported by tall pillars beneath which was a lofty door studded with silver knobs and made of a kind of variegated wood that had been brought from beyond the sea the windows from the floor to the ceiling of each stately apartment were composed respectively of but one enormous pane of glass so transparently pure that it was said to be a finer medium than even the vacant atmosphere hardly anybody had been permitted to see the interior of this palace but it was reported and with good semblance of truth to be far more gorgeous than the outside insomuch that whatever was iron or brass in other houses was silver or gold in this and mr gathergolds bedchamber especially made such a glittering appearance that no ordinary man would have been able to close his eyes there but on the other hand mr gathergold was now so inured to wealth that perhaps he could not have closed his eyes unless where the gleam of it was certain to find its way beneath his eyelids  in due time the mansion was finished next came the upholsterers with magnificent furniture then a whole troop of black and white servants the haringers of mr gathergold who in his own majestic person was expected to arrive at sunset our friend ernest meanwhile had been deeply stirred by the idea that the great man the noble man the man of prophecy after so many ages of delay was at length to be made manifest to his native valley he knew boy as he was that there were a thousand ways in which mr gathergold with his vast wealth might transform himself into an angel of beneficence and assume a control over human affairs as wide and benignant as the smile of the great stone face full of faith and hope ernest doubted not that what the people said was true and that now he was to behold the living likeness of those wondrous features on the mountainside while the boy was still gazing up the valley and fancying as he always did that the great stone face returned his gaze and looked kindly at him the rumbling of wheels was heard approaching swiftly along the winding road  here he comes cried a group of people who were assembled to witness the arrival here comes the great mr gathergold  a carriage drawn by four horses dashed round the turn of the road within it thrust partly out of the window appeared the physiognomy of the old man with a skin as yellow as if his own midashand had transmuted it he had a low forehead small sharp eyes puckered about with innumerable wrinkles and very thin lips which he made still thinner by pressing them forcibly together  the very image or the great stone face shouted the people sure enough the old prophecy is true and here we have the great man come at last  and what greatly perplexed ernest they seemed actually to believe that here was the likeness which they spoke of by the roadside there chanced to be an old beggar woman and two little beggarchildren stragglers from some faroff region who as the carriage rolled onward held out their hands and lifted up their doleful voices most piteously beseeching charity a yellow claw the very same that had dawed together so much wealthpoked itself out of the coachwindow and dropt some copper coins upon the ground so that though the great mans name seems to have been gathergold he might just as suitably have been nicknamed scattercopper still nevertheless with an earnest shout and evidently with as much good faith as ever the people bellowed he is the very image of the great stone face but ernest turned sadly from the wrinkled shrewdness of that sordid visage and gazed up the valley where amid a gathering mist gilded by the last sunbeams he could still distinguish those glorious features which had impressed themselves into his soul their aspect cheered him what did the benign lips seem to say  he will come fear not ernest the man will come  the years went on and ernest ceased to be a boy he had grown to be a young man now he attracted little notice from the other inhabitants of the valley for they saw nothing remarkable in his way of life save that when the labor of the day was over he still loved to go apart and gaze and meditate upon the great stone face according to their idea of the matter it was a folly indeed but pardonable inasmuch as ernest was industrious kind and neighborly and neglected no duty for the sake of indulging this idle habit they knew not that the great stone face had become a teacher to him and that the sentiment which was expressed in it would enlarge the young mans heart and fill it with wider and deeper sympathies than other hearts they knew not that thence would come a better wisdom than could be learned from books and a better life than could be moulded on the defaced example of other human lives neither did ernest know that the thoughts and affections which came to him so naturally in the fields and at the fireside and wherever he communed with himself were of a higher tone than those which all men shared with him a simple soulsimple as when his mother first taught him the old prophecyhe beheld the marvellous features beaming adown the valley and still wondered that their human counterpart was so long in making his appearance  by this time poor mr gathergold was dead and buried and the oddest part of the matter was that his wealth which was the body and spirit of his existence had disappeared before his death leaving nothing of him but a living skeleton covered over with a wrinkled yellow skin since the melting away of his gold it had been very generally conceded that there was no such striking resemblance after all betwixt the ignoble features of the ruined merchant and that majestic face upon the mountainside so the people ceased to honor him during his lifetime and quietly consigned him to forgetfulness after his decease once in a while it is true his memory was brought up in connection with the magnificent palace which he had built and which had long ago been turned into a hotel for the accommodation of strangers multitudes of whom came every summer to visit that famous natural curiosity the great stone face thus mr gathergold being discredited and thrown into the shade the man of prophecy was yet to come  it so happened that a nativeborn son of the valley many years before had enlisted as a soldier and after a great deal of hard fighting had now become an illustrious commander whatever he may be called in history he was known in camps and on the battlefield under the nickname of old bloodandthunder this warworn veteran being now infirm with age and wounds and weary of the turmoil of a military life and of the roll of the drum and the clangor of the trumpet that had so long been ringing in his ears had lately signified a purpose of returning to his native valley hoping to find repose where he remembered to have left it the inhabitants his old neighbors and their grownup children were resolved to welcome the renowned warrior with a salute of cannon and a public dinner and all the more enthusiastically it being affirmed that now at last the likeness of the great stone face had actually appeared an aiddecamp of old bloodandthunder travelling through the valley was said to have been struck with the resemblance moreover the schoolmates and early acquaintances of the general were ready to testify on oath that to the best of their recollection the aforesaid general had been exceedingly like the majestic image even when a boy only that the idea had never occurred to them at that period great therefore was the excitement throughout the valley and many people who had never once thought of glancing at the great stone face for years before now spent their time in gazing at it for the sake of knowing exactly how general bloodandthunder looked  on the day of the great festival ernest with all the other people of the valley left their work and proceeded to the spot where the sylvan banquet was prepared as he approached the loud voice of the rev dr battleblast was heard beseeching a blessing on the good things set before them and on the distinguished friend of peace in whose honor they were assembled the tables were arranged in a cleared space of the woods shut in by the surrounding trees except where a vista opened eastward and afforded a distant view of the great stone face over the generals chair which was a relic from the home of washington there was an arch of verdant boughs with the laurel profusely intermixed and surmounted by his countrys banner beneath which he had won his victories our friend ernest raised himself on his tiptoes in hopes to get a glimpse of the celebrated guest but there was a mighty crowd about the tables anxious to hear the toasts and speeches and to catch any word that might fall from the general in reply and a volunteer company doing duty as a guard pricked ruthlessly with their bayonets at any particularly quiet person among the throng so ernest being of an unobtrusive character was thrust quite into the background where he could see no more of old bloodandthunders physiognomy than if it had been still blazing on the battlefield to console himself he turned towards the great stone face which like a faithful and longremembered friend looked back and smiled upon him through the vista of the forest meantime however he could overhear the remarks of various individuals who were comparing the features of the hero with the face on the distant mountainside  t is the same face to a hair cried one man cutting a caper for joy  wonderfully like thats a fact responded another  like why i call it old bloodandthunder himself in a monstrous lookingglass cried a third  and why not hes the greatest man of this or any other age beyond a doubt  and then all three of the speakers gave a great shout which communicated electricity to the crowd and called forth a roar from a thousand voices that went reverberating for miles among the mountains until you might have supposed that the great stone face had poured its thunderbreath into the cry all these comments and this vast enthusiasm served the more to interest our friend nor did he think of questioning that now at length the mountainvisage had found its human counterpart it is true ernest had imagined that this longlookedfor personage would appear in the character of a man of peace uttering wisdom and doing good and making people happy but taking an habitual breadth of view with all his simplicity he contended that providence should choose its own method of blessing mankind and could conceive that this great end might be effected even by a warrior and a bloody sword should inscrutable wisdom see fit to order matters so  the general the general was now the cry hush silence old bloodandthunders going to make a speech  even so for the cloth being removed the generals health had been drunk amid shouts of applause and he now stood upon his feet to thank the company ernest saw him there he was over the shoulders of the crowd from the two glittering epaulets and embroidered collar upward beneath the arch of green boughs with intertwined laurel and the banner drooping as if to shade his brow and there too visible in the same glance through the vista of the forest appeared the great stone face and was there indeed such a resemblance as the crowd had testified alas ernest could not recognize it he beheld a warworn and weatherbeaten countenance full of energy and expressive of an iron will but the gentle wisdom the deep broad tender sympathies were altogether wanting in old bloodandthunders visage and even if the great stone face had assumed his look of stern command the milder traits would still have tempered it  this is not the man of prophecy sighed ernest to himself as he made his way out of the throng and must the world wait longer yet  the mists had congregated about the distant mountainside and there were seen the grand and awful features of the great stone face awful but benignant as if a mighty angel were sitting among the hills and enrobing himself in a cloudvesture of gold and purple as he looked ernest could hardly believe but that a smile beamed over the whole visage with a radiance still brightening although without motion of the lips it was probably the effect of the western sunshine melting through the thinly diffused vapors that had swept between him and the object that he gazed at butas it always didthe aspect of his marvellous friend made ernest as hopeful as if he had never hoped in vain  fear not ernest said his heart even as if the great face were whispering himfear not ernest he will come  more years sped swiftly and tranquilly away ernest still dwelt in his native valley and was now a man of middle age by imperceptible degrees he had become known among the people now as heretofore he labored for his bread and was the same simplehearted man that he had always been but he had thought and felt so much he had given so many of the best hours of his life to unworldly hopes for some great good to mankind that it seemed as though he had been talking with the angels and had imbibed a portion of their wisdom unawares it was visible in the calm and wellconsidered beneficence of his daily life the quiet stream of which had made a wide green margin all along its course not a day passed by that the world was not the better because this man humble as he was had lived he never stepped aside from his own path yet would always reach a blessing to his neighbor almost involuntarily too he had become a preacher the pure and high simplicity of his thought which as one of its manifestations took shape in the good deeds that dropped silently from his hand flowed also forth in speech he uttered truths that wrought upon and moulded the lives of those who heard him his auditors it may be never suspected that ernest their own neighbor and familiar friend was more than an ordinary man least of all did ernest himself suspect it but inevitably as the murmur of a rivulet came thoughts out of his mouth that no other human lips had spoken  when the peoples minds had had a little time to cool they were ready enough to acknowledge their mistake in imagining a similarity between general bloodandthunders truculent physiognomy and the benign visage on the mountainside but now again there were reports and many paragraphs in the newspapers affirming that the likeness of the great stone face had appeared upon the broad shoulders of a certain eminent statesman he like mr gathergold and old bloodandthunder was a native of the valley but had left it in his early days and taken up the trades of law and politics instead of the rich mans wealth and the warriors sword he had but a tongue and it was mightier than both together so wonderfully eloquent was he that whatever he might choose to say his auditors had no choice but to believe him wrong looked like right and right like wrong for when it pleased him he could make a kind of illuminated fog with his mere breath and obscure the natural daylight with it his tongue indeed was a magic instrument sometimes it rumbled like the thunder sometimes it warbled like the sweetest music it was the blast of warthe song of peace and it seemed to have a heart in it when there was no such matter in good truth he was a wondrous man and when his tongue had acquired him all other imaginable successwhen it had been heard in halls of state and in the courts of princes and potentatesafter it had made him known all over the world even as a voice crying from shore to shoreit finally persuaded his countrymen to select him for the presidency before this timeindeed as soon as he began to grow celebratedhis admirers had found out the resemblance between him and the great stone face and so much were they struck by it that throughout the country this distinguished gentleman was known by the name of old stony phiz the phrase was considered as giving a highly favorable aspect to his political prospects for as is likewise the case with the popedom nobody ever becomes president without taking a name other than his own  while his friends were doing their best to make him president old stony phiz as he was called set out on a visit to the valley where he was born of course he had no other object than to shake hands with his fellowcitizens and neither thought nor cared about any effect which his progress through the country might have upon the election magnificent preparations were made to receive the illustrious statesman a cavalcade of horsemen set forth to meet him at the boundary line of the state and all the people left their business and gathered along the wayside to see him pass among these was ernest though more than once disappointed as we have seen he had such a hopeful and confiding nature that he was always ready to believe in whatever seemed beautiful and good  he kept his heart continually open and thus was sure to catch the blessing from on high when it should come so now again as buoyantly as ever he went forth to behold the likeness of the great stone face  the cavalcade came prancing along the road with a great clattering of hoofs and a mighty cloud of dust which rose up so dense and high that the visage of the mountainside was completely hidden from ernests eyes all the great men of the neighborhood were there on horseback militia officers in uniform the member of congress the sheriff of the county the editors of newspapers and many a farmer too had mounted his patient steed with his sunday coat upon his back it really was a very brilliant spectacle especially as there were numerous banners flaunting over the cavalcade on some of which were gorgeous portraits of the illustrious statesman and the great stone face smiling familiarly at one another like two brothers if the pictures were to be trusted the mutual resemblance it must be confessed was marvellous we must not forget to mention that there was a band of music which made the echoes of the mountains ring and reverberate with the loud triumph of its strains so that airy and soulthrilling melodies broke out among all the heights and hollows as if every nook of his native valley had found a voice to welcome the distinguished guest but the grandest effect was when the faroff mountain precipice flung back the music for then the great stone face itself seemed to be swelling the triumphant chorus in acknowledgment that at length the man of prophecy was come  all this while the people were throwing up their hats and shouting with enthusiasm so contagious that the heart of ernest kindled up and he likewise threw up his hat and shouted as loudly as the loudest huzza for the great man huzza for old stony phiz but as yet he had not seen him  here he is now cried those who stood near ernest there there look at old stony phiz and then at the old man of the mountain and see if they are not as like as two twin brothers  in the midst of all this gallant array came an open barouche drawn by four white horses and in the barouche with his massive head uncovered sat the illustrious statesman old stony phiz himself  confess it said one of ernests neighbors to him the great stone face has met its match at last  now it must be owned that at his first glimpse of the countenance which was bowing and smiling from the barouche ernest did fancy that there was a resemblance between it and the old familiar face upon the mountainside the brow with its massive depth and loftiness and all the other features indeed were boldly and strongly hewn as if in emulation of a more than heroic of a titanic model but the sublimity and stateliness the grand expression of a divine sympathy that illuminated the mountain visage and etherealized its ponderous granite substance into spirit might here be sought in vain something had been originally left out or had departed and therefore the marvellously gifted statesman had always a weary gloom in the deep caverns of his eyes as of a child that has outgrown its playthings or a man of mighty faculties and little aims whose life with all its high performances was vague and empty because no high purpose had endowed it with reality  still ernests neighbor was thrusting his elbow into his side and pressing him for an answer  confess confess is not he the very picture of your old man of the mountain  no said ernest bluntly i see little or no likeness  then so much the worse for the great stone face answered his neighbor and again he set up a shout for old stony phiz  but ernest turned away melancholy and almost despondent for this was the saddest of his disappointments to behold a man who might have fulfilled the prophecy and had not willed to do so meantime the cavalcade the banners the music and the barouches swept past him with the vociferous crowd in the rear leaving the dust to settle down and the great stone face to be revealed again with the grandeur that it had worn for untold centuries  lo here i am ernest the benign lips seemed to say i have waited longer than thou and am not yet weary fear not the man will come  the years hurried onward treading in their haste on one anothers heels and now they began to bring white hairs and scatter them over the head of ernest they made reverend wrinkles across his forehead and furrows in his cheeks he was an aged man but not in vain had he grown old more than the white hairs on his head were the sage thoughts in his mind his wrinkles and furrows were inscriptions that time had graved and in which he had written legends of wisdom that had been tested by the tenor of a life and ernest had ceased to be obscure unsought for undesired had come the fame which so many seek and made him known in the great world beyond the limits of the valley in which he had dwelt so quietly college professors and even the active men of cities came from far to see and converse with ernest for the report had gone abroad that this simple husbandman had ideas unlike those of other men not gained from books but of a higher tonea tranquil and familiar majesty as if he had been talking with the angels as his daily friends whether it were sage statesman or philanthropist ernest received these visitors with the gentle sincerity that had characterized him from boyhood and spoke freely with them of whatever came uppermost or lay deepest in his heart or their own while they talked together his face would kindle unawares and shine upon them as with a mild evening light pensive with the fulness of such discourse his guests took leave and went their way and passing up the valley paused to look at the great stone face imagining that they had seen its likeness in a human countenance but could not remember where  while ernest had been growing up and growing old a bountiful providence had granted a new poet to this earth he likewise was a native of the valley but had spent the greater part of his life at a distance from that romantic region pouring out his sweet music amid the bustle and din of cities often however did the mountains which had been familiar to him in his childhood lift their snowy peaks into the clear atmosphere of his poetry neither was the great stone face forgotten for the poet had celebrated it in an ode which was grand enough to have been uttered by its own majestic lips this man of genius we may say had come down from heaven with wonderful endowments if he sang of a mountain the eyes of all mankind beheld a mightier grandeur reposing on its breast or soaring to its summit than had before been seen there if his theme were a lovely lake a celestial smile had now been thrown over it to gleam forever on its surface if it were the vast old sea even the deep immensity of its dread bosom seemed to swell the higher as if moved by the emotions of the song thus the world assumed another and a better aspect from the hour that the poet blessed it with his happy eyes the creator had bestowed him as the last best touch to his own handiwork creation was not finished till the poet came to interpret and so complete it  the effect was no less high and beautiful when his human brethren were the subject of his verse the man or woman sordid with the common dust of life who crossed his daily path and the little child who played in it were glorified if they beheld him in his mood of poetic faith he showed the golden links of the great chain that intertwined them with an angelic kindred he brought out the hidden traits of a celestial birth that made them worthy of such kin some indeed there were who thought to show the soundness of their judgment by affirming that all the beauty and dignity of the natural world existed only in the poets fancy let such men speak for themselves who undoubtedly appear to have been spawned forth by nature with a contemptuous bitterness she plastered them up out of her refuse stuff after all the swine were made as respects all things else the poets ideal was the truest truth  the songs of this poet found their way to ernest he read them after his customary toil seated on the bench before his cottagedoor where for such a length of time he had filled his repose with thought by gazing at the great stone face and now as he read stanzas that caused the soul to thrill within him he lifted his eyes to the vast countenance beaming on him so benignantly  o majestic friend he murmured addressing the great stone face is not this man worthy to resemble thee  the face seemed to smile but answered not a word  now it happened that the poet though he dwelt so far away had not only heard of ernest but had meditated much upon his character until he deemed nothing so desirable as to meet this man whose untaught wisdom walked hand in hand with the noble simplicity of his life  one summer morning therefore he took passage by the railroad and in the decline of the afternoon alighted from the cars at no great distance from ernests cottage the great hotel which had formerly been the palace of mr gathergold was close at hand but the poet with his carpetbag on his arm inquired at once where ernest dwelt and was resolved to be accepted as his guest  approaching the door he there found the good old man holding a volume in his hand which alternately he read and then with a finger between the leaves looked lovingly at the great stone face  good evening said the poet can you give a traveller a nights lodging  willingly answered ernest and then he added smiling methinks i never saw the great stone face look so hospitably at a stranger  the poet sat down on the bench beside him and he and ernest talked together often had the poet held intercourse with the wittiest and the wisest but never before with a man like ernest whose thoughts and feelings gushed up with such a natural feeling and who made great truths so familiar by his simple utterance of them angels as had been so often said seemed to have wrought with him at his labor in the fields angels seemed to have sat with him by the fireside and dwelling with angels as friend with friends he had imbibed the sublimity of their ideas and imbued it with the sweet and lowly charm of household words so thought the poet and ernest on the other hand was moved and agitated by the living images which the poet flung out of his mind and which peopled all the air about the cottagedoor with shapes of beauty both gay and pensive the sympathies of these two men instructed them with a profounder sense than either could have attained alone their minds accorded into one strain and made delightful music which neither of them could have claimed as all his own nor distinguished his own share from the others they led one another as it were into a high pavilion of their thoughts so remote and hitherto so dim that they had never entered it before and so beautiful that they desired to be there always  as ernest listened to the poet he imagined that the great stone face was bending forward to listen too he gazed earnestly into the poets glowing eyes  who are you my strangely gifted guest he said  the poet laid his finger on the volume that ernest had been reading  you have read these poems said he you know me thenfor i wrote them  again and still more earnestly than before ernest examined the poets features then turned towards the great stone face then back with an uncertain aspect to his guest but his countenance fell he shook his head and sighed  wherefore are you sad inquired the poet because replied ernest all through life i have awaited the fulfilment of a prophecy and when i read these poems i hoped that it might be fulfilled in you  you hoped answered the poet faintly smiling to find in me the likeness of the great stone face and you are disappointed as formerly with mr gathergold and old bloodandthunder and old stony phiz yes ernest it is my doom  you must add my name to the illustrious three and record another failure of your hopes forin shame and sadness do i speak it ernesti am not worthy to be typified by yonder benign and majestic image  and why asked ernest he pointed to the volume are not those thoughts divine  they have a strain of the divinity replied the poet you can hear in them the faroff echo of a heavenly song but my life dear ernest has not corresponded with my thought i have had grand dreams but they have been only dreams because i have livedand that too by my own choice among poor and mean realities sometimes evenshall i dare to say iti lack faith in the grandeur the beauty and the goodness which my own works are said to have made more evident in nature and in human life why then pure seeker of the good and true shouldst thou hope to find me in yonder image of the divine  the poet spoke sadly and his eyes were dim with tears so likewise were those of ernest  at the hour of sunset as had long been his frequent custom ernest was to discourse to an assemblage of the neighboring inhabitants in the open air he and the poet arm in arm still talking together as they went along proceeded to the spot it was a small nook among the hills with a gray precipice behind the stern front of which was relieved by the pleasant foliage of many creeping plants that made a tapestry for the naked rock by hanging their festoons from all its rugged angles at a small elevation above the ground set in a rich framework of verdure there appeared a niche spacious enough to admit a human figure with freedom for such gestures as spontaneously accompany earnest thought and genuine emotion into this natural pulpit ernest ascended and threw a look of familiar kindness around upon his audience they stood or sat or reclined upon the grass as seemed good to each with the departing sunshine falling obliquely over them and mingling its subdued cheerfulness with the solemnity of a grove of ancient trees beneath and amid the boughs of which the golden rays were constrained to pass in another direction was seen the great stone face with the same cheer combined with the same solemnity in its benignant aspect  ernest began to speak giving to the people of what was in his heart and mind his words had power because they accorded with his thoughts and his thoughts had reality and depth because they harmonized with the life which he had always lived it was not mere breath that this preacher uttered they were the words of life because a life of good deeds and holy love was melted into them pearls pure and rich had been dissolved into this precious draught the poet as he listened felt that the being and character of ernest were a nobler strain of poetry than he had ever written  his eyes glistening with tears he gazed reverentially at the venerable man and said within himself that never was there an aspect so worthy of a prophet and a sage as that mild sweet thoughtful countenance with the glory of white hair diffused about it at a distance but distinctly to be seen high up in the golden light of the setting sun appeared the great stone face with hoary mists around it like the white hairs around the brow of ernest its look of grand beneficence seemed to embrace the world  at that moment in sympathy with a thought which he was about to utter the face of ernest assumed a grandeur of expression so imbued with benevolence that the poet by an irresistible impulse threw his arms aloft and shouted  behold behold ernest is himself the likeness of the great stone face  then all the people looked and saw that what the deepsighted poet said was true the prophecy was fulfilled but ernest having finished what he had to say took the poets arm and walked slowly homeward still hoping that some wiser and better man than himself would by and by appear bearing a resemblance to the great stone face      the ambitious guest  one september night a family had gathered round their hearth and piled it high with the driftwood of mountain streams the dry cones of the pine and the splintered ruins of great trees that had come crashing down the precipice up the chimney roared the fire and brightened the room with its broad blaze the faces of the father and mother had a sober gladness the children laughed the eldest daughter was the image of happiness at seventeen and the aged grandmother who sat knitting in the warmest place was the image of happiness grown old they had found the herb heartsease in the bleakest spot of all new england this family were situated in the notch of the white hills where the wind was sharp throughout the year and pitilessly cold in the wintergiving their cottage all its fresh inclemency before it descended on the valley of the saco they dwelt in a cold spot and a dangerous one for a mountain towered above their heads so steep that the stones would often rumble down its sides and startle them at midnight  the daughter had just uttered some simple jest that filled them all with mirth when the wind came through the notch and seemed to pause before their cottagerattling the door with a sound of wailing and lamentation before it passed into the valley for a moment it saddened them though there was nothing unusual in the tones but the family were glad again when they perceived that the latch was lifted by some traveller whose footsteps had been unheard amid the dreary blast which heralded his approach and wailed as he was entering and went moaning away from the door  though they dwelt in such a solitude these people held daily converse with the world the romantic pass of the notch is a great artery through which the lifeblood of internal commerce is continually throbbing between maine on one side and the green mountains and the shores of the st lawrence on the other the stagecoach always drew up before the door of the cottage the wayfarer with no companion but his staff paused here to exchange a word that the sense of loneliness might not utterly overcome him ere he could pass through the cleft of the mountain or reach the first house in the valley and here the teamster on his way to portland market would put up for the night and if a bachelor might sit an hour beyond the usual bedtime and steal a kiss from the mountain maid at parting it was one of those primitive taverns where the traveller pays only for food and lodging but meets with a homely kindness beyond all price when the footsteps were heard therefore between the outer door and the inner one the whole family rose up grandmother children and all as if about to welcome some one who belonged to them and whose fate was linked with theirs  the door was opened by a young man his face at first wore the melancholy expression almost despondency of one who travels a wild and bleak road at nightfall and alone but soon brightened up when he saw the kindly warmth of his reception he felt his heart spring forward to meet them all from the old woman who wiped a chair with her apron to the little child that held out its arms to him one glance and smile placed the stranger on a footing of innocent familiarity with the eldest daughter  ah this fire is the right thing cried he especially when there is such a pleasant circle round it i am quite benumbed for the notch is just like the pipe of a great pair of bellows it has blown a terrible blast in my face all the way from bartlett  then you are going towards vermont said the master of the house as he helped to take a light knapsack off the young mans shoulders  yes to burlington and far enough beyond replied he i meant to have been at ethan crawfords tonight but a pedestrian lingers along such a road as this it is no matter for when i saw this good fire and all your cheerful faces i felt as if you had kindled it on purpose for me and were waiting my arrival so i shall sit down among you and make myself at home  the frankhearted stranger had just drawn his chair to the fire when something like a heavy footstep was heard without rushing down the steep side of the mountain as with long and rapid strides and taking such a leap in passing the cottage as to strike the opposite precipice the family held their breath because they knew the sound and their guest held his by instinct  the old mountain has thrown a stone at us for fear we should forget him said the landlord recovering himself he sometimes nods his head and threatens to come down but we are old neighbors and agree together pretty well upon the whole besides we have a sure place of refuge hard by if he should be coming in good earnest  let us now suppose the stranger to have finished his supper of bears meat and by his natural felicity of manner to have placed himself on a footing of kindness with the whole family so that they talked as freely together as if he belonged to their mountain brood he was of a proud yet gentle spirithaughty and reserved among the rich and great but ever ready to stoop his head to the lowly cottage door and be like a brother or a son at the poor mans fireside in the household of the notch he found warmth and simplicity of feeling the pervading intelligence of new england and a poetry of native growth which they had gathered when they little thought of it from the mountain peaks and chasms and at the very threshold of their romantic and dangerous abode he had travelled far and alone his whole life indeed had been a solitary path for with the lofty caution of his nature he had kept himself apart from those who might otherwise have been his companions the family too though so kind and hospitable had that consciousness of unity among themselves and separation from the world at large which in every domestic circle should still keep a holy place where no stranger may intrude but this evening a prophetic sympathy impelled the refined and educated youth to pour out his heart before the simple mountaineers and constrained them to answer him with the same free confidence and thus it should have been is not the kindred of a common fate a closer tie than that of birth  the secret of the young mans character was a high and abstracted ambition he could have borne to live an undistinguished life but not to be forgotten in the grave yearning desire had been transformed to hope and hope long cherished had become like certainty that obscurely as he journeyed now a glory was to beam on all his pathwaythough not perhaps while he was treading it but when posterity should gaze back into the gloom of what was now the present they would trace the brightness of his footsteps brightening as meaner glories faded and confess that a gifted one had passed from his cradle to his tomb with none to recognize him  as yet cried the strangerhis cheek glowing and his eye flashing with enthusiasmas yet i have done nothing were i to vanish from the earth tomorrow none would know so much of me as you that a nameless youth came up at nightfall from the valley of the saco and opened his heart to you in the evening and passed through the notch by sunrise and was seen no more not a soul would ask who was he whither did the wanderer go but i cannot die till i have achieved my destiny then let death come i shall have built my monument  there was a continual flow of natural emotion gushing forth amid abstracted reverie which enabled the family to understand this young mans sentiments though so foreign from their own with quick sensibility of the ludicrous he blushed at the ardor into which he had been betrayed  you laugh at me said he taking the eldest daughters hand and laughing himself you think my ambition as nonsensical as if i were to freeze myself to death on the top of mount washington only that people might spy at me from the country round about and truly that would be a noble pedestal for a mans statue  it is better to sit here by this fire answered the girl blushing and be comfortable and contented though nobody thinks about us  i suppose said her father after a fit of musing there is something natural in what the young man says and if my mind had been turned that way i might have felt just the same it is strange wife how his talk has set my head running on things that are pretty certain never to come to pass  perhaps they may observed the wife is the man thinking what he will do when he is a widower  no no cried he repelling the idea with reproachful kindness when i think of your death esther i think of mine too but i was wishing we had a good farm in bartlett or bethlehem or littleton or some other township round the white mountains but not where they could tumble on our heads i should want to stand well with my neighbors and be called squire and sent to general court for a term or two for a plain honest man may do as much good there as a lawyer and when i should be grown quite an old man and you an old woman so as not to be long apart i might die happy enough in my bed and leave you all crying around me a slate gravestone would suit me as well as a marble onewith just my name and age and a verse of a hymn and something to let people know that i lived an honest man and died a christian  there now exclaimed the stranger it is our nature to desire a monument be it slate or marble or a pillar of granite or a glorious memory in the universal heart of man  were in a strange way tonight said the wife with tears in her eyes they say its a sign of something when folks minds go a wandering so hark to the children  they listened accordingly the younger children had been put to bed in another room but with an open door between so that they could be heard talking busily among themselves one and all seemed to have caught the infection from the fireside circle and were outvying each other in wild wishes and childish projects of what they would do when they came to be men and women at length a little boy instead of addressing his brothers and sisters called out to his mother  ill tell you what i wish mother cried he i want you and father and grandmam and all of us and the stranger too to start right away and go and take a drink out of the basin of the flume  nobody could help laughing at the childs notion of leaving a warm bed and dragging them from a cheerful fire to visit the basin of the flumea brook which tumbles over the precipice deep within the notch the boy had hardly spoken when a wagon rattled along the road and stopped a moment before the door it appeared to contain two or three men who were cheering their hearts with the rough chorus of a song which resounded in broken notes between the cliffs while the singers hesitated whether to continue their journey or put up here for the night  father said the girl they are calling you by name  but the good man doubted whether they had really called him and was unwilling to show himself too solicitous of gain by inviting people to patronize his house he therefore did not hurry to the door and the lash being soon applied the travellers plunged into the notch still singing and laughing though their music and mirth came back drearily from the heart of the mountain  there mother cried the boy again theyd have given us a ride to the flume  again they laughed at the childs pertinacious fancy for a night ramble but it happened that a light cloud passed over the daughters spirit she looked gravely into the fire and drew a breath that was almost a sigh it forced its way in spite of a little struggle to repress it then starting and blushing she looked quickly round the circle as if they had caught a glimpse into her bosom the stranger asked what she had been thinking of  nothing answered she with a downcast smile only i felt lonesome just then  oh i have always had a gift of feeling what is in other peoples hearts said he half seriously shall i tell the secrets of yours for i know what to think when a young girl shivers by a warm hearth and complains of lonesomeness at her mothers side shall i put these feelings into words  they would not be a girls feelings any longer if they could be put into words replied the mountain nymph laughing but avoiding his eye  all this was said apart perhaps a germ of love was springing in their hearts so pure that it might blossom in paradise since it could not be matured on earth for women worship such gentle dignity as his and the proud contemplative yet kindly soul is oftenest captivated by simplicity like hers but while they spoke softly and he was watching the happy sadness the lightsome shadows the shy yearnings of a maidens nature the wind through the notch took a deeper and drearier sound it seemed as the fanciful stranger said like the choral strain of the spirits of the blast who in old indian times had their dwelling among these mountains and made their heights and recesses a sacred region there was a wail along the road as if a funeral were passing to chase away the gloom the family threw pine branches on their fire till the dry leaves crackled and the flame arose discovering once again a scene of peace and humble happiness the light hovered about them fondly and caressed them all there were the little faces of the children peeping from their bed apart and here the fathers frame of strength the mothers subdued and careful mien the highbrowed youth the budding girl and the good old grandam still knitting in the warmest place the aged woman looked up from her task and with fingers ever busy was the next to speak  old folks have their notions said she as well as young ones youve been wishing and planning and letting your heads run on one thing and another till youve set my mind a wandering too now what should an old woman wish for when she can go but a step or two before she comes to her grave children it will haunt me night and day till i tell you  what is it mother cried the husband and wife at once  then the old woman with an air of mystery which drew the circle closer round the fire informed them that she had provided her graveclothes some years beforea nice linen shroud a cap with a muslin ruff and everything of a finer sort than she had worn since her wedding day but this evening an old superstition had strangely recurred to her it used to be said in her younger days that if anything were amiss with a corpse if only the ruff were not smooth or the cap did not set right the corpse in the coffin and beneath the clods would strive to put up its cold hands and arrange it the bare thought made her nervous  dont talk so grandmother said the girl shuddering  nowcontinued the old woman with singular earnestness yet smiling strangely at her own follyi want one of you my childrenwhen your mother is dressed and in the coffini want one of you to hold a lookingglass over my face who knows but i may take a glimpse at myself and see whether alls right  old and young we dream of graves and monuments murmured the stranger youth i wonder how mariners feel when the ship is sinking and they unknown and undistinguished are to be buried together in the oceanthat wide and nameless sepulchre  for a moment the old womans ghastly conception so engrossed the minds of her hearers that a sound abroad in the night rising like the roar of a blast had grown broad deep and terrible before the fated group were conscious of it the house and all within it trembled the foundations of the earth seemed to be shaken as if this awful sound were the peal of the last trump young and old exchanged one wild glance and remained an instant pale affrighted without utterance or power to move then the same shriek burst simultaneously from all their lips  the slide the slide  the simplest words must intimate but not portray the unutterable horror of the catastrophe the victims rushed from their cottage and sought refuge in what they deemed a safer spotwhere in contemplation of such an emergency a sort of barrier had been reared alas they had quitted their security and fled right into the pathway of destruction down came the whole side of the mountain in a cataract of ruin just before it reached the house the stream broke into two branchesshivered not a window there but overwhelmed the whole vicinity blocked up the road and annihilated everything in its dreadful course long ere the thunder of the great slide had ceased to roar among the mountains the mortal agony had been endured and the victims were at peace their bodies were never found  the next morning the light smoke was seen stealing from the cottage chimney up the mountain side within the fire was yet smouldering on the hearth and the chairs in a circle round it as if the inhabitants had but gone forth to view the devastation of the slide and would shortly return to thank heaven for their miraculous escape all had left separate tokens by which those who had known the family were made to shed a tear for each who has not heard their name the story has been told far and wide and will forever be a legend of these mountains poets have sung their fate  there were circumstances which led some to suppose that a stranger had been received into the cottage on this awful night and had shared the catastrophe of all its inmates others denied that there were sufficient grounds for such a conjecture woe for the highsouled youth with his dream of earthly immortality his name and person utterly unknown his history his way of life his plans a mystery never to be solved his death and his existence equally a doubt whose was the agony of that death moment     the great carbuncle  a mystery of the white mountains  the indian tradition on which this somewhat extravagant tale is founded is both too wild and too beautiful to be adequately wrought up in prose sullivan in his history of maine written since the revolution remarks that even then the existence of the great carbuncle was not entirely discredited  at nightfall once in the olden time on the rugged side of one of the crystal hills a party of adventurers were refreshing themselves after a toilsome and fruitless quest for the great carbuncle they had come thither not as friends nor partners in the enterprise but each save one youthful pair impelled by his own selfish and solitary longing for this wondrous gem their feeling of brotherhood however was strong enough to induce them to contribute a mutual aid in building a rude hut of branches and kindling a great fire of shattered pines that had drifted down the headlong current of the amonoosuck on the lower bank of which they were to pass the night there was but one of their number perhaps who had become so estranged from natural sympathies by the absorbing spell of the pursuit as to acknowledge no satisfaction at the sight of human faces in the remote and solitary region whither they had ascended a vast extent of wilderness lay between them and the nearest settlement while scant a mile above their heads was that black verge where the hills throw off their shaggy mantle of forest trees and either robe themselves in clouds or tower naked into the sky the roar of the amonoosuck would have been too awful for endurance if only a solitary man had listened while the mountain stream talked with the wind  the adventurers therefore exchanged hospitable greetings and welcomed one another to the hut where each man was the host and all were the guests of the whole company they spread their individual supplies of food on the flat surface of a rock and partook of a general repast at the close of which a sentiment of good fellowship was perceptible among the party though repressed by the idea that the renewed search for the great carbuncle must make them strangers again in the morning seven men and one young woman they warmed themselves together at the fire which extended its bright wall along the whole front of their wigwam as they observed the various and contrasted figures that made up the assemblage each man looking like a caricature of himself in the unsteady light that flickered over him they came mutually to the conclusion that an odder society had never met in city or wilderness on mountain or plain  the eldest of the group a tall lean weatherbeaten man some sixty years of age was clad in the skins of wild animals whose fashion of dress he did well to imitate since the deer the wolf and the bear had long been his most intimate companions he was one of those illfated mortals such as the indians told of whom in their early youth the great carbuncle smote with a peculiar madness and became the passionate dream of their existence all who visited that region knew him as the seeker and by no other name as none could remember when he first took up the search there went a fable in the valley of the saco that for his inordinate lust after the great carbuncle he had been condemned to wander among the mountains till the end of time still with the same feverish hopes at sunrisethe same despair at eve near this miserable seeker sat a little elderly personage wearing a highcrowned hat shaped somewhat like a crucible he was from beyond the sea a doctor cacaphodel who had wilted and dried himself into a mummy by continually stooping over charcoal furnaces and inhaling unwholesome fumes during his researches in chemistry and alchemy it was told of him whether truly or not that at the commencement of his studies he had drained his body of all its richest blood and wasted it with other inestimable ingredients in an unsuccessful experimentand had never been a well man since another of the adventurers was master bod pigsnort a weighty merchant and selector boston and an elder of the famous mr nortons church his enemies had a ridiculous story that master pigsnort was accustomed to spend a whole hour after prayer time every morning and evening in wallowing naked among an immense quantity of pinetree shillings which were the earliest silver coinage of massachusetts the fourth whom we shall notice had no name that his companions knew of and was chiefly distinguished by a sneer that always contorted his thin visage and by a prodigious pair of spectacles which were supposed to deform and discolor the whole face of nature to this gentlemans perception the fifth adventurer likewise lacked a name which was the greater pity as he appeared to be a poet he was a brighteyed man but woefully pined away which was no more than natural if as some people affirmed his ordinary diet was fog morning mist and a slice of the densest cloud within his reach sauced with moonshine whenever he could get it certain it is that the poetry which flowed from him had a smack of all these dainties the sixth of the party was a young man of haughty mien and sat somewhat apart from the rest wearing his plumed hat loftily among his elders while the fire glittered on the rich embroidery of his dress and gleamed intensely on the jewelled pommel of his sword this was the lord de vere who when at home was said to spend much of his time in the burial vault of his dead progenitors rummaging their mouldy coffins in search of all the earthly pride and vainglory that was hidden among bones and dust so that besides his own share he had the collected haughtiness of his whole line of ancestry  lastly there was a handsome youth in rustic garb and by his side a blooming little person in whom a delicate shade of maiden reserve was just melting into the rich glow of a young wifes affection her name was hannah and her husbands matthew two homely names yet well enough adapted to the simple pair who seemed strangely out of place among the whimsical fraternity whose wits had been set agog by the great carbuncle  beneath the shelter of one hut in the bright blaze of the same fire sat this varied group of adventurers all so intent upon a single object that of whatever else they began to speak their closing words were sure to be illuminated with the great carbuncle several related the circumstances that brought them thither one had listened to a travellers tale of this marvellous stone in his own distant country and had immediately been seized with such a thirst for beholding it as could only be quenched in its intensest lustre another so long ago as when the famous captain smith visited these coasts had seen it blazing far at sea and had felt no rest in all the intervening years till now that he took up the search a third being camped on a hunting expedition full forty miles south of the white mountains awoke at midnight and beheld the great carbuncle gleaming like a meteor so that the shadows of the trees fell backward from it they spoke of the innumerable attempts which had been made to reach the spot and of the singular fatality which had hitherto withheld success from all adventurers though it might seem so easy to follow to its source a light that overpowered the moon and almost matched the sun it was observable that each smiled scornfully at the madness of every other in anticipating better fortune than the past yet nourished a scarcely hidden conviction that he would himself be the favored one as if to allay their too sanguine hopes they recurred to the indian traditions that a spirit kept watch about the gem and bewildered those who sought it either by removing it from peak to peak of the higher hills or by calling up a mist from the enchanted lake over which it hung but these tales were deemed unworthy of credit all professing to believe that the search had been baffled by want of sagacity or perseverance in the adventurers or such other causes as might naturally obstruct the passage to any given point among the intricacies of forest valley and mountain  in a pause of the conversation the wearer of the prodigious spectacles looked round upon the party making each individual in turn the object of the sneer which invariably dwelt upon his countenance  so fellowpilgrims said he here we are seven wise men and one fair damselwho doubtless is as wise as any graybeard of the company here we are i say all bound on the same goodly enterprise methinks now it were not amiss that each of us declare what he proposes to do with the great carbuncle provided he have the good hap to clutch it what says our friend in the bear skin how mean you good sir to enjoy the prize which you have been seeking the lord knows how long among the crystal hills  how enjoy it exclaimed the aged seeker bitterly i hope for no enjoyment from it that folly has passed long ago i keep up the search for this accursed stone because the vain ambition of my youth has become a fate upon me in old age the pursuit alone is my strengththe energy of my soulthe warmth of my bloodand the pith and marrow of my bones were i to turn my back upon it i should fall down dead on the hither side of the notch which is the gateway of this mountain region yet not to have my wasted lifetime back again would i give up my hopes of the great carbuncle having found it i shall bear it to a certain cavern that i wot of and there grasping it in my arms lie down and die and keep it buried with me forever  o wretch regardless of the interests of science cried doctor cacaphodel with philosophic indignation thou art not worthy to behold even from afar off the lustre of this most precious gem that ever was concocted in the laboratory of nature mine is the sole purpose for which a wise man may desire the possession of the great carbuncle  immediately on obtaining itfor i have a presentiment good people that the prize is reserved to crown my scientific reputationi shall return to europe and employ my remaining years in reducing it to its first elements a portion of the stone will i grind to impalpable powder other parts shall be dissolved in acids or whatever solvents will act upon so admirable a composition and the remainder i design to melt in the crucible or set on fire with the blowpipe by these various methods i shall gain an accurate analysis and finally bestow the result of my labors upon the world in a folio volume  excellent quoth the man with the spectacles nor need you hesitate learned sir on account of the necessary destruction of the gem since the perusal of your folio may teach every mothers son of us to concoct a great carbuncle of his own  but verily said master ichabod pigsnort for mine own part i object to the making of these counterfeits as being calculated to reduce the marketable value of the true gem i tell ye frankly sirs i have an interest in keeping up the price here have i quitted my regular traffic leaving my warehouse in the care of my clerks and putting my credit to great hazard and furthermore have put myself in peril of death or captivity by the accursed heathen savagesand all this without daring to ask the prayers of the congregation because the quest for the great carbuncle is deemed little better than a traffic with the evil one now think ye that i would have done this grievous wrong to my soul body reputation and estate without a reasonable chance of profit  not i pious master pigsnort said the man with the spectacles i never laid such a great folly to thy charge  truly i hope not said the merchant now as touching this great carbuncle i am free to own that i have never had a glimpse of it but be it only the hundredth part so bright as people tell it will surely outvalue the great moguls best diamond which he holds at an incalculable sum wherefore i am minded to put the great carbuncle on shipboard and voyage with it to england france spain italy or into heathendom if providence should send me thither and in a word dispose of the gem to the best bidder among the potentates of the earth that he may place it among his crown jewels if any of ye have a wiser plan let him expound it  that have i thou sordid man exclaimed the poet dost thou desire nothing brighter than gold that thou wouldst transmute all this ethereal lustre into such dross as thou wallowest in already for myself hiding the jewel under my cloak i shall hie me back to my attic chamber in one of the darksome alleys of london there night and day will i gaze upon it my soul shall drink its radiance it shall be diffused throughout my intellectual powers and gleam brightly in every line of poesy that i indite thus long ages after i am gone the splendor of the great carbuncle will blaze around my name  well said master poet cried he of the spectacles hide it under thy cloak sayest thou why it will gleam through the holes and make thee look like a jackolantern  to think ejaculated the lord de vere rather to himself than his companions the best of whom he held utterly unworthy of his intercourseto think that a fellow in a tattered cloak should talk of conveying the great carbuncle to a garret in grub street have not i resolved within myself that the whole earth contains no fitter ornament for the great hall of my ancestral castle there shall it flame for ages making a noonday of midnight glittering on the suits of armor the banners and escutcheons that hang around the wall and keeping bright the memory of heroes wherefore have all other adventurers sought the prize in vain but that i might win it and make it a symbol of the glories of our lofty line and never on the diadem of the white mountains did the great carbuncle hold a place half so honored as is reserved for it in the hall of the de veres  it is a noble thought said the cynic with an obsequious sneer yet might i presume to say so the gem would make a rare sepulchral lamp and would display the glories of your lordships progenitors more truly in the ancestral vault than in the castle hall  nay forsooth observed matthew the young rustic who sat hand in hand with his bride the gentleman has bethought himself of a profitable use for this bright stone hannah here and i are seeking it for a like purpose  how fellow exclaimed his lordship in surprise what castle hall hast thou to hang it in  no castle replied matthew but as neat a cottage as any within sight of the crystal hills ye must know friends that hannah and i being wedded the last week have taken up the search of the great carbuncle because we shall need its light in the long winter evenings and it will be such a pretty thing to show the neighbors when they visit us it will shine through the house so that we may pick up a pin in any corner and will set all the windows aglowing as if there were a great fire of pine knots in the chimney and then how pleasant when we awake in the night to be able to see one anothers faces  there was a general smile among the adventurers at the simplicity of the young couples project in regard to this wondrous and invaluable stone with which the greatest monarch on earth might have been proud to adorn his palace especially the man with spectacles who had sneered at all the company in turn now twisted his visage into such an expression of illnatured mirth that matthew asked him rather peevishly what he himself meant to do with the great carbuncle  the great carbuncle answered the cynic with ineffable scorn why you blockhead there is no such thing in rerum natura i have come three thousand miles and am resolved to set my foot on every peak of these mountains and poke my head into every chasm for the sole purpose of demonstrating to the satisfaction of any man one whit less an ass than thyself that the great carbuncle is all a humbug  vain and foolish were the motives that had brought most of the adventurers to the crystal hills but none so vain so foolish and so impious too as that of the scoffer with the prodigious spectacles he was one of those wretched and evil men whose yearnings are downward to the darkness instead of heavenward and who could they but distinguish the lights which god hath kindled for us would count the midnight gloom their chiefest glory as the cynic spoke several of the party were startled by a gleam of red splendor that showed the huge shapes of the surrounding mountains and the rockbed of the turbulent river with an illumination unlike that of their fire on the trunks and black boughs of the forest trees they listened for the roll of thunder but heard nothing and were glad that the tempest came not near them the stars those dialpoints of heaven now warned the adventurers to close their eyes on the blazing logs and open them in dreams to the glow of the great carbuncle  the young married couple had taken their lodgings in the farthest corner of the wigwam and were separated from the rest of the party by a curtain of curiouslywoven twigs such as might have hung in deep festoons around the bridalbower of eve the modest little wife had wrought this piece of tapestry while the other guests were talking she and her husband fell asleep with hands tenderly clasped and awoke from visions of unearthly radiance to meet the more blessed light of one anothers eyes they awoke at the same instant and with one happy smile beaming over their two faces which grew brighter with their consciousness of the reality of life and love but no sooner did she recollect where they were than the bride peeped through the interstices of the leafy curtain and saw that the outer room of the hut was deserted  up dear matthew cried she in haste the strange folk are all gone up this very minute or we shall loose the great carbuncle  in truth so little did these poor young people deserve the mighty prize which had lured them thither that they had slept peacefully all night and till the summits of the hills were glittering with sunshine while the other adventurers had tossed their limbs in feverish wakefulness or dreamed of climbing precipices and set off to realize their dreams with the earliest peep of dawn but matthew and hannah after their calm rest were as light as two young deer and merely stopped to say their prayers and wash themselves in a cold pool of the amonoosuck and then to taste a morsel of food ere they turned their faces to the mountainside it was a sweet emblem of conjugal affection as they toiled up the difficult ascent gathering strength from the mutual aid which they afforded after several little accidents such as a torn robe a lost shoe and the entanglement of hannahs hair in a bough they reached the upper verge of the forest and were now to pursue a more adventurous course the innumerable trunks and heavy foliage of the trees had hitherto shut in their thoughts which now shrank affrighted from the region of wind and cloud and naked rocks and desolate sunshine that rose immeasurably above them they gazed back at the obscure wilderness which they had traversed and longed to be buried again in its depths rather than trust themselves to so vast and visible a solitude  shall we go on said matthew throwing his arm round hannahs waist both to protect her and to comfort his heart by drawing her close to it  but the little bride simple as she was had a womans love of jewels and could not forego the hope of possessing the very brightest in the world in spite of the perils with which it must be won  let us climb a little higher whispered she yet tremulously as she turned her face upward to the lonely sky  come then said matthew mustering his manly courage and drawing her along with him for she became timid again the moment that he grew bold  and upward accordingly went the pilgrims of the great carbuncle now treading upon the tops and thicklyinterwoven branches of dwarf pines which by the growth of centuries though mossy with age had barely reached three feet in altitude next they came to masses and fragments of naked rock heaped confusedly together like a cairn reared by giants in memory of a giant chief in this bleak realm of upper air nothing breathed nothing grew there was no life but what was concentrated in their two hearts they had climbed so high that nature herself seemed no longer to keep them company she lingered beneath them within the verge of the forest trees and sent a farewell glance after her children as they strayed where her own green footprints had never been but soon they were to be hidden from her eye densely and dark the mists began to gather below casting black spots of shadow on the vast landscape and sailing heavily to one centre as if the loftiest mountain peak had summoned a council of its kindred clouds finally the vapors welded themselves as it were into a mass presenting the appearance of a pavement over which the wanderers might have trodden but where they would vainly have sought an avenue to the blessed earth which they had lost and the lovers yearned to behold that green earth again more intensely alas than beneath a clouded sky they had ever desired a glimpse of heaven they even felt it a relief to their desolation when the mists creeping gradually up the mountain concealed its lonely peak and thus annihilated at least for them the whole region of visible space but they drew closely together with a fond and melancholy gaze dreading lest the universal cloud should snatch them from each others sight  still perhaps they would have been resolute to climb as far and as high between earth and heaven as they could find foothold if hannahs strength had not begun to fail and with that her courage also her breath grew short she refused to burden her husband with her weight but often tottered against his side and recovered herself each time by a feebler effort at last she sank down on one of the rocky steps of the acclivity  we are lost dear matthew said she mournfully we shall never find our way to the earth again and oh how happy we might have been in our cottage  dear heart we will yet be happy there answered matthew look in this direction the sunshine penetrates the dismal mist by its aid i can direct our course to the passage of the notch let us go back love and dream no more of the great carbuncle  the sun cannot be yonder said hannah with despondence by this time it must be noon if there could ever be any sunshine here it would come from above our heads  but look repeated matthew in a somewhat altered tone it is brightening every moment if not sunshine what can it be  nor could the young bride any longer deny that a radiance was breaking through the mist and changing its dim hue to a dusky red which continually grew more vivid as if brilliant particles were interfused with the gloom now also the cloud began to roll away from the mountain while as it heavily withdrew one object after another started out of its impenetrable obscurity into sight with precisely the effect of a new creation before the indistinctness of the old chaos had been completely swallowed up as the process went on they saw the gleaming of water close at their feet and found themselves on the very border of a mountain lake deep bright clear and calmly beautiful spreading from brim to brim of a basin that had been scooped out of the solid rock a ray of glory flashed across its surface the pilgrims looked whence it should proceed but closed their eyes with a thrill of awful admiration to exclude the fervid splendor that glowed from the brow of a cliff impending over the enchanted lake for the simple pair had reached that lake of mystery and found the longsought shrine of the great carbuncle  they threw their arms around each other and trembled at their own success for as the legends of this wondrous gem rushed thick upon their memory they felt themselves marked out by fate and the consciousness was fearful often from childhood upward they had seen it shining like a distant star and now that star was throwing its intensest lustre on their hearts they seemed changed to one anothers eyes in the red brilliancy that flamed upon their cheeks while it lent the same fire to the lake the rocks and sky and to the mists which had rolled back before its power but with their next glance they beheld an object that drew their attention even from the mighty stone at the base of the cliff directly beneath the great carbuncle appeared the figure of a man with his arms extended in the act of climbing and his face turned upward as if to drink the full gush of splendor but he stirred not no more than if changed to marble  it is the seeker whispered hannah convulsively grasping her husbands arm matthew he is dead  the joy of success has killed him replied matthew trembling violently or perhaps the very light of the great carbuncle was death  the great carbuncle cried a peevish voice behind them the great humbug if you have found it prithee point it out to me  they turned their heads and there was the cynic with his prodigious spectacles set carefully on his nose staring now at the lake now at the rocks now at the distant masses of vapor now right at the great carbuncle itself yet seemingly as unconscious of its light as if all the scattered clouds were condensed about his person though its radiance actually threw the shadow of the unbeliever at his own feet as he turned his back upon the glorious jewel he would not be convinced that there was the least glimmer there  where is your great humbug he repeated i challenge you to make me see it  there said matthew incensed at such perverse blindness and turning the cynic round towards the illuminated cliff take off those abominable spectacles and you cannot help seeing it  now these colored spectacles probably darkened the cynics sight in at least as great a degree as the smoked glasses through which people gaze at an eclipse with resolute bravado however he snatched them from his nose and fixed a bold stare full upon the ruddy blaze of the great carbuncle but scarcely had he encountered it when with a deep shuddering groan he dropped his head and pressed both hands across his miserable eyes thenceforth there was in very truth no light of the great carbuncle nor any other light on earth nor light of heaven itself for the poor cynic so long accustomed to view all objects through a medium that deprived them of every glimpse of brightness a single flash of so glorious a phenomenon striking upon his naked vision had blinded him forever  matthew said hannah clinging to him let us go hence  matthew saw that she was faint and kneeling down supported her in his arms while he threw some of the thrillingly cold water of the enchanted lake upon her face and bosom it revived her but could not renovate her courage  yes dearest cried matthew pressing her tremulous form to his breastwe will go hence and return to our humble cottage the blessed sunshine and the quiet moonlight shall come through our window we will kindle the cheerful glow of our hearth at eventide and be happy in its light but never again will we desire more light than all the world may share with us  no said his bride for how could we live by day or sleep by night in this awful blaze of the great carbuncle  out of the hollow of their hands they drank each a draught from the lake which presented them its waters uncontaminated by an earthly lip then lending their guidance to the blinded cynic who uttered not a word and even stifled his groans in his own most wretched heart they began to descend the mountain yet as they left the shore till then untrodden of the spirits lake they threw a farewell glance towards the cliff and beheld the vapors gathering in dense volumes through which the gem burned duskily  as touching the other pilgrims of the great carbuncle the legend goes on to tell that the worshipful master ichabod pigsnort soon gave up the quest as a desperate speculation and wisely resolved to betake himself again to his warehouse near the town dock in boston but as he passed through the notch of the mountains a war party of indians captured our unlucky merchant and carried him to montreal there holding him in bondage till by the payment of a heavy ransom he had woefully subtracted from his hoard of pinetree shillings by his long absence moreover his affairs had become so disordered that for the rest of his life instead of wallowing in silver he had seldom a sixpence worth of copper doctor cacaphodel the alchemist returned to his laboratory with a prodigious fragment of granite which he ground to powder dissolved in acids melted in the crucible and burned with the blowpipe and published the result of his experiments in one of the heaviest folios of the day and for all these purposes the gem itself could not have answered better than the granite the poet by a somewhat similar mistake made prize of a great piece of ice which he found in a sunless chasm of the mountains and swore that it corresponded in all points with his idea of the great carbuncle the critics say that if his poetry lacked the splendor of the gem it retained all the coldness of the ice the lord de vere went back to his ancestral hall where he contented himself with a waxlighted chandelier and filled in due course of time another coffin in the ancestral vault as the funeral torches gleamed within that dark receptacle there was no need of the great carbuncle to show the vanity of earthly pomp  the cynic having cast aside his spectacles wandered about the world a miserable object and was punished with an agonizing desire of light for the wilful blindness of his former life the whole night long he would lift his splendorblasted orbs to the moon and stars he turned his face eastward at sunrise as duly as a persian idolater he made a pilgrimage to rome to witness the magnificent illumination of st peters church and finally perished in the great fire of london into the midst of which he had thrust himself with the desperate idea of catching one feeble ray from the blaze that was kindling earth and heaven  matthew and his bride spent many peaceful years and were fond of telling the legend of the great carbuncle the tale however towards the close of their lengthened lives did not meet with the full credence that had been accorded to it by those who remembered the ancient lustre of the gem for it is affirmed that from the hour when two mortals had shown themselves so simply wise as to reject a jewel which would have dimmed all earthly things its splendor waned when other pilgrims reached the cliff they found only an opaque stone with particles of mica glittering on its surface there is also a tradition that as the youthful pair departed the gem was loosened from the forehead of the cliff and fell into the enchanted lake and that at noontide the seekers form may still be seen to bend over its quenchless gleam  some few believe that this inestimable stone is blazing as of old and say that they have caught its radiance like a flash of summer lightning far down the valley of the saco and be it owned that many a mile from the crystal hills i saw a wondrous light around their summits and was lured by the faith of poesy to be the latest pilgrim of the great carbuncle      sketches from memory  the notch of the white mountains  it was now the middle of september we had come since sunrise from bartlett passing up through the valley of the saco which extends between mountainous walls sometimes with a steep ascent but often as level as a church aisle all that day and two preceding ones we had been loitering towards the heart of the white mountainsthose old crystal hills whose mysterious brilliancy had gleamed upon our distant wanderings before we thought of visiting them height after height had risen and towered one above another till the clouds began to hang below the peaks down their slopes were the red pathways of the slides those avalanches of earth stones and trees which descend into the hollows leaving vestiges of their track hardly to be effaced by the vegetation of ages we had mountains behind us and mountains on each side and a group of mightier ones ahead still our road went up along the saco right towards the centre of that group as if to climb above the clouds in its passage to the farther region  in old times the settlers used to be astounded by the inroads of the northern indians coming down upon them from this mountain rampart through some defile known only to themselves it is indeed a wondrous path a demon it might be fancied or one of the titans was travelling up the valley elbowing the heights carelessly aside as he passed till at length a great mountain took its stand directly across his intended road he tarries not for such an obstacle but rending it asunder a thousand feet from peak to base discloses its treasures of hidden minerals its sunless waters all the secrets of the mountains inmost heart with a mighty fracture of rugged precipices on each side this is the notch of the white hills shame on me that i have attempted to describe it by so mean an imagefeeling as i do that it is one of those symbolic scenes which lead the mind to the sentiment though not to the conception of omnipotence  we had now reached a narrow passage which showed almost the appearance of having been cut by human strength and artifice in the solid rock there was a wall of granite on each side high and precipitous especially on our right and so smooth that a few evergreens could hardly find foothold enough to grow there this is the entrance or in the direction we were going the extremity of the romantic defile of the notch before emerging from it the rattling of wheels approached behind us and a stagecoach rumbled out of the mountain with seats on top and trunks behind and a smart driver in a drab greatcoat touching the wheel horses with the whipstock and reining in the leaders to my mind there was a sort of poetry in such an incident hardly inferior to what would have accompanied the painted array of an indian war party gliding forth from the same wild chasm all the passengers except a very fat lady on the back seat had alighted one was a mineralogist a scientific greenspectacled figure in black bearing a heavy hammer with which he did great damage to the precipices and put the fragments in his pocket another was a welldressed young man who carried an opera glass set in gold and seemed to be making a quotation from some of byrons rhapsodies on mountain scenery there was also a trader returning from portland to the upper part of vermont and a fair young girl with a very faint bloom like one of those pale and delicate flowers which sometimes occur among alpine cliffs  they disappeared and we followed them passing through a deep pine forest which for some miles allowed us to see nothing but its own dismal shade towards nightfall we reached a level amphitheatre surrounded by a great rampart of hills which shut out the sunshine long before it left the external world it was here that we obtained our first view except at a distance of the principal group of mountains they are majestic and even awful when contemplated in a proper mood yet by their breadth of base and the long ridges which support them give the idea of immense bulk rather than of towering height mount washington indeed looked near to heaven he was white with snow a mile downward and had caught the only cloud that was sailing through the atmosphere to veil his head let us forget the other names of american statesmen that have been stamped upon these hills but still call the loftiest washington mountains are earths undecaying monuments they must stand while she endures and never should be consecrated to the mere great men of their own age and country but to the mighty ones alone whose glory is universal and whom all time will render illustrious  the air not often sultry in this elevated region nearly two thousand feet above the sea was now sharp and cold like that of a clear november evening in the lowlands by morning probably there would be a frost if not a snowfall on the grass and rye and an icy surface over the standing water i was glad to perceive a prospect of comfortable quarters in a house which we were approaching and of pleasant company in the guests who were assembled at the door  our evening party among the mountains we stood in front of a good substantial farmhouse of old date in that wild country a sign over the door denoted it to be the white mountain post officean establishment which distributes letters and newspapers to perhaps a score of persons comprising the population of two or three townships among the hills the broad and weighty antlers of a deer a stag of ten were fastened at the corner of the house a foxs bushy tail was nailed beneath them and a huge black paw lay on the ground newly severed and still bleeding the trophy of a bear hunt among several persons collected about the doorsteps the most remarkable was a sturdy mountaineer of six feet two and corresponding bulk with a heavy set of features such as might be moulded on his own blacksmiths anvil but yet indicative of mother wit and rough humor as we appeared he uplifted a tin trumpet four or five feet long and blew a tremendous blast either in honor of our arrival or to awaken an echo from the opposite hill  ethan crawfords guests were of such a motley description as to form quite a picturesque group seldom seen together except at some place like this at once the pleasure house of fashionable tourists and the homely inn of country travellers among the company at the door were the mineralogist and the owner of the gold opera glass whom we had encountered in the notch two georgian gentlemen who had chilled their southern blood that morning on the top of mount washington a physician and his wife from conway a trader of burlington and an old squire of the green mountains and two young married couples all the way from massachusetts on the matrimonial jaunt besides these strangers the rugged county of coos in which we were was represented by half a dozen woodcutters who had slain a bear in the forest and smitten off his paw  i had joined the party and had a moments leisure to examine them before the echo of ethans blast returned from the hill not one but many echoes had caught up the harsh and tuneless sound untwisted its complicated threads and found a thousand aerial harmonies in one stern trumpet tone it was a distinct yet distant and dreamlike symphony of melodious instruments as if an airy band had been hidden on the hillside and made faint music at the summons no subsequent trial produced so clear delicate and spiritual a concert as the first a fieldpiece was then discharged from the top of a neighboring hill and gave birth to one long reverberation which ran round the circle of mountains in an unbroken chain of sound and rolled away without a separate echo after these experiments the cold atmosphere drove us all into the house with the keenest appetites for supper  it did ones heart good to see the great fires that were kindled in the parlor and barroom especially the latter where the fireplace was built of rough stone and might have contained the trunk of an old tree for a backlog a man keeps a comfortable hearth when his own forest is at his very door in the parlor when the evening was fairly set in we held our hands before our eyes to shield them from the ruddy glow and began a pleasant variety of conversation the mineralogist and the physician talked about the invigorating qualities of the mountain air and its excellent effect on ethan crawfords father an old man of seventyfive with the unbroken frame of middle life the two brides and the doctors wife held a whispered discussion which by their frequent titterings and a blush or two seemed to have reference to the trials or enjoyments of the matrimonial state the bridegrooms sat together in a corner rigidly silent like quakers whom the spirit moveth not being still in the odd predicament of bashfulness towards their own young wives the green mountain squire chose me for his companion and described the difficulties he had met with half a century ago in travelling from the connecticut river through the notch to conway now a single days journey though it had cost him eighteen the georgians held the album between them and favored us with the few specimens of its contents which they considered ridiculous enough to be worth hearing one extract met with deserved applause it was a sonnet to the snow on mount washington and had been contributed that very afternoon bearing a signature of great distinction in magazines and annals the lines were elegant and full of fancy but too remote from familiar sentiment and cold as their subject resembling those curious specimens of crystallized vapor which i observed next day on the mountain top the poet was understood to be the young gentleman of the gold opera glass who heard our laudatory remarks with the composure of a veteran  such was our party and such their ways of amusement but on a winter evening another set of guests assembled at the hearth where these summer travellers were now sitting i once had it in contemplation to spend a month hereabouts in sleighing time for the sake of studying the yeomen of new england who then elbow each other through the notch by hundreds on their way to portland there could be no better school for such a place than ethan crawfords inn let the student go thither in december sit down with the teamsters at their meals share their evening merriment and repose with them at night when every bed has its three occupants and parlor barroom and kitchen are strewn with slumberers around the fire then let him rise before daylight button his greatcoat muffle up his ears and stride with the departing caravan a mile or two to see how sturdily they make head against the blast a treasure of characteristic traits will repay all inconveniences even should a frozen nose be of the number  the conversation of our party soon became more animated and sincere and we recounted some traditions of the indians who believed that the father and mother of their race were saved from a deluge by ascending the peak of mount washington the children of that pair have been overwhelmed and found no such refuge in the mythology of the savage these mountains were afterwards considered sacred and inaccessible full of unearthly wonders illuminated at lofty heights by the blaze of precious stones and inhabited by deities who sometimes shrouded themselves in the snowstorm and came down on the lower world there are few legends more poetical than that of the great carbuncle of the white mountains the belief was communicated to the english settlers and is hardly yet extinct that a gem of such immense size as to be seen shining miles away hangs from a rock over a clear deep lake high up among the hills they who had once beheld its splendor were inthralled with an unutterable yearning to possess it but a spirit guarded that inestimable jewel and bewildered the adventurer with a dark mist from the enchanted lake thus life was worn away in the vain search for an unearthly treasure till at length the deluded one went up the mountain still sanguine as in youth but returned no more on this theme methinks i could frame a tale with a deep moral  the hearts of the palefaces would not thrill to these superstitions of the red men though we spoke of them in the centre of the haunted region the habits and sentiments of that departed people were too distinct from those of their successors to find much real sympathy it has often been a matter of regret to me that i was shut out from the most peculiar field of american fiction by an inability to see any romance or poetry or grandeur or beauty in the indian character at least till such traits were pointed out by others i do abhor an indian story yet no writer can be more secure of a permanent place in our literature than the biographer of the indian chiefs his subject as referring to tribes which have mostly vanished from the earth gives him a right to be placed on a classic shelf apart from the merits which will sustain him there  i made inquiries whether in his researches about these parts our mineralogist had found the three silver hills which an indian sachem sold to an englishman nearly two hundred years ago and the treasure of which the posterity of the purchaser have been looking for ever since but the man of science had ransacked every hill along the saco and knew nothing of these prodigious piles of wealth by this time as usual with men on the eve of great adventure we had prolonged our session deep into the night considering how early we were to set out on our six miles ride to the foot of mount washington there was now a general breaking up i scrutinized the faces of the two bridegrooms and saw but little probability of their leaving the bosom of earthly bliss in the first week of the honeymoon and at the frosty hour of three to climb above the clouds nor when i felt how sharp the wind was as it rushed through a broken pane and eddied between the chinks of my unplastered chamber did i anticipate much alacrity on my own part though we were to seek for the great carbuncle
