tomorrow  harry i cant hang about here till morning got no money to get a bed not a cent but why wont today do  bessie because youve been too long away  harry with force look here they fairly drove me out poor mother nagged at me for being idle and the old man said he would cut my soul out of my body rather than let me go to sea  bessie murmurs he can bear no contradicting  harry continuing well it looked as tho he would do it too so i went moody it seems to me sometimes i was born to them by a mistake in that other rabbit hutch of a house  bessie a little mocking and where do you think you ought to have been born by rights  harry in the openupon a beachon a windy night  bessie faintly ah  harry they were characters both of them by george shall i try the door  bessie wait i must explain

and move up the stage slowly close together harry bends his head over bessie  bessies voice beginning eagerly people here somehow did not take kindly to him  harrys voice aye aye i understand that  they walk slowly back towards the front  bessie he was almost ready to starve himself for your sake  harry and i had to starve more than once for his whim  bessie im afraid youve a hard heart remains thoughtful  harry what for for running away indignant why he wanted to make a blamed lawyers clerk of me  from here this scene goes on mainly near and about the street lamp  bessie rousing herself what are you a sailor  harry anything you like proudly sailor enough to be worth my salt on board any craft that swims the seas  bessie he will never never believe it he mustnt be contradicted  harry always liked to have his own way and youve been encouraging him  bessie earnestly nonot in everythingnot really  harry vexed laugh what about that pretty tomorrow notion ive a hungry chum in londonwaiting for me  bessie defending herself why should i make the poor old friendless man miserable i thought you were far away i thought you were dead i didnt know but you had never been born i i harry turns to her she desperately it was easier to believe it myself carried away and after all its true its come to pass this is the tomorrow weve been waiting for  harry half perfunctorily aye anybody can see that your heart is as soft as your voice  bessie as if unable to keep back the words i didnt think you would have noticed my voice  harry already inattentive hm dashed scrape this is a queer tomorrow without any sort of today as far as i can see resolutely i must try the door  bessie welltry then  harry from gate looking over shoulder at bessie he aint likely to fly out at me is he i would be afraid of laying my hands on him the chaps are always telling me i dont know my own strength  bessie in front hes the most harmless creature that ever   harry you wouldnt say so if you had

window rumbles down harry in the distance only grazed my hat  bessie thank god intensely whatll he do now  harry comes forward slamming gate behind him just like old times nearly licked the life out of me for wanting to go away and now i come back he shies a confounded old shovel at my head fumes laughs a little i wouldnt care only poor little gingergingers my chum up in londonhe will starve while i walk back all the way from here faces bessie blankly i spent my last twopence on a shave  out of respect for the old man  bessie i think if you let me i could manage to talk him round in a week maybe  a muffled periodical bellowing had been heard faintly for some time  harry on the alert whats this whos making this row hark bessie bessie its in your house i believe  bessie without stirring drearily its for me  harry discreetly whispering good voice for a ships deck in a squall your husband steps out of lamplight  bessie no my father hes blind pause im not married  bellowings grow louder  harry oh i say whats up whos murdering him  bessie calmly i expect hes finished his tea bellowing continues regularly  harry hadnt you better see to it youll have the whole town coming out here presently bessie moves off i say bessie stops couldnt you scare up some bread and butter for me from that tea im hungry had no breakfast  bessie starts off at the word hungry dropping to the ground the white woollen shawl i wont be a minute dont go away  harry alone picks up shawl absently and looking at it spread out in his hands pronounces slowly adamsillyscrape pause throws shawl on arm strolls up and down mutters no money to get back louder silly little gingerll think ive got hold of the pieces and given an old shipmate the go by one good shovemakes motion of bursting in door with his shoulderswould burst that door ini bet looks about i wonder where the nearest bobby is no they would want to bundle me neck and crop into chokey shudders perhaps it makes me dog sick to think of being locked up havent got the nerve not for prison leans against lamppost and not a cent for my fare i wonder if that girl now  bessie coming hastily forward plate with bread and meat in hand i didnt take time to get anything else  harry begins to eat youre not standing treat to a beggar my dad is a rich manyou know  bessie plate in hand you resemble your father  harry i was the very image of him in face from a boyeatsand thats about as far as it goes he was always one of your domestic characters he looked sick when he had to go to sea for a fortnights trip laughs he was all for house and home  bessie and you have you never wished for a home goes off with empty plate and puts it down hastily on carvils benchout of sight  harry left in front home if i found myself shut up in what the old man calls a home i would kick it down about my ears on the third dayor else go to bed and die before the week was out die in a houseough  bessie returning stops and speaks from garden railing and where is it that you would wish to die  harry in the bush in the sea on some blamed mountaintop for choice no such luck tho i suppose  bessie from distance would that be luck harry yes for them that make the whole world their home  bessie comes forward shyly the worlds a cold homethey say  harry a little gloomy so it is when a mans done for  bessie you see taunting and a ships not so very big after all  harry no but the sea is great and then what of the ship you love her and leave her missbessies your nameisnt it i like that name  bessie you like my name i wonder you remembered it thats why i suppose  harry slight swagger in voice whats the odds as long as a fellow has lived and a voyage isnt a marriageas we sailors say  bessie so youre not marriedmovement of harryto any ship  harry soft laugh ship ive loved and left more of them than i can remember ive been nearly everything you can think of but a tinker or a soldier ive been a boundary rider ive sheared sheep and humped my swag and harpooned a whale ive rigged ships and skinned dead bullocks and prospected for goldand turned my back on more money than the old man would have scraped together in his whole life  bessie thoughtfully i could talk him over in a week    harry negligently i dare say you could joking i dont know but what i could make shift to wait if you only promise to talk to me now and then ive grown quite fond of your voice i like a right womans voice  bessie averted head quite fond sharply talk nonsense much youd care businesslike of course i would have to sometimes thoughtful again yes in a weekifif only i knew you would try to get on with him afterwards  harry leaning against lamppost growls through his teeth more humouring ah well no hums significantly       oh oh oh rio         and fare thee well      my bonnie young girl      were bound for rio grande  bessie shivering whats this  harry why the chorus of an upanchor tune kiss and go a deepwater ships goodbye you are cold heres that thing of yours ive picked up and forgot there on my arm turn round a bit so wraps her upcommanding hold the ends together in front  bessie softly a week is not so very long  harry begins violently you think that i  stops with sidelong look at her i cant dodge about in ditches and live on air and water can i i havent any moneyyou know  bessie hes been scraping and saving up for years all he has is for you and perhaps  harry interrupts yes if i come to sit on it like a blamed toad in a hole thank you  bessie angrily what did you come for then  harry promptly for five quidpauseafter a jolly good spree  bessie scathingly you and thatthatchum of yours have been drinking  harry laughs dont fly out miss bessiedear gingers not a bad little chap cant take care of himself tho blind three days serious dont think i am given that way nothing and nobody can get over me unless i like i can be as steady as a rock  bessie murmurs oh i dont think you are bad  harry approvingly youre right there impulsive ask the girls all overchecks himself ginger hes longheaded too in his waymind you he sees the paper this morning and says he to me hallo look at that harryloving parentthats five quid sure so we scraped all our pockets for the fare  bessie unbelieving you came here for that  harry surprised what else would i want here five quid isnt much to ask foronce in sixteen years through his teeth with a sidelong look at b and now i am ready to gofor my fare  bessie clasping her hands whoever heard a man talk like this before i cant believe you mean it  harry what that i would go you just try and see  bessie disregarding him dont you care for anyone didnt you ever want anyone in the world to care for you  harry in the world boastful theres hardly a place you can go in the world where you wouldnt find somebody that did care for harry hagberd pause im not of the sort that go about skulking under false names  bessie somebodythat means a woman  harry well and if it did  bessie unsteadily oh i see how it is you get round them with your soft speeches your promises and then  harry violently never  bessie startled steps back ahyou never    harry calm never yet told a lie to a woman  bessie what lie  harry why the lie that comes glib to a mans tongue none of that for me i leave the sneaking off to them softspoken chaps youre thinking of no if you love me you take me and if you take mewhy then the capstansong of deepwater ships is sure to settle it all some fine day  bessie after a short pause with effort its like your ships then  harry amused exactly up to now or else i wouldnt be here in a silly fix  bessie assumed indifference perhaps its because youve never yet met voice fails  harry negligently maybe and perhaps never shall whats the odds its the looking for a thing no matter i love them allships and women the scrapes they got me into and the scrapes they got me out ofmy word i say miss bessie what are you thinking of  bessie lifts her head that you are supposed never to tell a lie  harry never eh you wouldnt be that hard on a chap  bessie recklessly never to a woman i mean  harry well no serious never anything that matters aside i dont seem to get any nearer to my railway fare leans wearily against the lamppost with a faroff look b looks at him  bessie now what are you thinking of  harry turns his head stares at b well i was thinking what a fine figure of a girl you are  bessie looks away a moment is that true or is it only one of them that dont matter  harry laughing a little no no thats true havent you ever been told that before the men  bessie i hardly speak to a soul from years end to years end fathers blind he dont like strangers and he cant bear to think of me out of his call nobody comes near us much  harry absentminded blindah of course  bessie for years and years     harry commiserating for years and years in one of them hutches you are a good daughter brightening up a fine girl altogether you seem the sort that makes a good chum to a man in a fix and theres not a man in this whole town who found you out i can hardly credit it miss bessie b shakes her head man i said contemptuous a lot of tame rabbits in hutches i call them breaks off i say whens the last train up to london can you tell me  bessie gazes at him steadily what for youve no money  harry thats just it leans back against post again hard luck insinuating but there was never a time in all my travels that a woman of the right sort did not turn up to help me out of a fix i dont know why its perhaps because they know without telling that i love them all playful ive almost fallen in love with you miss bessie  bessie unsteady laugh why how you talk you havent even seen my face properly one step towards h as if compelled  harry bending forward gallantly a little pale it suits some puts out his hand catches hold of bs arm draws her to him lets see yes it suits you its a moment before b puts up her hands palms out and turns away her head  bessie whispering dont struggles a little released stands averted  harry no offence stands back to audience looking at hs cottage  bessie alone in front faces audience whispers my voicemy figuremy heartmy face  a silence b s face gradually lights up directly h speaks expression of hopeful attention  harry from railings the old man seems to have gone to sleep waiting for that tomorrow of his  bessie come away he sleeps very little  harry strolls down he has taken an everlasting jamming hitch round the whole business vexed cast it loose who may contemptuous exclamation tomorrow pooh itll be just another mad today  bessie its the brooding over his hope thats done it people teased him so its his fondness for you thats troubled his mind  harry aye a confounded shovel on the head the old man had always a queer way of showing his fondness for me  bessie a hopeful troubled expecting old manleft aloneall alone  harry lower tone did he ever tell you what mother died of  bessie yes a little bitter from impatience  harry makes a gesture with his arm speaks vaguely but with feeling i believe you have been very good to my old man  bessie tentative wouldnt you try to be a son to him  harry angrily no contradicting is that it you seem to know my dad pretty well and so do i hes dead nuts on having his own wayand ive been used to have my own too long its the deuce of a fix  bessie how could it hurt you not to contradict him for a whileand perhaps in time you would get used   harry interrupts sulkily i aint accustomed to knuckle under theres a pair of us hagberds both i ought to be thinking of my train  bessie earnestly why theres no need let us get away up the road a little  harry through his teeth and no money for the fare looks up skys come overcast black too itll be a wild windy night to walk the high road on but i and wild nights are old friends wherever the free wind blows  bessie entreating no need no need looks apprehensively at hagberds cottage takes a couple of steps up as if to draw harry further off harry follows both stop  harry after waiting what about this tomorrow whim  bessie leave that to me of course all his fancies are not mad they arent pause most people in this town would think what he had set his mind on quite sensible if he ever talks to you of it dont contradict him it wouldit would be dangerous  harry surprised what would he do  bessie he wouldi dont knowsomething rash  harry startled to himself  bessie no itd be against youi fear  harry sullen let him  bessie never dont quarrel but perhaps he wont even try to talk to you of it thinking aloud who knows what i can do with him in a week i can i can i cani must  harry comewhats this sensible notion of his that i mustnt quarrel about  bessie turns to harry calm forcible if i make him once see that youve come back he will be as sane as you or i all his mad notions will be gone but that other is quite sensible and you mustnt quarrel over it  moves up to back of stage harry follows a little behind away from audience  harrys voice calm lets hear what it is  voices cease action visible as before harry steps back and walks hastily down bessie at his elbow follows with her
