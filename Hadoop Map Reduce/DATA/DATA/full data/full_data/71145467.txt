her stays a moment looking down then bends and      kisses her hungrily  seelchen art thou angry       he does not answer but turning out the lamp goes into an inner      room       seelchen sits gazing through the window at the peaks bathed in      full moonlight  then drawing the blankets about her she      snuggles doom on the window seat  seelchen in a sleepy voice they kissed meboth she sleeps                      the scene falls quite dark     scene ii       the scene is slowly illumined as by dawn  seelchen is still      lying on the window seat  she sits up freeing her face and      hands from the blankets changing the swathings of deep sleep      for the filmy coverings of a dream  the wall of the hut has      vanished there is nothing between her and the three mountains      veiled in mist save a through of darkness  there as the peaks      of the mountains brighten they are seen to have great faces  seelchen  oh  they have faces       the face of the wine horn is the profile of a beardless youth      the face of the cow horn is that of a mountain shepherd      solemn and broom with fierce black eyes and a black beard      between them the great horn whose hair is of snow has a high      beardless visage as of carved bronze like a male sphinx      serene without cruelty  far down below the faces of the peaks      above the trough of darkness are peeping out the four little      heads of the flowers of edelweiss and gentian mountain      dandelion and alpenrose on their heads are crowns made of      their several flowers all powdered with dewdrops and when the      flowers lift their childfaces little tinkling bells ring  all around the peaks there is nothing but blue sky  edelweiss  in a tiny voice  would you   would you   would you ah ha  gentian  m dandelion  alpenrose  with their bells ranging enviously  oooooo            from behind the cow horn are heard the voices of cowbells           and mountain air       clinkelclink  clinkelclink      mountain air  mountain air            from behind the wine horn rise the rival voices of view of           italy  flume of steam  and things in books       i am italy  italy       see mesteam in the distance       o remember the things in books            and all call out together very softly with the flowers           ringing their bells  then far away like an echo comes a           sighing       mountain air  mountain air            and suddenly the peak of the cow horn speaks in a voice as           of one unaccustomed  the cow horn  amongst kine and my blackbrown sheep i live i am silence and monotony i am the solemn hills  i am fierceness and the mountain wind clean pasture and wild rest  look in my eyes love me alone  seelchen  breathless  the cow horn  he is speaking for felsman and the mountains  it is the half of my heart            the flowers laugh happily  the cow horn  i stalk the eternal hillsi drink the mountain snows my eyes are the colour of burned wine in them lives melancholy  the lowing of the kine the wind the sound of falling rocks the running of the torrents no other talk know i  thoughts simple and blood hot strength hugethe cloak of gravity  seelchen yes

me  love me  live with me under the stars  seelchen  below her breath  i am afraid            and suddenly the peak of the wine horn speaks in a youths           voice  the wine horn  i am the will o the wisp that dances thro the streets i am the cooing dove of towns from the plane trees and the chestnuts shade from day to day all changes where i burn my incense to my thousand little gods  in white palaces i dwell and passionate dark alleys  the life of men in crowds is mineof lamplight in the streets at dawn  softly  i have a thousand loves and never one too long for i am nimbler than your heifers playing in the sunshine            the flowers ringing in alarm cry       we know them  the wine horn  i hear the rustlings of the birth and death of pleasure and the rattling of swift wheels  i hear the hungry oaths of men and love kisses in the airless night  without me little soul you starve and die  seelchen  he is speaking for the gentle sir and the big world of the town  it pulls my heart  the wine horn  my thoughts surpass in number the flowers in your meadows they fly more swiftly than your eagles on the wind i drink the wine of aspiration and the drug of disillusion  thus am i never dull            the voices of view of italy flume of steam and things in           books are heard calling out together       i am italy italy       see mesteam in the distance       o remember remember  the wine horn  love me little soul  i paint life fifty colours i make a thousand pretty things  i twine about your heart  seelchen  he is honey            the flowers ring their bells jealously and cry       bitter bitter   the cow horn  stay with me seelchen  i wake thee with the crystal air            the voices of cowbells and mountain air tiny out far away       clinkelclink  clinkelclink       mountain air  mountain air            and the flowers laugh happily  the wine horn  come with me seelchen  my fan variety shall wake you            the voices of view

grief  my heart  it is torn  the wine horn  with me little soul you shall race in the streets and peep at all secrets  we will hold hands and fly like the thistledown  m dandelion  my puffballs fly faster  the wine horn  i will show you the sea  gentian  my blue is deeper  the wine horn i will shower on you blushes  alpenrose  i can blush redder  the wine horn  little soul listen  my jewels  silk  velvet  edelweiss  i am softer than velvet  the wine horn proudly  my wonderful rags  the flowers moaning  of those we have none  seelchen  he has all things  the cow horn  mine are the clouds with the dark silvered wings mine are the rocks on fire with the sun and the dewdrops cooler than pearls away from my breath of snow and sweet grass thou wilt droop little soul  the wine horn  the dark clove is my fragrance            the flowers ring eagerly and turning up their faces cry       we too smell sweet            but the voices of view of italy flume of steam and things           in books cry out       i am italy  italy       see mesteam in the distance       o remember  remember  seelchen distracted  oh it is hard  the cow horn  i will never desert thee  the wine horn  a hundred times i will desert you a hundred times come back and kiss you  seelchen  whispering  peace for my heart  the cow horn  with me thou shalt lie on the warm wild thyme            the flowers laugh happily  the wine horn  with me you shall lie on a bed of doves feathers            the flowers moan  the wine horn  i will give you old wine  the cow horn  i will give thee new milk  the wine horn  hear my song            from far away comes the sound as of mandolins  seelchen  clasping her breast  my heartit is leaving me  the cow horn  hear my song            from the distance floats the piping of a shepherds reed  seelchen  curving her hand at her ears the piping  ah  the cow horn  stay with me seelchen  the wine horn  come with me seelchen  the cow horn  i give thee certainty  the wine horn  i give you chance  the cow horn  i give thee peace  the wine horn  i give you change  the cow horn  i give thee stillness  the wine horn  i give you voice  the cow horn  i give thee one love  the wine horn  i give you many  seelchen  as if the words were torn from her heart  both bothi will love       and suddenly the peak of the great horn speaks  the great horn  and both thou shalt love little soul  thou shalt lie on the hills with silence and dance in the cities with knowledge  both shall possess thee  the sun and the moon on the mountains shall burn thee the lamps of the town singe thy wings small moth  each shall seem all the world to thee each shall seem as thy grave  thy heart is a feather blown from one mouth to the other  but be not afraid  for the life of a man is for all loves in turn tis a little raft moored then sailing out into the blue a tune caught in a hush then whispering on a newborn babe half courage and half sleep  there is a hidden rhythm  change quietude  chance  certainty  the one  the many  burn onthou pretty flame trying to eat the world  thou shaft come to me at last my little soul       the voices and the flowerbells peal out       seelchen enraptured stretches her arms to embrace the sight      and sound but all fades slowly into dark sleep     scene iii  the dark scene again becomes glamorous  seelchen is seen with her hand stretched out towards the piazza of a little town with a plane tree on one side a wall on the other and from the open doorway of an inn a pale path of light  over the inn hangs a full golden moon against the wall under the glimmer of a lamp leans a youth with the face of the wine horn in a crimson dock thrumming a mandolin and singing           little star soul           through the frost fields of night           roaming alone disconsolate           from out the cold           i call thee in           striking my dark mandolin           beneath this moon of gold       from the inn comes a burst of laughter and the sound of      dancing  seelchen  whispering  it is the big world       the youth of the wine horn sings on           pretty grey moth           where the strange candles shine           seeking for warmth so desperate           ah fluttering dove           i bid thee win           striking my dark mandolin           the crimson flame of love  seelchen  gazing enraptured at the inn  they are dancing       as she speaks from either side come mothchildren meeting and      fluttering up the path of light to the inn doorway then      wheeling aside they form again and again flutter forward  seelchen  holding out her hands  they are real  their wings are windy       the youth of the wine horn sings on           lips of my song           to the white maidens heart           go ye and whisper  passionate           these words that burn           o listening one           love that flieth past is gone           nor ever may return       seelchen runs towards himbut the light above him fades he has      become shadow  she turns bewildered to the dancing mothchildren      but they vanish before her  at the door of the inn stands      lamond in a dark cloak  seelchen  it is you  lamond  without my little soul i am cold  come  he holds out his arms to her  seelchen  shall i be safe  lamond  what is safety   are you safe in your mountains  seelchen  where am i here  lamond  the town       smiling he points to the doorway and silent as shadows there      come dancing out two by two two girls and two youths  the      first girl is dressed in white satin and jewels and the first      youth in black velvet  the second girl is in rags and a shawl      and the second youth in shirt and corduroys  they dance      gravely each couple as if in a world apart  seelchen whispering  in the mountains all dance together  do they never change partners  lamond how could they little one   those are rich these poor but see       a corybantic couple come dancing forth the girl has bare limbs      a flamecoloured shift and hair bound with red flowers the      youth wears a pantherskin  they pursue not only each other      but the other girls and youths  for a moment all is a furious      medley  then the corybantic couple vanish into the inn and the      first two couples are left slowly solemnly dancing apart from      each other as before  seelchen shuddering  shall i one day dance like that       the youth of the wine horn appears again beneath the lamp  he      strikes a loud chord then as seelchen moves towards that sound      the lamp goes out there is again only blue shadow but the      couples have disappeared into the inn and the doorway has grown      dark  seelchen  ah  what i do not like he will not let me see  lamond  will you not come then little soul  seelchen  always to dance  lamond  not so       the shutters of the houses are suddenly thrown wide in a      lighted room on one aide of the inn are seen two pale men and a      woman amongst many clicking machines  on the other side of the      inn in a forge are visible two women and a man but half      clothed making chains  seelchen  recoiling from both sights in turn  how sad they look all  what are they making       in the dark doorway of the inn a light shines out and in it is      seen a figure visible only from the waist up clad in      goldcloth studded with jewels with a flushed complacent face      holding in one hand a glass of golden wine  seelchen  it is beautiful what is it  lamond  luxury  seelchen  what is it standing on  i cannot see       unseen the wine horns mandolin twangs out  lamond  for that do not look little soul  seelchen  can it not walk   he shakes his head  is that all they make here with their sadness       but again the mandolin twangs out the shutters fall over the      houses the door of the inn grows dark  lamond  what is it then you would have  is it learning  there are books here that piled on each other would reach to the stars but seelchen shakes her head  there is religion so deep that no man knows what it means but seelchen shakes her head  there is religion so shallow you may have it by turning a handle  we have everything  seelchen  is god here  lamond  who knows  is god with your goats  but seelchen shakes her head  what then do you want  seelchen  life       the mandolin twangs out  lamond  pointing to his breast  there is but one road to life  seelchen  ah but i do not love  lamond  when a feather dies is it not loving the windthe unknown when the day brings not new things we are children of sorrow  if darkness and light did not change could we breathe  child  to live is to love to love is to liveseeking for wonder  and as she draws nearer  see  to love is to peer over the edge and spying the little grey flower to climb down  it has wings it has flownagain you must climb it shivers tis but air in your handyou must crawl you must cling you must leap and still it is there and not therefor the grey flower flits like a moth and the wind of its wings is all you shall catch  but your eyes shall be shining your cheeks shall be burning your breast shall be pantingah little heart  the scene falls darker  and when the night comesthere it is still thistledown blown on the dark and your white hands will reach for it and your honey breath waft it and never never shall you grasp that wanton thingbut life shall be lovely  his voice dies to a whisper  he stretches out his arms  seelchen  touching his breast  i will come  lamond  drawing her to the dark doorway  love me  seelchen  i love       the mandolin twangs out the doorway for a moment is all      glamorous and they pass through  illumined by the glimmer of      the lamp the youth of the wine hour is seen again  and slowly      to the chords of his mandolin he begins to sing           the windy hours through darkness fly           canst hear them little heart           new loves are born and old loves die           and kissing lips must part            the dusky bees of passing years           canst see them soul of mine           from flower and flower supping tears           and pale sweet honey wine       his voice grown strange and passionate            o flame that treads the marsh of time           flitting for ever low           where through the black enchanted slime           we desperate following go           untimely fire we bid thee stay           into dark air above           the golden gipsy thins away           so has it been with love       while he is singing the moon grows pale and dies  it falls      dark save for the glimmer of the lamp beneath which he stands      but as his song ends the dawn breaks over the houses the lamp      goes outthe wine horn becomes shadow  then from the doorway      of the inn in the shrill grey light seelchen comes forth  she      is pale as if wan with living her eyes like pitch against the      powdery whiteness of her face  seelchen  my heart is old       but as she speaks from far away is heard a faint chiming of      cowbells and while she stands listening lamond appears in the      doorway of the inn  lamond  little soul  seelchen  you  always you  lamond  i have new wonders  seelchen  mournfully  no  lamond  i swear it  you have not tired of me that am never the same  it cannot be  seelchen  listen       the chime of the cowbells is heard again  lamond  jealously  the music of dull sleep  has life then with me been sorrow  seelchen  i do not regret  lamond  come  seelchen  pointingto her breast  the bird is tired with flying touching her lips  the flowers have no dew  lamond  would you leave me  seelchen  see       there in a streak of the dawn against the plane tree is seen      the shepherd of the cow horn standing wrapped in his mountain      cloak  lamond  what is it  seelchen  he  lamond  there is nothing  he holds her fast  i have shown you the marvels of my townthe gay the bitter wonders  we have known life if with you i may no longer live then let us die  see  here are sweet deaths by slumber and by drowning  the mandolin twangs out and from the dim doorway of the inn come forth the shadowy forms  death by slumber and death by drowning who to a ghostly twanging of mandolins dance slowly towards seelchen stand smiling at her and as slowly dance away  seelchen  following yes  they are good and sweet       while she moves towards the inn  lamonds face becomes      transfigured with joy  but just as she reaches the doorway      there is a distant chiming of bells and blowing of pipes and      the shepherd of the cow horn sings           to the wild grass come and the dull far roar           of the falling rock to the flowery meads           of thy mountain home where the eagles soar           and the grizzled flock in the sunshine feeds           to the alp where i in the pale light crowned           with the moons thin horns to my pasture roam           to the silent sky and the wistful sound           of the rosy dawnsmy daughter come       while he sings the sun has risen and seelchen has turned      with parted lips and hands stretched out and the forms of      death have vanished  seelchen  i come  lamond  clasping her knees  little soul  must i then die like a gnat when the sun goes down   without you i am nothing  seelchen  releasing herself  poor hearti am gone  lamond  it is dark  he covers his face with his cloak       then as seelchen reaches the shepherd of the cow horn there is      blown a long note of a pipe the scene falls back and there      rises a far continual mingled sound of cowbells and flower      bells and pipes      scene iv       the scene slowly brightens with the misty flush of dawn      seelchen stands on a green alp with all around nothing but      blue sky  a slip of a crescent moon is lying on her back  on a      low rock sits a brown faced goatherd blowing on a pipe and the      four flowerchildren are dancing in their shifts of grey white      and blue rosepink and burntgold  their bells are ringing      as they pelt each other with flowers of their own colours and      each in turn wheeling flings one flower at seelchen who puts      them to her lips and eyes  seelchen  the dew she moves towards the rock  goatherd       but the flowers encircle him and when they wheel away he has      vanished  she turns to the flowers but they too vanish  the      veils of mist are rising  seelchen  gone  she rubs her eyes then turning once more to the rock sees felsman standing there with his arms folded  thou  felsman  so thou hast comelike a sick heifer to be healed  was it good in the townthat kept thee so long  seelchen  i do not regret  felsman  why then return  seelchen  i was tired  felsman  never again shalt thou go from me  seelchen  mocking  with what wilt thou keep me  felsman  grasping her thus  seelchen i have known changei am no timid maid  felsman  moodily  aye thou art different  thine eyes are hollow thou art whitefaced  seelchen  still mocking  then what hast thou here that shall keep me  felsman  the sun  seelchen  to burn me  felsman  the air       there is a faint wailing of wind  seelchen  to freeze me  felsman  the silence       the noise of the wind dies away  seelchen  yes it is lonely  felsman  wait  and the flowers shall dance to thee       and to a ringing of their bells  the flowers come dancing      till one by one they cease and sink down nodding falling      asleep  seelchen  see  even they grow sleepy here  felsman  i will call the goats to wake them       the goatherd is seen again sitting upright on his rock and      piping  and there come four little brown wildeyed naked      boys with goats legs and feet who dance gravely in and out of      the sleeping flowers and the flowers wake spring up and fly      till each goat catching his flower has vanished and the      goatherd has ceased to pipe and lies motionless again on his      rock  felsman  love me  seelchen  thou art rude  felsman  love me  seelchen  thou art grim  felsman  aye  i have no silver tongue  listen  this is my voice sweeping his arm round all the still alp  it is quiet  from dawn to the first star all is fast  laying his hand on her heart  and the wings of the birds shall be still  seelchen  touching his eyes  thine eyes are fierce  in them i see the wild beasts crouching  in them i see the distance  are they always fierce  felsman  neverto look on thee my flower  seelchen  touching his hands  thy hands are rough to pluck flowers  she breaks away from him to the rock where the goatherd is lying  see  nothing moves  the very day stands still  boy  but the goatherd neither stirs nor answers  he is lost in the blue passionately  boy  he will not answer me  no one will answer me here  felsman with fierce longing  am i then no one  seelchen  thou       the scene darkens with evening  see  sleep has stolen the day  it is night already       there come the female shadow forms of sleep in grey cobweb      garments waving their arms drowsily wheeling round her  seelchen  are you sleep   dear sleep       smiling she holds out her arms to felsman  he takes her      swaying form  they vanish encircled by the forms of sleep it      is dark save for the light of the thin horned moon suddenly      grown bright  then on his rock to a faint gaping the goatherd      sings           my goat my little speckled one           my yelloweyed sweetsmelling           let moon and wind and golden sun           and stars beyond all telling           make every day a sweeter grass           and multiply thy leaping           and may the mountain foxes pass           and never scent thee sleeping           oh  let my pipe be clear and far           and let me find sweet water           no hawk nor udderseeking jar           come near thee little daughter           may fiery rocks defend at noon           thy tender feet from slipping           oh hear my prayer beneath the moon           great master goatgodskipping       there passes in the thin moonlight the goatgood pan and with a      long wail of the pipe the goatherd boy is silent  then the moon      fades and all is black till in the faint grisly light of the      false dawn creeping up seelchen is seen rising from the side of      the sleeping felsman  the goatherd boy has gone but by the      rock stands the shepherd of the cow horn in his dock  seelchen  years years i have slept  my spirit is hungry  then as she sees the shepherd of the cow horn standing there  i know thee nowlife of the earththe smell of thee the sight of thee the taste of thee and all thy music  i have passed thee and gone by she moves away  felsman  waking where wouldst thou go  seelchen  to the edge of the world  felsman  rising and trying to stay her  thou shalt not leave me       but against her smiling gesture he struggles as though against      solidity  seelchen  friend  the time is on me  felsman  were my kisses then too rude   was i too dull  seelchen  i do not regret       the youth of the wine horn is seen suddenly standing opposite      the motionless shepherd of the cow horn and his mandolin twangs      out  felsman  the cursed music of the town  is it back to him thou wilt go  groping for sight of the hated figure  i cannot see  seelchen fear not  i go ever onward  felsman  do not leave me to the wind in the rocks  without thee love is dead and i must die  seelchen  poor heart  i am gone  felsman  crouching against the rock  it is cold       at the blowing of the shepherds pipe the cow horn stretches      forth his hand to her  the mandolin twangs out and the wine      horn holds out his hand  she stands unmoving  seelchen companions  i must go in a moment it will be dawn       in silence the cow horn and the wine horn cover their faces      the false dawn dies  it falls quite dark     scene v       then a faint glow stealing up lights the snowy head of the      great horn and streams forth on seelchen  to either aide of      that path of light like shadows  the cow horn and the wine      horn stand with cloaked heads  seelchen  great one  i come       the peak of the great horn speaks in a faraway voice growing      with the light clearer and stronger            wandering flame thou restless fever           burning all things regretting none           the winds of fate are stilled for ever           thy little generous life is done           and all its wistful wonderings cease           thou traveller to the tideless sea           where light and dark and change and peace           are onecome little soul to mystery       seelchen falling on her knees bows her head to the ground  the      glow slowly fades till the scene is black     scene vi  then as the blackness lifts in the dim light of the false dawn filtering through the window of the mountain hut  lamond and felsman are seen standing beside seelchen looking down at her asleep on the window seat  felsman  putting out his hand to wake her  in a moment it will be dawn       she stirs and her lips move murmuring  lamond  let her sleep  shes dreaming       felsman raises a lantern till its light falls on her face      then the two men move stealthily towards the door and as she      speaks pass out  seelchen  rising to her knees and stretching out her hands with ecstasy  great one  i come  waking she looks around and struggles to her feet  my little dream       through the open door the first flush of dawn shows in the sky      there is a sound of goatbells passing    the curtain falls
