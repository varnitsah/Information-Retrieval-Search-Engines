74480965	the lively poll by rm ballantyne   the scene opens with one of the many north sea fishing fleets at work on its grounds  one of the boats is commanded by a man who is called the admiral of the fleet  he commands the other boats as to when and where they are to start working with their trawl nets for if such control were not imposed there would be chaos with a hundred or more boats crossing each others paths and consequently entangling their nets  after a nights fishing the fish are gutted filleted and boxed  a steam vessel approaches and takes their catches so that they can be landed at the nearest fishing port such as yarmouth and gorleston and rushed to london and other great cities to be fresh on tables the following day  but there is another type of vessel that trades with the lively poll and other ships of that fishing fleetthe dutch coper bringing goods to trade for fish including tobacco and schnapps for the demon drink is the ruination of many a good man  that is what this book is really all about the ruination of some men and the salvation of others for even out at sea there are missionaries working to try and save souls   the lively poll by rm ballantyne    chapter one  the fleet  manx bradley was an admiraladmiral of the fleetthough it must be admitted that his personal appearance did not suggest a position so exalted  with rough pilot coat and souwester scarred and tarred hands easy rolling gait and boots from heel to hip with inchthick soles like those of a dramatic buccaneer he bore as little resemblance to the popular idea of a lacecoated brassbuttoned cockhatted admiral as a seaurchin bears to a cockleshell  nevertheless manx was a real admiralas real as nelson and much harder worked  his fleet of nearly two hundred fishingsmacks lay bobbing about one fine autumn evening on the north sea  the vessels cruised round each other out and in hither and thither in all positions now on this tack now on that bowsprits pointing north south east and west as if without purpose or engaged in a nautical game of touch nevertheless all eyes were bent earnestly on the admirals vessel for it was literally the flagship being distinguishable only by a small flag attached to its fore stay  the fleet was hovering awaiting orders from the admiral  a fine smart fishing breeze was blowing  the setting sun sparkled on the wavecrests thin fleecy clouds streaked the sky everything gave promise of a satisfactory night and a good haul of fish in the morning  with the quiet air of an amiable despot manx nodded his venerable head up went the signal and in a few minutes the fleet was reduced to order every smack swept round into position and bending over on the same tack they all rushed like a shoal of startled minnows away in the same directionthe direction signalled by the admiral  another signal from our venerable despot sent between one and two hundred trawlnets down to the bottom of the sea nets that were strong enough to haul up tons of fish and rocks and wreckage and rubbish with fiftyfeet beams like young masts with iron enough in bands and chains to sink them and so arranged that the beams were raised a few feet off the ground thus keeping the mouths of the great nets open while cables many fathoms in length held the gears to their respective vessels  so the north sea fishermen began the nights workthe nancy the coquette the rattler the truant the faith the playfellow the cherub and all the rest of them  of course although the breeze was fresh they went along slowly because of the ponderous tails that they had to draw  do you ask reader why all this order why this despotic admiral and all this unity of action why not every man for himself  let me reply by asking you to think for a moment  wind blowing in one direction perhaps you are aware does not necessarily imply vessels sailing in the same direction  with variation of courses possible nearly two hundred tails out astern and no unity of action there would arise the certainty of varied and striking incident  the nancy would go crashing into the bows of the coquette the bowsprit of the rallier would stir up the cabin of the truant the tail of the faith would get entangled with that of the cherub and both might hook on to the tail of the playfellow in short the awful result would be wreck and wretchedness on the north sea howling despair in the markets of columbia and billingsgate and no fish for breakfast in the great metropolis  there is reason for most thingsspecially good reason for the laws that regulate the fisheries of the north sea the fleets of which are over twelve in number and the floating population over twelve thousand men and boys  for several hours this shoal of vessels with full sails and twinkling lights like a moving city on the deep continued to tug and plunge along over the banks of the german ocean to the satisfaction of the fishermen and the surprise no doubt of the fish  about midnight the admiral again signalled by rocket and flares haul up and immediately with capstan bar and steam the obedient crews began to coil in their tails  it is not our intention to trouble the reader with a minute account of this process or the grand result but turning to a particular smack we solicit attention to that  she is much like the others in size and rig her name is the lively poll  stephen lockley is her skipper as fine a young fisherman as one could wish to seetall handsome free hearty and powerful  but indeed all deepsea fishermen possess the last quality  they would be useless if not physically strong  many a samson and hercules is to be found in the north sea fleets  no better nursery or trainingschool in time of war they say  that may be true but it is pleasanter to think of them as a trainingschool for times of peace  the night was very dark  black clouds overspread the sky so that no light save the dim rays of a lantern cheered the men as they went tramp tramp round the capstan slowly coiling in the trawlwarp  sheets of spray sometimes burst over the side and drenched them but they cared nothing for that being pretty well protected by oilskins souwesters and seaboots  straining and striving sometimes gaining an inch or two sometimes a yard or so while the smack plunged and kicked the contest seemed like a doubtful one between vis inertiae and the human will  two hours and a half it lasted until the great trawlbeam came to the surface and was got up on the vessels side after which these indomitable men proceeded to claw up the huge net with their fingers straining and heaving with might and main  yo ho cried the skipper heave her in boys  hoy growled peter jay the mate giving a tug that should have torn the net to piecesbut didnt  looks like as if wed got hold of a lump o wreck gasped bob lumsden the smacks boy who was also the smacks cook  no no lumpy remarked david duffy who was no respecter of names or persons it aint a wreck its a mermaid  ive bin told they weigh over six ton when young  look out when she comes aboardshell bite  i do believe its old neptune himself said jim freeman another of the hands  theres his head an something like his pitchfork  it does feel heavier than i ever knowed it afore remarked fred martin  thats all along of your bein ill fred said the mate  it may be so returned martin for i do feel queer an amost as weak as a baby  come heave away  it was indeed a huge mass of wreck entangled with seaweed which had rendered the net so heavy on that occasion but there was also a satisfactory mass of fish in the codend or bag at the extremity of the net for when by the aid of the winch this codend was finally got inboard and the cord fastening the bottom of it was untied fish of all kinds gushed over the wet decks in a living cataract  there were a few expressions of satisfaction from the men but not much conversation for heavy work had still to be donedone too in the dark  turbot sole cod skate and all the other treasures of the deep had to be then and there gutted cleaned and packed in square boxes called trunks so as to be ready for the steamcarrier next morning  the net also had to be cleared and let down for another catch before daybreak  now it is just possible that it may never have occurred to the reader to consider how difficult not to say dangerous must be the operation of gutting cleaning and packing fish on a dark night with a smack dancing a north sea hornpipe under ones feet  among the dangers are two which merit notice  the one is the fishermans liability while working among the ruck to run a sharp fishbone into his hand the other to gash himself with his knife while attempting to operate on the tail of a skate  either accident may be slight or it may be severe  a sudden exclamation from one of the men while employed in this cleaning and packing work told that something had happened  there goes martin growled joe stubley you can always tell when its him cause he dont curse an swear  stubleyor stubby as his mates called himdid not intend this for a compliment by any means though it may sound like one  being an irreligious as well as a stupid man he held that all who professed religion were hypocritical and silly  manliness in poor jos mind consisted of swagger quiet insolence cool cursing and general godlessness  with the exception of fred martin the rest of the crew of the lively poll resembled him in his irreligion but they were very different in characterlockley the skipper being genial peter jay the mate very appreciative of humour though quiet and sedate duffy jovial and funny freeman kindly though reckless and bob the boycook easygoing both as to mind and morals  they all liked martin however in spite of his religion for he practised much and preached little  whats wrong asked lockley who stood at the tiller looking out for lights ahead  only a bone into my left hand replied martin going on with his somewhat dirty labours  well that its no worse boy observed freeman for weve got no medicinechest to fly to like that lucky shortblue fleet  thats true jim responded martin i wish we had a gospel smack with our fleet for our souls need repairing as well as our bodies  there you go growled stubley flinging down a just finished fish with a flap of indignation  a feller cant mention the name o them mission craft without rousin you up to some o your hypocritical chaff  for my part if it wasnt for the medicinechest and the mittens i think wed be better by a long way without gospel ships as ye call em  why what good ave they done the shortblues  im sure we doesnt want churches or prayin or psalmsingin or book  speak for yourself jo interrupted puffy  although your head may be as thick as a threeinch plank through which nothin amost can pass either from books or anything else you mustnt think weve bin all built on the same lines  i likes a good book myself an though i dont care about prayin or psalmsingin seein i dont understand em i say good luck to the mission smacks if it was for nothin else than the books an doctor stuff an mitts what the shoregoin ladiesbless their heartsis so fond o sendin to us  ay an the cheap baccy too that they say theyre agoin to send to us added freeman  praps theyll send us cheap grog at last said puffy with a laugh  theyll hardly do that remarked martin for its to try an keep us from goin for our baccy to the copers that theyve started this new plan  i wish em success said lockley in a serious tone  and there was good ground for that wish for our genial and handsome skipper was peculiarly weak on the point of strong drink that being to him a powerful almost irresistible temptation  when the fishcleaning and packing were completed the men went below to snatch a few hours repose  wet weary and sleepy but with a large stock of reserve strength in them they retired to the little cabin in which they could scarcely stand up without bumping their heads and could hardly turn round without hitting their elbows on something or other  kicking off their long boots and throwing aside oilskin coats and souwesters they tumbled into their narrow bunks and fell asleep almost without winking  there was one among them however who did not sleep long that night fred martin was soon awakened by the pain of his wound which had begun to inflame and by a feeling of giddiness and intense uneasiness with which he had been troubled for several days past  turning out at last he sat down in front of the little iron stove that served to cook food as well as to warm the cabin and gazing into the embers began to meditate on his strangely uncomfortable sensations  hallo martin anything wrong asked the mate who descended at that moment to relight his pipe  i believe there is mate  i never felt like this afore  ive fowt against it till i can hardly stand  i feel as if i was goin to knock under altogether  this hand too seems gittin bad  i do think my blood must be poisoned or somethin o that sort  you know i dont easily give in but when a feller feels as if little redhot wires was twistin about inside of him an sees things goin round as if he was drunk why  why its time to think of goin home interrupted jay with a laugh but lets have a look at you fred  well there does seem to be some o your riggin slack  have you ever had the measles  not as i knows of  looks like it said the mate lighting his pipe  praps itll be as well to send you into dock to refit  youd better turn in again anyhow for a snooze would do you good  fred martin acted on this advice while jay returned to the deck but it was evident that the snooze was not to be had for he continued to turn and toss uneasily and to wonder what was wrong with him as strong healthy men are rather apt to do when suddenly seized with sickness  at grey dawn the admiral signalled again  the order was to haul up the nets which had been scraping the bottom of the sea since midnight and the whole fleet set to work without delay  martin turned out with the rest and tried to defy sickness for a time but it would not do  the strong man was obliged to succumb to a stronger than henot however until he had assisted as best as he could in hauling up the trawl  this second haul of the gear of the lively poll illustrated one of those mishaps to which all deepsea trawlers are liable and which are of frequent occurrence  a piece of wreck or a lost anchor or something had caught the net and torn it badly so that when it reached the surface all the fish had escaped  a nights work for nothing exclaimed stephen lockley with an oath  might have been worse suggested martin  by that time it was broad daylight and as they had no fish to pack the crew busied themselves in removing the torn net from the beam and fitting on a new one  at the same time the crews of the other smacks secured their various and varied hauls cleaned packed and got ready for delivery  the smoke of the steamcarrier was seen on the horizon early in the forenoon and all the vessels of the fleet made for her as chickens make for their mother in times of danger  we may not pause here to describe the picturesque confusion that ensuedthe arriving congregating tacking crossing and recrossing of smacks the launching of little boats and loading them with trunks the concentration of these round the steamer like minnows round a whale the shipping of the cargo and the tremendous hurry and energy displayed in the desire to do it quickly and get the fish fresh to market  suffice it to say that in less than four hours the steamer was loaded and fred martin feverstricken and with a highly inflamed hand and arm started on a thirtysix hours voyage to london  then the fleet sheered off and fell into order the admiral issued his instructions and away they all went again to continue the hard unvarying round of hauling and toiling and moiling in heat and cold wet and dry with nothing to lighten the life or cheer the heart save a game at crib or all fives or a visit to the coper that terrible curse of the north sea    chapter two  accidents afloat and incidents ashore  now although it is an undoubted fact that the skippers of the north sea trawling smacks are firstrate seamen it is an equally certain fact that strong drink can render them unfit for duty  one of the skippers was if we may say so unmanned by drink at the time the fleet sheered off from the steamcarrier as stated in the last chapter  he was named georgie foxbetter known in the fleet as groggy fox  unfortunately for himself as well as others skipper fox had paid a visit to one of the copers the day before for the purpose of laying in a stock of tobacco which was sold by the skipper of the floating grogshop at 1 shilling 6 pence a pound  of course fox had been treated to a glass of fiery spirits and had thereafter been induced to purchase a quantity of the same  he had continued to tipple until night when he retired in a fuddled state to rest  on rising he tippled again and went on tippling till his fish were put on board the steamer  then he took the helm of his vessel and stood with legs very wide apart an owlish gaze in his eyes and a look of amazing solemnity on his visage  when a fleet sheers off from a steamcarrier after delivery of cargo the sea around is usually very much crowded with vessels and as these cross and recross or run past or alongside of each other before finally settling into the appointed course there is a good deal of hearty recognitionshouting questioning tossing up of arms and expressions of goodwillamong friends  several men hailed and saluted fox as his smack the cormorant went by but he took no notice except with an idiotic wink of both eyes  hes bin to the coper remarked puffy as the cormorant crossed the bow of the lively poll  i say lumpy come here he added as bob lumsden came on deck  have ee got any o that coffee left  no not a drop  i gave the last ot to fred martin just as he was goin away  poor fred said puffy  hes in for suthin stiff i doubt measles or mulligrumps if not wuss  a great pity remarked peter jay who stood at the helm that martin couldnt hold out a week longer when our turn comes round to run for yarmouth  its well we got him shipped off today said lockley  that hand of his would have made him useless before another day was out  its a long time for a man in his state to be without help that run up to lunon port your helm a bit jay  is it the cormorant thats yawin about there in that fashion  ay its the cormorant replied jay  i seed her just now amost run foul o the butterfly  shell be foul of us  hi  look out cried lockley becoming excited as he saw the cormorant change her course suddenly without apparent reason and bear straight down upon his vessel  there was indeed no reason for the strange movements of the smack in question except that there was at the helm a man who had rendered his reason incapable of action  with dull fishy eyes that stared idiotically at nothing his hand on the tiller and his mind asleep georgie fox stood on the deck of the cormorant steering  starboard a bit jay said lockley with an anxious look shell barely clear us  as he spoke fox moved his helm slightly  it changed the course of his vessel only a little but that little sufficed to send the cutwater of the cormorant straight into the port bows of the lively poll with a tremendous crash for a smart breeze was blowing at the time  the bulwarks were cut down to the deck and as the cormorant recoiled and again surged ahead the bowsprit was carried away and part of the topmast brought down  deep and fierce was the growl that burst from lockleys lips at this disaster but that did not mend matters  the result was that the lively poll had to quit the fleet a week before her time of eight weeks afloat was up and run to yarmouth for repairs  next day however it fell calm and several days elapsed before she finally made her port  meanwhile fred martin reached london with his feverish complaint greatly aggravated and his undressed wound much worse  in london he was detained some hours by his employers and then sent on to yarmouth which he reached late in the afternoon and ultimately in a state of great suffering and exhaustion made his way to gorleston where his mother lived  with his mind in a species of wild whirl and acute pains darting through his wounded hand and arm he wended his way slowly along the road that led to his mothers house  perhaps we should style it her attic for she could claim only part of the house in which she dwelt from a quaint gable window of this abode she had a view of the sea over the houses in front  part of freds route lay along the banks of the yare not far from its mouth  at a spot where there were many old anchors and cables old and new trawlbeams and sundry other seafaring rusty and tarry objects the young fisherman met a pretty young girl who stopped suddenly and with her large blue eyes expressing unspeakable surprise exclaimed fred  the youth sprang forward seized the girl with his uninjured hand and exclaimed isa as he drew her towards him  frednot here  behave said isa holding up a warning finger  fred consented to behavewith a promise however that he would make up for it at a more fitting time and place  but what is the matter asked isa with an anxious look laying her pretty little hands on the youths arm  yes you need not smile reader it is not a perquisite of ladies to have pretty little hands  isas hands were brown no doubt like her cheeks owing to exposure and sunshine and they were somewhat roughened by honest toil but they were small and wellshaped with taper fingers and their touch was very tender as she clasped them on her lovers arm  nothing serious replied the youth lightly only an accident with a fishbone but it has got to be pretty bad for want of attention an besides im out o sorts somehow  no physic you see or doctors in our fleet like the lucky dogs of the shortblue  ive been knocked up more or less for some weeks past so they sent me home to be looked after but i wont need either physic or doctor now  no why not asked the girl with a simple look  cause the sight o your sweet face does away with the need of either  dont talk nonsense fred  if thats nonsense returned the fisherman youll never hear me talk sense again as long as i live  but how about mother isa  is she well  quite well  i have just left her puzzling herself over a letter from abroad thats so illwritten that it would bother a schoolmaster to read it  i tried to read it but couldnt  youre a good scholar fred so you have come just in time to help her  but wont she be surprised to see you  thus conversing and walking rather slowly the pair made their way to the attic of mrs martin where the unexpected sight of her son threw the patient woman into a great flutter of surprise and pleasure  we use the word patient advisedly for mrs martin was one of those wholesomeminded creatures who having to battle vigorously for the bare necessaries of life in the face of many adverse circumstances carry on the war with a degree of hearty sweettempered resolution which might put to shame many who are better off in every way  mrs martin was a widow and a washerwoman and had a neerdowell brother a fisherman who frequently sponged upon her  she also had a mother to support and attend upon as well as a bad leg to endure  true the attendance on her mother was to the good woman a source of great joy  it constituted one of the few sunbeams of her existence but it was not on that account the less costly for the old woman could do nothing whatever to increase the income of the widows householdshe could not indeed move a step without assistance  her sole occupation was to sit in the attic window and gaze over the sands upon the sea smiling hopefully yet with a touch of sadness in the smile mouthing her toothless gums and muttering now and then as if to herself hell come soon now  her usual attitude was that of one who listens expectantly  thirty years before granny martin had stood at the same attic window an elderly woman even then looking out upon the raging sea and muttering anxiously the same words hell come soon now  but her husband never came  he was lost at sea  as years flew by and time as well as grief weakened her mind the old woman seemed to forget the flight of time and spent the greater part of every day in the attic window evidently on the lookout for some one who was to come soon  when at last she was unable to walk alone and had to be half carried to her seat in the attic window by her strong and loving daughter the sadness seemed to pass away and her cheery spirit revived under the impression apparently that the coming could not be delayed much longer  to every one granny was condescendingly kind especially to her grandchild fred of whom she was very fond  only at intervals was the old womans cheerfulness disturbed and that was during the occasional visits of her neerdowell son dick for he was generally drunk or halfseasover when he came  granny never mentioned his name when he was absent and for a long time mrs martin supposed that she tried to forget him but her opinion changed on this point one night when she overheard her mother praying with intense earnestness and in affectionate terms that her dear dick might yet be saved  still however much or frequently grannys thoughts might at any time be distracted from their main channel they invariably returned thereto with the cheerful assurance that he would soon come now  youre ill my boy said mrs martin after the first greetings were over  right you are mother said the wornout man sitting down with a weary sigh  ive done my best to fight it down but it wont do  you must have the doctor fred  ive had the doctor already mother  i parted with isa wentworth at the bottom o the stair an she will do me more good than dozens o doctors or gallons o physic  but fred was wrong  not long afterwards the lively poll arrived in port and stephen lockley hastened to announce his arrival to his wife  now it was the experience of martha lockley that if on his regular return to land for his eight days holiday after his eight weeks spell afloat her handsome and genial husband went straight home she was wont to have a happy meeting but if by any chance stephen first paid a visit to the blue boar publichouse she was pretty sure to have a miserable meeting and a more or less wretched time of it thereafter  a conversation that stephen had recently had with fred martin having made an impression on himdeeper than he chose to admit even to himselfhe had made up his mind to go straight home this time  ill be down by daybreak to see about them repairs he said to peter jay as they left the lively poll together and ill go round by your old friend widow mooneys and tell her to expect you some time tonight  now peter jay was a single man and lodged with widow mooney when on shore  it was not however pure consideration for his mate or the widow that influenced lockley but his love for the widows little invalid child eve for whose benefit that north sea skipper had in the kindness of his heart made a special collection of deepsea shells with some shreds of bright bunting  little eve mooney thin wasted and sad sat propped up with dirty pillows in a dirty bed in a dirtier room close to a broken and paperpatched window that opened upon a coalyard with a prospect rubbishheap beyond  oh im so glad its you cried eve with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes as the fisherman entered  yes eve my pretty  im back sooner than i expectedand look what ive brought you  i havent forgot you  joy beamed in the lustrous eyes and on every feature of the thin face as the sick child surveyed the treasures of the deep that lockley spread on her ragged counterpane  how goodhow kind of you stephen exclaimed eve  kind repeated the skipper nothing of the sort eve  to please you pleases me so its only selfishness  but wheres your mother  drunk said the child simply and without the most remote intention of injuring her parents character  indeed that was past injury  shes in there  the child pointed to a closet in which stephen found on the floor a heap of unwomanly rags  he was unable to arouse the poor creature who slumbered heavily beneath them  eve said she had been there for many hours  she forgot to give me my breakfast before she went in and im too weak to rise and get it for myself whimpered eve and im so hungry and i got such a fright too for a man came in this morning about daylight and broke open the chest where mother keeps her money and took something away  i suppose he thought i was asleep for i was too frightened to move but i could see him all the time  please will you hand me the loaf before you go  its in that cupboard  we need scarcely add that lockley did all that the sick child asked him to doand more  then after watching her till the meal was finished he rose  ill go now my pretty he said and dont you be afeared  ill soon send some one to look after you  goodbye  stephen lockley was unusually thoughtful as he left widow mooneys hut that day and he took particular care to give the blue boar a wide berth on his way home    chapter three  the skipper ashore  right glad was mrs lockley to find that her husband had passed the blue boar without going in on his way home and although she did not say so she could not feel sorry for the accident to the lively poll which had sent him ashore a week before his proper time  martha lockley was a pretty young woman and the proud mother of a magnificent baby which was bordering on that age when a child begins to have some sort of regard for its own father and to claim much of his attention  matty said stephen to his wife as he jolted his daughter into a state of wild delight on his knee tottie is becoming very like you shes got the same pretty little turnedup nose an the same huge grey eyes with the wicked twinkle in em about the corners  dont talk nonsense stephen but tell me about this robbery  i know nothin about it more than ive told ye matty  eve didnt know the man and her description of him is confusedshe was frightened poor thing  but i promised to send some one to look after her at once for her drunken mother isnt fit to take care of herself let alone the sick child  who can i send think ee  mrs lockley pursed her little mouth knitted her brows and gazed thoughtfully at the baby who taking the look as personal made a face at her  finally she suggested isabella wentworth  and where is she to be found asked the skipper  at the martins no doubt replied mrs lockley with a meaning look shes been there pretty much ever since poor fred martin came home looking after old granny for mrs martins time is taken up wi nursing her son  they say hes pretty bad  then ill go an see about it at once said stephen rising and setting tottie down  he found isa quite willing to go to eve though mrs mooney had stormed at her and shut the door in her face on the occasion of her last visit  but you mustnt try to see fred she added  the doctor says he must be kep quiet and see no one  all right returned the skipper ill wait till hes out o quarantine  good day ill go and tell eve that youre coming  on his way to mrs mooneys hut stephen lockley had again to pass the blue boar  this time he did not give it a wide berth  there were two roads to the hut and the shorter was that which passed the publichouse  trusting to the strength of his own resolution he chose that road  when close to the blue monster whose creaking sign drew so many to the verge of destruction and plunged so many over into the gulf he was met by skipper ned bryce a sociable reckless sort of man of whom he was rather fond  bryce was skipper of the fairy an iron smack which was known in the fleet as the ironclad  hullo  stephen  you here  ay a week before my time ned  that lubber groggy fox ran into me cut down my bulwarks and carried away my bowsprit an some o my tophamper  come alonghave a glass an lets hear all about it said bryce seizing his friends arm but lockley held back  no ned he said im on another tack just now  what not hoisted the blue ribbon eh  no returned lockley with a laugh  ive no need to do that  you havent lost faith in your own power o selfdenial surely  no nor that either butbut  come now none o your buts  come along my mate dick martin is in here an hes the best o company  dick martin in there repeated lockley on whom a sudden thought flashed  is he one o your hands  in course he is  left the grimsby fleet apurpose to jine me  rather surly he is at times no doubt but a good fellow at bottom and great company  you should hear him sing  come  oh i know him well enough by hearsay but never met him yet  whether it was the urgency of his friend or a desire to meet with dick martin that shook our skippers wavering resolution we cannot tell but he went into the blue boar and took a glass for goodfellowship  being a man of strong passions and excitable nerves this glass produced in him a desire for a second and that for a third until he forgot his intended visit to eve his promises to his wife and his stern resolves not to submit any longer to the tyranny of drink  still the memory of mrs mooneys conduct and of the advice of his friend fred martin had the effect of restraining him to some extent so that he was only what his comrades would have called a little screwed when they had become rather drunk  there are many stages of drunkenness  one of them is the confidential stage  when dick martin had reached this stage he turned with a superhumanly solemn countenance to bryce and winked  ifif you ththink said bryce thickly ththat winkin suits you youre mistaken  look ere said dick drawing a letter from his pocket with a maudlin leer and holding it up before his comrade who frowned at it and then shook his headas well he might for besides being very illegibly written the letter was presented to him upside down  after holding it before him in silence long enough to impress him with the importance of the document dick martin explained that it was a letter which he had stolen from his sisters house because it contained something to his advantage  see here he said holding the letter close to his own eyes still upside down and evidently reading from memory if mr frederick martin will ccall at this office any day next week between 10 an 12 hhe will ear suthin to his adadvantage  bounce and brag slicitors  there  but you aint fred martin said bryce with a look of supreme contempt for he had arrived at the quarrelsome stage of drunkenness  right you are said martin but im his uncle  same name ccause his mother mmarried her ccousin and there aint much difference tween dick and fredfour letters both of emso if i goes wi the letter an says im fred martin wy theyll hand over the blunt or the jewels or wotiver it is to medee see  no i dont see returned bryce so irritatingly that his comrade left the confidential stage astern and requested to know with an affable air when bryce lost his eyesight  when i first saw you and thought you worth your salt shouted bryce as he brought his fist heavily down on the table  both men were passionate  they sprang up grappled each other by the throat and fell on the floor  in doing so they let the letter fall it fluttered to the ground and lockley quietly picking it up put it in his pocket  youd better look after them said lockley to the landlord as he paid his reckoning and went out  in a few minutes he stood in widow mooneys hut and found isa wentworth already there  im glad you sent me here said the girl for mrs mooney has gone out  she stopped and looked earnestly in lockleys face  youve been to the blue boar she said in a serious tone  yes lass i have admitted the skipper but without a touch of resentment  i did not mean to go but its as well that i did for ive rescued a letter from dick martin which seems to be of some importance an he says he stole it from his sisters house  he handed the letter to the girl who at once recognised it as the epistle over which she and mrs martin had puzzled so much and which had finally been deciphered for them by dick martin  he must have made up his mind to pretend that he is fred said isa and so get anything that was intended for him  youre a sharp girl isa youve hit the nail fair on the head for i heard him in his drunken swagger boast of his intention to do that very thing  now will you take in hand lass to give the letter back to mrs martin and explain how you came by it  of course isa agreed to do so and lockley turning to eve said he would tell her a story before going home  the handsome young skipper was in the habit of entertaining the sick child with marvellous tales of the sea during his frequent visits for he was exceedingly fond of her and never failed to call during his periodical returns to land  his love was well bestowed for poor eve besides being of an affectionate nature was an extremely imaginative child and delighted in everything marvellous or romantic  on this occasion however he was interrupted at the commencement of his tale by the entrance of his own ships cook the boy bob lumsden alias lumpy  hullo lumpy what brings you here asked the skipper  but the boy made no answer  he was evidently taken aback at the unexpected sight of the sick child and the skipper had to repeat his question in a sterner tone  even then lumpy did not look at his commander but addressing the child said  beg parding miss i wouldnt have come in if id knowed you was in bed but  oh never mind interrupted eve with a little smile on seeing that he hesitated my friends never see me except in bed  indeed i live in bed but you must not think im lazy  its only that my backs bad come in and sit down  well boy demanded the skipper again were you sent here to find me  yes sir said lumpy with his eyes still fixed on the earnest little face of eve  mister jay sent me to say he wants to speak to you about the heel o the noo bowsprit  tell him ill be aboard in half an hour  i didnt know before said eve that bowsprits have heels  at this lumpy opened his large mouth nearly shut his small eyes and was on the point of giving vent to a rousing laugh when his commander half rose and seized hold of a wooden stool  the boy shut his mouth instantly and fled into the street where he let go the laugh which had been thus suddenly checked  well she is a rum un he said to himself as he rolled in a nautical fashion down to the wharf where the lively poll was undergoing repairs  i think hes a funny boy that said eve as the skipper stooped to kiss her  yes he is a funny dog  goodbye my pretty one  stay said eve solemnly as she laid her delicate little hand on the huge brown fist of the fisherman youve often told me stories stephen i want to tell one to you tonight  you need not sit down its a very very short one  but the skipper did sit down and listened with a look of interest and expectation as the child began  there was once a great strong brave man who was very kind to everybody most of all to little children  one day he was walking near a river when a great fearful ugly beast came out of the wood and seized the man with its terrible teeth  it was far stronger than the dear good man and it threw him down and held him down tilltill it killed him  she stopped and tears filled her soft eyes at the scene she had conjured up  do you know she asked in a deeper tone what sort of awful beast it was  no what was it  a blue boar said the child pressing the strong hand which she detained  lockleys eyes fell for a moment before eves earnest gaze and a flush deepened the colour of his bronzed countenance  then he sprang suddenly up and kissed eves forehead  thank you my pretty one for your story but it ant just correct for the man is not quite killed yet and please god hell escape  as he spoke the door of the hut received a severe blow as if some heavy body had fallen against it  when isa opened it a dirty bundle of rags and humanity rolled upon the floor  it was eves mother  lifting her up in his strong arms lockley carried her into the closet which opened off the outer room and laid her tenderly on a mattress which lay on the floor  then without a word he left the hut and went home  it is scarcely necessary to add that he took the longer road on that occasion and gave a very wide berth indeed to the blue boar    chapter four  hardships on the sea  fly with us now good reader once more out among the breezeruffled billows of the north sea  it was blowing a fine fresh frosty fishing breeze from the norwest on a certain afternoon in december  the admiralmanx bradleywas guiding his fleet over that part of the german ocean which is described on the deepsea fishermans chart as the swarte or black bank  the trawls were down and the men were taking it easyat least as easy as was compatible with slushcovered decks a bitter blast and a rolling sea  if we had the power of extending and intensifying your vision reader so as to enable you to take the whole fleet in at one stupendous glance and penetrate planks as if they were plate glass we might perhaps convince you that in this multitude of deepsea homes there was carried on that night a wonderful amount of vigorous action good and badlargely if not chiefly badunder very peculiar circumstances and that there was room for improvement everywhere  strong and bulky and wiry men were gambling and drinking and singing and swearing storytelling and fighting and skylarking and sleeping the last may be classed appropriately under the head of action if we take into account the sonorous doings of throats and noses  as if to render the round of human procedure complete there was at least one manperhaps morepraying  yes manx bradley the admiral was praying  and his prayer was remarkably brief as well as earnest  its request was that god would send help to the souls of the men whose home was the north sea  for upwards of thirty years manx and a few likeminded men had persistently put up that petition  during the last few years of that time they had mingled thanksgiving with the prayer for a gracious answer was being given  god had put it into the heart of the present director of the mission to deepsea fishermen to inaugurate a system of evangelisation among the heretofore neglected thousands of men and boys who toil upon the north sea from january to december  mission or gospel smacks were purchased manned by christian skippers and crews and sent out to the various fleets to fish with them during the week and supply them with medicine for body and soul with lending libraries of wholesome christian literature and with other elevating influences not least among which was a floating church or meetinghouse on sundays  but up to the time we write of manx bradley had only been able to rejoice in the blessing as sent to others  it had not yet reached his own fleet the twelve or thirteen hundred men and boys of which were still left in their original condition of semisavagery and exposure to the baleful influences of that pest of the north seathe coper  you see jacob jones said the admiral to the only one of his hands who sympathised with him in regard to religion if it warnt for the baccy them accursed copers wouldnt be able to keep sich a hold of us  why bless you theres many a young feller in this fleet as dont want no grogespecially the vile fiery stuff the copers sell em but when the dutchmen offers the baccy so cheap as 1 shilling 6 pence a pound the boys are only too glad to go aboard and git it  then the dutchmen being uncommon sly dogs gives em a glass o their vile brandy for goodfellowship by way of an that flies to their heads an makes em want moredee see  an so they go on till many of em becomes regular topersthats where it is jacob  why dont the mission smacks sell baccy too asked jacob stamping his feet on the slushy deck to warm them and beating his right hand on the tiller for the same purpose  youre a knowing fellow returned the admiral with a short laugh why thats just what theyve bin considerin about at the head officeleastwise so im told an if they manage to supply the fleets wi baccy at 1 shilling a pound which is 6 pence less than the dutchmen do theyll soon knock the copers off the north sea altogether  but the worst of it is that we wont git no benefit o that move till a mission smack is sent to our own fleet an to the halfdozen other fleets that have got none  at this point the state of the weather claiming his attention the admiral went forward and left jacob jones who was a new hand in the fleet to his meditations  one of the smacks which drew her trawl that night over the swarte bank not far from the admiral was the lively pollrepaired and rendered as fit for service as ever  not far from her sailed the cherub and the cormorant and that inappropriately named fairy the ironclad  in the little box of the lively pollwhich out of courtesy we shall style the cabinjim freeman and david duffy were playing cards and stephen lockley was smoking  joe stubby was drinking smoking and grumbling at the weather hawkson a new hand shipped in place of fred martin was looking on  the rest were on deck  whats the use o grumblin stub said hawkson lifting a live coal with his fingers to light his pipe  dont stub me said stubley in an angry tone  would you rather like me to stab you asked hawkson with a goodhumoured glance as he puffed at his pipe  id rather you clapped a stopper on your jaw  ahsos you might have all the jawin to yourself retorted hawkson  whatever reply joe stubley meant to make was interrupted by jim freeman exclaiming with an oath that he had lost again and would play no more he flung down the cards recklessly and david duffy gathered them up with the twinkling smile of a goodnatured victor  come lets have a yarn cried freeman filling his pipe with the intention of soothing his vanquished spirit  wholl spin it asked duffy sitting down and preparing to add to the fumes of the place  come stub you tape it off itll be better occupation than growlin at the poor weather whats never done you no harm yet though theres no sayin what it may do if you go on as youve bin doin growlin an aggravatin it  i never spin yarns said stubley  but you tell stories sometimes dont you asked hawkson  no never  oh thats a story anyhow cried freeman  come ill spin ye one said the skipper in that hearty tone which had an irresistible tendency to put hearers in good humour and sometimes even raised the growling spirit of joe stubley into something like amiability  what sort o yarn dee want boys he asked stirring the fire in the small stove that warmed the little cabin shall it be comical or sentimental  lets have a true ghost story cried puffy  no no said freeman a hanecdotethats what im fondest of suthin short an sweet as the little boy said to the stick o liquorice  tell us said stubley how it was you come to be saved the night the saucy jane went down  ah lads said lockley with a look and a tone of gravity theres no fun in that story  it was too terrible and only by a miracle or ratheras poor fred martin said at the timeby gods mercy i was saved  was fred there at the time asked duffy  ay an very near lost he was too  i thought he would never get over it  poor chap said freeman he dont seem to be likely to git over this arm  its been a long time bad now  oh hell get over that returned lockley in fact its amost quite well now im told an hes pretty strong againthough the fever did pull him down a bit  its not that its money thats keepin him from goin afloat again  hows that asked puffy  this is how it was  he got a letter which axed him to call on a lawyer in lunon who told him an old friend of his father had made a lot o tin out in austeralia an he died an left some hundreds o poundsi dont know how manyto his mother  humph thats just like him the hypercrit growled joe stubley no sooner comes a breeze o good luck than off he goes too big and mighty for his old business  he was always preachin that money was the root of all evil an now hes found it out for a fact  no fred never said that money was the root of all evil you thickhead returned duffy he said it was the love of money  put that in your pipe and smoke itor rather in your glass an drink it for thats the way to get it clearer in your fuddled brain  hold on boys youre forgettin my yarn interposed lockley at this point for he saw that stubley was beginning to lose temper  well you must know it was about six years agoi was little more than a big lad at the time on board the saucy jane black thomson bein the skipper youve heard o black thomson that used to be so cruel to the boys when he was in liquor which was pretty nigh always for it would be hard to say when he wasnt in liquor  he tried it on wi me when i first went aboard but i was toowell well poor fellow ill say nothin against him for hes gone now  fred martin was there at the time an it was wonderful what a hold fred had over that old sinner  none of us could understand it for fred never tried to curry favour with him an once or twice i heard him when he thought nobody was near givin advice to black thomson about drink in his quiet earnest way that made me expect to see the skipper knock him down  but he didnt  he took it wellonly he didnt take his advice but kep on drinkin harder than ever  whenever a coper came in sight at that time thomson was sure to have the boat over the side an pay him a visit  well about this time o the year there came one night a most tremendous gale wi thick snow from the norard  it was all we could do to make out anything twenty fathom ahead of us  the skipper he was lyin drunk down below  we was close reefed and laying to with the foresail aweather lookin out anxiously for the fleet bein all round and the snow thick our chances o runnin foul o suthin was considerable  when we took in the last reef we could hardly stand to do it the wind was so strongan wasnt it freezin too  sharp enough amost to freeze the nose off your face  about midnight the wind began to shift about and came in squalls so hard that we could scarcely stand so we took in the jib and mizzen and lay to under the foresail  of course the hatchways was battened down and tarpaulined for the seas that came aboard was fearful  when i was standin there expectin every moment that we should founder a sea came and swept fred martin overboard  of course we could do nothing for himwe could only hold on for our lives but the very next sea washed him right on deck again  he never gave a cry but i heard him say praise the lord in his own quiet way when he laid hold o the starboard shrouds beside me  just then another sea came aboard an amost knocked the senses out o me  at the same moment i heard a tremendous crash an saw the mast go by the board  what happened after that i never could rightly understand  i grabbed at somethingit felt like a bit of plankand held on tight you may be sure for the cold had by that time got such a hold o me that i knew if i let go i would go down like a stone  i had scarce got hold of it when i was seized round the neck by something behind me an amost choked  i couldnt look round to see what it was but i could see a great black object coming straight at me  i knew well it was a smack an gave a roar that might have done credit to a young walrus  the smack seemed to sheer off a bit an i heard a voice shout starboard hard  ive got him an i got a blow on my cocoanut that wellnigh cracked it  at the same time a boathook caught my coat collar an held on  in a few seconds more i was hauled on board of the cherub by manx bradley an the feller that was clingin to my neck like a young lobster was fred martin  the saucy jane went to the bottom that night  an black thomsondid he go down with her asked duffy  ay that was the end of him and all the rest of the crew  the fleet lost five smacks that night  admirals asignallin sir said one of the watch on deck putting his head down the hatch at that moment  lockley went on deck at once  another moment and the shout came downhaul  haul all  instantly the sleepers turned out all through the fleet  oiled frocks souwesters and long boots were drawn on and the men hurried on the decks to face the sleetladen blast and man the capstan bars with the prospect before them of many hours of hard toilheaving and hauling and fishcleaning and packing with benumbed fingersbefore the dreary winter night should give place to the grey light of a scarcely less dreary day    chapter five  the tempters victory  i wouldnt mind the frost or snow or anything else growled joe stubley pausing in the midst of his labours among the fish if it warnt for them seablisters  just look at that jim he added turning up the hard sleeve of his oiled coat and exposing a wrist which the feeble rays of the lantern showed to be badly excoriated and inflamed  ay its an ugly bracelet an ive got one myself just begun on my left wrist remarked jim freeman also suspending labour for a moment to glance at his mates wound  if our fleet had a mission ship like some o the other fleets wed not only have worsted mitts for our wrists but worsted helmets for our heads an necksto say nothin of lotions pills an plasters  if theyd only fetch us them things an let alone tracts bibles an religion returned stubley id have no objection to em but whats the use o religion to a drinkin swearin gamblin lot like us  its quite clear that your notions about religion are muddled said david duffy with a short laugh  why whats the use o physic to a sick man stubs  to make him wuss replied stubs promptly  you might as well argify with a lobster as with joe stubs said bob lumsden who although burdened with the cares of the cooking department worked with the men at cleaning and packing  what does a boy like you know about lobsters cept to cook em growled stubley  you mind your pots an pans  thats all your brains are fit forif you have brains at all  leave argification to men  thats just what i was advisin duffy to do an not waste his breath on the likes o you retorted the boy with a grin  the conversation was stopped at this point by the skipper ordering the men to shake out a reef as the wind was moderating  by the time this was accomplished daybreak was lighting up the eastern horizon and ere long the pale grey of the cold sea began to warm up a little under the influence of the not yet visible sun  goin to be fine said lockley as he scanned the horizon with his glass  looks like it replied the mate  remarks were few and brief at that early hour for the men being pretty well fagged preferred to carry on their monotonous work in silence  as morning advanced the fleet was clearly seen in all directions and at all distances around holding on the same course as the lively poll gradually the breeze moderated and before noon the day had turned out bright and sunny with only a few thin clouds floating in the wintry sky  by that time the fishboxes or trunks were all packed and the men availed themselves of the brief period of idleness pending the arrival of the steamcarrier from billingsgate to eat a hearty breakfast  this meal it may be remarked was a moveable feast depending very much on the duties in hand and the arrival of the steamer  to get the fish ready and shipped for market is always regarded as his first and allimportant duty by the deepsea trawler who until it is performed will not condescend to give attention to such secondary matters as food and repose  these are usually taken when opportunity serves  pipes and recreation in the form of games at cards draughts dominoes and yarns are also snatched at intervals between the periods of severe toil  nevertheless there are times when the fishermans experience is very different  when prolonged calms render fishing impossible then time hangs heavily on his hands andin regard to the fleet of which we write and all those similarly circumstancedthe only recreations available are sleeping drinking gambling and yarnspinning  true such calms do not frequently occur in winter but they sometimes do and one of them prevailed on the afternoon of the particular winters day of which we treat  after the departure of the carrier that day the wind fell so much that the admiral deemed it advisable not to put down the nets  before long the light air died away altogether and the fleet was left floating idly in picturesque groups and with flapping sails on the glassy sea  among the groups thus scattered about there was one smack which had quietly joined the fleet when the men were busy transhipping or ferrying the fish to the steamcarrier  its rig was so similar to that of the other smacks that a stranger might have taken it for one of the fleet but the fishermen knew better  it was that enemy of souls that floating grogshop that pirate of the north sea the coper  good luck to ee muttered joe stubley whose sharp because sympathetic eye was first to observe the vessel  its bad luck to you anyhow remarked bob the cook who chanced to pass at the moment  mind your own business lumpy an none o your sauce if you dont want a ropesendin retorted the man  aint i just mindin my own business  why wot is sauce but part of a cooks business returned the boy  i wont go to her thought stephen lockley who overheard the conversation and in whose breast a struggle had been going on for he also had seen the coper and his casebottle having run dry he was severely tempted to have it replenished  would it not be as well skipper to go aboard o the coper as shes so near at hand said the mate coming aft at the moment  well no peter i think it would be as well to drop the coper altogether  the abominable stuff the dutchmen sell us is enough to poison a shark  you know im not a teetotaller but if im to be killed at all id rather be killed by good spirits than bad  right you are replied jay but you see a lot of us are hard up for baccy and  of course of course the men must have baccy interrupted the skipper an we dont need to buy their vile brandy unless we like yes get the boat out jay an well go  stephen lockley was not the first man who has deceived himself as to his motives  tobacco was his excuse for visiting the floating den of temptation but a craving for strong drink was his real motive  this craving had been created imperceptibly and had been growing by degrees for some years past twining its octopus arms tighter and tighter round his being until the strong and hearty young fisherman was slowly but surely becoming an abject slave though he had fancied himself heretofore as free as the breezes that whistled round his vessel  now for the first time lockley began to have uncomfortable suspicions about himself  being naturally bold and candid he turned sharply round and as it were faced himself with the stern question stephen are you sure that its baccy that tempts you aboard of the coper  are you clear that schnapps has nothing to do with it  it is one of the characteristics of the slavery to which we refer that although strongminded and resolute men put pointed questions of this sort to themselves not unfrequently they very seldom return answers to them  their once vigorous spirits it would seem are still capable of an occasional heave and strugglea sort of flash in the panbut that is all  the influence of the depraved appetite immediately weighs them down and they relapse into willing submission to the bondage  lockley had not returned an answer to his own question when the mate reported that the boat was ready  without a word he jumped into her but kept thinking to himself well only get baccy an ill leave the coper before the lads can do themselves any harm  ill not taste a drop myselfnot a single drop o their vile stuff  the dutch skipper of the coper had a round fat face and person and a jovial hearty manner  he received the visitors with an air of openhanded hospitality which seemed to indicate that nothing was further from his thoughts than gain  weve come for baccy said lockley as he leaped over the bulwarks and shook hands i spose youve plenty of that  ya the dutchman had plenty tabacver sheep too an mit sooch a goot vlavour  he was what the yankees would call a cute fellow that dutchman observing the emphasis with which lockley mentioned tobacco he understood at once that the skipper did not want his men to drink and laid his snares accordingly  com he said in a confidential tone taking hold of lockleys arm com blow an you shall zee de tabac an smell him yourself  our skipper accepted the invitation went below and was soon busy commenting on the weed which as the dutchman truly pointed out was so sheep as well as goot  but another smell in that cabin overpowered that of the tobacco  it was the smell of hollands or some sort of spirit which soon aroused the craving that had gained such power over the fisherman  have some schnapps said the dutch skipper suddenly producing a casebottle as square as himself and pouring out a glass  no thank ee said stephen firmly  no exclaimed the other with wellfeigned surprise  you not drink  oh yes i drink replied lockley with a laugh but not today  i not ask you to buy rejoined the tempter holding the spirits a little nearer to his victims nose  joost take von leetle glass for goot vellowship  it seemed rude to decline a proposal so liberally made and with such a smiling countenance  lockley took the glass drank it off and went hurriedly on deck followed by the dutchman with the casebottle in one hand and the glass in the other  of course the men had no objection to be treated  they had a small glass all round  thats the stuff for my money cried stubley smacking his lips  i say old chap lets have a bottle of it  none o your thimblefuls for me  i like a good swig when im at it  youd better wait till we get aboard joe before you begin suggested lockley who was well aware of joes tendencies  joe admitted the propriety of this advice but said he would treat his mates to one glass before starting by way o wetting their whistles  ya joost von glass vor vet deir vistles echoed the dutchman with a wink and a look which produced a roar of laughter  the glass was accepted by all including lockley who had been quite demoralised by the first glass  the victory was gained by the tempter for that time at least  the fishermen who went for baccy remained for schnapps and some of them were very soon more than half drunk  it was a fierce maddening kind of spirit which produced its powerful effects quickly  the skipper of the lively poll kept himself better in hand than his men but being very sociable in disposition and finding the dutchman a humorous and chatty fellow he saw no reason to hurry them away besides his vessel was close alongside and nothing could be done in the fishing way during the dead calm that prevailed  while he and his men were engaged in a lively conversation about nothing in particularthough they were as earnest over it as if the fate of empires depended on their judgmentthe dutch skipper rose to welcome another boats crew which approached on the other side of the coper so eager and fuddled were the disputants of the lively poll that they did not at first observe the newcomers  it was the fairys boat with dick martin in charge  hallo dick mein boy gif me your vlipper  a sign from martin induced the dutchman to lean over the side and speak in lower tones  lets have a keg of it said dick with a mysterious look  ned bryce sent me for a good supply an heres fish to pay for it  the fishwhich of course belonged to the owner of the fairy not to ned brycewere quickly passed up and a keg of spirits passed down then the dutchman asked if dick or his men wanted tabac or schnapps for themselves  i vill take jersey or vish or sail or boots or vat you please in exchange  com aboard anyhow an have von leetle glass  dick and his men having thus smartly transacted their chief business leaped on deck made fast their painter let the boat drop astern and were soon smoking and drinking amicably with the crew of the lively poll  not long afterwards they were quarrelling  then dick martin who was apt to become pugnacious over his liquor asserted stoutly that something or other was  joe stubley swore that it was not whereupon dick martin planted his fist on joe stubleys nose and laid its growly owner flat on the deck  starting up joe was about to retaliate when lockley seizing him by the neck thrust him over the side into the boat and ordered his more or less drunken crew to follow  they did so with a bad grace but the order was given in a tone which they well understood must not be disobeyed  as they pushed off stubley staggered and fell into the sea  another moment and he would have been beyond all human aid but lockley caught a glimpse of his shaggy black head as it sank  plunging his long right arm down and holding on to the boat with his left he caught the drowning man by the hair  strong and willing arms helped and stubley was hauled inboardrestored to life opportunity and hopeand flung into the bottom of the boat  the oars were shipped and they pulled for the lively poll  as they rode away they saw that other boats were proceeding towards the coper the men in them were all anxious to buy baccy  no mention was made of drink  oh dear no  they cared nothing for that though of course they had no sort of objection to accept the wily dutchmans generous offer of von leetle glass vor goot vellowship    chapter six  the power of sympathy  one fine afternoon not long after the visit to the coper bob lumsden alias lumpy was called from his culinary labours to assist in hauling in the net  now it is extremely interesting to note what a wonderful effect the power of loving sympathy can have on a human being  lumpy was a human beingthough some of his mates insisted that he must have been descended from a codfish because his mouth was so large  no doubt it was and when the boy laughed heartily he was indeed apt to remind one of that fish nevertheless it was a good wellshaped mouth though large with a kindly expression about it and a set of splendid white teeth inside of it  but whether human or fishy in his nature bob lumsden had been overwhelmed by a flood of sympathy ever since that memorable day when he had first caught a glimpse of the sweet pale face of the little invalid eve mooney  it was but a brief glimpse yet it had opened a new sluice in lumpys heart through which the waters of tenderness gushed in a wild torrent  one of the curious results of this flood was that bob was always more prompt to the summons to haul up the trawl than he had ever been before more energetic in clawing the net inboard and more eager to see and examine the contents of the codend  the explanation is simple  he had overheard his skipper say how fond eve was of shellsespecially of those which came from the bottom of the north sea and of all sorts of pretty and curious things wherever they came from  from that hour bob lumpy became a diligent collector of marine curiosities and the very small particular corner of the vessel which he called his own became ere long quite a museum  they say that sympathy is apt to grow stronger between persons of opposite constitutions  if this be so perhaps it was his naturehis bold hearty gushing skylarking spirit his strong rugged frame his robust health his carroty hair his appley cheeks his eagle nose his flashing eyesthat drew him so powerfully to the helpless tender little invalid with her delicate frame and pale cheeks straight little nose bud of a mouth and timid though by no means cowardly spirit  on another occasion bob overheard lockley again talking about eve  im sorry for the poor thing he said to peter jay as they paced the deck together shes got such a wretched home an her mothers such a drunken bru  lockley checked himself and did not finish the sentence  the doctor says he resumed that if eve had only a bathchair or suthin o that sort to get wheeled about in the fresh air shed very likely get better as she growed olderspecially if she had good victuals  you see small as she is and young as she looks shes over fifteen  but even if she had the chair poor thing who would wheel it for her  it would be no use unless it was done regular an her mother cant do itor wont  from that hour bob lumpy became a miser  he had been a smoker like the rest of the crew but he gave up baccy  he used to take an occasional glass of beer or spirits when on shore or on board the copers but he became a total abstainer much to his own benefit in every way and as a result he became richin an extremely small way  there was a very small thin and dirty but lively and intelligent boy in yarmouth who loved bob lumsden better if possible than himself his name was pat stiver  the affection was mutual  bob took this boy into his confidence  one day a considerable time after bobs discovery of eve pat having nothing to do sauntered to the end of gorleston pier and there to his inexpressible joy met his friend  before he had recovered sufficiently from surprise to utter a word bob seized him by the arms lifted him up and shook him  take care lumpy cried the boy im wery tender like an overyoung chicken  youd better set me down before i comes in pieces  why stiver youre the very man i was thinkin of said lumpy setting the boy on the edge of the pier and sitting down beside him  stiver looked proud and felt six inches taller  listen said bob with an earnest look that was apt to captivate his friends i want help  will you do somethin for me  anything replied the boy with emphasis from pitch and toss to manslaughter  well look here  you know eve mooney  do i know the blessedest angel in all gorleston  in course i does wot of her  shes illvery ill said lumpy  you might as well tell me when its daytime that the suns up returned pat  dont be so awful sharp stiver else ill have to snub you  which youve ony got to frown bob lumpy an the deeds done  bob gave a short laugh and then proceeded to explain matters to his friend how he had been saving up his wages for some time past to buy a secondhand bathchair for eve because the doctor had said it would do her so much good especially if backed up with good victuals  its the wittles as bothers me stiver said bob regarding his friend with a puzzled expression  hm well returned the small boy seriously wittles has bothered me too off an on pretty well since i was born though im bound to confess i does get a full blowout now an  hold on stiver youre away on the wrong tack cried bob interrupting  i dont mean the difficulty o findin wittles but how to get eve to take em  tell her to shut her eyes an open her mouth an then shove em in suggested pat  ill shove you into the sea if you go on talking balderdash said bob now look here you haint got nothin to do have you  if you mean in the way o my purfession bob youre right  i purfess to do anything but nobody as yet has axed me to do nothin  in the ways o huntin up wittles howsever ive plenty to do  its hard lines and yet i aint extravagant in my expectations  most coves require three good meals a day wereas im content with one  i begins at breakfast an i goes on aeatin promiskoously all day till arter supperwen i can get it  just so stiver  now i want to engage you professionally  your dooties will be to hang about mrs mooneys but in an offhand careless sort o way like them superintendent chaps as git five or six hundred a year for doin nuffin an be ready at any time to offer to give eve a shove in the chair  but first youll have to take the chair to her an say it was sent to her from  robert lumsden esquire said pat seeing that his friend hesitated  not at all you little idiot said bob sharply  you mustnt mention my name on no account  from a gentleman then suggested pat  that might do but i aint a gentleman stiver an i cant allow you to go an tell lies  id like to know who is if you aint returned the boy indignantly aint a gentleman a man wots gentle  an wen you was the other day aspreadin of them lovely shells an crabs an seagoin kooriosities out on her pockethankercher didnt i see that you was gentle  ill be pretty rough on you pat in a minit if you dont hold your jaw interrupted bob who however did not seem displeased with his friends definition of a gentleman  well you may say what you like only be sure you say whats true  an then youll have to take some nice things as ill get for her from time to time wen i comes ashore but therell be difficulties i doubt in the way of gettin her to take wittles wen she dont know who they comes from  oh dont you bother your head about that said pat  ill manage it im used to difficulties  just you leave it to me an itll be all right  well i will pat so youll come round with me to the old furnitur shop in yarmouth an fetch the chair  i got it awful cheap from the old chap as keeps the shop wen i told him what it was for  then youll bring it out to eve an try to git her to have a ride in it today if you can  ill see about the wittles arter  haint quite worked that out in my mind yet

my wages an give you what i can spare  youll just have to trust me as to that  trust you bob exclaimed pat with enthusiasm look here now this is how the wind blows  if the prime minister o rooshia was to come to me in full regimentals an offer to make me capting o the horse marines to the hemperor id say no thankee im engaged as the young woman said to the young man she didnt want to marry  the matter being thus satisfactorily settled bob lumsden and his little friend went off to yarmouth intent on carrying out the first part of their plan  it chanced about the same time that another couple were having a quiet chat together in the neighbourhood of gorleston pier  fred martin and isa wentworth had met by appointment to talk over a subject of peculiar interest to themselves  let us approach and become eavesdroppers  now fred said isa with a good deal of decision in her tone im not at all satisfied with your explanation  these mysterious and long visits you make to london ought to be accounted for and as i have agreed to become your wife within the next three or four months just to please you the least you can do i think is to have no secrets from me  besides you have no idea what the people here and your former shipmates are saying about you  indeed dear lass what do they say  well they say now youve got well they cant understand why you should go loafing about doin nothin or idling your time in london instead of goin to sea  idlin my time exclaimed fred with affected indignation  how do they know im idlin my time  what if i was studyin to be a doctor or a parson  perhaps theyd say that was idlin your time seein that youre only a fisherman returned isa looking up in her lovers face with a bright smile  but tell me fred why should you have any secret from me  because dear lass the thing that gives me so much pleasure and hope is not absolutely fixed and i dont want you to be made anxious  this much i will tell you however you know i passed my examination for skipper when i was home last time and now through gods goodness i have been offered the command of a smack  if all goes well i hope to sail in her next week then on my return i hope toto take the happiest  well well ill say no more about that as were gettin near mothers door  but tell me isa has uncle martin been worrying mother again when i was away  no  when he found out that you had got the money that was left to her and had bought an annuity for her with it he went away and ive not seen him since  thats well  im glad of that  but am i to hear nothing more about this smack not even her name  nothing more just now isa  as to her name its not yet fixed  but trust me you shall know all in good time  as they had now reached the foot of mrs martins stair the subject was dropped  they found the good woman in the act of supplying granny martin with a cup of tea  there was obvious improvement in the attic  sundry little articles of luxury were there which had not been there before  you see my boy said mrs martin to fred as they sat round the social board now that the lord has sent me enough to get along without slavin as i usedto do i takes more time to make granny comfortable an ive got her a noo chair and noo specs which she was much in want of for the old uns was scratched to that extent you could hardly see through em besides bein cracked across both eyes  aint they much better dear  the old woman seated in the attic window turned her head towards the teatable and nodded benignantly once or twice but the kind look soon faded into the wonted air of patient contentment and the old head turned to the sea as the needle turns to the pole and the soft murmur was heard hell come soon now    chapter seven  a rescue  never was there a fishing smack more inappropriately named than the fairythat unwieldy iron vessel which the fleet in facetious content had dubbed the ironclad and which had the honour of being commanded by that free and easy sociablealmost too sociableskipper ned bryce  she was steered by dick martin on the day of which we now write  dick as he stood at the helm with stern visage bloodshot eyes and dissipated look was not a pleasant object of contemplation but as he played a prominent part in the proceedings of that memorable day we are bound to draw attention to him  although he had spent a considerable portion of the night with his skipper in testing the quality of some schnapps which they had recently procured from a coper he had retained his physical and mental powers sufficiently for the performance of his duties  indeed he was one of those socalled seasoned casks who are seldom or never completely disabled by drink although thoroughly enslaved and he was now quite competent to steer the fairy in safety through the mazes of that complex dance which the deepsea trawlers usually perform on the arrival of the carryingsteamer  what bryce called a chopping and a lumpy sea was running  it was decidedly rough though the breeze was moderate so that the smacks all round were alternately presenting sterns and bowsprits to the sky in a violent manner that might have suggested the idea of a rearing and kicking dance  when the carrier steamed up to the admiral and lay to beside him and the smacks drew towards her from all points of the compass the mazes of the dance became intricate and the risk of collisions called for careful steering  being aware of this and being himself not quite so steady about the head as he could wish skipper bryce looked at martin for a few seconds and then ordered him to go help to launch the boat and get the trunks out and send phil morgan aft  phil was not a better seaman than dick but he was a more temperate man therefore clearer brained and more dependable  soon the smacks were waltzing and kicking round each other on every possible tack crossing and recrossing bows and sterns sometimes close shaving out and in downthemiddleandupagain fashion which to a landsman might have been suggestive of the bus cab and van throng in the neighbourhood of that heart of the world the bank of england  sounds of hailing and chaffing now began to roll over the north sea from many stentorian lungs  what cheer what cheer cried some in passing  hallo tim how are ee old man  what luck  all right jim ony six trunks  ha thats cause ye fished up a dead man yesterday  is that you ted  ay ay whats left o meworse luck  i thought your mother was goin to keep you at home this trip to mind the babby  so she was boy but the babby fell into a can o buttermilk an got drownded so i had to come off again dee see  what cheer groggy fox  have ee hoisted the blue ribbon yet  no stephen lockley i havent nor dont mean to but one o the fleet seems to have hoisted the blue flag  groggy fox pointed to one of the surrounding vessels as he swept past in the cormorant  lockley looked round in haste and to his surprise saw floating among the smaller flags at a short distance the great twentyfeet flag of a mission vessel with the letters mdsf mission to deepsea fishermen on it in white on a blue ground  she must have lost her reckoning muttered lockley as he tried to catch sight of the vessel to which the flag belongedwhich was not easy owing to the crowd of smacks passing to and fro between it and him  just at that moment a hearty cheer was heard to issue from the admirals smack the cherub  at the same time the boat of the lively poll was launched into the sea duffy and freeman and another hand tumbled into her and the skipper had to give his undivided attention to the allimportant matter of transhipping the fish  dozens of boats were by that time bobbing like corks on the heaving sea all making for the attendant steamer  other dozens which had already reached her were clinging onthe men heaving the fishboxes aboard while yet others were pushing off from the smacks last arrived to join the busy swarm  among these was the boat of the fairy with dick martin and two men aboard  it was heavily ladentoo heavily for such a seafor their haul on the previous night had been very successful  north sea fishermen are so used to danger that they are apt to despise it  both bryce and martin knew they had too many trunks in the boat but they thought it a pity to leave five or six behind and be obliged to make two trips for so small a number where one might do  besides they could be careful  and so they werevery careful yet despite all their care they shipped a good deal of water and the skipper stood on the deck of the fairy watching them with some anxiety  well he might for so high were the waves that not only his own boat but all the others kept disappearing and reappearing continually as they rose on the crests or sank into the hollows  but skipper bryce had eyes for only one boat  he saw it rise to view and disappear steadily regularly until it was about halfway to the steamer then suddenly it failed to rise and next moment three heads were seen amid the tumultuous waters where the boat should have been  with a tremendous shout bryce sprang to the tiller and altered the vessels course but as the wind blew he knew well it was not in his power to render timely aid  that peculiar cry which tells so unmistakably of deadly disaster was raised from the boats nearest to that which had sunk and they were rowed towards the drowning men but the boats were heavy and slow of motion  already they were too late for two out of the three men had sunk to rise no moredragged down by their heavy boots and winter clothing  only one continued the struggle it was dick martin  he had grasped an oar and being able to swim kept his head up  the intense cold of the sea however would soon have relaxed even his iron grip and he would certainly have perished had it not been that the recently arrived mission vessel chanced to be a very short distance to windward of him  a slight touch of the helm sent her swiftly to his side  a rope was thrown  martin caught it  ready hands and eager hearts were there to grasp and rescue  in another moment he was saved and the vessel swept on to mingle with the other smacksfor martin was at first almost insensible and could not tell to which vessel of the fleet he belonged  yes the bad man was rescued though no one would have sustained much loss by his death but in yarmouth that night there was one woman who little thought that she was a widow and several little ones who knew not that they were fatherless  the other man who perished was an unmarried youth but he left an invalid mother to lifelong mourning over the insatiable greed of the cold north sea  little note was taken of this event in the fleet  it was in truth a by no means unusual disaster  if fish are to be found fair weather or foul for the tables on land lives must be risked and lost in the waters of the sea  loss of life in ferrying the fish being of almost daily occurrence men unavoidably get used to it as surgeons do to suffering and soldiers to bloodshed  besides on such occasions in the great turmoil of winds and waves and crowds of trawlers and shouting it may be only a small portion of the fleet which is at first aware that disaster has occurred and even these must not cannot turn aside from business at such times to think about the woes of their fellowmen  meanwhile dick martin had fallen as the saying is upon his feet  he was carried into a neatly furnished cabin put between warm blankets in a comfortable berth and had a cup of steaming hot coffee urged upon him by a pleasantvoiced sailor who while he inquired earnestly as to how he felt at the same time thanked the lord fervently that they had been the means of saving his life    chapter eight  tells of more than one surprise  was that your boat that went down shouted groggy fox of the cormorant as he sailed past the fairy after the carryingsteamer had left and the numerous fishingsmacks were gradually falling into order for another attack on the finny hosts of the sea  they were almost too far apart for the reply to be heard and possibly bryces state of mind prevented his raising his voice sufficiently but it was believed that the answer was yes  poor fellows muttered fox who was a man of tender feelings although apt to feel more for himself than for any one else  i think dick martin was in the boat said the mate of the cormorant who stood beside his skipper  i saw them when they shoved off and though it was a longish distance i could make him out by his size an the fur cap he wore  well the world wont lose much if hes gone returned fox he was a bad lot  it did not occur to the skipper at that time that he himself was nearly if not quite as bad a lot  but bad men are proverbially blind to their own faults  he was a crossgrained fellow returned the mate specially when in liquor but i never heard no worse of im than that  didnt you said fox didnt you hear what they said of im at gorlestonthat he tried to do his sister out of a lot o money as was left her by some cove or other in furrin parts  an some folk are quite sure that it was him as stole the little savins o that poor widdy mrs mooney though they cant just prove it agin him  ah he is a bad lot an no mistake  but i may say that o the whole bilin o the martins  look at fred now  well wot of him asked the mate in a somewhat gruff tone  what of him repeated the skipper aint he a hypocrite with his smooth tongue an his sly ways as if butter wouldnt melt in his mouth an nowwhere is he  well where is he demanded the mate with increasing gruffness  why in course nobody knows where he is retorted the skipper thats where it is  no sooner does he get a small windfallleastwise his mother gets itthan he cuts the trawlers an all his old friends without so much as sayin goodbye an goes off to lunnon or somewheres to set up for a gentleman i suppose  i dont believe nothin o the sort returned the mate indignantly fred martin may be smoothtongued and shy if you like but hes no hypercrite  hallo theres that mission ship on the lee bow cried fox interrupting his mate and going over to the lee side of the smack whence he could see the vessel with the great blue flag clearly  port your helm he added in a deep growl to the man who steered  ill give her a wide berth  if she was the coper youd steer the other way remarked the mate with a laugh  in course i would retorted fox for there id find cheap baccy and brandy  ay bad brandy said the mate but skipper you can get baccy cheaper aboard the mission ships now than aboard the coper  what at a shillin a pound  ay at a shillin a pound  i dont believe it  but its a fact returned the mate firmly for simon brooks as was in the shortblue fleet last week told me its a noo regulation theyve started the sale o baccy in the gospel ships just to keep us from going to the copers  thatll not keep me from going to the copers said groggy fox with an oath  nor me said his mate with a laugh but skipper as we are pretty nigh out o baccy just now an as the mission ship is near us an the breeze down i dont see no reason why we shouldnt go aboard an see whether the reports be true  we go to buy baccy you know an were not bound to buy everything the shop has to sell  we dont want their religion an they cant force it down our throats whether we will or no  groggy fox vented a loud laugh at the bare supposition of such treatment of his throat admitted that his mate was right and gave orders to launch the boat  in a few minutes they were rowing over the still heaving but now somewhat calmer sea for the wind had fallen suddenly and the smacks lay knocking about at no great distance from each other  it was evident from the bustle on board many of them and the launching of boats over their bulwarks that not a few of the men intended to take advantage of this unexpected visit of a mission vessel  no doubt their motives were various  probably some went like the men of the cormorant merely for baccy some for medicine others perhaps out of curiosity while a few no doubt went with more or less of desire after the good tidings which they were aware had been carried to several of the other fleets that laboured on the same fishinggrounds  whatever the reasons it was evident that a goodly number of men were making for the vessel with the great blue flag  some had already reached her more were on their way  the cormorants boat was among the last to arrive  what does mdsf stand for asked skipper fox as they drew near  mission to deepsea fishermen answered the mate whose knowledge on this and other points of the mission were due to his intercourse with his friend simon brooks of the shortblue  but it means more than that he continued  when we are close enough to make em out youll see little letters above the mdsf which make the words ive just told you an there are little letters below the mdsf which make the words mighty deliverer saviour friend  ay  thats a clever dodge observed groggy fox who it need hardly be said was more impressed with the ingenuity of the device than with the grand truth conveyed  but i say mate they seems to be uncommonly lively aboard of her  this was obviously the case for by that time the boat of the cormorant had come so near to the vessel that they could not only perceive the actions of those on board but could hear their voices the curiosity of skipper fox and his men was greatly roused for they felt convinced that the mere visit of a passing mission ship did not fully account for the vigorous handshakings of those on the deck and the hearty hailing of newcomers and the enthusiastic cheers of some at least of the little boats crews as they pulled alongside  seems to me as if theyve all gone mad remarked groggy fox with a sarcastic grin  i would say they was all drunk or halfseas over observed the mate if it was a coper but in a gospel ship thats impossible cause theyre teetotal you know  isnt that the boat o the admiral thats pullin alongside just now skipper  looks like it mate  ay an thats stephen lockley of the lively poll close astarn of iman aint they kickin up a rumpus now  fox was right for when the two little boats referred to ranged alongside of the vessel and the men scrambled up the side on to her deck there was an amount of greeting and handshaking and exclaiming in joyful surprise which threw all previous exhibitions in that way quite into the shade and culminated in a mighty cheer the power of which soft people with shoregoing throats and lungs and imaginations cannot hope to emulate or comprehend  the cheer was mildly repeated with mingled laughter when the crowd on deck turned to observe the arrival of the cormorants boat  why its the skipper o the ironclad exclaimed a voice  no its not  its the skipper o the cormorant cried another  what cheer what cheer groggy fox cried a third as the boat swooped alongside and several strong arms were extended  whod have looked for you here  there aint no schnapps  all right mates replied fox with an apologetic smile as he alighted on the deck and looked round ive come for baccy  a short laugh greeted this reply but it was instantly checked for at the moment fred martin stepped forward grasped the skippers horny hand and shook it warmly as well as powerfully for fred was a muscular man and had fully recovered his strength  youve come to the right shop for baccy he said ive got plenty o that besides many other things much better  i bid you heartily welcome on board of the sunbeam in the name of the lord  for a few seconds the skipper of the cormorant could not utter a word he gazed at fred martin with his mouth partially and his eyes wide open  the thought that he was thus cordially received by the very man whose character he had so lately and so ungenerously traduced had something perhaps to do with his silence  aareare you the skipper o this here wessel he stammered  ay through gods goodness i am  a mission wessel said fox his amazement not a whit abated as he looked round  just so a gospel ship answered fred giving the skipper another shake of the hand  you didnt mistake it for a coper did ee asked david duffy who was one of the visitors  the laugh which followed this question drowned groggy foxs reply  and youll be glad to hear said fred still addressing fox that the sunbeam is a new mission ship and has been appointed to do service for god in this fleet and no other so youll always be able to have books and baccy mitts helmets comforters medicines and best of all bibles and advice for body and soul free gratis when you want em  but wheres the doctor to give out the medicines asked fox who began to moderate his gaze as he recovered selfpossession  well mate answered fred with a bashful air i am doctor as well as skipper  indeed im parson tooa sort of jackofalltrades  im not full fledged of course but on the principle i fancy that half a loaf is better than no bread ive been sent here after goin through a short course o trainin in surgeryalso in divinity something like city missionaries and scripturereaders not that trainin much or little would fit any man for the great work unless he had the love of the master in his heart  but i trust i have that  you have fred thank god said the admiral of the fleet  and now skipper fox continued fred facetiously as im a sort of doctor you must allow me to prescribe something for your complaint here boy he added hailing one of his crew fetch skipper fox a draught o that physicthe brown stuff that you keep in the kettle  ay ay sir answered a youthful voice and in another minute pat stiver forced his way through the crowd bearing in his hand a large cup or bowl of coffee  its not exactly the tipple im used to said fox accepting the cup with a grin and wisely resolving to make the best of circumstances all the more readily that he observed other visitors had been or still were enjoying the same beverage  howsever its not to be expected that sick men shall have their physic exactly to their likin so i thank ee all the same dr martin  this reply was received with much approval and the character of groggy fox immediately experienced a considerable rise in the estimation of his comrades of the fleet  attention was drawn from him just then by the approach of another boat  there is some genuine surgeons work coming to you in that boat fred if i mistake not remarked stephen lockley as he stood beside his old friend  hasnt that man in the stern got his head tied up  looks like it  by the way what of your uncle dick martin asked the admiral  it was you that picked him up wasnt it  this reference to the sad event which had occurred that morning solemnised the fishermen assembled on the sunbeams deck and they stood listening with sympathetic expressions as fred narrated what he had seen of the catastrophe and told that his uncle was evidently nothing the worse of it and was lying asleep in the cabin where everything had been done for his recovery and comfort  in the boat which soon came alongside was a fisherman who had met with a bad accident some days before  a block tackle from aloft had fallen on his head and cut it severely  his mates had bound it up in roughandready fashion but the wound had bled freely and the clotted blood still hung about his hair  latterly the wound had festered and gave him agonising pain  his comrades being utterly ignorant as to the proper treatment could do nothing for him  indeed the only effectual thing that could be done was to send the poor man home  this sudden and unexpected appearance of one of the mission ships was therefore hailed as a godsend for it was wellknown that these vessels contained medicines and it was believed that their skippers were more or less instructed in the healing art  in this belief they were right for in addition to the wellappointed medicinechest each vessel has a skipper who undergoes a certain amount of instruction and possesses a practical and plain book of directions specially prepared under the supervision of the board of trade for the use of captains at sea  one can imagine therefore what a relief it was to this poor wounded man to be taken down into the cabin and have his head at last attended to by one who knew what he was about  the operation of dressing was watched with the deepest interest and curiosity by the fishermen assembled there for it was their first experience of the value even in temporal matters of a gospel ship  their ears were open too as well as their eyes and they listened with much interest to fred martin as he tried after a silent prayer for the holy spirits influence to turn his first operation to spiritual account in his masters interest  tell me if i hurt you he said observing that his patient winced a little when he was removing the bandage  go on said the man quietly  i aint a babby to mind a touch of pain  the cabin being too small to hold them all some of the visitors clustered round the open skylight and gazed eagerly down while a few who could not find a point of vantage contented themselves with listening  even dick martin was an observer at that operation for having been roused by the bustle around him he raised himself on an elbow and looking down from his berth could both hear and see  there now said fred martin when at last the bandage was removed and the festering mass laid bare  hand the scissors pat  pat stiver who was assistantsurgeon on that occasion promptly handed his chief the desired instrument and stood by for further orders  ill soon relieve you continued fred removing the clotted hair etcetera in a few seconds and applying a cleansing lotion  i cut it off you see just as the great physician cuts away our sins and washes us clean in the fountain of his own blood  you feel better already dont you  theres no doubt about that replied the patient looking up with a great sigh of relief that told far more than words could convey  we will not record all that was said and done upon that occasion  let it suffice to say that the mans wound was put in a fair way of recovery without the expense and prolonged suffering of a trip home  thereafter as a breeze was beginning to blow which bid fair to become a fishing breeze it became necessary for the visitors to leave in haste but not before a few books tracts and worsted mittens had been distributed with an earnest invitation from the skipper of the sunbeam to every one to repeat the visit whenever calm weather should permit and especially on sundays when regular services would be held on deck or in the hold  on this occasion bob lumpy and pat stiver had met and joined hands in great delight not unmingled with surprise  well whod ever have expected to find you here said bob  ah who indeed echoed pat  the fact is i came to be near you bob  but how did it happen  who got you the sitivation  look alive  dont be longwinded i see theyre gittin our boat ready  this is ow it was bob  i was shovin eve about the roads in the bathchair as you know ive bin doin ever since i entered your service wen a genlemn come up and axed all about us  would ye like a sitivation among the north sea fishermen says he  the very ticket says i  come to lunon tonight then says he unpossible says i fit to bust wi disappointment cos i must first shove miss eve home an git hold of a noo shover to take my place  all right says he laughin come when you can  heres my address  so away i goes got a trustworthy promisin young feller as ive knowd a long time to engage for miss eve an off to lunon an here i am  times up cried the admiral at this point shaking hands with fred martin while bob lumsden sprang from the side of his little friend and there was a general move towards the boats  goodbye mate said skipper fox holding out his hand  stop friends cried fred in a loud voice thats not the way we part on board o the sunbeam  taking off his hat and looking upa sign that all understood for they immediately uncovered and bowed their headsthe missionary skipper in a few brief but earnest words asked for a blessing on the work which he had been privileged that day to begin that satan might be foiled and the name of jesus be made precious among the fishermen of the north sea  thereafter the boats scattered towards their various smacks their crews rejoicing in this latest addition to the fleet  even groggy fox gave it as his opinion that there might be worse things after all in the world than mission wessels    chapter nine  beginning of the good work  the breeze which had begun to blow freshened as the day advanced and the admiral directing his course to the noreast made for the neighbourhood of the dogger bank  having reached what he deemed suitable fishingground he changed his course and gave the signal to put to  with the precision of welltrained troops the smacks obeyed and let down their trawls  the sunbeam also let down her net and shaped her course like the rest thus setting an example of attention to secular duty  she trawled for fish so as to help to pay expenses until such time as suitable weather and opportunity offered for the main and higher duty of fishing for men  the first haul of the mission vessel was a great success prophetic of the great successes in store thought her skipper as the codend was finally swung inboard in an almost bursting condition  when the lower end was opened and the living fountain of fish gushed over the deck there was a general exclamation of satisfaction mingled with thanksgiving from the crew for fishes great and small were there in abundance of every sort that swims in the north sea  all sorts and conditions of men leaped into fred martins mind for he was thinking of higher things at the moment  a good beginning and a good omen he murmured  wot a haul exclaimed pat stiver who was nearly swept off his legs and to whom the whole thing was an entirely new experience  use your eyes less and your hands more my boy said fink the mate setting the example by catching hold of a magnificent turbot that would have graced a lord mayors feast and commencing to clean it  pat was by no means a lazy boy  recovering from his surprise he set to work with all the vigour of a man of purpose and joined the rest of the crew in their somewhat disagreeable duty  they wrought with such goodwill that their contribution of trunks to the general supply was the largest put on board the steamer next day  calm and storm sometimes succeed each other rapidly on the north sea it was so on the present occasion  before the nets could be cleared and let down for another take the breeze had died away  the weather that was unsuited however for fishing was very suitable for ferrying to the steamer and when that allimportant duty was done the comparative calm that prevailed was just the thing for the work of the sunbeam  well aware of this manx bradley and other likeminded skippers kept close to the mission ship whose great blue flag was waving welcome to all  boats were soon pulling towards her their crews being influenced by a great variety of motives and many men who but for her presence would have been gambling or drinking or oppressed with having nothing to do or whistling for a breeze found an agreeable place of meeting on her deck  on this occasion a considerable number of men who had received slight injuries from accidents came on board so that fred had to devote much of his time to the medical part of his work while fink his mate superintended the distribution of what may be styled worstedworks and literature  hallo jim freeman said fred looking round from the medicine shelves before which he stood searching for some drug youre the very man i want to see  want to tempt you away from skipper lockley an ship with me in the sunbeam  im not worth much for anybody just now said freeman holding up his right hand which was bound in a bloody handkerchief  see ive got whatll make me useless for weeks to come i fear  never fear jim said fred examining the injured member which was severely bruised and lacerated  how got ye that  carelessness fred  the old storyclapped my hand on the gunwale o the boat when we were alongside the carrier  id change with ee jim if i could growled joe stubley one of the group of invalids who filled the cabin at the time  there was a general laugh as much at joes lugubrious visage as at his melancholy tone  why whats wrong with you stubs asked fred  dt remarked the skipper of the cormorant who could hardly speak because of a bad cold and who thus curtly referred to the drunkards complaint of delirium tremens  nothin o the sort growled joe  ive not seed a coper for a week or two  brandys more in your way groggy fox than in mine  no its mulligrumps o some sort thats the matter wi me  indeed said fred as he continued to dress the bruised hand  what does it feel like stubs  feel like exclaimed the unhappy man in a tone that told of anguish it feels like redhot thunder rumblin about inside o me  just as if a great conger eel was wallopin about an adinin off my witals  horrible but not incurable remarked fred  ill give you some pills boy thatll soon put you all to rights  now then whos next  while another of the invalids stepped forward and revealed his complaints which were freely commented on by his more or less sympathetic mates fink had opened out a bale of worsted comforters helmets and mitts on deck and assisted by pat stiver was busily engaged in distributing them  here you area splendid pair of mitts jack he said tossing the articles to a huge man who received them with evident satisfaction  too small i fear said jack trying to force his enormous hand into one of them  hold on dont bust it exclaimed pat sharply theres all sorts and sizes here  theres a pair now that would fit goliath  ah thems more like it little un cried the big fisherman  no more seablisters now thanks to the ladies on shore he added as he drew the soft mittens over his sadly scarred wrists  now then who wants this continued fink holding up a worsted helmet splendid for the back o the head and neck with a hole in front to let the eyes and nose out  hand over cried david duffy  i say wots this inside exclaimed one of the men drawing a folded paper from one of his mittens and opening it  read an youll maybe find out suggested the mate  god who giveth us richly all things to enjoy said the fisherman reading from the paper  just so said fink thats what the lady as made the mitts wants to let you know sos you may larn to think more o the giver than the gifts  i wish said another of the men testily as he pulled a tract from inside one of his mitts and flung it on the deck i wish as how these same ladies would let religion alone an send us them things without it  we want the mitts an comforters an helmets but we dont want their humbuggin religion  shame dick said david duffy as he wound a comforter round his thick neck  you shouldnt look a gift horse in the mouth  were bound to take the things as theyve been sent to us an say thank ee  if it wasnt for what you call humbuggin religion remarked fink looking dick straight in the face its little that wed see o comforters or books or mission ships on the north sea  why dee think that selfishness or greed or miserliness or indifference or godlessness would ever take the trouble to send all them things to us cant you understand that the love of god in the heart makes men and women wish to try to keep gods commandments by bein kind to one another an considering the poor an feedin the hungry an clothin the naked  right you are fink said lockley with a nod of approval which was repeated by several of those around  but i say you spoke of books mate remarked bob lumsden who came forward at the moment much to the satisfaction of his little friend pat stiver you hant showed us any books yet  one thing at a time boy returned the mate  weve got lots o books too  go below pat an ask the skipper to send up that big case o books say ive about finished givin out the mitts an mufflers  just so boy put in his friend bob say that the mate has distributed the soft goods an wants some hard facts now  dont be cheeky you young rascal cried the mate hitting bob on the nose with a well aimed pair of mittens  thankee  ony them things was meant for the hands not for the nose howsever i wont quarrel with a gift no matter what way it comes to me retorted bob picking up the mitts and putting them in his pocket  while he was speaking two men brought on deck a large box which was quickly opened by the mate  the men crowded around with much interest and curiosity for it was the first batch of books that had ever reached that fleet  the case was stuffed to the lid with old periodicals and volumes of every shape and size and colour  wy theyve bin an sent us the whole british museum i do believe exclaimed david duffy whose younger brother chanced to be a porter in our great storehouse of literature  here you are lads cried fink going down on his knees and pulling out the

like to make fools on us wot do we want wi books and larnin  nothin wotsumdever answered pat stiver with a look of the most patronising insolence  youre right joe quite rightas you always are  smacksmen has got no souls no brains no minds no hintellects  theyve got no use for books bless you  all they wants is wittles an grog  the boy pulled up at this point for stubley made a rush at him but pat was too quick for him  well said youngster give it him hot cried one of the men approvingly while the others laughed but they were too much interested in the books to be diverted from these for more than a few seconds many of them were down on their knees beside the mate who continued in a semijocular strainnow then take your time my hearties lots o books here and lots more where these came from  the british public will never run dry  im cheap john  here they are all for nothin on loan small wollumthe title aint clear ahthe little man as lost his mother big wollumshakespeare

a look at that cried bob lumsden eagerlyso eagerly that the mate handed the book to him with a laugh  come here pat whispered bob dragging his friend out of the crowd to a retired spot beside the boat of the sunbeam which lay on deck near the mainmast  did you ever read robinson crusoe  no nevernever so much as eard of im  you can read i suppose  oh yes i can read well enough  what have you read demanded bob  ony bits of old noospapers replied pat with a look of contempt an i dont like readin  dont like it  of course you dont you ignorant curmudgeon if noospapers is all youve read  now pat i got this book not for myself but a purpus for you  thankee for nothin said pat i doesnt want it  doesnt want it repeated bob  dee know that this is the very best book as ever was written  you seems pretty cocksure returned pat who was in a contradictory mood that day but you know scholards sometimes differ in their opinions about books  pat ill be hard upon you just now if you dont look out said bob seriously  howsever youre not so far wrong arter all  people does differ about books so ill only say that robinson crusoe is the best book as was ever written in my opinion an so itll be in yours too when you have read it for theres shipwrecks an desert islands an savages an scrimmages an footprints ansee here thats a pictur of him in his hairy dress wi his goat an parrot an the umbrellar as he made hisself alookin at the footprint on the sand  the picture coupled with bob lumsdens graphic description had the desired effect  his little friends interest was aroused and pat finally accepted the book with a promise to read it carefully when he should find time  but of that added pat i aint got too much on hand  youve got all thats of itfour and twenty hours havent you demanded his friend  true bob but its the spare time im short of  howsever ill do my best  while this literary conversation was going on beside the boat the visitors to the sunbeam had been provided with a good supply of food for the mind as well as ease and comfort for the body and you may be very sure that the skipper and his men all of whom were christians did not fail in regard to the main part of their mission namely to drop in seeds of truth as they found occasion which might afterwards bear fruit to the glory of god and the good of man    chapter ten  the first fight and victory  there was on board the sunbeam on this her first voyage a tall broadshouldered but delicatelooking young man with a most woebegone expression and a yellowishgreen countenance  to look at him was to pronounce him a melancholy misanthropea man of no heart or imagination  never before probably did a mans looks so belie his true character this youth was an enthusiast an eager earnest hearty christian full of love to his master and to all mankind and a student for the ministry  but john binning had broken down from overstudy and at the time we introduce him to the reader he was still further down with that most horrible complaint seasickness  even when in the depth of his woe at this time some flashes of binnings true spirit gleamed fitfully through his misery  one of those gleams was on the occasion of dick martin being rescued  up to that period since leaving yarmouth binning had lain flat on his back  on hearing of the accident and the rescue he had turned out manfully and tried to speak to the rescued man but indescribable sensations quickly forced him to retire  again when the first visitors began to sing one of his favourite hymns he leaped up with a thrill of emotion in his heart but somehow the thrill went to his stomach and he collapsed  at last however neptune appeared to take pity on the poor student  his recoveryat least as regarded the seasicknesswas sudden  he awoke on the morning after the opening of the case of books quite restored he could hardly believe it  his head no longer swam other parts of him no longer heaved  the first intimation that skipper martin had of the change was john binning bursting into a hymn with the voice of a stentor  he rose and donned his clothes  youve got your sea legs at last sir said fred martin as binning came on deck and staggered towards him with a joyful salutation  yes and ive got my sea appetite too mr martin  will breakfast be ready soon  just goin on the table sir  i like to hear that question  its always a sure and good sign  at that moment pat stiver appeared walking at an acute angle with the deck and bearing a dish of smoking turbot  he dived as it were into the cabin without breaking the dish and set it on the very small table on which tea bread butter and a lump of beef were soon placed beside it  to this sumptuous repast the skipper the student and the mate sat down  after a very brief prayer for blessing by the skipper they set to work with a zest which perhaps few but seafaring men can fully understand  the student in particular became irrepressible after the first silent and ravenous attack  oh he exclaimed the sea the sea the open sea  if you are ill go to sea  if you are fagged go to sea  if you are used up seedy washedout miserable go to sea  another slice of that turbot please thanks  mind your cup sir said the skipper a few minutes after in a warning voice with a breeze like this its apt to pitch into your lap she lays over a good deal because ive got a press of sail on her this morning  more than usual asked binning  yes  you see im trying to beat a coper thats close ahead of us just now  the sunbeam is pretty swift on her heels an if the breeze holdsha youve got it sir  he certainly had got it in his lapwhere neither cup saucer nor tea should be  you are right skipper and if your ready hands had not prevented it i should have got the teapot and sugarbasin also  but no matter  as ive had enough now ill go on deck and walk myself dry  on deck a new subject of interest occupied the mind of the rapidly reviving student for the race between the sunbeam and the coper was not yet decided  they were trying which would be first to reach a group of smacks that were sailing at a considerable distance ahead on the port bow  at first the coper seemed to have the best of it but afterwards the breeze freshened and the sunbeam soon left it far astern  seeing that the race was lost the floating grogshop changed her course  ah shell steer for other fleets where theres no opposition remarked the skipper  to win our first race is a good omen said john binning with much satisfaction  may the copers be thus beaten from every fleet until they are beaten from the north sea altogether  amen to that said fred martin heartily  you feel well enough now sir to think of undertaking service tomorrow dont you  think of it my friend  i have done more than think exclaimed the student i have been busy while in bed preparing for the sabbath and if the master sends us calm weather i will surely help in the good work you have begun so well  and the master did send calm weatherso calm and so beautiful that the glassy sea and fresh air and bright blue sky seemed typical of the quiet rest that remaineth for the people of god  indeed the young student was led to choose that very text for his sermon ignoring all his previous preparation so impressed was he with the suitability of the theme  and when afterwards the boats of the various smacks came trooping over the sea and formed a long tail astern of the sunbeam and when the capacious hold was cleared and packed as full as possible with rugged weatherbeaten men who looked at the tall pale youth with their earnest inquiring gaze like hungering men who had come there for something and would not be content to depart with nothing the student still felt convinced that his text was suitable although not a single word or idea regarding it had yet struggled in his mind to get free  in fact the young mans mind was like a pentup torrent calm for the moment but with tremendous and everincreasing force behind the floodgates for he had before him men many of whom had scarcely ever heard the gospel in their lives whose minds were probably free from the peculiar prejudices of landsmen whose lives were spent in harsh hard cheerless toil and who stood sorely in need of spiritual rest and deliverance from the death of sin  many of these men had come there only out of curiosity a few because they loved the lord and some because they had nothing better to do  groggy fox was among them  he had come as before for baccy forgetting that the weed was not sold on sundays and had been prevailed on to remain to the service  dick martin was also there in a retired and dark corner  he was curious to know he remarked what the young man had to talk about  it was not till after prayer had been offered by the student that god opened the floodgates  then the stream gushed forth  it is said the preacherin tones not loud but so deep and impressive that every soul was at once enthralledit is to the servants of the devil that the grand message comes  not to the good and pure and holy is the blessed gospel or good news sent but to the guilty the sinstricken the bad and the sinweary god has sent by his blessed spirit the good and glorious news that there is deliverance in jesus christ for the chief of sinners  deliverance from sin changes godless men into the children of god and there is rest for these  do i need to tell toilers of the deep how sweet rest is to the tiredout body  surely not because you have felt it and know all about it better than i do  but it is needful to tell you about rest for the soul because some of you have never felt it and know not what it is is there no man before me who has some time or other committed some grievous sin whose soul groans under the burden of the thought and who would give all he possesses if he had never put out his hand to commit that sin  is there no one here under the power of that deadly monster strong drinkwho remembering the days when he was free from bondage would sing this day with joy unspeakable if he could only escape  yes shouted a strong voice from a dark corner of the hold  thank god murmured another voice from a different quarter for there were men in that vessels hold who were longing for the salvation of other as well as their own souls  no notice was taken of the interrupters  the preacher only paused for an instant as if to emphasise the wordsjesus christ is able to save to the uttermost all who come to god through him  we will not dwell on this subject further than to say that the prayer which followed the sermon was fervent and short for that student evidently did not think that he should be heard for his much speaking the prayer which was thereafter offered by the admiral of the fleet was still shorter very much to the point and replete with nautical phrases but an uncalledfor petition which followed that was briefest of all  it came in low but distinct tones from a dark corner of the hold and had a powerful effect on the audience perhaps also on the hearer of prayer  it was merelygod have mercy on me  whatever influence might have resulted from the preaching and the prayer on that occasion there could be no doubt whatever as to the singing it was tremendous  the wellknown powers of wesleyan throats would have been lost in it  saint pauls cathedral organ could not have drowned it  many of the men had learned at least the tunes of the more popular of sankeys hymns first from the admiral and a few likeminded men then from each other  now every man was furnished with an orangecoloured booklet  some could read some could not  it mattered little  their hearts had been stirred by that young student or rather by the students god  their voices trained to battle with the tempest formed a safetyvalve to their feelings  the lifeboat was appropriately the first hymn chosen  manx bradley led with a voice like a trumpet for joy intensified his powers  fred martin broke forth with tremendous energy  it was catching  even groggy fox was overcome with eyes shut mouth wide open and book upside down he absolutely howled his determination to leave the poor old stranded wreck and pull for the shore  but skipper fox was not the only man whose spirit was touched on that occasion  many of the boats clung to the mission vessel till the day was nearly past for their crews were loath to part  new joys new hopes new sensations had been aroused  before leaving dick martin took john binning aside and in a low but firm voice saidyoure right sir  a grievous sin does lie heavy on me  i robbed mrs mooney a poor widdy of her little bag o savinstwenty pounds it was  the latter part of this confession was accidentally overheard by bob lumsden  he longed to hear more but bob had been taught somehow that eavesdropping is a mean and dishonourable thing  with manly determination therefore he left the spot but immediately sought and found his little friend pat stiver intent on relieving his feelings  what dee think pat he exclaimed in a low whisper but with indignation in his eye and tone  i aint thinkin at all said pat  would you believe it pat continued bob ive just heerd that scounrel dick martin say that it was him as stole the money from mrs mooneyfrom the mother of our eve  you dont say so exclaimed pat making his eyes remarkably wide and round  yes i does an ive long suspected him  whether he was boastin or not i cant tell an it do seem strange that he should boast of it to the young parsonleastwise unless it was done to spite him  but now mark me pat stiver ill bring that old sinner to his marrowbones before long and make him disgorge too if he haint spent it all  i give you leave to make an irish stew o my carcase if i dont  ay ay sir  the concluding words of bob lumsdens speech were in reply to an order from skipper lockley to haul the boat alongside  in a few minutes more the mission ship was forsaken by her strange sabbath congregation and left with all the fleet around her floating quietly on the tranquil sea    chapter eleven  a consultation a feast and a plot  there wasprobably still isa coffeetavern in gorleston where in a cleanly cheerful room a retired fisherman and his wife of temperance principles supplied people with those hot liquids which are said to cheer without inebriating  here by appointment two friends met to discuss matters of grave importance  one was bob lumsden the other his friend and admirer pat stiver  having asked for and obtained two large cups of coffee and two slices of buttered bread for some ridiculously small sum of money they retired to the most distant corner of the room and turning their backs on the counter began their discussion in low tones  being early in the day the room had no occupants but themselves and the fishermans wife who busied herself in cleaning and arranging plates cups and saucers etcetera for expected visitors  pat said bob sipping his coffee with an appreciative air ive turned a total abstainer  wich means inquired pat  that i dont drink nothin at all replied bob  but youre adrinkin now said pat  you know what i mean you small willain i drink nothin with spirits in it  well i dont see what you gains by that bob for i heerd fred martin say you was natrally full o spirit so abstainin ll make no difference  pat said bob sternly if you dont clap a stopper on your tongue ill wollop you  pat became grave at once  well dee know bob he said with an earnest look i do blieve you are right  youve always seemed to me as if you had a sort o dissipated look an would go to the bad right off if you gave way to drink  yes youre right an to prove my regard for you ill become a total abstainer toobut nevertheless i cant leave off drinkin  cant leave off drinkin echoed bob  pat shook his head  nocant  taint possible  why wot do you mean  well bob i mean that as ive never yet begun to drink it aint possible for me to leave it off dee see though i was to try ever so hard  howsever ill become an abstainer all the same just to keep company along wi you  bob lumsden gave a short laugh and then resuming his earnest air said  pat ive found out that dick martin the scounrel has bin to mrs mooneys hut again an now im sartin sure it was him as stole the oomans moneynot because i heerd him say so to mr binning but because eve told me she saw him flattenin his ugly nose against her windowpane last night an recognised him at once for the thief moreover he opened the door an looked into the room but seein that he had given eve a terrible fright he drew back smartly an went away  the willain exclaimed pat stiver snapping his teeth as if he wanted to bite and doubling up his little fists  it was evident that bobs news had taken away all his tendency to jest  now its plain to me continued bob that the willain means more mischief  praps he thinks the old oomans got more blunt hid away in her chest or in the cupboard  anyhow hes likely to frighten poor eve out of her wits so its my business to stop his little game  the question is how is it to be done  dee think it would be of any use to commoonicate wi the police  the shaking of pat stivers head was a most emphatic answer  no said he wotiver you do have nothin to do wi the pleece theyre a lowminded pigheaded set wi their move ons an their now then little uns an their grabbins of your collars without no regard to wether theyre clean or not an their  let alone the police pat interrupted his friend but lets have your adwice about what should be done  after a moments consideration the small boy advised that mrs mooneys hut should be watched  in course he said dick martin aint such a fool as to go an steal doorin the daytime so we dont need to begin till near dark  you are big an strong enough now bob to go at a man like dick an floor him wi a thumpin stick  scarcely returned bob with a gratified yet dubious shake of his head  im game to try but it wont do to risk gettin the worst of it in a thing o this sort  well but if im there with another thumpin stick to back you up said pat youll have no difficulty wotsumdever  an then if we should need help aint the blue boar handy an theres always a lot o hands there ready for a spree at short notice  now my adwice is that we go right off an buy two thumpin sticksyaller ones wi big heads like jack the giant killerget em for sixpence apiece  a heavy expense no doubt but worth goin in for for the sake of eve mooney and when in the words o the old song the shades of evenin is closin oer us well surround the house of eve and wait till the brute rolls by  youre far too poetical pat for a practical man said his friend howsomediver i think on the whole your adwice is not bad so well try it on  but wot are we to do till the shades of evenin comes on  amoose ourselves answered pat promptly  hm might do worse returned his friend  i spose you know ive got to be at widow martins to take tea wi fred an his bride on their return from their weddin trip  i wonder if i might take you with me pat  youre small an i suppose you dont eat much  oh dont i though exclaimed pat  well no matter  it would be very jolly  wed have a good blowout you know sit there comfortably together till it began to git dark and then start off toto  go in an win suggested the little one  having thus discussed their plans and finished their coffee the two chivalrous lads went off to yarmouth and purchased two of the most formidable cudgels they could find of the true jackthegiantkiller type with which they retired to the denes to amoose themselves  evening found them hungry and hearty at the teatable of mrs martin and really for the table of a fishermans widow it was spread with a very sumptuous repast for it was a great day in the history of the martin family  no fewer than three mrs martins were seated round it there was old granny martin who consented to quit her attic window on that occasion and take the head of the table though she did so with a little sigh and a soft remark that it would be sad if he were to come when she was not watching  then there was widow martin freds motherwhose bad leg by the way had been quite cured by her legacy  and lastly there was pretty mrs isa martin freds newlymarried wife  besides these there were skipper lockley of the lively poll and his wife marthafor it will be remembered martha was cousin to isa and stephens smack chanced to be in port at this time as well as the sunbeam and the fairy alias the ironclad which last circumstance accounts for dick martin being also on shore  but dick was not invited to this family gathering for the good reason that he had not shown face since landing and no one seemed to grieve over his absence with the exception of poor old granny whose love for her wandering boy was as strong and unwavering as was her love to the husband for whose coming she had watched so long  bob lumsden it may be remarked was one of the guests because lockley was fond of him and pat stiver was there because bob was fond of him both were heartily welcomed  besides the improvement in mrs martins health there was also vast improvement in the furniture and general appearance of the attic since the arrival of the legacy  it was quite a windfall remarked mrs lockley handing in her cup for more tea  true martha though i prefer to call it a godsend said mrs martin you see it was gettin so bad what wi standin so long at the tub an goin about wi the cloes that i felt as if i should break down altogether i really did but now ive been able to rest it i feel as if it was going to get quite strong again and that makes me fit to look after mother far better  have some more tea granny  a mumbled assent and a pleased look showed that the old woman was fully alive to what was going on  hand the butter to isa pat  thankee said the exwasherwoman  what a nice little boy your friend is bob lumpy  im so glad you thought of bringin him  he quite puts me in mind of what my boy fred was at his ageony a trifle broader an taller an stouter  a sort of lockstockanbarrel difference mother said fred laughing  i dun know what you mean by your blocks stocks an barrels returned mrs martin but pat is a sight milder in the face than you was an im sure hes a better boy  the subject of this remark cocked his ears and winked gently with one eye to his friend bob with such a sly look that the blooming bride who observed it went off into a shriek of laughter  an only to think continued mrs martin gazing in undisguised admiration at her daughterinlaw that my fredwho seems as if ony yesterday he was no bigger than pat should have got isa wentworththe best lass in all gorlestonfor a wife  youre a lucky boy  right you are responded fred with enthusiasm  i go wi you there mother but im more than a lucky boyim a highly favoured one and i thank god for the precious gift and also for that other gift which is second only to isa the command of a gospel ship on the north sea  a decided chuckle which sounded like a choke from granny fortunately called for attentions from the bride at this point  but do ee really think your mission smack will do much good asked martha lockley who was inclined to scepticism  i am sure of it replied fred emphatically  why weve done some good work already though we have bin but a short time wi the fleet  i wont speak of ourselves but just look at what has bin done in the way of saving drunkards and swearers by the cholmondeley in the shortblue fleet and by the old ensign in the fleet started by mr burdettcoutts the columbia fleet and in the other fleets that have got gospel ships  it is not too much to say that there are hundreds of men now prayin to god singin the praises o the lamb an servin their owners better than they ever did before who not long ago were godless drunkards and swearers  men are sometimes hypocrites objected martha how dee know that they are honest or that it will last  hypocrites exclaimed fred pulling a paper hastily from his pocket and unfolding it  i think youll admit that sharp men o bussiness are pretty good judges o hypocrites as well as of good men  listen to what one of the largest firms of smackowners says our men have been completely revolutionised and we gladly become subscribers of ten guineas to the funds of the mission  another firm says what we have stated does not convey anything like our sense of the importance of the work you have undertaken  ay theres something in that said martha who like all sceptics was slow to admit truth  we say not this to the discredit of sceptics  on the contrary we think that people who swallow what is called truth too easily are apt to imbibe a deal of error along with it  doubtless it was for the benefit of such that the word was givenprove all things  hold fast that which is good  fred then went to show the immense blessing that mission ships had already been to the north sea fishermenalike to their souls and bodies but we may not follow him further for bob lumsden and pat stiver claim individual attention just now  when these enterprising heroes observed that the shades of evening were beginning to fall they rose to take their leave  why so soon away lads asked fred  were goin to see eve mooney answered bob  whatever are the boys goin to do wi them thick sticks exclaimed martha lockley  fit main an fore masts into a manowar i suppose suggested her husband  the boys did not explain but went off laughing and lockley called after them  tell eve ive got a rare lot o queer things for her this trip  and give her my dear love cried mrs fred martin  ay ay replied the boys as they hurried away on their selfimposed mission    chapter twelve  the enterprise failsremarkably  the lads had to pass the blue boar on their way to widow mooneys hut and they went in just to see as bob said how the land lay and whether there was a prospect of help in that quarter if they should require it  besides a number of strangers they found in that den of iniquity joe stubley ned bryce and groggy foxwhich last had alas forgotten his late determination to leave the poor old stranded wreck and pull for the shore  he and his comrades were still out among the breakers clinging fondly to the old wreck  the boys saw at a glance that no assistance was to be expected from these men  stubley was violently argumentative fox was maudlinly sentimental and bryce was in an exalted state of heroic resolve  each sought to gain the attention and sympathy of the other and all completely failed but they succeeded in making a tremendous noise which seemed partially to satisfy them as they drank deeper  come nothin to be got here whispered bob lumsden in a tone of disgust as he caught hold of his friends arm  well trust to ourselves  an the thumpin sticks whispered pat as they reached the end of the road  alas for the success of their enterprise if it had depended on those formidable weapons of war  when the hut was reached the night had become so nearly dark that they ventured to approach it with the intention of peeping in at the front window but their steps were suddenly arrested by the sight of a mans figure approaching from the opposite direction  they drew back and being in the shadow of a wall escaped observation  the man advanced noiselessly and with evident caution until he reached the window and peeped in  its dick whispered bob  cant see his figurehead but i know the cut of his jib even in the dark  lets go at im slick whispered pat grasping his cudgel and looking fierce  not yet  we must make quite sure an nab him in the very act  as he spoke the man went with stealthy tread to the door of the hut which the drunken owner had left on the latch  opening it softly he went in shut it after him and to the dismay of the boys locked it on the inside  now pat said bob somewhat bitterly theres nothin for it but the police  pat expressed strong dissent  the pleece he said was useless for real work they was ony fit to badger boys an old women  but what can we do demanded bob anxiously for he felt that time was precious  you an i aint fit to bust in the door an if we was dick would be ready for us  if were to floor him he must be took by surprise  lets go an peep suggested the smaller warrior  come on then growled the big one  the sight that met their eyes when they peeped was indeed one fitted to expand these orbs of vision to the uttermost for they beheld the thief on his knees beside the invalids bed holding her thin hand in his while his head was bowed upon the ragged counterpane  bob lumsden was speechless  hold me im agoin to bust whispered pat by way of expressing the depth of his astonishment  presently eve spoke  they could hear her faintly yet distinctly through the cracked and patched windows and listened with all their ears  dont take on so poor man she said in her soft loving tones  oh i am so glad to hear what you say  dick martin looked up quickly  what he exclaimed glad to hear me say that i am the thief as stole your mothers money that im a low vile selfish blackguard who deserves to be kicked out o the north sea fleetoff the face o the arth altogether  yes returned eve smiling through her tearsfor she had been cryingglad to hear you say all that because jesus came to save people like you but he does not call them such bad names  he only calls them the lost  well i suppose youre right dear child said the man after a pause an i do think the blessed lord has saved me for i never before felt as i do nowhatred of my old bad ways and an awful desire to do right for his sake  if any o my mates had told me id feel an act like this a week ago id have called him a fool  i cant understand it  i suppose that god must have changed me altogether  my only fear is that ill fall back again into the old bad waysim so helpless for anything good dee see  you forget returned eve with another of her tearful smiles he says i will never leave thee nor forsake thee  no i dont forget that interrupted dick quickly that is what the young preacher in the mission smack said an it has stuck to me  its that as keeps me up  but i didnt come here to speak about my thoughts an feelins he continued rising and taking a chair close to the bed on which he placed a heavy bag  i come here eve to make restitootion  theres every farthin i stole from your poor mother  i kep it intendin to go to lunon and have a good long spreeso its all there  youll give it to her but dont tell her who stole it thats a matter tween you an me an the almighty  just you say that the miserable sinner who took it has bin saved by jesus christ an now returns it and axes her pardon  eve gladly promised but while she was yet speaking heavy footsteps were heard approaching the hut  the man started up as if to leave and the two boys suddenly awakening to the fact that they were eavesdropping fled silently round the corner of the hut and hid themselves  the passerby whoever he was seemed to change his mind for the steps ceased to sound for a few moments then they were heard again with diminishing force until they finally died away  a moment later and the key was heard to turn and the door of the hut to open and close after which the heavy tread of the repentant fisherman was heard as he walked quickly away  the boys listened in silence till all was perfectly still  well now said bob drawing a long breath whod have thought that things would have turned out like this  never heard of sich a case in my life before responded pat stiver with emphasis as if he were a venerable magistrate who had been trying cases for the greater part of a long life  why it leaves us nothin wotiver to do  even a pleeceman might manage it  the thief has gone an took up hisself tried an condemned hisself without a jury pronounced sentance on hisself without a judge an all but hanged hisself without jack ketch so theres nothin for you an me to do but go an bury our thumpin sticks as red injins bury the warhatchet retire to our wigwams an smoke the pipe of peace  wery good lets go an do it then returned bob curtly  as it is not a matter of particular interest how the boys reduced this figurative intention to practice we will leave them and follow dick martin for a few minutes  his way led him past the blue boar which at that moment however proved to be no temptation to him  he paused to listen  sounds of revelry issued from its door and the voice of joe stubley was heard singing with tremendous energybritons never never never shall be slaves although he and all his companions were at that very moment thoroughlyin one or two cases almost hopelesslyenslaved to the most terrible tyrant that has ever crushed the human race  dick went on and did not pause till he reached his sisters house  by that time the family party had broken up but a solitary candle in the attic window showed that old granny martin was still on her watchtower  is that you dick said his sister opening to his tap and letting him in but there was nothing of welcome or pleasure in the widows tone  the fisherman did not expect a warm welcome  he knew that he did not deserve it but he cared not for the visit was to his mother  gliding to her side he went down on his knees and laid his rugged head on her lap  granny did not seem taken by surprise  she laid her withered hand on the head and said bless you my boy  i knew you would come sooner or later praise be to his blessed name  we will not detail what passed between the mother and son on that occasion but the concluding sentence of the old woman was significant he cant be long of coming now dick for the promises are all fulfilled at last and im ready  she turned her head slowly again in the old direction where across the river and the sands she could watch the moonbeams glittering on the solemn sea  three days later and the skipper of the sunbeam received a telegram telling him to prepare for guests two of whom were to accompany him on his trip to the fleet  it was a bright warm day when the guests arriveda dozen or more ladies and gentlemen who sympathised with the mission accompanied by the director  all ready for sea martin i suppose said the latter as the party stepped on board from the wharf alongside of which the vessel lay  all ready sir responded fred  if the wind holds we may be with the fleet god willing some time tomorrow night  the sunbeam was indeed all ready for the duties on board of her had been performed by those who did their work as to the lord and not to men  every rope was in its place and properly coiled away every piece of brasswork about the vessel shone like burnished gold  the deck had been scrubbed to a state of perfect cleanliness so that as jim freeman said you might eat your victuals off it  in short everything was trim and taut and the great blue mdsf flag floated from the masthead intimating that the gospel ship was about to set forth on her mission of mercy to fish for men  among the party who were conducted by fred and the director over the vessel were two clergymen men of middle age who had been labouring among all classes on the land sympathising with the sad rejoicing with the glad praying working and energising for rich and poor until health had begun to give way and change of air and scene had become absolutely necessary  a week or so at the sea it was thought would revive them  and what change of air could be more thorough than that from the smoke of the city to the billows of the north sea  the director had suggested the change  men of god were sorely wanted out there he said and while they renewed their health among the fresh breezes of ocean they might do grand service for the master among the longneglected fishermen  the reasoning seemed just  the offer was kind  the opportunity was good as well as unique and interesting  the landworn clergymen accepted the invitation and were now on their way to the scene of their healthgiving work armed with waterproofs souwesters and seaboots  it will do you good sir both body and soul said skipper martin to the elder of the two when presented to him  youll find us a strange lot sir out there but glad to see you and game to listen to what youve got to say as long as ever you please  when the visitors had seen all that was to be seen enjoyed a cup of coffee prayed and sung with the crew and wished them godspeed they went on shore and the sunbeam hoisting her sails and shaking out the blue flag dropped quietly down the river  other smacks there were very much like herself coming and going or moored to the wharves but as the visitors stood on the river bank and waved their adieux the thought was forced upon them how inconceivably vast was the difference between those vessels which laboured for time and this one which toiled for eternity  soon the sunbeam swept out upon the sea bent over to the freshening breeze and steered on her beneficent course towards her double fishingground    chapter thirteen  the tide begins to turn and death steps in  let us now good reader outstrip the sunbeam and proceeding to the fleet in advance of her pay a night visit to one or two of the smacks we are imaginative creatures you see and the powers of imagination are as you know almost illimitable  even now in fact we have you hovering over the dark sea which however like the air above it is absolutely calm so that the numerous lanterns of the fishingvessels around are flickering far down into the deep like gleams of perpendicular lightning  it is saturday night and the particular vessel over which we hover is the lively poll  let us descend into her cabin  a wonderful change has come over the vessels crew since the advent of the mission smack  before that vessel joined the fleet the chief occupation of the men during the hours of leisure was gambling diversified now and then with stories and songs more or less profane  on the night of which we write almost universal silence pervaded the smack because the men were profoundly engaged with book and pamphlet they could all read more or less though the reading of one or two involved much spelling and knitting of the brows  but it was evident that they were deeply interested and utterly oblivious of all around them  like a schoolboy with a good story they could not bear to be interrupted and were prone to explosive commentary  david duffy who had fallen upon a volume of dickens was growing purple in the face because of his habit of restraining laughter until it forced its way in little squeaks through his nose  stephen lockley who had evidently got hold of something more serious sat on a locker his elbows resting on his knees the book in his hands and a solemn frown on his face  hawkson was making desperate efforts to commit to memory a hymn with the tune of which he had recently fallen in love and the meaning of which was unknown to himself slowly but surely entering deep into his awakening soul  bob lumsden who read his pamphlet by the binnacle light on deck had secured an american magazine the humorous style of which being quite new to him set him off ever and anon into hearty ripples of laughter  but they were not equally persevering for joe stubley to whom reading was more of a toil than a pleasure soon gave in and recurred to his favourite game of checkers  the mate peter jay was slowly pacing the deck in profound meditation  his soul had been deeply stirred by some of the words which had fallen from the lips of john binning and perplexities as well as anxieties were at that time struggling fiercely in his mind  well done little marchioness exclaimed david duffy with eyes riveted on his book and smiting his knee with his right palm youre a trump  shush exclaimed lockley with eyes also glued to his book holding up his hand as if to check interruption  theres somethin in this although i cant quite see it yet  a roar of laughter on deck announced that bob lumsden had found something quite to his taste  firstrateha ha  i wonder if its all true  hold your noise there cried hawkson who dee think can learn off a hymn wi you shoutin like a bosuns mate an duffy snortin like a grampus  ah just so chimed in stubley looking up from his board  why dont you let it out david  youll bust the biler if you dont open a bigger safetyvalve than your nose  smack on the weather beam that looks like the gospel ship sir said the mate looking down the hatchway  the skipper closed his book at once and went on deck but the night was so dark and the smack in question so far off that they were unable to make her out among the numerous lights of the fleet  in another part of that fleet not far distant floated the cormorant here too as in many other smacks the effects of the sunbeams beneficent influence had begun to tell  groggy foxs crew was noted as one of the most quarrelsome and dissipated in the fleet  on this particular saturday night however all was quiet for most of the men were busy with books pamphlets and tracts  one who had as his mate said come by a broken head was slumbering in his berth scientifically bandaged and convalescent and groggy himself with a pair of tortoiseshell glasses on his nose was deep in a book which he pronounced to be one o the wery best wollums he had ever come across in the whole course of his life leaving it to be inferred perhaps that he had come across a very large number of volumes in his day  while he was thus engaged one of the men whispered in his ear a coper alongside sir  the skipper shut the wery best wollum at once and ordered out the boat  put a cask o oysters in her he said  usually his men were eager to go with their skipper but on this night some of them were so interested in the books they were reading that they preferred to remain on board  others went and with their skipper got themselves fuddled on the proceeds of the owners oysters  if oysters had not been handy fish or something else would have been used instead for skipper fox was not particularhe was still clinging to the poor old stranded wreck  it was dawn when according to their appropriate phrase they tumbled over the side of the coper into their boat  as they bade the dutchman good night they observed that he was looking black as thunder at the horizon  wwats wrong ol bboy asked groggy  the dutchman pointed to the horizon  no use for me to shtop here mit dat alongside he replied  the fishermen turned their drunken eyes in the direction indicated and after blinking a few seconds clearly made out the large blue flag with its letters mdsf fluttering in the light breeze that had risen with the sun  with curses both loud and deep the dutchman trimmed his sails and slowly but decidedly vanished from the scene  thus the tide began to turn on the north sea  the light breeze went down as the day advanced and soon the mission vessel found herself surrounded by smacks with an everincreasing tail of boats at her stern and an evermultiplying congregation on her deck it was a busy and a lively scene for while they were assembling fred martin took advantage of the opportunity to distribute books and medicines and to bind up wounds etcetera  at the same time the pleasant meeting of friends who never met in such numbers anywhere elsenot even in the copersand the hearty good wishes and shaking of hands with now and then expressions of thankfulness from believers all tended to increase the bustle and excitement so that the two invalid clergymen began at once to experience the recuperative influence of glad enthusiasm  there is plenty to do here both for body and soul remarked one of these to fred during a moment of relaxation  yes sir thank god  we come out here to work and we find the work cut out for us  a good many surgical cases too you observe  but we expect that  in five of the fleets there were more than two thousand cases treated last year aboard of the mission smacks so we look for our share  in fact during our first eight weeks with this fleet we have already had two hundred men applying for medicine or dressing of wounds  quite an extensive practice dr martin said the clergyman with a laugh  ay sir but ours is the medicalmissionary line  the body may be first in time but the soul is first in importance with us  in proof of this as it were the skipper now stopped all that had been going on and announced that the real work of the day was going to begin whereupon the congregation crowded into the hold until it was full  those who could not find room clustered on deck round the open hatch and listenedsometimes craned their necks over and gazed  it was a new experience for the invalid clergymen who received another bath of recuperative influence  fervour interest intelligence seemed to gleam in the steady eyes of the men while they listened and thrilled in their resonant voices when they sang  one of the clergymen preached as he had seldom preached before and then prayed after which they all sang but the congregation did not move to go away  the brother clergyman therefore preached and modestly fearing that he was keeping them too long hinted as much  go on sir said the admiral who was there it aint every day we gets a chance like this  a murmur of assent followed and the preacher went on but we will not follow him  after closing with the hymn how sweet the name of jesus sounds in a believers ear they all went on deck where they found a glory of sunshine flooding the sunbeam and glittering on the still tranquil sea  the meeting now resolved itself into a number of groups among whom the peculiar work of the day was continued directly or indirectly  it was indeed a wonderful condition of things on board of the gospel ship that sundaywheels within wheels spiritual machinery at work from stem to stern  a few whose hearts had been lifted up got out an accordion and their books and went in for hymns  among these bob lumsden and his friend pat stiver took an active part  here and there couples of men leaned over the side and talked to each other in undertones of their saviour and the life to come  in the bow manx bradley got hold of joe stubley and pleaded hard with him to come to jesus and receive power from the holy spirit to enable him to give up all his evil ways  in the stern fred martin sought to clear away the doubts and difficulties of ned bryce  elsewhere the two clergymen were answering questions and guiding several earnest souls to a knowledge of the truth while down in the cabin jim freeman prevailed on several men and boys to sign the temperance pledge  among these last was groggy fox who irresolute of purpose was still holding back  cause why said he ill be sure to break it again  i cant keep it  i know that skipper said fred coming down at the moment  in your own strength youll never keep it but in gods strength you shall conquer all your enemies  lets pray lads that we may all be enabled to keep to our good resolutions  then and there they all knelt down and skipper fox arose with the determination once again to leave the poor old stranded wreck and pull for the shore  but that was a memorable sunday in other respects for towards the afternoon a stiff breeze sprang up and an unusually low fall in the barometer turned the fishermens thoughts back again to wordly cares the various boats left the sunbeam hurriedly  as the lively poll had kept close alongside all the time stephen lockley was last to think of leaving  he had been engaged in a deeply interesting conversation with one of the clergymen about his soul but at last ordered his boat to be hauled alongside  while this was being done he observed that another smackone of the socalled ironcladswas sailing so as to cross the bows of his vessel  the breeze had by that time increased considerably and both smacks lying well over were rushing swiftly through the water suddenly some part of the ironclads tackling about the mainsail gave way the head of the vessel fell to leeward next moment she went crashing into the lively poll and cut her down to the waters edge the ironclad seemed to rebound and tremble for a moment and then passed on  the steersman at once threw her up into the wind with the intention of rendering assistance but in another minute the lively poll had sunk and disappeared for ever carrying peter jay and hawkson along with her  of course several boats pushed off at once to the rescue and hovered about the spot for some time but neither the men nor the vessel were ever seen again  there was a smack at some distance which was about to quit the fleet next morning and return to port  the skipper of it knew well which vessel had been run down but not being near enough to see all that passed imagined that the whole crew had perished along with her during the night the breeze freshened to a gale which rendered fishing impossible  this vessel therefore left the fleet before dawn and carried the news to gorleston that the lively poll had been run down and sunk with all her crew  it was fred martins wife who undertook to break this dreadful news to poor mrs lockley  only those who have had such duty to perform can understand the struggle it cost the gentlespirited isa  the first sight of her friends face suggested to mrs lockley the truth and when words confirmed it she stood for a moment with a countenance pale as death  then clasping her hands tightly together the poor woman with a cry of despair sank insensible upon the floor    chapter fourteen  the last  but the supposed death of stephen lockley did not soften the heart of his wife  it only opened her eyes a little  after the first stunning effect had passed a hard rebellious state of mind set in which induced her to dry her tears and with stern countenance reject the consolation of sympathisers  the poor womans heart was breaking and she refused to be comforted  it was while she was in this condition that mrs mooney of all people took it into her head to visit and condole with her neighbour  that poor woman although a sot was warmhearted and the memory of what she had suffered when her own husband perished seemed to arouse her sympathies in an unusual degree  she was as her male friends would have said screwed when she knocked at mrs lockleys door  the poor creature was recovering from a burst of passionate grief and turned her large dark eyes fiercely on the wouldbe comforter as she entered  my dear mrs lockley began mrs mooney with sympathy beaming on her red countenance it do grieve me to see you like thisamost as much as wen my  youre drunk interrupted mrs lockley with a look of mingled sternness and indignation  well my dear replied mrs mooney with a deprecatory smile that aint an uncommon state o things an youve no call to be ard on a poor widdy like yourself takin a little consolation now an then when she can get it  i just thought id like to comfort  i dont want no comfort cried mrs lockley in a sharp tone  leave me  go away  there was something so terrible in the mingled look of grief and anger which disturbed the handsome features of the young wife that mrs mooney partly awed and partly alarmed turned at once and left the house  she did not feel aggrieved only astonished and somewhat dismayed  after a few moments of meditation she set off intending to relieve her feelings in the blue boar  on her way she chanced to meet no less a personage than pat stiver who with his hands in his pockets and his big boots clattering over the stones was rolling along in the opposite direction  pat my boy exclaimed the woman in surprise wherever did you come from  from the north sea said pat looking up at his questioner with an inquiring expression  i say old woman drunk again  well boy who denyses of it  aint you ashamed of yourself  no i aint  why should i  who cares whether im drunk or sober  who cares you unnatral old bundle o dirty cloes  dont eve care an dont fred martin an bob lumpy care  an dont i care worse than all of em put together except eve  you boy exclaimed the woman  yes me  but look here old gal where are you goin  to have a drink i suppose  jus so  thats xactly where im asteerin to  well now cried pat seizing the womans hand come along an ill give you somethin to drink  moreover ill treat you to some noos asll cause your blood to curdle an your flesh to creep an your eyes to glare an your hair to stand on end  thus adjured and with curiosity somewhat excited mrs mooney suffered herself to be led to that temperance coffeetavern in gorleston to which we have already referred  aint it comfrable asked the boy as his companion gazed around her  now then missis he said to the attendant with the air of an old frequenter of the place coffee and wittles for twohot  here sit down in this corner old lady where you can take in the beauties o the place all at one squint  almost before he had done speaking two large cups of hot coffee and two thick slices of buttered bread lay before them  there you areall shipshape  now drink an no heeltaps  mrs mooney drank in dumb surprise partly at the energy and cool impudence of the boy and partly at the discovery that there was more comfort in hot coffee than she had expected  youve heard in course that the lively poll is at the bottom of the north sea said pat  mrs mooney set down her cup with a sigh and a sudden expression of woe mingled with reproof while she remarked that there was no occasion to be lighthearted on such a subject  thats all you know retorted pat  of course we was told the moment we came alongside the wharf this mornin that somebody had bin blowin half a gale o lies about it but stephen lockley aint drownded not he an dont mean to be for some time  he was aboard of the sunbeam at the time his wessel went down an all the rest of em except poor jay an hawkson an weve brought em all ashore  you see we got so damaged in a gale that came on to blow the wery next day that weve bin forced to run here for repairs  skipper lockleys away up at this here minit to see his wifeleastwise hes waitin outside till one o the parsons goes and breaks the noos to her  the skipper didnt see no occasion for that an said he could break the noos to her hisself but the parson said he didnt know what the consikences might be so stephen he gave in an  now old girl if you keep openin of your mouth an eyes at that rate youll git lockjaw an never be able to go to sleep no more  there was indeed some ground for the boys remark for his noos had evidently overwhelmed mrs mooneychiefly with joy on account of her friend mrs lockley to whom even when in liquor she was tenderly attached  she continued to gaze speechless at pat who took advantage of the opportunity to do a little private business on his own account  taking a little bit of blue ribbon with a pin attached to it from his pocket he coolly fixed it on mrs mooneys breast  there said he gravely i promised bob that id make as many conwerts as i could so ive conwerted you  utterly regardless of her conversion mrs mooney suddenly sprang from her seat and made for the door  hallo old gal where away now cried the boy seizing her skirt and following her out being unable to stop her  im agoin to tell eve an wont she be glad for she was awful fond o lockley  all right im with ee  cut along  mother exclaimed eve when the poor woman stood before her with eager excitement flushing her face to a ruddy purple  have you really put on the blue ribbon  the poor childs thin pretty little race flushed with hope for a moment  oh it aint that dear said mrs mooney but lockley aint drownded arter all  heshes  here pat stiver broke in and began to explain to the bewildered girl he was yet in the midst of his noos when the door was flung open and mrs lockley hurried in  forgive me mrs mooney she cried grasping her friends hand i shouldnt have spoke to you as i did but my heart was very sore  oh it is breakin  she sat down covered her face with both hands and sobbed violently her friends stood speechless and helpless  it was obvious that she must have left her house to make this apology before the clergyman who was to break the news had reached it  before any one could summon courage to speak a quick step was heard outside and lockley himself entered  he had been waiting near at hand for the clergyman to summon him when he caught sight of his wife entering the hut  mrs lockley sprang upone glance a wild shriek but not of despair and she would have fallen to the ground had not her husbands strong arms been around her  it is believed that joy seldom or never kills  at all events it did not kill on this occasion for mrs lockley and her husband were seen that same evening enjoying the hospitality of mrs martin while their little one was being fondled on the knees of the old granny who pointed through the attic window and tried to arouse the childs interest in the great sea  when mrs mooney succeeded in turning her attention to the blue ribbon on her breast she laughed heartily at the idea of such a decoration much to the sorrow of eve who had prayed for many a day not that her mother might put on that honourable badge but that she might be brought to the saviour in whom are included all things good and true and strong  nevertheless it is to be noted that mrs mooney did not put the blue ribbon off  she went next day to have a laugh over it with mrs lockley  but the fishermans wife would not laugh  she had found that while sorrow and suffering may drive one to despair in regard to god and self and all terrestrial things joy frequently softens  surely it is the goodness of god that leadeth to repentance  this life as it were from the dead proved to be life from death to herself and she talked and prayed with her drunken friend until that friend gave her soul to jesus and received the spirit of power by which she was enabled to hold the fortto adopt and keep the pledge of which her ribbon was but the emblem  although we have now described the end of the lively poll it must not be supposed that the crew of that illfated smack was dispersed and swallowed up among the fishing fleets of the north sea  on the contrary though separated for the time they came together againay and held together for many a long day thereafter  and this is how it came about  one morning a considerable time after the events we have just narrated stephen lockley invited his old comrades to meet him in the gorleston coffeetavern and over a rousing cup of hot with delivered to them the following oration  friends and former messmates  i aint much of a speaker so youll excuse my goin to the pint direct  a noble lady with lots o tin an a warm heart has presented a smack all complete to our deepsea fishermen institootion  it cost im told about 2000 pounds and will be ready to start as a gospel ship next week  for no reason that i knows on xcept that its the lords will theyve appointed me skipper with directions to choose my own crew  so lads ive got you here to ask if youre willin to ship with me  im willin of course cried pat stiver eagerly an sos bob lumpy  ill answer for him  there was a general laugh at this but bob lumsden who was present chose to answer for himself and said he was heartily willing  so said david duffy and so also said joe stubley  i ony wish added the latter that jim freeman was free to jine but fred martins not likely to let him go for hes uncommon fond of him  hes doin good work for the master where he is returned lockley and well manage to catch as true and able a man among the north sea fleets afore long  theres as good fish in the sea you know as ever came out of it  our mission smack is to be called the welcome  at this rate observed dick martin who was one of the party well soon have a mission ship to every fleet in the north sea thatll please our director wont it  ay it will said lockley  all the same i heard the director say only the other day he wished people would remember that the mission needed funds to keep the smacks agoin as well as to build an launch em  howsever weve no need to fear for when the master sends the men and the work hes sure to find the means  two weeks after the date on which this harmonious meeting was held a new vessel laden with spiritual treasure unfurled her sails shook out her mdsf ensign and amid the good wishes silent prayers and ringing cheers of sympathetic friends on shore went forth as a beacon of love and light and hope to irradiate the toilers on the dark north sea  among those cheering and praying ones were mrs mooneya brand plucked from the burningand fragile eve with her weak thin helpless body and her robust heart chosen to do herculean and gladiator service of sympathy and rescue in the masters cause  and you may be sure that blooming isa martin was there and her friend martha lockley manx bradley the admiral who with other fishermen chanced to be having their spell on shore at that time was also there  even old granny martin was there in a sense for she could see from her attic the great blue flag as it fluttered in the breeze and she called her unfailing and no longer ailing daughter to come to the window and look at it and wish it godspeed after which she turned her old eyes again to their wonted restingplace where the great sea rolled its crested breakers beyond the sands  it remains but to add that the welcome was received by the fleet to which she was sent with an enthusiasm which fully justified her name and that her crew found her thenceforth both as to her seagoing qualities and the nature of her blessed work a marvellous improvement on their former home the lively poll    note  the office of the mission to deepsea fishermen is 181 queen victoria street london ec at the date of publication of this book  the end
